500|$|The {{localization}} {{team had}} to translate 1500 pages of text {{to make sure}} it made sense in a [...] "native check", because of lack of plurals in the Japanese language and the large number of characters and conditional conversations that the player could interact with.

Only one puzzle in the game had to be changed as it required knowledge of the steps in drawing a kanji character which would be readily known for Japanese audiences; for the Western release, these steps were demonstrated in the game. The team noted that personalities of characters could be easily conveyed in Japanese text simply by the way sentences were constructed or slurred, a feature that could not directly be applied to localization. Instead, working with Kamiya, the team scripted the localization to either recreate the personality to match the Japanese version, or to create a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>set</b> of mannerisms for the characters as appropriate.|$|E

As part of writing for the game, he needed to create new tracks for game updates, which put added pressure on him to create music that would appeal to players. A concept present from an early stage was changing the battle music depending on what job was equipped by the player: Suzuki created an initial battle theme that acted {{as a base for}} other themes, then added elements like electronic elements and vocal work to give derivative tracks variety. The majority of the game's choral work, such as with the game's main theme, was done using synthesizers. Suzuki also needed to do remixes of earlier Final Fantasy music, such as the [...] "Chocobo" [...] theme, and pieces from other Final Fantasy games that would appear in special in-game events. Suzuki estimated that he created between 40-50 songs for the game. The music was recorded at the Red Bull Studios in Tokyo.|$|R

However, it is simultaneously also a methodological experiment on the way anthropological approach can be used to study state law. Thus, despite the importance of answers to the question posed here, at least equal significance is placed on all the ancillary information acquired on the way to answers: what kind of difficulties such an approach entails, and what kind of methodological choices can be used to overcome them. In other words the attempt is to take rather orthodox, although modified, anthropological methods to a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>setting,</b> and to study both what kind of new insights could be gained from such an approach, and to examine what kind of contributions the method could offer to this new field. Further questions are also created on the relationship of state law to other modes of social control; should all of them be the subject of study, or should clear division be maintained between formal and casual modes dispute resolution? What should then be identified as social control, and who should be identified as its author? Overall the study derives from a variety of sources, including newspaper articles, communications from the attorneys of the parties involved and other online documents. Endast sammandrag.

It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship.

Post-apocalyptic games are most notable for their realistic depictions of these spaces, but Irrational Games (now 2 K Boston) 2007 release Bioshock takes dystopian architecture in games to a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> level. <b>Set</b> up as an antithesis to Ayn Rand s theory of objectivism (as presented in her 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged and her 1943 novel The Fountainhead), Bioshock {{calls into question the}} existence of free will and honesty of a free market. And Rapture, as the setting upon which the game is set, echoes those sentiments completely. Littered with accoutrement of 1950 s nostalgia, Rapture is the quintessential underwater, secluded utopia Rand envisioned at the time; however, where readers do not see Rand s utopia in action, Rapture, as a well-designed game environment, shows how such a place, meant to represent freedom and paradise, crumbles at the hands of its own inhabitants. As the game progresses and the narrative becomes increasingly savage and dystopian, so, too, does Rapture. It is both parallel and prison to the player, and only through overcoming these dangers will the player ever return to life on the surface...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} an e-mail {{classification}} problem known as e-mail foldering, which consists on the classification of incoming mail into the different folders previously cre-ated by the user. This task has re-ceived less attention in the literature than spam filtering and is quite com-plex due to the (usually large) car-dinality (number of folders) and lack of balance (documents per class) of the class variable. On the other hand, proximity based algorithms {{have been used in}} a wide range of fields since decades ago. One of the main drawbacks of these classifiers, known as lazy classifiers, is their computational load due to their need to compute the distance of a new sample to each point in the vectorial space to decide which class it belongs to. This is why most of the devel-oped techniques for these classifiers consist on edition and condensation of the training set. In this work we make an approach to the problem of e-mail classification into folders. It is suggested a new algorithm based on neighbourgood called Gaussian Bal-anced K-NN, which does not edit nor condense the database but sam-ples a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> training <b>set</b> from the marginal gaussian distributions of the initial set. This algorithm lets choose the computational load of the classifier and also balances the train-ing set, alleviating the same prob-lems that edition and condensation techniques try to solve.

It was challenging - often I would just jam to the recorded tracks for a long time trying to find a different vibe then that already recorded... this is best apparent on To the Bitter End or Tunnel Effect.
