25|$|In a twist, Gene Hunt in 1973 {{turns out}} to be {{astronaut}} 'Major Tom' Tyler — Sam's father — in the conclusion. Just as Maria was estranged from Gene in 1973, Sam was estranged from his father until {{the very end of the}} series, when he reconciles <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad</b> before they step out onto the bare ground of the Red Planet. However the final shot shows, not an astronaut boot, but Gene Hunt's signature white loafer taking the first step onto the martian surface, casting doubt once again onto the ending.|$|E

His first race car was a 1979 Monte Carlo that he co-owned with his older half-brother, Kerry Earnhardt. By age 19 after two seasons of driving Street Stock Division, Earnhardt had honed his driving abilities {{to the point of}} joining the Late Model Stock Car Division. He competed on the North and South Carolina short tracks driving a No. 3 Chevrolet. While he did run various tracks during this time, Earnhardt primarily focused his efforts at the Myrtle Beach Speedway in South Carolina and the East Carolina Motor Speedway in Robersonville, North Carolina, where he captured the pole for the Greenville Merchants 300 on October 28, 1994. There he developed an in-depth knowledge of chassis setup and car preparation, while racing against his older brother Kerry and his sister Kelley. He worked at his father's dealership as a mechanic while he went to Mitchell Community College to earn an associate degree in automotive technology.|$|E

500|$|There {{were similar}} {{reactions}} to Kurt's scene with Burt, though reviewers agreed that Burt was being reasonable and Kurt was not. Gonzalez characterized Kurt as [...] "more flawed in this episode {{than he has}} been, especially in that scene <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad</b> when he kept taking offense to his dad's miscommunicated guidelines for sleepovers", and Semigran described [...] "Kurt's overreaction" [...] as [...] "even more unsettling" [...] than his argument with Blaine. Corliss wrote that Kurt's [...] "smackdown of his father has the odor of propaganda from the gayest show in TV history". Canning said he was [...] "moved by Kurt asking his father {{to step out of}} his comfort zone and educate himself about what is gay men do when [...] together", and Gonzalez enjoyed [...] "the very realistic tension that exists between them as father and gay son".|$|E
500|$|Streets {{moved in}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad</b> and {{transferred}} to Thornton Township High School. At {{the time of his}} 1994 senior year transfer to Harvey, Illinois's Thornton, Streets was described by a Chicago Sun-Times journalist as [...] "the best high school athlete in Illinois". [...] The Sun-Times chose him as one of the six best football prospects in the area and as an All-Area Offensive selection before his senior season. He was a preseason All-American in football. [...] Lemming named him {{as one of the top}} 100 senior prospects in the nation. By this time, Lemming considered him to be the best high school wide receiver in Illinois. [...] According to Sporting News, Streets and Randy Moss were among the four best wide receivers in the nation. [...] National Recruiting Advisor listed him fifth behind Peter Warrick, Moss, Mondriel Fulcher, and Corey Jones.|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said it was [...] "an amazing episode, in which Homer {{actually}} has an argument with someone, rather than backing down. As he and his father drift further apart, so the family are at a loss at what to do. You can't help but feel sorry for Grampa as a piece of Simpson family history goes up in flames". Nate Meyers for Digitally Obsessed praised Dan Castellaneta's role in the episode and said: [...] "Dan Castellaneta's work as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in [...] is full of emotion and brilliant comic timing. Watch the closing scene carefully as Homer returns to his childhood home, because Castellaneta gracefully dances between a tender father-son relationship and flat-out comedy". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said he [...] "didn’t remember this as a very good episode, but it actually turns out to be quite strong. The initial plot in which Homer and Marge can’t get it together offers plenty of funny moments, and the scenes in which Homer battles <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad</b> offer depth and much humor. It’s also hard to beat the children's fears of the reverse vampires".|$|E

500|$|It is then {{revealed}} that Kylie has a son, Max (Harry McDermott), {{who is in}} foster care. Lane said that this happened because Kylie [...] "was drinking <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad</b> and not looking after him". Kylie loves Max but is too [...] "young and naive" [...] too cope with motherhood. Kylie snatches Max while on a visit; Lane opined it was a {{spur of the moment}} decision, but [...] "she couldn't bear to lose him". Becky helps Kylie regain custody of him. The [...] "turning point" [...] in the storyline was attributed to scenes in which Kylie stands up in court and vows to change. Lane said that they were [...] "touching" [...] scenes, which included a rare moment in which Kylie applauds Becky for being [...] "a great sister". Lane stated that when she gets Max back, Kylie takes advantage of Becky. In another storyline Kylie makes a pass at Steve. Gregson who plays him opined that in Kylie's mind she thought [...] "that fat bald guy wants a bit". He also said that Steve was [...] "extremely shocked" [...] but was not interested. Steve decides not to say anything to Becky because he doesn't trust Kylie and knows that she will take Max away from Becky. Gregson said that in Steve's opinion [...] "she's been trouble from the start and he's sure that's not going to change." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Lex's key {{characteristics}} is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his [...] "shady" [...] actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning {{from the moment}} he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: [...] "For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad,</b> or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent." [...] Another characteristic of Smallville 's Lex Luthor—one that is being developed {{over the course of the}} series—is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of. In the season two premiere [...] "Vortex", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to open a window into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, [...] "...either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and it felt good to him". According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and [...] "really flips out", that is the point where the [...] "world needs to hide". Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make Smallvilles Lex Luthor a [...] "tragic figure [...] almost Shakespearean grandeur".|$|E

2500|$|Frames {{was made}} {{over the course of}} a year and a half. Unlike on his {{previous}} album, Live It Up, DeWyze served as a producer on Frames. Toby Gad was the only producer and co-writer to collaborate with DeWyze on both albums. DeWyze described the co-writing process on Live It Up as having been like speed-dating, but said that on Frames it felt like [...] "a full on collaboration." [...] He said that the recording process felt organic and that there was no [...] "pressure [...] to make a 'certain' type of record." [...] Free of this obligation, he chose not to confine himself to only writing folk rock songs and also included the pop songs [...] "You Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "The Ride," [...] which have been compared to the music of the Beatles, [...] "Fire Away," [...] which has been described as a combination of roots music and rockabilly, and [...] "Who Would've Known," [...] which has been described as a combination of pop and bluegrass. DeWyze specifically set out to write Frames so that it would [...] "flow as one," [...] harkening back to the kind of albums that he had listened to as a kid <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad.</b> He said, [...] "I wanted the vibe of the album as a whole to be cohesive. I wanted you to be able to sit down and listen to the whole thing and have a musical experience with it." ...|$|E
