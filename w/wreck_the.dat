5|$|Another noted shipwreck, {{that of the}} Surat, {{occurred}} on New Year's Day in 1874.

5|$|At 4:00 am on 25 August, {{the newly}} erected French gun battery {{opened fire on}} Sirius and Iphigenia, which {{returned}} fire as best they could.

French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the <b>wreck.</b> <b>The</b> frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide, who wet the decks to prevent any risk of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would <b>wreck</b> <b>the</b> country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic <b>wreck.</b> <b>The</b> modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E

The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them.

5|$|The Institute mascots are Buzz and the Ramblin' <b>Wreck.</b> <b>The</b> Institute's {{traditional}} football rival is the University of Georgia; {{the rivalry}} {{is considered one}} of the fiercest in college football. The rivalry is commonly referred to as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate, which is also the title of a book about the subject.

Four Georgia Tech football teams were selected as national champions in news polls: 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990.

5|$|A {{support wall}} was built at Sørlia, {{just south of}} Steinkjer, after there was a clay landslide. Construction of the bridge over Figgja, just south of Steinkjer, was {{performed}} in 1904. The superstructure was built by Kværner of Oslo and installed between 11 November and 21 December 1904. The bridge over Steinkjerelva took up {{a significant portion of}} the old river port in Steinkjer, resulting in a spur being built to a new port location. The railway ran right through the town center, forcing 20 houses to be demolished and splitting the town in two. The arrival and route of the railway was described by some locals as vandalism. A counter-proposal which saw the line run further up and cross through Steinkjersannan and Furuskogen—and thus avoid the town itself—was discarded because it would <b>wreck</b> <b>the</b> military camp at Steinkjersannan and would be located too far from the port. There was also a major debate as to whether the station should be on the south side or north side of the river. The municipal council voted for the south side with the mayor's double vote being decisive. Construction of the bridge over Steinkjerelva started in August 1902 and was completed on 7 May 1904. A proposal to build the bridge as a swing bridge was dropped, forcing the railways to pay NOK45,402 in compensation to companies with facilities upstream.|$|E

5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career.

The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a belaying pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|The fourth caution {{was issued}} on lap 54 when Ambrose {{made contact with}} Logano, causing a multiple-car {{collision}} involving Earnhardt, Kenseth, and Truex.

Biffle led at the lap 61 restart before Gordon reclaimed the lead, with Johnson moving into second place. Ten laps later, Kyle Busch took the lead until Stewart passed him two laps later. On lap 74, Kyle Busch lost control of his car which caused Gordon to hit the wall; his car rolled over, prompting the fifth and final caution. Kurt Busch, Johnson and McMurray were {{caught up in the}} <b>wreck.</b> <b>The</b> race restarted on lap 81, for a green–white–checker finish (extending the race to 82 laps) with Stewart leading Ambrose, Bowyer and Keselowski until Ambrose (with assistance from Keselowski) passed him. On the final lap, Stewart reclaimed the lead (with help from Kyle Busch) before Busch passed him to win the race. The margin of victory was 0.013 seconds, the closest {{in the history of the}} event. Ambrose finished third, Keselowski fourth and Hamlin fifth. Biffle, Newman, Bowyer, Edwards and Montoya rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Avenger torpedo bomber shot down in the {{operation}} was located off Fagervika {{with the help of}} local Norwegians in 1987, and partially salvaged by the Royal Norwegian Navy. The remains of two of the airmen killed in the operation were recovered from the sea. A memorial in the honour of the airmen killed in the operation was erected at the former site of a German coastal artillery position at Fagervika. The memorial was dedicated on 4 October 1987 in the presence of American diplomat Richard Norland, naval attaché Lieutenant Commander Robert B. Murrett, and relatives of one of the airmen killed in Operation Leader. Included in the memorial is one of the three propeller blades recovered from the Avenger <b>wreck,</b> <b>the</b> other two blades being displayed at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida and at the Norwegian Home Guard base in Søvik, near Sandnessjøen, respectively.
