5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body {{with representatives of the}} District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because the least expensive <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|Over {{much of her}} childhood, Michelena’s parents toured {{with the}} Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company a {{traveling}} theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences. Beatriz's father in later life taught music {{and worked as a}} vocal coach and, {{at the time of his}} death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco. Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in The Man from China (1904). Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco, California to teach voice. There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques. He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the way to move as another person, the way to make simple but authoritative gestures, and the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> intensity over the span of a performance. Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena.|$|E

A peculiar feature is the quilt-like ornament on the columns. Fomin knew very well that a 25-meter bare column will look unnatural; the quilt warms up an otherwise dull shape.

25|$|Eagle {{along with}} British United Airways (BUA) — its {{principal}} contemporary independent competitor — had successfully lobbied the Government {{to bring about}} a change in legislation that had given their state-owned counterparts a virtual monopoly on scheduled services. This resulted in the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act of 1960, which abolished BEA's and BOAC's statutory monopoly on principal domestic and international scheduled routes and — theoretically — gave the independents equal opportunities to develop such routes in their own right. Eagle concurred with BUA and Caledonian Airways — an independent upstart that would subsequently compete with it head-to-head for a licence to operate transatlantic scheduled services — that running a fully fledged scheduled operation was the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an airline with a long-term, stable future. It argued that the non-scheduled nature of its business — mainly trooping, ad hoc charters and IT flying — made planning ahead difficult because of extreme seasonality and generally low margins. Therefore, Eagle saw its future primarily as an international scheduled passenger and freight carrier with transatlantic ambitions.|$|E

500|$|In January 1951, Ulam {{had another}} idea: to channel the {{mechanical}} shock {{of a nuclear}} explosion so as to compress the fusion fuel. [...] On the recommendation of his wife, Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it. Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit, but noted that soft X-rays from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than mechanical shock and suggested ways to enhance this effect. [...] On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations. [...] A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a fissile rod or cylinder {{at the center of}} the fusion fuel. [...] The detonation of this [...] "spark plug" [...] would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction.

500|$|The Utah {{portion of}} I-70 was not {{completed}} to Interstate Highway standards until 1990, {{when the second}} Eagle Canyon bridge was dedicated. A second dedication ceremony {{was held at the}} bridge declaring the Utah portion of I-70 complete. Archie Hamilton, one of three engineers who worked for Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) long enough to see I-70 progress from conception to completion, said the most memorable moment was seeing the excavation at Spotted Wolf Canyon. He said before construction began, he could stand in one spot and touch both sides of the canyon. To carve the first [...] through the canyon required excavating [...] of rock. It was estimated construction cost for the San Rafael Swell portion was $183.5million, $105.5million (1970, $595million in 2008) to build the first two lanes, and $78million (1990, $130million in 2008) to construct the rest.
