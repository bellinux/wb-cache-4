50|$|Sometimes, {{there is}} a <b>weak</b> <b>market</b> for assets which trade {{relatively}} infrequently - often during an economic crisis. During these periods, there are few, if any buyers for such products. This complicates the marking process. In the absence of market information, an entity is allowed to use its own assumptions, but the objective is still the same: {{what would be the}} current value of a sale to a willing buyer. In developing its own assumptions, the entity can not ignore any available market data, such as interest rates, default rates, prepayment speeds, etc.|$|E
50|$|When {{the entity}} (in the US, {{typically}} a county sheriff or designee) auctions a foreclosed property the noteholder may set the starting price as the remaining {{balance on the}} mortgage loan.

In a <b>weak</b> <b>market</b> the foreclosing party may set the starting price at a lower amount if it believes the real estate securing the loan is worth less than the remaining principal of the loan. Time from notice of foreclosures to actual property sales is dependent on many factors, such as the method of foreclosure (judicial or non-judicial).|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Fruitopia was relaunched in Australia as a juice brand but {{was unable}} to gain major success. Four years later, it held only 4% of the Australian juice market, {{prompting}} Coca-Cola Australia’s then general manager for Non Carbs, John McLoughlin, to invest several million dollars into revitalizing the brand in what was seen as a challenge to the reigning Berri brand. This was based on research suggesting that while consumers did not hold the product experience in high esteem, they chose Fruitopia as their favorite brand name. The plan involved the launch Fruitopia J, an ambient juice, and as Fruitopia Classic, a chilled juice as well as $100 million in dedicated Fruitopia coolers. Critics did not agree with the strategy, and within two years, Fruitopia maintained only a <b>weak</b> <b>market</b> share.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a unique}} sample of new Ph. D. economists in 1987 and 1997, we examine how job seekers and their {{employers}} alter their search strategies in strong versus <b>weak</b> <b>markets.</b> The 1987 academic market was strong while the 1997 <b>market</b> was much <b>weaker.</b> A multimarket theory of optimal search suggests that job seekers {{will respond to}} a weakening market by lowering their reservation utility. This in turn affects their search strategies at the extensive margin (which markets to enter) and the intensive margin (how many applications to submit per market). Meanwhile, employers respond to the weakening market by raising their hiring standards. The combination of strategies on the supply and demand sides suggest that high quality applicants will obtain an increased share of academic interviews in <b>weak</b> <b>markets</b> while applicants from weaker schools will increasingly secure interviews outside of the academic market. Empirical results show that in the bust market, graduates of elite schools shifted their search strategies to include weaker academic institutions, while graduates of lower ranked schools shifted their applications away from academia and toward the business sector. In bust conditions, academic institutions increasingly concentrate their interviews on elite school graduates, women and U. S. residents...|$|R

5000|$|The Kölner Kunstmarkt {{was founded}} by galerists Hein Stünke and Rudolph Zwirner in 1967 {{in an attempt to}} reinvigorate the <b>weak</b> <b>market</b> for {{contemporary}} art. With Bonn as the new capital city of Germany, the Rhineland - an industrial powerhouse at the centre of Europe driving the West German economy and acting as a hub for the entire western European economy - took over as the centre of the West German art world. The first Kölner Kunstmarkt took place in the Gürzenich festival hall in the medieval part of the city; the following year Kunsthalle Köln was added as an additional location. The fair helped to establish Cologne as a new center of contemporary art. A West German dealer and a West German artist set new records at the 1969 edition of Kölner Kunstmarkt: René Block sold a work by Joseph Beuys - known later as Das Rudel - at DM 110,000, making Beuys the first West German artist to beat the one-hundred-thousand-mark mark.|$|E

5000|$|On 1 April 2011, GDF {{surrendered}} 1,830 MW {{of transmission}} entry capacity (TEC) {{of the station}} and ceased operations of the CCGT element of the plant leaving the Open Cycle gas turbine as the only available machine, leaving the station with an operating capacity of 45 MW. This {{was due to the}} low cost of energy imports and a <b>weak</b> <b>market</b> in the UK, resulting in a need to save on operating costs. It is unknown how long the power station will be out of operation for and around 100 workers may lose their jobs due to the mothballing. International Power's lack of clarity over the workers' jobs has been condemned by unions, with Unite the Union North East regional officer Bob Bolam stating [...] "The company might say they will keep the plant on standby but workers can’t hang around waiting for an upturn". It is yet to be decided whether the mothballing will effectively shelve the planned upgrade of the power station. MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland Tom Blenkinsop also criticised the move, calling on Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne to [...] "see to it that the owners ... are not allowed to pull the plug on this plant at this time."

40|$|Open Access articleCorporate {{governance}} {{is often}} split between rulebased and principle-based approaches to regulation in different institutional contexts. This split is often {{informed by the}} types of institutional configurations, their strengths, and the complementarities within them. This approach to corporate governance regulation is mostly discussed {{in the context of}} developed economies and their regulatory demands. However, in developing and <b>weak</b> <b>market</b> economies, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is no such explicit split and the debates on such contexts in the comparative corporate governance literature have been meagre. Nonetheless, there are sparks of good corporate governance practices in the region. Drawing from institutional theory and a case study of a largest economy, we explore the appropriateness or suitability of corporate governance regulatory frameworks in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings suggest that Nigeria needs an integrated system that combines elements of both rule-based and principle- based regulation, supported by a multi-stakeholder coregulation strategy. This paper departs from the mainstream rule-based and principle-based categorisations by forging ahead new perspectives on corporate governance regulation, especially in <b>weak</b> <b>market</b> economies...|$|E
