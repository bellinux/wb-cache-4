5|$|In the Peace of Westphalia, Frederick William was {{compensated}} for <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> with the secularized bishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden {{and the right}} of succession to the likewise secularized Archbishopric of Magdeburg. With Halberstadt, Brandenburg-Prussia also gained several smaller territories: the Lordship of Derenburg, the County of Regenstein, the Lordship of Klettenberg and the Lordship of Lohra. This was primarily due to French efforts to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg emperor by strengthening the Hohenzollern, and while Frederick William valued these territories lower than <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> they became step-stones {{for the creation of a}} closed, dominant realm in Germany in the long run.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of 1284 Przemysł II was {{involved}} on the side of Denmark and Brandenburg in an armed conflict against <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> and Rügen. Details about this event are limited, and the peace, which was concluded on 13 August, didn't bring any real benefits to Greater Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Slavic settlers {{from the}} east reached southeastern Poland {{in the second half}} of the 5th century, specifically the San River basin, then the upper Vistula regions, including the Kraków area and Nowy Sącz Valley. Single early sites are also known around Sandomierz and Lublin in Masovia and Upper Silesia. Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in Lower Silesia. In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. At the end of this century, or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania.</b> According to the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, the Slavs captured in Constantinople in 592 named the Baltic Sea coastal area as the place from which they originated.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that in practical terms the victory at Cedynia sealed <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania's</b> fate as Mieszko' dependency.|$|R
50|$|The {{surrounding}} area, {{even when}} {{seen from the}} odd spot that reaches 20 m above sea level, is almost flat. The city also gave the Ueckermünder Heide (heath and woodland) its name. It is <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania's</b> biggest wooded area, and stretches from the northwest to the southeast over 50 km to the Polish town of Police (Pölitz in German).|$|R
5|$|As of {{that time}} and in the {{following}} decades, <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin {{is the subject of}} debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzień group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical {{for the rest of the}} Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.|$|E
5|$|The early Germanic Jastorf {{cultural}} sphere was in {{the beginning}} an impoverished continuation of the North German Urnfield culture and the Nordic circle cultures. It formed around 700–550 BC in northern Germany and Jutland under the Hallstatt influence and in Jastorf's early stages its funeral customs resembled a lot those of the contemporary Pomeranian culture. From the Jastorf culture, which rapidly expanded from around 500 BC on, two groups sprang and settled the western borderlands of Poland during the 300–100 BC period: The Oder group in <b>western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> and the Gubin group further south. These peripheral for the Jastorf culture groups very likely originated as Pomeranian culture populations influenced by the Jastorf cultural model. Jastorf communities established large burial grounds, separate for men and women. The dead were cremated and the ashes placed in urns, which were covered by bowls turned upside down. Funeral gifts were modest and rather uniform, indicating a society that was neither affluent nor socially diversified.|$|E
5|$|After a power struggle, Bolesław III Wrymouth (r. 1102–1138) {{became the}} duke of Poland by {{defeating}} his half-brother Zbigniew in 1106–1107. Zbigniew {{had to leave the}} country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, who attacked Bolesław's Poland in 1109. Bolesław was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see Battle of Głogów). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Bolesław's other major achievement was the conquest of all of Mieszko I's Pomerania (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father Władysław I Herman and completed by Bolesław around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> up to Rügen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Bolesław's fief, to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty.|$|E
50|$|From the Napoleonic Wars to World War I, Pomerania was {{administered}} by the Kingdom of Prussia as the Province of <b>Pomerania</b> (<b>Western</b> and Farther <b>Pomerania)</b> and West Prussia (Pomerelia).|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{primarily}} commercial character, W krainie Gryfitów is a tome useful {{both to the}} Polish folklorists, as a {{basis for}} a more scientific research into the folklore of the western part of Poland, as well as an attempt to find the <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania's</b> Slavic roots, due to the constant disconnection and reconnection of this geographic area from the lands of Poland, since the first union of Polish tribes into one Polish nation under the Mieszko I's of Poland rule.|$|R
50|$|Forming {{part of the}} {{southern}} coast of the Baltic Sea, <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania's</b> boundaries have changed through the centuries and it belonged to countries such as Poland, Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia. Before 1945, it embraced the whole area of Pomerania west of the Oder River. Today the cities of Szczecin (Stettin), Świnoujście (Swinemünde) and Police (Pölitz) are part of Poland (see Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II), with {{the remainder of the}} region staying part of Germany. German Vorpommern now forms about one-third of the present-day north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.|$|R
5|$|Fighting the Veleti {{from the}} {{beginning}} of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany. The alliance was natural at this point, because the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when Wichmann, this time leading forces of the Volinians, was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law Boleslaus, had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his Italian policies. This new status allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent bishopric. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older. The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with Margrave Hodo that followed in the Battle of Cedynia of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of Pomerania. Wolin however remained autonomous and pagan. Kołobrzeg, where a strong gord was built around 985, was probably the actual center of Piast power in Pomerania. Before, a Scandinavian colony in Bardy-Świelubie near Kołobrzeg functioned as the center of this area. The western part of Mieszko controlled Pomerania (the region referred to by Polish historians as <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> roughly within the current Polish borders, as opposed to Gdańsk Pomerania or Pomerelia), which became independent of Poland during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005, when Poland was ruled by Mieszko's son Bolesław.|$|E
5|$|The Marcomannic Wars fought during 166–180 AD {{were caused}} by the {{pressure}} exerted by the northern Germanic peoples (settled around the area of today's Poland) on the tribes located {{in the vicinity of}} Roman limes, the Empire's defended border. Expansion of the Proto-Gothic Wielbark culture displaced from northern Greater Poland and Masovia the Przeworsk culture people; they in turn, moving south and east, crossed during the third quarter of the 2nd century the Carpathian Mountains. The ethnic composition of the Przeworsk population at this stage is not known, as the Lugii tribes no longer seem to be mentioned. Related to the Przeworsk culture was the Wietrzno-Solina type, a cultural unit with Celtic and then Dacian elements, situated within the more eastern part of the Beskids range (San River basin) during the 100–250 AD period. The Kotins tribe Celtic survivors with their Púchov culture disappeared now for good, {{as a result of their}} migration and involvement in the Marcomannic Wars. There were also changes in northwest Poland, on the border of the Elbe cultural sphere region. The Lubusz group there was absorbed by the new Luboszyce culture (Luboszyce, Krosno Odrzańskie County), that occupied the middle Oder basin during the 140–430 AD period. Its birth was related to the arrival from the east of population groups strongly influenced by the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures. Gradually a new branch of Germanic people, the Burgundians, whose origins are traced back to Scandinavia and the Bornholm island in particular and whose ancestors then migrated to the northwest Przework culture area, developed and evolved under new favorable conditions here. On the other hand, the Gustow group left <b>western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> to be replaced after 70 years by the Dębczyn group (Dębczyn, Wschowa County), established by the arrivals from the Elbe cultures and lasting between 210 and 450 AD.|$|E
25|$|Germany did not revoke {{the threat}} of execution, but the Gestapo did return the Czechoslovaks to PoW camps. On 22 September 1944 Bryks was brought to Stalag Luft I near Barth in <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1930, the <b>western</b> {{parts of}} <b>Pomerania</b> joined the Verband Brandenburgischer Ballspielvereine, {{to compete in}} the Brandenburg {{football}} championship instead.|$|R
50|$|Between 1 and 7 September 1643, {{imperial}} forces {{commanded by}} von Krockow invaded the Duchy of <b>Pomerania</b> and took <b>western</b> Farther <b>Pomerania.</b> Swedish forces commanded by Hans Christoff von Königsmarck attacked Krockow on 1 October, the battles lasted until 12 November when Krockow retreated pursued by Königsmarck's forces.|$|R
5000|$|Polish costumes are a {{wide variety}} {{depending}} on each region; there is no [...] "one" [...] polish costume. <b>Western</b> Poland (Silesia, <b>Pomerania)</b> feature more Germanised styles, usually less embroidery than its counterparts in Eastern Poland.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} his rule, Mieszko I left to {{his sons}} a {{territory}} at least twice as large as what he inherited from his father. The most significant were the additions of Silesia, <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> and probably Lesser Poland including Kraków.|$|E
25|$|Scheele {{was born}} in Stralsund, in <b>western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> {{which at the time}} was a Swedish Dominion inside the Holy Roman Empire. Scheele's father Joachim (or Johann) Christian Scheele, was a grain dealer and brewer from a {{respected}} German family. His mother was Margaretha Eleanore Warnekros.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{result of}} Mieszko's {{fighting}} in <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> is not known. Subsequent {{loss of the}} region by Mieszko's son Bolesław Chrobry suggests that the conquest was difficult and the hold over that territory rather tenuous. In one version of the legend of St. Wojciech it is written that Mieszko I had his daughter married to a Pomeranian prince, who previously voluntarily was washed with the holy water of the baptism in Poland. The above information, {{as well as the}} fact that Bolesław lost <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> suggest that the region was not truly incorporated into the Polish state, but only became a fief. This conjecture seems to be confirmed in the introduction of the first volume of the chronicles of Gallus Anonymus concerning the Pomeranians: Although often the leaders of the forces defeated by the Polish duke sought salvation in baptism, as soon as they regained their strength, they repudiated the 'Christian' (that is, Roman Catholic) faith and started the war against Christian anew.|$|E
50|$|According to Labuda, in the <b>western</b> {{portion of}} <b>Pomerania,</b> the {{population}} balance of German colonists relative to original Kashubian and Lutici inhabitants was 1 to 9 - Germanization didn't occur until the 14th and 15th centuries.|$|R
50|$|During {{his short}} life he {{published}} over 80 publications including 6 historical monographies. Another 20 were published after his death.

25|$|The first map series, still {{unpublished}} to this day, {{are probably}} the First Saxon land survey by Matthias Oeder and Balthasar Zimmermann (surveyed between 1586 and 1633) and the Swedish land survey of <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> (surveyed 1692-1709). The first published, and thus trendsetting, map series {{is likely to be}} the Carte de Cassini, published from 1756 and finished only at the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Wilhelm Solf {{was born}} into a wealthy and liberal family in Berlin. He {{attended}} secondary schools in Anklam in <b>western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> and in Mannheim. He took up the study of Oriental languages, in particular Sanskrit at universities in Berlin, Göttingen and Halle, earning a doctorate in philology in the winter of 1885. Under the supervision of the well-known Indologist Richard Pischel, he wrote an elementary grammar of Sanskrit.|$|E
25|$|Baltic amber {{was traded}} {{in return for}} weapons and luxurious objects from {{southern}} Europe, including fancy personal grooming items such as nail clipping devices, and trade relations with the Nordic area peoples were similarly well developed, notably in <b>western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> which had increasingly been falling under the Nordic cultural zone (southern Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark and northern Germany) influence throughout the Later Bronze Age, when its artisans imitated the Nordic imports.|$|E
50|$|The Region of Stettin (Regierungsbezirk Stettin, rejencja szczecińska) was {{a unit of}} {{territorial}} division in the Prussian and later German Province of Pomerania. It was established in 1816 and existed until 1945. On 1 October 1932 the Stralsund Region was incorporated into the Stettin Region. The Region included {{large parts of the}} historical regions of <b>Western</b> and Central <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|R
50|$|After World War II, Germans {{east of the}} Oder-Neisse line were {{expelled}} to post-war Germany. Most varieties of East Pomeranian dialect have largely died out in the following decades as the expellees were assimilated into their new homes, although West Pomeranian and Central Pomeranian are still spoken in Vorpommern (<b>Western</b> or Hither <b>Pomerania),</b> part of the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.|$|R
50|$|In 1460, Otto III was {{declared}} an adult, {{at the request}} of the Estates of Pomerania. This ended the regency by Brandenburg; instead the 15-year-old Otto III took up government himself. The most important offices in his court were occupied by Brandenburg-minded people. The disputes about the inheritance of Warislaw IX were settled in 1463, with Otto receiving Pomerania-Stargard, the <b>western</b> part of <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|R
25|$|Władysław died on 2 March 1333 in Kraków. His son, Casimir III the Great, {{inherited}} Lesser Poland, the Duchy of Sandomierz, Greater Poland, Kuyavia, and the Duchies of Łęczyca and Sieradz. However, Silesia and Lubusz Land to the west, {{along with}} Gdańsk Pomerania, <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> and Mazovia to the north, still remained outside the kingdom's borders.

25|$|Altogether, 47,252 French {{troops were}} hunting for Blücher. Bernadotte had 15,450, Soult led 24,375, General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc's 4th Dragoon Division {{numbered}} 2,550 troopers, General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy's 2nd Dragoon Division had 2,432 horsemen, General of Brigade Antoine Lasalle counted 785 hussars, and General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's 2nd Cuirassier Division included 1,660 cavalrymen. Bernadotte dropped off his least fit men at Neubrandenburg and pressed on with 12,000. Meanwhile, Murat and his cavalry were sweeping west through <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Peace of Westphalia {{was signed}} between May and October 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster, {{effectively}} ending the European wars of religion. Sweden received an indemnity of five million talers, used primarily {{to pay its}} troops. Sweden further received <b>Western</b> <b>Pomerania</b> (henceforth Swedish Pomerania), Wismar, and the Prince-Bishoprics of Bremen and Verden as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire {{as well as in}} the respective circlediets (Kreistag) of the Upper Saxon, Lower Saxon and Westphalian circles.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 14th century, the {{settling}} progress slowed {{as a result of the}} Black Death. Probably the population halved by that time and in addition economically marginal settlements were left, in particular on the sandy soil of <b>Pomerania</b> and <b>Western</b> Prussia. Only after more than a century, local Slavic leaders in late Medieval <b>Pomerania,</b> <b>Western</b> Prussia and Silesia continued inviting German settlers to their territories.|$|R
50|$|The {{league and}} its modus {{did not change}} at all until 1930, when, on 18 January, the clubs from the <b>western</b> part of <b>Pomerania</b> joined the Brandenburg {{football}} championship, but not the Oberliga. This meant, instead {{of two or three}} final games between the two divisional champions, a four team finals tournament was introduced in 1931, consisting of the two Oberliga division winners, the Pomeranian champion and the Berlin Cup winner.|$|R
25|$|After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 the <b>western</b> part of <b>Pomerania,</b> {{including}} Greifswald and its university, {{became a}} fief held by Sweden. 1806-1815 it was formally {{a part of}} Sweden. Without entirely losing its character as a German university, it was heavily influenced by Swedish educational policies until 1815. Especially {{during the second half}} of the eighteenth century Greifswald was a cultural and scientific bridge between Germany and Sweden. More than 1,500 Swedes studied at Greifswald University.|$|R
