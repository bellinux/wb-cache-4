Several weeks later the supplement disappeared altogether, with The Crab with the Golden Claws being moved into Le Soir itself, where it became a daily strip.

5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The {{statutory}} minimum wage {{does not apply to}} them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> less than the MAW.|$|E

25|$|Effective altruists {{argue that}} {{counterfactual}} reasoning {{is important to}} determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume {{that the best way}} to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.|$|E
25|$|The textile industry, once {{concentrated}} in New England with outposts in New Jersey and Philadelphia, had started moving South in the 1880s.

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Italians in Boston, {{as in other}} cities, often clashed with the Irish {{despite the fact that}} the vast {{majority}} of both groups shared a common religion (Roman Catholic) and political party (Democratic). The Irish dominated Boston politics, the police department, and the local church hierarchy. In addition to having arrived earlier than the Italians, and in greater numbers, they had the advantage of speaking English and being generally lighter-complexioned than Italians, many of whom had olive skin. At the same time, working-class Irish and Italian residents were in competition for housing and jobs. Italians were often <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> less, and thus posed a threat to Irish job security.|$|E
25|$|He {{attempted}} {{to increase the}} Congress base by bringing in more farmers, townspeople and Muslims between 1886 and 1887 and this created a backlash from the British, leading to backtracking by the Congress. Hume was disappointed when Congress opposed moves to raise the age of marriage for Indian girls and failed to focus on issues of poverty. Some Indian princes {{did not like the}} idea of democracy and some organizations like the United Indian Patriotic Association went about trying to undermine the Congress by showing it as an organization with a seditious character. In 1892, he tried to get them to act by warning of a violent agrarian revolution but this only outraged the British establishment and frightened the Congress leaders. Disappointed by the continued lack of Indian leaders <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the cause of national emancipation, Hume left for Britain in 1894.|$|E
25|$|The Farm Hall {{transcripts}} {{reveal that}} Heisenberg, {{along with other}} physicists interned at Farm Hall including Otto Hahn and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, were glad the Allies had won World War II, but regretted failing to create an atomic bomb. Upon hearing that the Allies had succeeded in creating atomic bombs and had dropped them in Japan, the German scientists speculated how the bomb was made and discussed their own failure. Heisenberg mentioned some misconceptions regarding {{the construction of an}} atomic bomb, such as the critical mass necessary to trigger a nuclear reaction. The morality of creating a bomb for the Nazis was also discussed. Only a few of the scientists expressed genuine horror at the prospect of nuclear weapons, and Heisenberg himself was cautious in discussing the matter. In his book Alsos, Samuel Goudsmit states that the German scientists were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Nazis to develop an atomic weapon, and attributed their failure to scientific misconception. Paul Lawrence Rose argues in Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: a Study in German Culture that Heisenberg is intentionally misleading in his report of the atomic bomb project in order to protect his own reputation.|$|E
