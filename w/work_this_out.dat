5000|$|Despite {{its early}} {{involvement}} and important role, the Manhattan Project {{had not been}} kind to Columbia. Arthur Compton had concentrated nuclear reactor research at the University of Chicago in 1942. After the war, scientists there {{had access to the}} research reactors at the government-sponsored Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermi and Urey were lured away to Chicago. When the war ended in August 1945, the Physics Department at Columbia had five vacant chairs. Filling them would be no easy task. Physicists were hailed as heroes, and every major university was eager to recruit the best ones to build up their departments. They were offered high salaries, and when they left they often took their students and post-doctoral assistants with them. Even the quintessential New Yorker Rabi was tempted to leave rather than return to Columbia from his wartime work at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. He offered to stay, but one condition: [...] I Rabi went to the chairman, Dean Pegram, a very fine person, a brilliant man. He was on most important committees of the university. He also had been chairman of the Physics Department for some twenty years. I said to him, [...] "I'll come back, but I have to be the chairman. I have to <b>work</b> <b>this</b> <b>out,</b> and I have to <b>work</b> <b>this</b> <b>out</b> in my way. Well, he did it. He was my patron, actually, and I asked him to vacate his job. I don't think the department would have elected me necessarily. But Pegram was a very powerful man, and he was so universally respected that he just had to suggest it in his way and it was done.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to {{the common}} belief that Sven Co-op was {{developed}} to play through Half-Life cooperatively, Fearon had {{wanted to create a}} means for players to engage in cooperative experiences together, often just spawning in large number of enemies for them to dispatch together on a single map. This drew a number of amateur level developers to craft mission-based maps for the mod, where players would be required to go to different areas on the map based on success or failure of a given objective. Such designers included Dave McDermot, who initially ran the Sven Co-op website before becoming a developer on it. Fearon had planned from the onset to include support for cooperatively playing through Half-Lifes single-player campaign within Sven Co-op, but this was hampered initially by how the game's engine transitions from map to map that made it difficult to keep players together in the multiplayer approach. Ultimately, the team had been able to <b>work</b> <b>this</b> <b>out,</b> and later added support for Half-Lifes two expansions, Half-Life: Opposing Force, and Half-Life: Blue Shift.|$|E
