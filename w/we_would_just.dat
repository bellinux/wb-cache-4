500|$|Recording {{began with}} a demo session at a small church in Woodstock, which was not {{intended}} to produce any official releases. During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums (Astral Weeks and Moondance), recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before ("Crazy Face" [...] and [...] "Give Me a Kiss"), as well as two instrumentals. Limited recording equipment was used, operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar, who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time. Shaar remembered: [...] "I found an old church and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> load in. I'd set up a pair of mikes and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> run down some tracks with the tapes running. They became like a working thing for the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
500|$|The Hill Valley {{town square}} scenes were shot at Courthouse Square, {{located in the}} Universal Studios backlot (...) [...] Gale {{explained}} {{it would have been}} impossible to shoot on location [...] "because no city is going to let a film crew remodel their town to look like it's in the 1950s." [...] The filmmakers [...] "decided to shoot all the 50s stuff first, and make the town look real beautiful and wonderful. Then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> totally trash it down and make it all bleak and ugly for the 1980s scenes." [...] The interiors for Doc Brown's house were shot at the Robert R. Blacker House, while exteriors took place at Gamble House. The exterior shots of the Twin Pines Mall, and later the Lone Pine Mall (from 1985) were shot at the Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry, California. The exterior shots and some interior scenes at Hill Valley High School were filmed at Whittier High School in Whittier, California. The Battle of the Bands tryout scene was filmed at the McCambridge Park Recreation Center in Burbank, and the [...] "Enchantment Under the Sea" [...] dance was filmed in the gymnasium at Hollywood United Methodist Church. The scenes outside of the Baines' house in 1955 were shot at Bushnell Avenue, South Pasadena, California.|$|E

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking.

2500|$|Go was {{recorded}} with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson from June to October 2011 at his studio, Flowers Studio, in the band's home of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band recorded {{on their own}} time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervous to the group. Typically, for an album such as their previous effort, the band would head to Los Angeles with booked studio time, balancing the schedules of producers, on budget with a set timeline. The band did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "This time we just felt like it was like we were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. [...] "Before <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> work on material, make edits, add guitars and then finish.

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of her career until 1990, Graf regularly played doubles events in Grand Slams and other tournaments, winning a total of 11 titles. In 1986, she formed a partnership with rival Gabriela Sabatini. The pair was moderately successful, winning the 1988 Wimbledon Championships [...] together and reaching the finals of the French Open in 1986, 1987 and 1989. The partnership was the subject of much discussion, as the two women, both known to be shy, usually kept communication to a minimum during changeovers and between points, a highly unusual situation in doubles. Sabatini said of the partnership: [...] "doubles is all about communicating with each other, and we didn't communicate that much. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> say the basic things, but nothing else." [...] The pair played their last major tournament together at the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, losing in the quarterfinals. From 1991 until the end of her career, Graf would only play doubles sporadically, forming short-term partnerships with a variety of players, including Lori McNeil, Anke Huber and her best friends on the tour, Rennae Stubbs, Patricia Tarabini and Ines Gorrochategui. She played her last Grand Slam doubles tournament at the 1999 Australian Open with Gorrochategui, losing in the second round.|$|E
2500|$|Sebastian {{wrote about}} his time {{recording}} in Memphis {{in a series}} of blogs in Australian newspapers. [...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. [...] I would show them which song I wanted to record. After listening to any changes I had, we would all go into the live room. Everyone would hop to their instruments I'd hop in the vocal booth. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> hit record button without a rehearsal and everyone would nail it nearly every time." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic about working with Sebastian. [...] "Needless to say I've done {{a lot of things in}} my career, had a lot of fun, but we had more fun working with this young guy who just sings the rings around everything. [...] this kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off. He had the grit and the grime and the soul of Otis Redding, and he had the sweet soul of Al Green, he had the wonderful sweet church sound of Sam Cooke, and he just took us by storm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soul-Crusher {{continued}} {{to develop the}} punk-like noise rock style of its predecessor. The record's sound {{has been described as}} [...] "Beefheart in painfully tight trousers trying to scream his way over Sonic Youth and The Birthday Party playing different songs in the same room." [...] Sean has cited The Cramps, The Birthday Party, Flipper, Butthole Surfers, and Black Flag as primary influences to the band during this time. She said, [...] "I would write bass riffs that were very driving and tribal with Ivan’s drums, very Birthday Party and Butthole Surfers-influenced. Then sometimes <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> tell Tom to go nuts and make some noise!". Guay also created entire tracks of guitar feedback and noise, which didn't relate to any of the songs, that the band would proceed to layer over the album. Rob would usually work out the lyrics and vocal arrangement after the music had already been written, sometimes even waiting until the band was in the studio to finish the song. He felt that the band had finally solidified into a unit and that the record perfectly showcased their sound during that era more so than anything else they had recorded before, although he was very critical of the band's music and the noise rock genre at the time, going as far as to say: ...|$|E

2500|$|Whilst on tour, {{the band}} became reacquainted with Claritys {{producer}} Mark Trombino, {{and decided to}} work with him once again for their forthcoming album. Trombino also produced the band's second studio album, Static Prevails (1996), and their commercial breakthrough, Bleed American (2001). Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking [...] songs as far as [...] could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] " [...] would do a mix of it and add production ideas and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> kind of go back and forth like that.

[...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
