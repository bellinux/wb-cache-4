5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented {{a detailed description of the}} oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues came up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had {{been in touch with}} a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E

25|$|The Monitor was a high-winged {{aircraft}} with an all-metal fuselage {{and wooden}} wings. It was originally stipulated that the aircraft would incorporate the Bristol Beaufighter wing and landing gear {{to speed up}} design and production, but owing to increased demand for the Beaufighter only the landing gear was used, and a new all-wood one-piece wing was designed. The aircraft was powered by two Wright Cyclone R-2600-31 radial engines driving Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propellers. It was fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> hydraulic winch as the normal windlasses {{could not be used}} at speeds of much more than , while the Monitor was required to tow targets at double this speed.|$|E

25|$|The {{south and}} westwards range {{expansion}} of black sparrowhawks in South Africa has {{led them to}} colonise the urban and suburban areas of Cape Town where they have thrived in the past 15 years, {{with none of the}} expected negative impacts on their health that might have been expected from the disturbances associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> climate (from a subtropical, summer rainfall regimen to a Mediterranean, winter rainfall region), or other possible sources of stress in their newly urbanised environments. This is probably due to the abundance of prey, mainly various species of Columbidae (the wide variety of pigeons and doves) in these urban areas, and, therefore, their lack of nutritional stress.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} that A. salmonicida contains the spf gene (which encodes Spot 42), but lacks the galK operon (the natural Spot 42 target in E. coli), have inspired scientists {{to study the}} role of Spot 42 in this fish pathogen. A. salmonicida is unable to utilize galactose (lacks gal operon) in minimal medium and addition of galactose has {{little effect on the}} growth rate. When cells are grown in glucose the level of Spot42 is increased 16-40 folds, but is in contrast decreased 3 folds when cAMP is added, indicating that Spot42 probably have similar roles as in E. coli (i.e., in carbohydrate metabolism). It has been hypothesized that Spot 42 works in concert <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> sRNA gene, called VSsrna24, located 262 nt downstream of spf. The VSsrna42 RNA is approximately 60 nt in length and has an expression pattern opposite to that of Spot42. Furthermore, in a spf deletion mutant a gene encoding a pirin-like protein was upregulated 16 folds. Pirin has key roles in the central metabolism by regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 and therefore select if pyruvate will be fermented or go through respiration through the TCA cycle and electron transport.|$|E
