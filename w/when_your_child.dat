I am now a private person like {{yourself}} and many million others; but I am one who still fights upon the side of quiet. Now, madam, {{you know better than}} I, and God better than you, what you have done to mankind in the past; I pause not to inquire; it is with the future I concern myself, it is for the future I demand security. I would not willingly put arms into the hands of a disloyal combatant; and I dare not restore to wealth one of the levyers of a private and a barbarous war. I speak with some severity, and yet I pick my terms. I tell myself continually that you are a woman; and a voice continually reminds me of the children whose lives and limbs you have endangered. A woman,’ he repeated solemnly—‘and children. Possibly, madam, when you are yourself a mother, you will feel the bite of that antithesis: possibly when you kneel at night beside a cradle, a fear will fall upon you, heavier than any shame; and <b>when</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> lies in the pain and danger of disease, you shall hesitate to kneel before your Maker.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{is another}} {{difficulty}} in trusting to the honor and conscience of a doctor. Doctors {{are just like}} other Englishmen: {{most of them have}} no honor and no conscience: what they commonly mistake for these is sentimentality and an intense dread of doing anything that everybody else does not do, or omitting to do anything that everybody else does. This of course does amount to a sort of working or rule-of-thumb conscience; but it means that you will do anything, good or bad, provided you get enough people to keep you in countenance by doing it also. It is the sort of conscience that makes it possible to keep order on a pirate ship, or in a troop of brigands. It may be said that in the last analysis there is no other sort of honor or conscience in existence--that the assent of the majority is the only sanction known to ethics. No doubt this holds good in political practice. If mankind knew the facts, and agreed with the doctors, then the doctors would be in the right; and any person who thought otherwise would be a lunatic. But mankind does not agree, and does not know the facts. All that can be said for medical popularity is that until there is a practicable alternative to blind trust in the doctor, the truth about the doctor is so terrible that we dare not face it. Moliere saw through the doctors; but he had to call them in just the same. Napoleon had no illusions about them; but he had to die under their treatment just as much as the most credulous ignoramus that ever paid sixpence for a bottle of strong medicine. In this predicament most people, to save themselves from unbearable mistrust and misery, or from being driven by their conscience into actual conflict with the law, fall back on the old rule that if you cannot have what you believe in you must believe in what you have. <b>When</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> is ill or your wife dying, and you happen to be very fond of them, or even when, if you are not fond of them, you are human enough to forget every personal grudge before the spectacle of a fellow creature in pain or peril, what you want is comfort, reassurance, something to clutch at, were it but a straw. This the doctor brings you. You have a wildly urgent feeling that something must be done; and the doctor does something. Sometimes what he does kills the patient; but you do not know that; and the doctor assures you that all that human skill could do has been done. And nobody has the brutality to say to the newly bereft father, mother, husband, wife, brother, or sister, [...] "You have killed your lost darling by your credulity." ...|$|E

Having a high self-esteem is what we, as parents want {{for our children and}} is an important ingredient for success in school and at home. Here are some tips on ways to encourage the growth of <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> self-esteem: • Give <b>your</b> <b>child,</b> a Genuine Encounter Moments (GEMS) daily. A Genuine Encounter Moment is simply 100 % focused attention without having your mind distracted with other thoughts <b>when</b> responding to <b>your</b> <b>child.</b> Remembering to talk to <b>your</b> <b>child</b> at his eye level will demonstrate his worth in his mind. In less than two minutes, you can help <b>your</b> <b>child</b> feel loved, valuable, listened to and important by using a Genuine Encounter Moment. • Help her feel valuable by asking for her advice or having her teach you something. For example: your daughter telling and showing you how to play the game or asking her what she thinks you should wear to work today. • Respect <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> differences by accepting and valuing his efforts, school-related or activity-related. Just because when you were young and great in softball doesn’t mean <b>your</b> <b>child</b> will have the same interest. • Provide individual storage space for her belongings just as you have your own personal space. ...|$|R

40|$|Wouldn’t it be {{wonderful}} if our children were always well-behaved {{and we never}} {{had to worry about}} discipline? In reality, however, we know that discipline is one of the necessary, if sometimes unpleasant, parts of our job as parents. <b>When</b> you discipline <b>your</b> <b>child,</b> you are teaching the right way to behave. This {{is an important part of}} child development. Children Need Discipline Children need discipline to protect them from danger, to learn how to get along with others, to learn acceptable and appropriate behavior, and to learn that society has certain common rules that everyone is expected to live by. Discipline also helps children learn to think in an orderly fashion and to understand the logical consequences of their actions. Most important, positive discipline helps a child learn self-control, which builds healthy self-esteem. Parents and School Discipline The discipline a child learns at home is the foun-dation for behavior at school. Be familiar with your school’s discipline policy. If <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> teacher reports a discipline problem, talk with <b>your</b> <b>child</b> and the teacher to work on a solution together. Discipline Tips for Parents ■ Emphasize “do’s ” rather than “don’ts. ” ■ Put limits on <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> behavior, but be careful not to make too many rules. ■ Be consistent. A predictable environment helps children to feel safe, since they know what to expect. ■ Keep a sense of humor. It helps you keep a proper perspective about what is really important. ■ Praise <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> accomplishments. ■ Listen to <b>your</b> <b>child</b> and help him or her work through a problem. ■ Encourage independence. Let children make their own decisions and contributions to family decisions whenever appropriate. ■ Set a good example. A child learns more from what you do than from what you say.
