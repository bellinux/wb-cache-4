Messenger states that her three remaining children are unvaccinated and are very healthy, she says sunshine and healthy food will protect them, while the Herald Sun says [...] "She also argues that her unvaccinated children have never had any serious illnesses.

Her children are also benefiting from the sensible precautions taken {{by the rest of}} us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nina {{was very}} much {{involved}} in {{the whole process of}} producing the album that she had to give up several television appearances, which included dropping out of her ASAP group and segment entitled the Sessionistas. She explained [...] "Umalis po ako sa ASAP dahil nagprepare po talaga ako sa album. At nasasabay sa mga out of town and out of the country na shows. [...] " [...] She kept a close watch from the album's conceptualization to its songs and arrangement, and even the paper dolls inside the album was her own idea. To be able to do all these things, she had to temporarily disappear in the scene for a while. Production for the album took nearly two years to finish, making people <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had gone out of the music industry for good. In choosing a title for the album, Nina personally decided to call it Stay Alivecoming from the album's second track, [...] "Staying Alive"to remind the people that she is still very much around, in spite of the hiatus on TV, and the long break from the recording scene.

2500|$|The {{character}} has received mostly positive critical reception. IGN's Andrew Alfonso described Lili as a [...] "deadly Lolita-looking warrior". Luke van Leuveren of PALGN opined that Lili {{and the other}} new characters who debuted in Dark Resurrection [...] "fit well into the game and don’t feel tacked on." [...] James Mielke of 1UP.com, in 2007, deemed Lili [...] "the most substantial new character the series has seen in years". NowGamer described Lili as [...] "an instant hit" [...] for her [...] "flowery girly-girl appearance" [...] and [...] "light-footed fighting style", because, the site wrote, [...] "she’s a girl and girls love that kind of stuff." [...] Brian Soboleski of TeamXbox included Lili among the site's eleven [...] "hotties in the Xbox universe" [...] for [...] "her role of a childish, yet seductive, fighter whose self confidence made her even more appealing." [...] She was listed as the ninth-"sexiest female video game character of all time" [...] by Albert Costill of AMOG in 2013: [...] "She’s a cute, blonde bombshell that blends street fighting with gymnastics. It doesn’t {{get any better than}} that." [...] Kevin Wong of Complex listed her as the fifteenth-best Tekken character in 2013: [...] "If a player wants to kick ass and look impeccable doing it, Lili is the girl for the job." [...] Jayson Dubin of GameZone criticized Lili's [...] "faux originality" [...] in his 2006 review of Dark Resurrection: [...] "She's a decent character that offers a lot of moves to learn. But when I control her, I don't feel like I'm in the next evolution of Tekken. I feel like I'm charge of a rehash." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said in 2012, [...] " [...] nice to see that someone finally found a way to work a character with daddy issues into the Tekken series," [...] but Writtin King of Game Informer included Lili in his 2012 ranking of the most [...] "ridiculous" [...] Tekken characters on the basis of her primary costume. [...] " [...] supposed to believe Lili is proficient in street fighting? Give me a break." [...] King additionally commented on her storyline of being housebound by her father for fighting in the tournament: [...] "In other words, she got grounded. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> lost her telephone privileges, too." [...] In an official fan poll hosted by Namco in 2012, Lili was the most-requested Tekken character for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter with 16.72% (14,764) of 88,280 votes, finishing two hundredths of a percentage point ahead of Jun Kazama.|$|E
