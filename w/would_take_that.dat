500|$|Chotiner {{arranged}} for stories in local papers alleging that Voorhis had {{been endorsed by}} [...] "the PAC", hoping that voters <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> to mean the Congress of Industrial Organizations's Political Action Committee (CIO-PAC). The CIO was a labor federation which later merged with the American Federation of Labor to form the AFL-CIO. [...] It had been organized in 1943 and took left-wing stands; its PAC {{was seen as a}} communist front organization by some. A second PAC, the National Citizen's Political Action Committee (NCPAC) was also affiliated with the CIO, but was open to those outside the labor movement. [...] Among the 1946 members of the NCPAC were actors Melvyn Douglas and Ronald Reagan. [...] Both PACs had been headed by the late labor leader, Sidney Hillman, and the two organizations shared office space in New York City. [...] While the CIO's national leadership decried communism; some of the local CIO-PAC branches were dominated by Communist Party members. [...] The CIO-PAC, which had endorsed Voorhis in 1944, refused to back him again. The Southern California chapter of the NCPAC endorsed Voorhis on April 1, 1946. Chotiner's strategy was to conflate the two PACs in the public eye.|$|E

2500|$|The early Heinlein biographer {{and critic}} Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 {{biography}} Heinlein in Dimension, {{took note of}} a controversial theme: [...] "The romantic situation in this story is a very interesting, very odd one: it {{is nothing less than}} a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve ('adorable' is Heinlein's word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit." [...] The novel [...] "worried and bothered" [...] John W. Campbell, who said [...] "Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands.

2500|$|There {{are many}} where the true {{identity}} of mikoshi-nyūdō is unclear, {{but there are}} regions where they are animals that possess the ability to transform. In the legends of Hinoemata, Minamiaizu District, Fukushima Prefecture, they are shapeshifted weasels, and {{it is said that}} if one gets lured to look up from the nyūdō's expansion, the weasel <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> opening and bit at one's throat. In the [...] "Tonoigusa," [...] they are shapeshifted tanuki, and there are also some regions where they are shapeshifted foxes (kitsune). In the Shinano Province (now Nagano Prefecture), they are said to be shapeshifted mujina. Also, in the aforementioned Hinoemata, it is said that the mikoshi-nyūdō's true form is a hand-held object like a paper lantern, bucket, or rudder, {{and that it would be}} possible to exterminate the nyūdō by striking at the object.|$|E
2500|$|Artie Auerbach had a {{successful}} career as a reporter and photographer for the New York tabloid Daily Mirror and the New York Daily News. Among the more famous stories he covered were the Lindbergh kidnapping and the Hall–Mills murder case. Reportedly, he once took an illegal picture of {{a person in the}} electric chair. While a photographer, Auerbach had become very popular at private parties by telling Yiddish anecdotes. It was during his days as a press photographer when Auerbach had the inspiration for the character that would prove to give him his greatest fame. He was on an assignment at a Bronx drug store when he heard a voice singing a popular song of the time, [...] "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" [...] with a strong Yiddish dialect and he loved the voice and personality. He <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> character and evolve it into the lovable and laughable Mr. Kitzel. Auerbach and the druggist who inspired the character, Maurice Adollf, became long-time close friends. Auerbach described Adollf as [...] "a wealthy man who had found peace of mind... the thing we are all battling to find." [...] When Auerbach began to find work as a comedian, he didn't quit the newspaper, but simply took a leave of absence. However, even by 1941, despite then appearing regularly on various radio programs, he still felt insecure about his future in show business and asked his newspaper for his seventh consecutive leave of absence.|$|E
2500|$|The Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices fined NOM over $50,000 {{and demanded}} the group file a {{campaign}} finance report, revealing donors, for fundraising {{related to a}} 2009 Maine referendum. Maine laws require organizations that solicit more than $5,000 for a ballot question campaign to file disclosure reports. NOM contributed $1.6million to Stand For Marriage Maine as of October 23, 2009, without filing any disclosure reports. [...] The Commission was started on the path an investigation by Karger. The commission approved an investigation on a 3–2 vote, overriding the recommendation of their staff. NOM responded by filing suit, claiming that the state's election laws violate the Constitution. NOM, arguing that their lawsuit was likely to succeed, sought a federal restraining order {{to avoid having to}} provide donor names before the date of the balloting, which U.S. District Court Judge David Brock Hornby denied. In January 2010, representatives of the group were subpoenaed to appear before the commission. In February, the group requested that those subpoenas be dropped, but the commission voted unanimously to deny that request. On May 23, 2010, Magistrate Judge John H. Rich III of the U.S. District Court of Maine ordered NOM to submit bank statements and similar documentation, covering the dates from January 1, 2009 forward, to Maine's Commission on Government Ethics and Election Practices within seven days. On June 24, 2010, the commission rejected NOM's claim that the commission lacked appropriate authority and should cease its investigation. In February 2011, Hornby issued a summary judgment ruling that Maine's disclosure law was valid, a decision NOM appealed and lost in August 2011. In September 2011, the federal court denied NOM's request to have the case reheard, and in February 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected NOM's request to hear the case. In January 2012, NOM lost another federal appeal on a different aspect of their Maine case, but said that they <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> issue to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on October 1, 2012. After hearing arguments on April 11, 2013, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on May 30 affirmed the lower court ruling and rejected NOM's challenge to the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Elections Practices's subpoenas. The Commission announced their findings and the fine on May 28, 2014, saying that NOM had [...] "intentionally set up its fundraising strategy to avoid disclosure laws". A lawyer representing NOM plans to appeal the matter in state court, and NOM filed complaint against two groups that support gay marriage, the Human Rights Campaign and the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force Foundation, saying that they had engaged in the same actions as NOM.|$|E
