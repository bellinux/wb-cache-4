The second production series (560 100 - 560 141) has the blue <b>window</b> <b>strip</b> extended {{all the way}} to the driver's compartment.

50|$|The {{entrance}} façade and {{the external}} altar wall are concrete slabs. The {{rest of the}} structure is bare concrete. A canopy floats over the entrance, which slopes down in an inward curve. On its fascia is a dedicatory inscription. The entrance doors are carved wood planking and are set in varnished planking that fills the frontage below the canopy. At {{the top of the}} entrance façade is a horizontal <b>window</b> <b>strip.</b> Vertical window strips edge each vertical step along the side frontages. Another horizontal <b>window</b> <b>strip</b> {{is at the top of}} the altar wall.|$|E

50|$|Like the exterior, the {{interior}} is entirely exposed grey concrete. The vast single space houses abstract stained glass in the horizontal and vertical <b>window</b> <b>strips,</b> the colours of which are dominated by azure blue. Behind the altar is a semicircular coved concrete wall, surrounded by vertical and horizontal <b>window</b> <b>strips</b> that are mostly magenta. Above this is the main altar wall, which has an upward and outward sweep of raw concrete bearing a figure of Christ crucified without a cross. The two chapels are smaller with blue glass.|$|R
50|$|Another {{new feature}} was the livery, {{with a red}} coach body and beige <b>window</b> <b>strips.</b> Even various {{passenger}} and luggage trailers were offered, but only the Fliegerkommandantur List had one of these trailers delivered from Waggonfabrik Wismar.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pavilion}} is {{topped by}} a pediment above the molded raking cornice which marks the roofline. It has an oculus with rowlocks and keystones in the middle.

The northernmost window unit on the basement has been bricked in.|$|R
5000|$|Rioting {{broke out}} in London. On the evening of March 1, protestors {{attacked}} an elegant Presbyterian meeting-house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, built only five years before.

50|$|Yarrabee flats {{was built}} for two musicians {{and it was a}} block of five flats which is located {{particularly}} in South Yarra. It is noticeably in the style of Romberg’s student work with crisp rectangular blocks build on large <b>windows,</b> <b>stripped</b> awnings, pilotis and cantilevered corner balconies recalled by corrugated ironwork form work. Yarrabee built in unrendered brick rather than white concrete and in the large living room has a huge stone chimney.|$|R
5000|$|The Jardinette {{building}} was Neutra's first commission in Los Angeles. Like the Lovell House, which Neutra designed {{around the same}} time, the Jardinette is composed of [...] "box-like forms, flat roofs, unbroken horizontal windows alternating with plain, banded spandrels extended to form balconies." [...] However, Jardinette differs from Lovell House in construction. Neutra chose reinforced concrete for Jardinette, with long spans of reinforced concrete allowing for unbroken <b>window</b> <b>strips.</b> The original design also included rooftop gardens.|$|R
50|$|The {{most ambitious}} constructions {{of the period}} {{included}} the seats of self-government in Amsterdam (1646) and Maastricht (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the House of Orange are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, Huis ten Bosch and Mauritshuis, are symmetrical blocks with large <b>windows,</b> <b>stripped</b> of ostentatious Baroque flourishes and mannerisms. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the Stadholder's summer residence of Het Loo.|$|R

5000|$|Campbell {{attracted}} the attention of Coventry City, Queens Park Rangers and Blackpool, who were keen to re-sign him.

50|$|The major exponents of the mid-17th century, Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post, adopted de Keyser's {{forms for}} such eclectic {{elements}} as giant-order pilasters, gable roofs, central pediments, and vigorous steeples. Brought {{together in a}} coherent combination, these stylistic developments anticipated Wren's Classicism. The most ambitious constructions of the period included the seats of self-government in Amsterdam (1646) and Maastricht (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively.

5000|$|In the Universal Century (U.C.) timeline, space colonies {{are placed}} at the five Earth-Moon Lagrangian points. In most cases, a Lagrangian point is {{home to more than}} one group of space colonies. Individual colony pairs are known as Bunches, and a group of colonies that occupy a Lagrangian point are known collectively as a Side. Because Sides {{sometimes}} share a single Lagrangian point, it is possible to have two Sides in close orbit to one another. Most colonies in the Universal Century are O'Neill [...] "Island 3" [...] type colony cylinders, yet a few early built Bernal sphere (Island 1) and Stanford torus colonies are still in function, but most are changed to space stations or discarded. [...] Side 3's colonies are identical in size and shape to the Island 3 design, but doubled the habitable area by removing the large <b>window</b> <b>strips</b> of the Island 3.|$|R

60|$|I am {{reminded}} of a story, or rather of {{the idea for a}} story that I think I must have read in that curious collection of fantasies and observations, Hawthorne's Note Book. It was to be {{the story of a man}} who found life dull and his circumstances altogether mediocre. He had loved his wife, but now after all she seemed to be a very ordinary human being. He had begun life with high hopes--and life was commonplace. He was to grow fretful and restless. His discontent was to lead to some action, some irrevocable action; but upon the nature of that action I do not think the Note Book was very clear. It was to carry him in such a manner that he was to forget his wife. Then, when it was too late, he was to see her at an upper <b>window,</b> <b>stripped</b> and firelit, a glorious thing of light and loveliness and tragic intensity....|$|R

25|$|The east bell-tower {{consists}} of a two-storey rusticated base and step-backs to an onion-shaped cupola above the belfry. At the ground level, an entry vestibule is created by an open, four-centered archway. At the second story, still within the tower's rusticated base-section, a series of four narrow, stained-glass <b>strip</b> <b>windows</b> provide a distinct, modernist, element. The first segment of the step-backs of the tower contains two smaller <b>strip</b> <b>windows,</b> and the following, taller set-back houses the church-bell behind narrow arches, one {{on each of the}} four sides, supported by Corinthian columns. The onion-cupola caps the composition.|$|R

50|$|Weatherization {{generally}} {{does not}} cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm <b>windows,</b> weather <b>stripping,</b> caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can {{reduce the amount of}} outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.|$|R
