5|$|In 1845, Archimandrite Porphyrius Uspensky (1804–1885), at {{that time}} head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and {{subsequently}} Bishop of Chigirin, visited the monastery and the codex was shown to him, together <b>with</b> <b>leaves</b> which Tischendorf had not seen. In 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw the codex, and bought two codices (495 and 496) from the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Cacti show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genus Pereskia, the branches are covered <b>with</b> <b>leaves,</b> so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness <b>with</b> <b>leaves</b> and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E

5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined <b>with</b> <b>leaves,</b> grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E

The next day, while hunting prey she {{encounters}} a tom named Pine, who engages {{in conversation with}} Sasha. He warns her of the Clan cats living in the forest, in the process taking off her collar for her. The next morning, a ShadowClan patrol consisting of Tigerstar, Rowanpaw, and Jaggedtooth comes along, and Sasha takes a particular interest in Tigerstar. After Rowanpaw scents traces of foxes, a frog appears, although he is unsuccessful at catching it. Before it can get away, though, Sasha drops on it and says that it slipped through their paws.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook nests in {{holes in}} trees {{between one and}} twenty metres (3-70 ft) above the ground. The holes are generally vertical, and mostly in eucalypts, though other trees such as coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia) have been recorded. Some sites are reused for up to 20 years, especially if broods have been successfully raised in them before. Boobooks may also evict other birds such as galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) to use their hollows, and have used sites abandoned by babblers, crows and ravens. The male does more of the site preparation, such as lining {{the base of the}} hollow <b>with</b> <b>leaves.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background Leaving {{hospital}} against {{medical advice}} (AMA) is common {{among people who}} use illicit drugs (PWUD) and is associated with severe health-related harms and costs. However, lit-tle {{is known about the}} prevalence of and factors associated <b>with</b> <b>leaving</b> AMA among PWUD. Methods Data were collected through two Canadian prospective cohort studies involving PWUD between September 2005 and July 2011 and linked to a hospital admission/discharge data-base. Bivariable and multivariable generalized estimating equations were used to examine factors associated <b>with</b> <b>leaving</b> hospital AMA among PWUD who were hospitalized. Results Among 488 participants who experienced at least one hospitalization, 212 (43. 4 %) left the hospital AMA at least once during the study period. In multivariable analyses, factors posi-tively and significantly associated <b>with</b> <b>leaving</b> hospital AMA included: unstable employmen...|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} very similar to A.barbiger. There are obvious {{differences}} in typical leaf shape, <b>with</b> <b>leaves</b> of most populations of A.barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A.obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and scarlet respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: A.barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} oviparous, meaning these turtles produce {{offspring}} by laying eggs only {{and do not}} provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest site selection and construction. Females select nest sites based on soil temperature (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is four inches wide and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas {{in order to avoid}} flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles will cover the nest <b>with</b> <b>leaves</b> or dirt in order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated <b>with</b> <b>leaves</b> and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E

25|$|The second general {{characteristic}} of Pachypodium is spinescence, or having spines. The spines come clustered in either pairs or triplets with these clusters often arranged in rings or whorls around the trunk. Spines emerge <b>with</b> <b>leaves,</b> and like leaves grow {{for a short}} period before stopping growth and hardening. Spines do not regenerate so weathering and abrasion can wear away all but the youngest spines from older specimens - leaving smooth trunks and branches.|$|E
