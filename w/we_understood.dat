500|$|Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA {{managing}} director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum {{to improve his}} attitude, and he heeded their advice. At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> {{what it meant to}} put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now." [...] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000. In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of {{the leader of the}} Flood were mixed. In a review of Halo 2, Mike Leonard of the AllXbox community said that the introduction of the Gravemind character had him [...] "rolling my eyes hard enough to get motion sickness from seeing the back of the inside of my skull"; Leonard {{went on to say that}} the [...] "Little Shop of Horrors reject" [...] ruined the [...] "cool" [...] of the Halo franchise. Staff from GamesRadar singled out the appearance of the Gravemind as a sign the Halo series had jumped the shark. [...] "Until Gravemind showed up, we were pretty sure <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> the Halo series' story," [...] they wrote, but that the appearance of a Venus Flytrap-like creature with an ego and [...] "a tendency to spout philosophical drivel" [...] was unexpected. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com bemoaned the fact that Gravemind was never explicitly stated to be the Flood leader in either Halo 2 or Halo 3 and was hardly seen in the third installment. Publications also took issue with the fact that the character's motivations were never fully explored; the South Florida Sun-Sentinel said that the [...] "unique and compelling characters" [...] of Halo 3, such as Cortana and the Master Chief, were overwhelmed by Gravemind.|$|E
500|$|Benfica started December with a Derby de Lisboa {{game against}} Sporting. They won 3–0, with a first half goal by Van Hooijdonk and two {{goals in a}} five-minute span from João Tomás. Following the win, Mourinho {{requested}} a contract extension as a demonstration {{of faith in the}} work he had put in along with his assistant: [...] "Me [...] and Mozer thought {{that the only way to}} end speculation and the constant threat of being sacked in the event of a bad result...was renewing our contracts for another season." [...] Their proposal was not met. They parted ways with the club through an announcement in a press conference: [...] "He [...] thought it was better not to accept our request. <b>We</b> <b>understood</b> that decision showed a lack of trust in our work, and that we should offer our resignation..." [...] Benfica immediately appointed Toni – a long-time favourite of the President – as the new manager. On 10 December, Benfica played Alverca away from home. They opened the score sheet with a goal from João Tomás close to half-time, but Mantorras equalized. Later, Milinkovic put the Ribatejo side in the lead, resulting in the fourth loss in seven matches in away games for Benfica. In the last match of the year 2000, Benfica met a struggling Gil Vicente, who were at the bottom of the Primeira Liga standings. Unable to unlock the 0–0 draw, the club suffered their eighth winless league game of the season.|$|E
500|$|Benn {{asserted}} that the teachings of Jesus Christ had a [...] "radical political importance" [...] on his life, and made {{a distinction between the}} historical Jesus as [...] "a carpenter of Nazareth" [...] who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and [...] "the way in which he's presented by some religious authorities; by popes, archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power", believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus. He believed that it was a [...] "great mistake" [...] to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain, and Higgins wrote in The Benn Inheritance that Benn was [...] "a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx". Later in his life, Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness, as well as various ethical principles of Nonconformism. [...] "I've never thought we can understand the world we lived in unless <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> the history of the church", Benn said to the Catholic Herald. [...] "All political freedoms were won, first of all, through religious freedom. Some of the arguments about the control of the media today, which are very big arguments, are the arguments that would have been fought in the religious wars. You have the satellites coming in now – well, it is the multinational church all over again. That's why Mrs Thatcher pulled Britain out of UNESCO: she was not prepared, any more than Ronald Reagan was, to be part of an organisation that talked about a New World Information Order, people speaking to each other without the help of Murdoch or Maxwell." [...] According to Peter Wilby in the New Statesman, Benn [...] "decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus". Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older, he was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity, radicalism and socialism. Wilby also wrote in The Guardian that although former Chancellor Stafford Cripps described Benn as [...] "as keen a Christian as I am myself", Benn wrote in 2005 that he was [...] "a Christian agnostic" [...] who believed [...] "in Jesus the prophet, not Christ the king", specifically rejecting the label of [...] "humanist".|$|E

[...] "I thought at last I had found the ideal man... had lost a son of his own and I felt <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> each other. Above all, we had the same artistic conceptions." [...] Rossellini had become violent, volatile and possessive, and they argued constantly about films or out of jealousy. [...] "In fits of rage they threw crockery at each other."

[...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E

As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was {{said in the}} presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
