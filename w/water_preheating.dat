30|$|DWI is a {{quantitative}} imaging technique {{that allows the}} measurement of thermally driven molecular movement of water, also known as Brownian motion. While water molecules move freely in pure water, {{the magnitude of the}} range of motion in body tissues depends on its composition, i.e., cell density and extracellular matrix, and so reflects the characteristics of tissue types (reviewed in [12]). At a steady state, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a measure for DWI is approximately 3.0  mm 2 /s for pure <b>water</b> <b>preheated</b> to 37  °C [13]. Stejskal and Tanner first introduced a way for diffusion-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 1965 [14] by adding two diffusion gradients to a common MRI sequence, such as spin-echo (SE) or echo-planar-imaging (EPI), to measure the signal attenuation caused by the motion of a water molecule. For quantitative analysis, DWI enables the calculation of the ADC, which is mainly dependent on the combination of diffusion weighting factors, the so-called b values. However, the optimal magnitude and amount of b values remain controversial as the available hardware [15], the organ of interest [16 – 18], and the method of data analysis [19] play a major role for this technique.|$|R

Waste heat {{can also be used to}} generate cooling energy via technologies such as the absorption chiller. During the summer season and in tropical countries, space cooling in buildings typically consumes up to 50 % of the total energy consumption. Further recovery of waste heat to generate cooling can result in huge energy savings and emission reduction. This paper presents a new Total Site Energy Integration concept that integrates not only heat and power, but also cooling. The waste heat technology considered for cooling generation are Absorption Chiller (AC) and Electric Compression Chiller (EC). As there is actually an economic trade-off between amounts of chilled water generated, cooling water and power consumed, the new framework has been proposed to guide users in selecting the most economical waste heat-to-cooling technology for Industrial Clusters and LIES.

40|$|The European {{electric}} power industry has undergone considerable changes {{over the past}} two decades as a result of more stringent laws concerning environmental protection along with the deregulation and liberalization of the {{electric power}} market. However, the pressure to deliver solutions in regard to the issue of climate change has increased dramatically in the last few years and has given rise to the possibility that future natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) plants will also be subject to CO 2 capture requirements. At the same time, the interest in combined cycles with their high efficiency, low capital costs, and complexity has grown as a consequence of addressing new challenges posed by the need to operate according to market demand in order to be economically viable. Considering that these challenges will also be imposed on new natural gas-fired power plants in the foreseeable future, this study presents a new process concept for natural gas combined cycle power plants with CO 2 capture. The simulation tool IPSEpro is used to model a 400 MW single-pressure NGCC with post-combustion CO 2 capture using an amine-based absorption process with monoethanolamine. To improve the costs of capture, the gas turbine GE 109 FB is utilizing exhaust gas recirculation, thereby, increasing the CO 2 content in the gas turbine working fluid to almost double that of conventional operating gas turbines. In addition, the concept advantageously uses approximately 20 % less steam for solvent regeneration by utilizing preheated water extracted from heat recovery steam generator. The further recovery of heat from exhaust gases for <b>water</b> <b>preheating</b> by use of an increased economizer flow results in an outlet stack temperature comparable to those achieved in combined cycle plants with multiple-pressure levels. As a result, overall power plant efficiency as high as that achieved for a triple-pressure reheated NGCC with corresponding CO 2 removal facility is attained. The concept, thus, provides a more cost-efficient option to triple-pressure combined cycles since the number of heat exchangers, boilers, etc., is reduced considerably...|$|E

40|$|The YWCA Family Village at Issaquah, Net Zero Energy Approach Project {{provides}} a compelling model {{for how the}} nation can seriously respond to the critical need for affordable housing while advancing environmental standards and reducing economic inequities. Affordable housing developments for vulnerable {{members of the community}} and in today's workforce cannot overlook issues, such as climate impact, energy security and water conservation. This project's advanced building design was based on the goal of creating a 100 year building that could achieve net zero energy usage if funding had been available to support the final pieces of energy generation. The team worked closely with community stakeholders to ensure the baseline components of high quality and efficient building envelopes along with efficient systems were in place to set the stage for future incorporation of energy generating systems such as solar panels. As built, these 146 homes, large child care center and community services areas are proving the value of investing upfront for the benefit of future generations by reducing ongoing utility and maintenance costs with an eye toward environmental stewardship and community/resident education. The DOE award helped fund two critical energy conservation features for the YWCA Family Village at Issaquah campus: 1) super-insulated roof assembly with a continuous air barrier and 2) domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>preheat</b> system. The roof system at the YWCA Family Village at Issaquah project was built to include 6 " of Polyiso rigid insulation (R- 38) on top of the roof sheathing to provide a super-insulated roof in line with the other green features of the project. Placing the rigid insulation on top of the roof sheathing allows the building to have a continuous layer of insulation and {{provides a}} continuous air barrier. The domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>preheat</b> system includes flat panel arrays on roofs of the buildings that heat the water using solar power, which reduces the amount of heating needed from the gas-fired boilers. The flat-plate panels {{on the roof of the}} building heats the water using solar power. A heat exchanger transfers heat from water warmed by the panels to potable water for the units. The warmed potable water mixes with the tap water supply to create hot water for the buildings. This boost of water warmed by the solar panels reduces the heating costs for eh project by reducing the need to heat the water via gas-fired boilers. Both of these energy upgrades were chosen because they significantly improve the energy efficiency for the life of the building and are reducing monthly utility costs for both the residents and the owners. Since the owner is a not-for-profit dedicated to long-term ownership and serving households with very-low and low-incomes, the costs savings will ultimately benefit current and future residents as the dollars saved will either be realized directly by the resident or be invested in the project. Technically, the design of these systems is easily understood and the principles could be applied to other projects. The incremental costs depend largely on the existing market rate of the components-none of which are considered "cutting edge" so a market does currently exist...|$|R
