In a 2007 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, only 27% of American Muslims believed that homosexuality should be accepted. In a 2011 poll, that rose to 39%. In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society clearly outnumber those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> should be discouraged (52% versus 33%).|$|E

[...] The origin of the Korean alphabet is, in fact, not a simple matter at all. Those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "based" [...] in 'phags-pa are partly right; those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "based" [...] on abstract drawings of articulatory organs are partly right. [...] Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: [...] "According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from the Mongol 'phags-pa script" [...] phags-pa contributed none of the things that make this script perhaps the most remarkable in the world.|$|E

[...] In the 2nd century, 5,500 Iazyges were transported there as auxiliaries during the Marcomannic Wars.

2500|$|The Internet {{has been}} {{extensively}} used by patient groups to obtain and disseminate information on CCSVI. People with MS often read extensively about the CCSVI theory and its development on Internet sites, and a search for [...] "liberation procedure" [...] in Google as of August 2010 yielded more than 2.5 million hits. The Internet has also been used to advertise places where stenting for CCSVI is performed, and to more generally disseminate all the information on CCSVI. Social media have served patient groups {{in their attempt to}} pressure official bodies to make decisions favoring funding of clinical trials, or the public coverage of stenting and venoplasty as treatments of MS. Likewise, social media have been accused of creating a division between CCSVI supporters and those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> does not work. Indeed, they have been repeatedly used by advocates of the CCSVI theory to attack those who were more critical or cautious, most commonly with accusations of being tainted due to commercial relationships with pharmaceutical companies.|$|E

2500|$|Ramadan denies {{contacts}} with terrorists or other Islamic fundamentalists and {{the charges of}} anti-Semitism and double talk, attributing the charges to misinterpretation and an unfamiliarity with his writings. He stated: [...] "I have often been accused of this 'double discourse', and to those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> I say – bring the evidence. I am quite clear in what I say. The problem is that many people don't want to hear it, particularly in the media. Most of the stories about me are completely untrue: journalists simply repeat black propaganda from the internet without any corroboration, and it just confirms {{what they want to}} believe. Words are used out of context. There is double-talk, yes, but there is also double-hearing. That is what I want to challenge." [...] In answer to criticism of his response to 11 September, Ramadan replied that two days after the attacks he had published an open letter, exhorting Muslims to condemn the attacks and the attackers, and not to [...] "hide behind conspiracy theories." [...] and that less than two weeks after the attacks he had stated that [...] "The probability [...] is large, but some questions remain unanswered. ...

60|$|This I {{resolve to}} {{myself in the}} affirmative: and then another {{question}} arises:--Whether this House stands firm upon its ancient foundations, and is not, by time and accidents, so declined from its perpendicular as to want {{the hand of the}} wise and experienced architects of the day to set it upright again, and to prop and buttress it up for duration;--whether it continues true to the principles upon which it has hitherto stood;--whether this be de facto the constitution of the House of Commons, as it has been since the time that the House of Commons has without dispute become a necessary and an efficient part of the British Constitution. To ask whether a thing which has always been the same stands to its usual principle {{seems to me to be}} perfectly absurd: for how do you know the principles, but from the construction? and if that remains the same, the principles remain the same. It is true that to say your Constitution is what it has been is no sufficient defence for those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is a bad constitution.

6000|$|My Lords,--The {{question}} before the House {{has been so}} frequently, fully, and ably discussed, and never perhaps more ably than on this night, {{that it would be}} difficult to adduce new arguments for or against it. But with each discussion difficulties have been removed, objections have been canvassed and refuted, and some of the former opponents of Catholic emancipation have at length conceded to the expediency of relieving the petitioners. In conceding thus much, however, a new objection is started; it is not the time, say they, or it is an improper time, or there is time enough yet. In some degree I concur with those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is not the time exactly; that time is past; better had it been for the country that the Catholics possessed at this moment their proportion of our privileges, that their nobles held their due weight in our councils, than that we should be assembled to discuss their claims.

Now, I propose to try {{to show that the}} whole of this--issue and evidence--is from beginning to end the sheerest deception. The issue, as he presents it, is in these words: [...] "But there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the latter river, we passed the Texas line and invaded the territory of Mexico." [...] Now this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative. The main deception of it is that it assumes as true that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary; and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possibly the boundary is somewhere between the two, and not actually at either. A further deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue would exclude. A true issue made by the President would be about as follows: [...] "I say the soil was ours, on which the first blood was shed; there are those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was not." ...|$|E
