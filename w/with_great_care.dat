5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must be handled <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care,</b> with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride {{is used in the}} United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care</b> and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E

5|$|Solimán: Solimán {{is first}} {{introduced}} in the text as the slave who receives the fortune of massaging the body of Pauline and also lavishing her beauty <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care.</b> He begins to conduct voodoo rituals with Pauline {{for the sake of}} Leclerc, who has contracted yellow fever. Following the demise of Henri Christophe, Solimán ends up in Europe, where he enjoys the summers. He is given food and drink freely and his appearance is the subject of much attention. He regales exaggerated and embellished tales of his past and even makes an appearance at theatre performances. He later comes across a marble statue of Pauline and this, coupled with memories of the night that witnessed the demise of Henri Christophe, causes him to fall into madness, flee, and eventually succumb to malaria.|$|E
5|$|The Warren Family Mortuary Chapel is a stone chapel {{built on}} a knoll {{near the center of}} the cemetery. It was {{designed}} by Henry Dudley of New York City and built in 1860 in the English country Gothic style, complete with a nave and transept floor plan. A tower was added in 1883, <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care</b> placed on finding building material that matched the earlier structure. The Chapel contains stained glass windows above the altar designed by artist Robert Walter Weir. Former member of the United States House of Representatives Joseph Mabbett Warren (1813–1896) is interred in the chapel.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care.</b> The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of ADP {{systems in}} {{medicine}} frequently becomes mired in problems of tenuous cost measurement, of proving illusory cost savings, of false precision, and of dubious discounting methods, while giving only superficial treatment to non-dollar benefits.

25|$|Museum collections, {{especially}} those of the natural history variety, often contain osteological specimens derived from humans. These can include individual bones, bone fragments, entire skeletons, and teeth from both ancient and contemporary sources. Reconstruction of bone fragments should be conducted <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care</b> and consideration. Due to the porous nature of bones, few adhering substances {{can be used on}} bone with an adequate level of reversibility, which is a key component of all conservation treatments.|$|E
50|$|According {{to popular}} belief, during the Communist era, {{in the plant}} where Dacias were made, there were two {{assembly}} lines: one line producing Dacias intended for sale in Romania and the other line producing the same car (albeit from superior parts, and assembled <b>with</b> <b>greater</b> <b>care)</b> for export. Romanians living near the border would commonly purchase their Dacia in neighbouring countries expecting {{a higher level of}} quality.|$|R

25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not know Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still expected Griffin to be able to intercept them. Griffin's force moved in line of battle <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care</b> because they thought they might strike the Confederate force from White Oak Road while moving toward the Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known {{depiction}} is on {{the town}} seal from 1311. A number of changes to the coat of arms followed. These corresponded to structural alterations made to the buildings and the bridge that were replicated <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care</b> to detail, {{as can be seen}} on the depiction to the left. With time multiple versions came into simultaneous use. In 1964 the town council (Stadtrat) decided to standardize the coat. One year later the emblem received its modern form.|$|E
25|$|Riemenschneider's {{early success}} as a {{sculptor}} {{was due to the}} plasticity of his works, <b>with</b> <b>great</b> <b>care</b> being taken of modeling the folds of garments. This way of sculpting the garments as well as the typical oval faces and almond-shaped eyes were modelled on art from the Upper Rhine region of the 1470s, implying that Riemenschneider may have learned his trade either there or at Ulm. Later works lost some of the volume of the early sculptures, allowing a more efficient production.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with all}} European tribunals of the time, torture was employed.

Historian Henry Kamen contends that some [...] "popular" [...] {{accounts}} of the inquisition (those that describe scenes of uncontrolled sadistic torture) are not based in truth. Kamen argues that torture was only ever used to elicit information or a confession, not for punitive reasons.|$|R
