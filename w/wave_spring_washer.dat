5000|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>spring</b> - {{the name}} applies to a {{multitude}} of <b>wave</b> shaped <b>springs,</b> <b>washers</b> and expanders, including linear springs, {{all of which are}} generally made with flat wire or discs which are marcelled according to industrial terms, usually by die-stamping, into a wavy regular pattern resulting in curvilinear lobes.

Types include : wave <b>washer,</b> single turn <b>wave</b> <b>spring,</b> multi-turn <b>wave</b> <b>spring,</b> linear <b>wave</b> <b>spring,</b> marcel expander, interlaced <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> and nested <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> amongst others.|$|R

40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} {{is paid for}} {{on the basis of}} the marginal costs of generation, and supply is paid for at the marginal cost at the supply point. In the case where power lines form a loop and there is a limit on a line within the loop, the electrical requirements of providing supply force a reallocation of generation and a step change in the marginal costs. This is known as the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect. In some cases the cost of supply can reach extreme levels. Transpower and its customers are interested in obtaining a better understanding of these events. Simplified equations determining {{power generation}} and pricing are derived. So-lutions for the supply costs are obtained for several simple cases. Numerical exam-ples and a graphical representation demonstrate the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect and how a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> responds to changes. Several possible changes that reduce the cost of supply are demonstrated. When a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> comes active the marginal prices make a step change. This means that power costs can be be highly sensitive to the values of all the network parameters that affect the power flow in the power loop. Detecting when a large <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> is likely to occur is of considerable interest. Suggestions on how this could be done are made. 1...|$|R

Advantages and disadvantages of the wave construction {{in comparison to the}} traditional helical shape are presented and discussed by means of dimensionless functions.

The wave geometry is also superior in purely mechanical terms to the helical counterpart when axial space is at a premium.

Of course, this will also reduce the part weight and raw material cost of every <b>spring</b> produced. <b>Wave</b> <b>springs</b> operate as load bearing devices. They take up play and compensate for dimensional variations within assemblies. A virtually unlimited range of forces can be produced whereby loads build either gradually or abruptly to reach a predetermined working height. This establishes a precise spring rate in which load is proportional to deflection. Functional requirements are necessary for both dynamic and static spring applications. Special performance characteristics are individually built into each spring to satisfy a variety of precise operating conditions. Typically, a <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> will occupy an externally small area for the amount of work it performs. The use of this product is demanded, but not limited to tight axial and radial space constraints. In this paper, a three dimensional finite element (FE) model for shock absorber spring is proposed.
