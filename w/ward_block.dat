500|$|Sheriff Hill {{was once}} {{the site of a}} lunatic asylum, which was opened in the 1830s and {{situated}} on Sour Milk Hill Lane. Sheriff Hill Lunatic Asylum tended 86 patients in 1844 and continued to attract admissions until its closure in 1860. Soon after, work began on a 38–bed isolation hospital at what is today Queen Elizabeth Avenue. The first building was completed in 1878 and others were added later. The [...] site was enclosed by a large stone wall tipped with barbed wire and broken glass, and by 1903 the hospital comprised a main block with an administrative building in the centre with a <b>ward</b> <b>block</b> on each side, another three-ward block, a porter's lodge, a steam disinfecting building, a laundry and a mortuary. The hospital had a [...] maximum capacity of 78 patients, who were tended by two resident doctors and 10 nurses.|$|E

50|$|Control of the Northern Convalescent Fever Hospital was {{transferred}} to London County Council in 1930, and the site served as an emergency bed service hospital during World War II. In 1938, four additional single storey <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> {{were added to the}} Enfield Isolation Hospital.|$|R
50|$|Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse, Plymouth (1758) The {{hospital}} housed 1200 {{patients in}} sixty wards, its ten <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> being arranged around a courtyard {{with a central}} block containing the chapel, dispensary and staff housing. The hospital closed in 1995 {{and is now a}} gated residential complex called Millfields.|$|R

50|$|In early 2014 a new $160 million eight-storey <b>ward</b> <b>block</b> opened, housing 3 {{levels of}} cancer {{services}} and will also accommodate 70 additional inpatient beds. A helipad opened in early 2015 to enable better transport.|$|E
50|$|C Block, {{one of the}} {{original}} <b>ward</b> <b>blocks,</b> is not immediately recognisable as a nineteenth century building, as the two storeyed verandahs surrounding the building have been infilled with a s brick envelope through which aluminium framed openings are punched. The complex hipped roof of {{the original}} structure is evident above these verandahs and this retains an early corrugated iron cladding.|$|R
50|$|The former {{hospital}} {{estate was}} {{sold by the}} Department of Health to M J Gleeson in 1995, with {{development of a new}} village commencing shortly afterwards. The Administration block, chapel, convalescent villas and some <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> have been converted into apartments. The Water Tower was sold on by Gleeson to a certain company trading as Falcon, enabling structural redevelopment into apartments.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} chapel {{was chosen}} as the site on which to build the new community's swimming pool. Notwithstanding this history, little remains at all apart from a minority of converted buildings. The central area comprising the original administration building, the water tower, two <b>ward</b> <b>blocks,</b> and four smaller detached buildings now form the Netherne on the Hill Conservation area, and are locally listed.|$|R
50|$|Major {{expansion}} {{took place}} at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital in the late 1960s with the construction of a ten-storey maternity block, opened by the Queen Mother http://www.edp24.co.uk/QueenMother/asp/Norfolk.asp in 1968. A new main <b>ward</b> <b>block,</b> diagnostic and treatment area, and a teaching centre were all built in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Shafston house {{stands on}} a large site which slopes down to the Brisbane river at Kangaroo Point. Buildings include the {{original}} house and its kitchen (1851), the former <b>ward</b> <b>block</b> (1919), the former orderlies' accommodation (1928), the former postal depot (1936), a recent garage and a very recent two-storeyed adjacent to the kitchen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{place which}} functioned as the Queensland Police College until 2012 at Chelmer, was {{established}} [...] {{as a private}} residence, with additions {{in the form of}} staff quarters and a <b>ward</b> <b>block</b> constructed between 1941 and 1942 when the house was converted into a convalescent hospital for the Australian Red Cross Society.|$|E
50|$|In November, 2016, {{the final}} Laboratory Staff at Chestnut Villa moved out (all Laboratory Staff and Services re-located within the Grounds of Colchester General Hospital). This {{marked the end}} of Medical-related use of the last of the {{original}} Hospital <b>Ward</b> <b>Blocks.</b> Currently Severalls House (the Medical Superintendents' Residence) is the only original Building still owned and in use by NEPFT (the local Mental Health Trust).|$|R
50|$|Set within {{landscaped}} gardens for {{the comfort}} of patients and visitors, the hospital has remained fully equipped with medical facilities and infrastructure since its opening. There are four <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> providing 806 beds across 17 wards. Other basic necessities including telephones, ATMs and vending machines along with many others are within easy reach in the hospital. There are also a cafeteria, mosque and waiting rooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} was first built in 1889 {{as an extension}} to the Birmingham Union Workhouse (whose building, though derelict, is still extant). It originally comprised a single corridor stretching {{for a quarter of}} a mile with nine Nightingale <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> radiating from it along its length. The original design was by an architect called W. H. Ward and was designed around a configuration recommended by Florence Nightingale.|$|R
50|$|He was {{president}} of the St Thomas' Hospital in London which was then located in the Borough. He employed Thomas Cartwright to rebuild the hospital and St Thomas Church nearby. A statue of Clayton now stands at the North Entrance to <b>Ward</b> <b>Block</b> of North Wing at St Thomas' Hospital and is Grade I listed.|$|E
50|$|The former <b>Ward</b> <b>Block</b> {{built in}} 1919 in a {{pavilion}} form demonstrates the plan typical of smaller hospitals {{of the time}} providing two wards separated by smaller rooms and is typical in its lightweight timber construction. The siting to catch breezes and enhance airflow characterises health practices that were considered important at the time.|$|E
50|$|Doncaster Royal Infirmary started {{life as the}} Doncaster Dispensary on French Gate (now Greyfriars Road) in 1792. The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the first purpose-built hospital in Doncaster, St James' Hospital, was laid in 1852. It was demolished in 1963 {{to make way for}} town improvements. An infirmary was opened in 1867 as the Doncaster General Infirmary and Dispensary. Within 20 years, the hospital was too small and unsuitable for the town's needs and developments in medicine. A three-day fund-raising bazaar was opened by HRH Princess Christian, and this connection led to Home Office approval for the institution to be known as Doncaster Royal Infirmary and Dispensary. Plans for another new hospital came to fruition in 1930, when the first part on Thorne Road (now the West <b>Ward</b> <b>Block)</b> opened to patients. The East <b>Ward</b> <b>Block</b> opened in 1968, the Women's Hospital in 1969, and the Children's Hospital in 1989.|$|E
50|$|Later in the 1960s, it was announceed {{that the}} Queen Alexandra {{would become a}} {{district}} general hospital, complete with an Accident and Emergency department. This involved the construction of several new buildings, which began in 1968 with an eye department, a training school for nurses and two three-storey blocks for staff accommodation. A further two accommodation blocks, this time nine storeys high, were added later, being completed in 1976. Only two of the planned three new <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> were built.|$|R
50|$|Ruchill Hospital was {{eventually}} closed in 1998, {{after the opening}} of the Brownlee Centre for Infectious and Communicable Diseases at Gartnavel General Hospital. The Ruchill Hospital site was sold by the NHS to Scottish Enterprise in July 1999 and 12 of the 16 original <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> and other outbuildings on the site were demolished. The remaining listed buildings currently remain derelict awaiting redevelopment, with emergency demolition of the Administration block and part of the Kitchen block occurring in 2007 due to structural deterioration.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{vacation}} {{of the hospital}} buildings, the site was sold to developer Linden Homes and following planning consultation, demolition and conversion work began in 2010 to turn the site into a carbon-neutral community called Graylingwell Park. As of December 2012 the central block (with {{the exception of the}} administration block and water tower) had been demolished and the <b>ward</b> <b>blocks</b> were being readied for conversion to apartments. The chapel had been repurposed by a religious group while the isolation hospital, Graylingwell Farmhouse and Richmond Villa remained derelict.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} other {{structures}} have been erected in the grounds, the most significant {{of which is the}} large <b>ward</b> <b>block</b> constructed in 1919. This is a single-storey low-set timber building on stumps. The ward was designed as open-sided, but has since been excavated under to allow for the construction of new accommodation, enclosed and extended and substantial changes made to the immediate setting.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{required a}} major refurbishment {{to bring it}} up to modern standards. As the first phase of a modernisation programme, a new <b>ward</b> <b>block</b> and day procedures unit was built {{at the rear of the}} present block, at a cost of £15 million. This cost was fully met by a contribution from the charitable funds of the YP Trustees, who have long association with the Mater.|$|E
50|$|In 1988 Shafston House was leased to a Brisbane {{entrepreneur}} {{under two}} consecutive ninety-nine year leases. After failing to gain local government approval {{for use of}} the property as a restaurant and function venue, the house was refurbished as a residence. The 1919 laundry was demolished and a new garage constructed adjacent to the early kitchen building. The <b>ward</b> <b>block</b> was refurbished, additional bathrooms installed in the house and changes were made to landscaping.|$|E
50|$|Cheddleton Asylum {{was laid}} out in the chevron or echelon style on a south facing plateau. At the apex of the echelon was the {{administration}} building which was flanked on either side by four <b>ward</b> <b>blocks.</b> The <b>wards</b> (infirmary, recent, acute, and epileptic) and within the echelon the quiet and working patients' ward. Those wards to the right or east housed male patients whilst females lived on the west side - there were two separate keys for each side of the building, to ensure that patients never mixed.|$|R
50|$|Since {{roll out}} was {{completed}} in August 2007, ZEPRS {{has been used by}} 24 public obstetrics clinics, as well as six <b>wards</b> (<b>blocks</b> A-D, adult ARV ward, and pediatric ARV ward) within the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. The ZEPRS patient record database has been used since February 2006 for routine health surveillance, monitoring, and supervision of health care. A 2006 study cited the use of a ZEPRS-based patient record system as one of four key factors in the successful rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy at primary care sites in Zambia.|$|R
