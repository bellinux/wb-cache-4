5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E

25|$|Melliferous plants offer nectar to {{bees and}} other insects to {{encourage}} them to carry pollen from the flowers of one plant to others thereby ensuring pollination.A number of legume species are good nectar providers such as alfalfa, <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> sweet clover and various Prosopis species. Many plants in the Fabaceae family are an important source of pollen for the bumblebee species Bombus hortorum. This bee species is especially fond of one species in particular; Trifolium pratense, also known as red clover, is a popular food source in the diet of Bombus hortorum.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, after Ehart {{returned}} from England (where {{he had gone}} to look for other musicians), he and Hope once again re-formed <b>White</b> <b>Clover</b> with Robby Steinhardt (vocals, violin, viola, cello), Steve Walsh (vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, percussion) and Rich Williams (guitars). In early 1973 they recruited Livgren from the second Kansas group, which then folded. Eventually they received a recording contract with Don Kirshner's eponymous label, after Kirshner's assistant, Wally Gold, heard one of their demo tapes and came out to check out the band at one of their local gigs in March 1973. After signing with Kirshner, the group decided to adopt the Kansas name.|$|E

25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{in what would}} be Newburgh Township were David Bryant and his son, Whitman, who arrived in June 1797. East of the Portage Escarpment, they found dense forests of American sycamore, beech, black walnut, eastern hemlock, eastern redcedar, northern red oak, Ohio buckeye, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and white oak. West of the escarpment were American elm, ash, beech, and black cherry. In some places, settlers would have seen artificial meadows, created by Native Americans using controlled fire. On the flats which formed {{the valley of the}} Cuyahoga River bluegrass, <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> and wild rye grew in profusion. American bison, eastern elk, and the extremely plentiful white-tailed deer were the most common game animals inhabiting the area. Canada geese, ducks, grouse, passenger pigeon, quail, and wild turkey were the most common game fowl.|$|E
25|$|European earwigs {{spend the}} day time in cool, dark, {{inaccessible}} places such as flowers, fruits, and wood crevices. Active primarily at night, they seek out food ranging from plant matter to small insects. Though they are omnivorous, they are considered scavengers rather than predators. Often they consume plant matter, though they have also been known to feed on aphids, spiders, insect eggs, and dead plants and insects, among other things. Their favorite plants include the common crucifer Sisymbrium officinale, the <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> Trifolium repens, and the dahlia Dahlia variabilis. They also like to feed on molasses, {{as well as on}} nonvascular plants, lichens and algae. They prefer meat or sugar to natural plant material even though plants are a major natural food source. European earwigs prefer aphids to plant material such as leaves and fruit slices of apple, cherry and pear. Adults eat more insects than do nymphs.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} 30 dairy cows each, to study the preference for fresh (Experiment 1) and ensiled (Experiment 2) ryegrass, <b>white</b> and red <b>clover.</b> Both experiments consisted of three choice diets with <b>white</b> or red <b>clover</b> or both, offered with ryegrass, and two diets with ryegrass mixed with <b>white</b> or red <b>clover</b> (40 % clover). Cows consumed diets with 37. 7 % fresh white and 45. 9 % red clover, and no preference was observed when the cows were offered all three forages. By contrast, cows preferred <b>white</b> and red <b>clover</b> silage (73. 0 and 69. 2 %, respectively) over ryegrass silage (of lower nutritive quality). When offered three forages, cows preferred white (59. 8 %) over red clover (17. 5 %) and ryegrass (22. 7 %). Choice diets resulted in diets similar (fresh forages) or higher in nutrient content and digestibility (silages). Treatments did not affect feed intake and performance. Choices compared to mixed diets with red clover silage were preferable regarding the fatty acid composition of the milk fat. Obviously, only large differences in nutrient and energy concentration facilitate preferences for clovers over ryegrass, which could, depending on clover type, be beneficial {{in terms of the}} milk's fatty acid composition...|$|R

40|$|In 2008 and 2009, studies made {{contents}} of {{cadmium and lead}} in the soil and their uptake by non-traditional plants were studied in a small-plot trial. At the same time also the effect of bio-algeen preparations on phytoextraction of heavy metals by these plants was investigated. Experimental plots were established on the reclaimed land after closing down mining operations {{in the town of}} Å½aclÃ©Å™ (North-East Bohemia) where a layer of sewage sludge from a wastewater treatment plant 0. 6 â€“ 0. 8 [*]m thick was subsequently applied. The locality is situated in the altitude of 612 [*]m, its average annual temperature is about 6. 8 [*]Â°C and the mean annual precipitations are 857 [*]mm.

The average concentrations of lead and cadmium were 180 [*]mgâ€Š. â€Škgâˆ’ 1 and 6. 89 [*]mgâ€Š. â€Škgâˆ’ 1, respectively. The experiment had two variants: Variant 1 â€“ sewage sludge without any other substances, and Variant 2 â€“ sewage sludge + bio-algeen preparations (B. A. S- 90 or B. A. Root Concentrate). To find the most suitable plant species for the phytoextraction of cadmium and lead, the following non-traditional plants were cultivated in both variants: fodder mallow (Malva verticillata L.), rye (Secale cereale L. var. multicaule METZG. ex ALEF.) and <b>white</b> sweet <b>clover</b> (Melilotus alba MEDIC.). The highest accumulation of cadmium and lead in the aboveground biomass was found out in rye, viz 14. 89 [*]mgâ€Š. â€Škgâˆ’ 1 [*]DM and 14. 89 [*]mgâ€Š. â€Škgâˆ’ 1 [*]DM of Cd and Pb, respectively., As compared with other plants under study, <b>white</b> sweet <b>clover</b> exhibited the significantly lowest capability to extract both heavy metals from soil (viz 0. 22 and 3. 20 [*]mgâ€Š. â€Škgâˆ’ 1 [*]DM of Cd and Pb, respectively).
