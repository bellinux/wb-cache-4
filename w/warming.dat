5|$|First Light is a {{young adult}} science fiction and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, first {{published}} in 2007. The novel follows Peter, who is in Greenland {{with his father and}} mother for research on global <b>warming,</b> and Thea, who lives in Gracehope, an underground colony located below Greenland. First Light explains how global <b>warming</b> is melting Gracehope and Peter and Thea's attempt to persuade the people to leave. The novel addresses the effects of global <b>warming</b> as a theme.|$|E
5|$|Global <b>warming,</b> also {{referred}} to as climate change, is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is <b>warming.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>warm</b> {{compress}} is {{a method}} of applying heat to the body. It can either be dry and <b>warm</b> or wet and <b>warm.</b> A wet and <b>warm</b> compress is often created by taking a washcloth and wetting it with <b>warm</b> water.|$|R
500|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed when a cold front overtakes a <b>warm</b> front, and usually forms around mature low-pressure areas. The cold and <b>warm</b> fronts curve naturally poleward into {{the point of}} occlusion, which {{is also known as}} the triple point. [...] It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either <b>warm</b> or cold. [...] In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the <b>warm</b> front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the <b>warm</b> front and plows under both air masses. [...] In a <b>warm</b> occlusion, the air mass overtaking the <b>warm</b> front is <b>warmer</b> than the cold air ahead of the <b>warm</b> front and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the <b>warm</b> air.|$|R

5|$|Some of Antarctica {{has been}} <b>warming</b> up; {{particularly}} strong <b>warming</b> {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this <b>warming</b> is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is <b>warming</b> as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface <b>warming</b> in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric <b>warming</b> there.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} that global <b>warming</b> is unproven or that <b>warming</b> will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses {{the possibility of the}} collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global <b>warming.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>warm</b> {{front is}} also {{defined as the}} {{transition}} zone where a <b>warmer</b> air mass is replacing a cooler air mass. <b>Warm</b> fronts generally move from southwest to northeast. If the <b>warmer</b> air originates over the ocean, {{it is not only}} <b>warmer</b> but also more moist than the air ahead of it.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-16 mm. The forewings are sepia, with <b>warm</b> buff {{points on}} the costa and two <b>warm</b> buff patches obliquely on {{the lower half of}} the wing, one antemedially and the other just before the postmedial line. There is a <b>warm</b> buff spot between the two. The postmedial fascia consists of a fine, wavy, <b>warm</b> buff line from the costa to vein 2. The hindwings are sepia with a <b>warm</b> buff patch at the base. The medial fascia is oblique, waved and <b>warm</b> buff and the postmedial fascia is oblique and <b>warm</b> buff.|$|R

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens about global <b>warming</b> via a comprehensive slide show that, {{by his own}} estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global <b>warming,</b> which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their <b>warming</b> effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global <b>warming.</b> Scientists have speculated that global <b>warming</b> could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A <b>warm</b> up is {{undertaken}} before exercise {{to prepare the}} body for performance, reduce injury and improve performance[1]. Despite evidence suggesting that low intensity static-based <b>warm</b> ups are detrimental to performance[2] they are often included in pre-game <b>warm</b> up routines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a dynamic-based <b>warm</b> up of shorter duration and higher intensity (DSH) was more effective at preparing elite rugby league players for performance than a <b>warm</b> up that included combined static and dynamic activities of longer duration and lower intensity (Cll). It was hypothesised that the DSH <b>warm</b> up would be superior to the Cll <b>warm</b> up with respect to physical performance measures and player perceptions of readiness to perform. Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects with testing approved by the JCU research Ethics committee. Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the DSH and Cll <b>warm</b> up routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each <b>warm</b> up, players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint. Player and coach perceptions of the <b>warm</b> ups and readiness to play or train were determined by questionnaires and interviews. Paired samples T -tests were used to identify significant differences between <b>warm</b> ups (p < 0. 05). Results: Players reported no significant differences between <b>warm</b> ups for preparedness to perform vertical jump (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 0, P = 0. 25) or 40 m sprint (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 8 vs Cll: 6. 3 ± 1. 7, P = 0. 917). Senior players and coaching staff rated the DSH <b>warm</b> up as significantly better than the Cll <b>warm</b> up (DSH: 7. 6 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 1, P = 0. 019) after using the DSH <b>warm</b> up in three preseason trial games. ConclusionlDiscussion: The dynamic <b>warm</b> up resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint times and higher perception of readiness to perform in games compared to the combined <b>warm</b> up. The vertical jump result of no difference between <b>warm</b> ups contrasted available research[3] however this may be due to the dynamic component of the Cll <b>warm</b> up mitigating the detrimental effects of the static component[4]. The players' higher rating of the DSH <b>warm</b> up indicate that the DSH <b>warm</b> up should be used in preference to the Cll <b>warm</b> up as it elicits enhanced sprint performance and psychological preparedness to compete...|$|R
50|$|The <b>warm</b> {{sector is}} the area of <b>warmer</b> air behind a <b>warm</b> front, usually between the <b>warm</b> and cold fronts in a depression. Temperatures are often <b>warmer</b> than they are before the <b>warm</b> front or after the cold front. Cloud types can be mixed, but usually consist of stratocumulus, which can range to being broken to {{covering}} the entire sky depending on distance from the centre of low pressure.

5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global <b>warming</b> and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global <b>warming</b> and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global <b>warming</b> by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|It has {{interfered}} with the hydrological cycle by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a cooling effect that may have partially counteracted the effect of greenhouse gases on global <b>warming.</b>|$|E
