500|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its {{splitting}} of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] rolls, saying the proposed system had [...] "racialist" [...] connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a [...] "debased franchise". [...] "Our policy in the past has always been that we would have a government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> black or <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> white," [...] he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the [...] "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field's conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.|$|E

500|$|The Best of Both Worlds Tour was financially {{successful}} {{and was able}} to sell an abundance of shows throughout the United States in record times. The December6,2007 concert at the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan sold out within eight minutes, the third-fastest sell-out in the arena's history. Numerous other concerts, such as the one held on December1,2007 at the Sprint Center in North Little Rock, Arkansas and December11,2007 at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio, sold out within approximately twelve and fifteen minutes, respectively. [...] "Absolutely every show sold out within the same amount of time. <b>Whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in Moline or Omaha or New York or Los Angeles, it sold out in minutes", stated Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live. In total, the Best of Both Worlds Tour had a total attendance of approximately one million people and grossed over US $54million, according to Billboard Boxscore, becoming the highest-grossing concert tour for a new act in 2007 and 2008. The record was recognized with the award for Breakthrough Act at the 2008 Billboard Touring Awards.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} been {{perceived}} very positively {{in the years}} following its initial release. [...] GameDaily named it alongside the other Game Boy Final Fantasy titles as definitive games for the system, describing it as providing [...] "hours of role-playing excitement, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> waiting in a dentist's office or on the way to Grandma's house." [...] The sentiment was shared by gaming magazine Pocket Games, which ranked the titles together 8th out of the Top 50 games for the Game Boy, stating [...] "every game in the series is a sprawling classic with well written scripts and solid characters." [...] Kotaku praised the original release of the game as a [...] "really great action-RPG". 1UP.com called the game ambitious for its time, writing that it represented an evolution of the overhead perspective action adventure genre. They also rated the game as [...] "Worth It!" [...] in terms of buying and enjoying the original game in 2007, and noted it as the origins of the Mana series' many unique gameplay features. GamesRadar named it the 13th best Game Boy game ever made, noting that its interesting leveling system and large number of collectible items made up for a poor English translation. Game Informer also praised the game's leveling system, though it did call it a [...] "simplistic" [...] title in comparison to its sequels.|$|E
500|$|Other Western {{publications}} {{reacted to}} The Final Fantasy Legend more favorably. Author Jeff Rovin heavily praised the {{title in the}} book How to Win at Game Boy Games, citing the thorough manual and considering the game a [...] "masterful achievement for the Game Boy unit, and a superlative game of [...] kind", though not as complex as The Legend of Zelda. Spencer Yip of Siliconera named it as a game he was thankful for playing, citing it as opening his mind to story-based games more so than titles like Dragon Quest, and in part {{led to the creation}} of the website. In May 1991, Nintendo Power named the game the third all-around best Game Boy game of the previous year, and in September 1997 they ranked it 70th on their list of the [...] "Top 100" [...] games to appear on a Nintendo system, stating that it had [...] "stayed true to the Square Soft tradition". TechnoBuffalo's Ron Duwell acknowledged while it was regarded less favorably than its sequels, its flaws could be worked around and added [...] "There is nothing quite like The Final Fantasy Legend. Not before it, [...] and only a single sequel to follow up on its ideas.". 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish called it one of the [...] "essential" [...] games for the Game Boy as well as one of the best of 1989, noting its introduction of new ideas that contrasted the Final Fantasy series and calling it [...] "a pretty decent portable RPG in its own right". GameDaily named it a definite game for Game Boy alongside the related Final Fantasy titles, describing it as providing [...] "hours of role-playing excitement, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> waiting in a dentist's office or on the way to Grandma's house." [...] Andrew Vanden Bossche described the game as [...] "unusual" [...] amongst Japanese roleplaying games, describing its narrative as [...] "loosely connected experiences rather than the sort of epic narrative the RPG genre is commonly thought of". As a result, the off-screen deaths of non-player characters felt more [...] "poignant" [...] and an example of memento mori. However, he also felt the monster class system as counter-intuitive, as frequently said classes emphasized the point of enemies as [...] "designed to pose challenges, not overcome them". Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, Pocket Games, and GameSpot shared this sentiment; the latter three named it one of the top fifty games for the Game Boy.|$|E

2500|$|Their live {{performances}} were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: [...] "When they were good, {{they were very}} very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that {{was the nature of}} the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going to get one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or {{if it was going to}} be a ball of incomprehensible noise." [...] While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from [...] "Secrets" [...] as a frequent opener and [...] "All World Cowboy Romance" [...] or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.|$|E
