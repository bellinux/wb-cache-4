500|$|Speaking to Phil Symes of Disc and Music Echo in May 1971, Ronnie Spector {{admitted}} that she had hated being away from the music industry. The situation had been forced on her by her husband's semi-retirement in 1966, following the failure in America of Ike & Tina Turner's single [...] "River Deep – Mountain High", a production that Phil Spector had considered his masterpiece. Ronnie Spector told Symes: [...] "For four years Phil and I completely detached ourselves from everyone {{in the business and}} settled down in California. I was so bored and missed the stage so much I nearly had a nervous breakdown. If I hadn't had a kid I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done." ...|$|E
500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, I would have done better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not occur to me. Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done or said.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E

"Sandy Black," [...] said Lancey, rising {{with a look}} of dignity, [...] "you {{are very}} kind--just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>'ave</b> {{expected}} of you--but you must clearly understand that I will serve only in works of 'umanity. In a milingtary capacity I will serve neither the Turks nor the Roossians." ...|$|R

500|$|Joyce's {{versions}} of events recorded in his published diaries {{have been described}} as unreliable and sometimes as outright invention—a [...] "self-aggrandizing epic". [...] Specific examples of this [...] "fabulism" [...] include his self-designation as [...] "Captain" [...] after the Ross Sea expedition; [...] his invented claim to have seen Scott's death tent on the Barrier; [...] the misrepresentation of his instructions from Shackleton regarding his sledging role, and his assertion of independence in the field; his claim to have been offered a place on the transcontinental party when Shackleton had made it clear he did not want him there; [...] and his habit, late in life, of writing anonymously to the press praising [...] "the famous Polar Explorer Ernest Mills Joyce". This self-promotion neither surprised nor upset his former comrades. [...] "It is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> expected", said Richards. [...] "He was bombastic [...] but true-hearted and a staunch friend". Alexander Stevens, the party's chief scientist, concurred. They knew that Joyce, for all his swaggering style, had the will and determination to [...] "drag men back from certain death". Lord Shackleton, the explorer's son, named Joyce (with Mackintosh and Richards) as [...] "one of those who emerge from the (Ross Sea party) story as heroes".|$|E
500|$|In the 1956 season, Feller started {{four games}} and {{appeared}} in 15 others, {{and finished with}} an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97ERA. The Indians held [...] "Bob Feller Night" [...] on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, [...] "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years." [...] He continued, [...] "What if I did pitch another year, so <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to come to the decision I am making now, some time." ...|$|E
500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of my interest in serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E

500|$|Writer Kinberg {{would later}} state that [...] "there {{are a lot}} of things about 'X3' that I love and there {{are a lot of}} things that I regret", {{detailing}} that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and [...] "I would have fought harder" [...] for that, considering that at the period [...] "the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $200 million studio movie" [...] leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isn't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in [...] – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratner's direction: [...] "I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|E

They were shrewd because that's exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done." [...] He has been called the [...] "greatest manager England never had." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ringo Starr met {{songwriter}} Dean Grakal at a {{party on}} New Year's Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on Time Takes Time (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time I've really been involved [...] Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked to say, on this, we're really trying to say what I want to say, thank you." ...|$|E

It was just brilliant and totally deserved." [...] Tom Queally said: [...] "You never see an F1 car win on anything but tarmac but for him to win on ground like that shows how special he is. There was a bigger crowd at Royal Ascot but this was more intense. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done if he didn't win."

Asked if he was happy for new Star Wars films to be made after his death, he said: [...] "I've left pretty explicit instructions for there not to be any more features. There will definitely be no Episodes VII–IX. That's because there isn't any story. I mean, I never thought of anything.

2500|$|In a turn of events, a {{settlement}} was reached between Infinity and the FCC that dismissed all outstanding indecency cases on September 1, 1995. Infinity {{agreed to make}} two payments totaling $1.715 million to the United States Treasury as a [...] "voluntary contribution" [...] while its five indecency NALs were cleared from the FCC's record. An additional $9,000 was given to settle all pending complaints. Though Infinity admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement, Stern accused the FCC of extortion, and called the payout [...] "the biggest shakedown in history... the bullies have won. I lost. That means we all lost." [...] Stern, however, praised his employer. [...] "They fought {{as long as they}} could. Honestly, I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done in their shoes... they got jerked around plenty." [...] With its clean record with the FCC, Infinity announced on September 22, 1995 the purchase of seven radio stations owned by Alliance Broadcasting for $275 million that expanded its number of outlets to 34. The Howard Stern Show was syndicated to 26 stations across the country by December 1995.|$|E

In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, [...] "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will." [...] In Wittgenstein's Culture and Value, it is found, [...] "Is what I am doing [...] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." [...] His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, [...] "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers." [...] At last, Wittgenstein writes, [...] "Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelbuechlein, ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ [...] That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked to say about my work." ...|$|E

They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week.
