5|$|Schizophrenia is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real.</b> Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, {{and a lack of}} motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Shogun is {{targeting}} him, {{he tries}} {{to distance himself from}} having witnessed the murder scene and avoid getting involved in New Gen, which draws the attention of the police. Between him being suspected, more New Gen murders occurring, and Shogun supposedly targeting him, Takumi finds himself experiencing hallucinations and paranoia, and is unsure of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and who he can trust. In one of his delusions, Shogun appears as an old man in a wheelchair and tells him that more people will die unless he wakes up.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept has}} also been used in comics. In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman is seen chasing the Joker through an {{amusement}} park and into a hall of mirrors.

25|$|There {{has been}} a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is {{extracted}} {{from the town of}} Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be enough to put authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful because many people, especially foreign tourists, {{do not know how to}} determine <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real.</b> However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer.|$|E
500|$|Dan Stevens {{stars as}} Haller, with Rachel Keller, Aubrey Plaza, Bill Irwin, Jeremie Harris, Amber Midthunder, Katie Aselton, and Jean Smart also {{starring}} in the season. FX ordered a pilot for Legion in October 2015, which Hawley wrote and directed. The show was picked up to series in May 2016. Filming took place in Vancouver, {{with a focus on}} in-camera effects over visual effects. Hawley wanted to show Haller as an [...] "unreliable narrator", with the series mixing retro and modern designs, using unconventional filming and musical techniques, and being structured so the audience is unsure <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real.</b> The narrative becomes more clear throughout the season as Haller gains knowledge, and the villainous Shadow King is revealed. The latter takes several forms, including one portrayed by Plaza.|$|E
500|$|Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq {{for a lack}} of real substance, stating, [...] "Nearly {{three hundred}} pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" [...] and [...] "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, notes: for [...] "Aflaq, reality is {{confined}} to the inner world of the party." [...] In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, [...] Aflaq did not as a rule define what is and what ought to be. [...] In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is attainable.|$|E

5000|$|American Realism was a {{style in}} art, music and {{literature}} that depicted contemporary social realities {{and the lives}} and everyday activities of ordinary people. The movement began in literature in the mid-19th century, and became an important tendency in visual art in the early 20th century. Whether a cultural portrayal or a scenic view of downtown New York City, American realist works attempted to define <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>real.</b>|$|R
500|$|In addition, many reviewers {{were pleased}} with the style and concept of [...] "Triangle". Tom Kessenich lauded the {{atmosphere}} of the entry, calling it [...] "60 minutes of The X-Files at its finest". Kessenich noted that, despite the [...] "gloom and doom" [...] talk that the series was heading in the wrong direction, stylistically, the episode proved [...] "just how exciting this show can be". He ultimately concluded that it was [...] "a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality" [...] that allowed the viewer [...] "to try and ascertain <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and what is not." [...] He later named [...] "Triangle" [...] one of the [...] "Top 25 Episode of All Time" [...] of The X-Files, and ranked it in second place. VanDerWerff noted that he thoroughly enjoyed the concept, pointing out that the [...] "sheer level of crazy stuff that goes on in this episode makes it fun to watch". He wrote that [...] "othing else had ever been this skillfully done on television before", which resulted in a [...] "terrific episode of television". Furthermore, he opined that [...] "verything comes together in the episode's fantastically entertaining final act", due to the presence of the dramatic fight scene, among others.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} essay, Tracey further {{develops}} {{his thoughts on}} the title story, [...] "Oblivion," [...] which raises questions about what reality is, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real.</b> The story, Tracy asserts, gives an ambiguous answer, which suggests that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and true comes from our own decisions about what to believe.
