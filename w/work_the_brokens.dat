40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{combination}} of a broken spatial symmetry in the potential (or ratchet potential) and time correlations in the driving are crucial, and enough to allow transformation of <b>the</b> fluctuations into <b>work.</b> <b>The</b> required <b>broken</b> spatial symmetry implies a specific molecular arrangement of the proteins involved.

Temporal asymmetry, defined as a lack of invariance of the statistical properties under the operation to temporal inversion, is a generic property of nonequilibrium fluctuation, and should therefore be expected to be quite common in biological systems.
