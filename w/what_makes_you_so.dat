60|$|EILEEN (angrily). <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> {{considerate}} of Fred Nicholls {{all of a}} sudden? What {{you thought}} about him was right.|$|E
6000|$|She {{fired at}} this. [...] "Come now! Spit it out! Something nasty {{is in your}} mind. Go on! What have I done? <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> hot?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> lame to-day?' asked Lord Ormersfield, as Louis {{crossed the}} library, on {{returning}} from {{an interview to}} which he had been summoned in another room.|$|E
6000|$|The king, without {{awaiting}} {{an answer}} from either prelate, proceeded to question Lord Nigel, {{but in the}} vernacular tongue,--"Weel, my likely Alumnus of the Muses, and <b>what</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> far from the north?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Eleanor, I could guess; but it's no use {{guessing}} at such things, my dear. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> look <b>so</b> earnest about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But no, signore. But no. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> say <b>so?</b> Why, we Italians are so good-natured. Noi Italiani siamo così buoni. Siamo così buoni." ...|$|R
6000|$|Florida {{went back}} to her mother, who asked her, [...] "What in the world have you and Don Ippolito been talking about so earnestly? <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> pale and out of breath?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not very}} late yet," [...] he said, [...] "and these thirsty boys will be sure to want a drop of beer to their supper to-night. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> sure that Bill Jones is the thief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> glorious," [...] Charmian exulted. [...] "You don't {{need to do}} such things. You're {{equal to}} life as it comes. But I have to prepare myself for it every way I can. Don't you see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, do, thank you; it will hasten matters. Only, {{first order}} in some breakfast. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> up <b>so</b> early? Have not you slept?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed! But how came you to {{know our}} intentions, and <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> take <b>so</b> much {{interest}} in us?" [...] asked Mark, {{with a look of}} suspicion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, ma'am, you can't well {{be dressed}} plainer than you are, unless {{you go in}} {{sackcloth}} at once. 'Tis your excitement is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> look <b>so</b> noticeable to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{gives you}} a chance to do more for other people," [...] she answered; and then she dropped her eyes, {{as if she had been}} {{surprised}} into that answer. She made haste to add: [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> popular with--everybody!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do they not, Frank? That's a {{dangerous}} doctrine; and one which, {{if you had}} my position, you would hardly admit. But <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> much out of sorts? Your own position is generally considered about the best which the world has to give." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, Jimmy, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> late?" [...] said {{someone in}} the room. [...] "We're waiting to hear the finish of all that trouble about your bird at home. Stolen any more of your wife's jewellery? Come in, and let's hear all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What ails thee, {{what ails}} thee, friend Athanarich? [...] <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>thee</b> look <b>so</b> pale?' 'I fear I am poisoned, thou cunning Kaiser, [...] For I feel my heart-strings fail.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Father, dear father, what is it? <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> look <b>so</b> ill, so haggard?' cried Diane de Selinville, when {{summoned the}} next morning to meet her father in the parlour of the convent.|$|R
6000|$|A half sarcastic smile flitted over Buckley's {{face as he}} said, [...] "You didn't use to be a preacher, Jack; <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> now <b>so</b> keen to save me, as {{you call}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, by {{the usual}} {{conveyance}} Pullman vestibuled train, I suppose. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> blue, mamma?" [...] The girl {{was all the}} time sketching away, rubbing out, lifting her head for the effect, and then bending it over her work again without looking at her mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{some one}} who knows your little--we'll say peculiarities," [...] {{answered}} Harry dryly. [...] "I sometimes wonder, Ralph, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> confoundedly proud of yourself. Can't you take it in the spirit it's evidently meant, and be thankful? You are not overburdened with worldly riches at present, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{chaffing}} is {{all to be}} on one side, is it, George? Well; I {{will say}} nothing to add to your discomforts. What is it ails you? You will drink liqueurs after dinner. That is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> wretched. And I believe you drink them before dinner too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Passionate thing! Your face is {{the colour}} of a coquelicot. I wonder <b>what</b> always <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> mighty testy à l'endroit du gros Jean? 'John Anderson, my Joe, John!' Oh, the {{distinguished}} name!" ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. But {{you have}} not told me yet <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> honour London <b>so</b> suddenly. Our season is almost over.|$|R
6000|$|W. But prithee, friend, do {{not make}} thyself fool and knave too. Dost not thou {{know that we are}} out of fear of all thy army, and out of danger of all that they can do? <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>thee</b> act <b>so</b> simply as well as so knavishly? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I hate crows," [...] said Faith airily. [...] "The are {{so black}} and sly I feel sure they're hypocrites. They steal little birds' eggs {{out of their}} nests, you know. I saw one do it on our lawn last spring. Walter, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> pale to-day? Did you have the {{toothache}} again last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much obliged, Mr. Knobs," [...] said Button-Bright, {{sitting up}} {{and staring at}} him, [...] "but I don't believe you've saved {{anything}} except some popcorn that I might have eaten had you not disturbed me. It was nice and warm in that bank of popcorn, and there was plenty to eat. What made you dig me out? And <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> bumpy everywhere?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{tell us how}} and why {{and when}} you came. Take off your coat, my dear! And here are the old slippers. Why didn't you let us know you were coming so soon? How have you been? and <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> late to-night? Betsey, you needn't put on your bonnet. And--oh, my dear boy, {{have you been to}} supper yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I--didn't m-mean," [...] said my father, blazing with excitement, and gasping with a mingled {{tendency}} {{to laugh and}} weep, [...] "didn't mean to come it quite so strong, P-Punch, my boy, b-but you'll make allowance for a momentary weakness. I'm getting an old man, Punch. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> grin <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> backwoods koonisquat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, {{go and get}} Captain Davis. You {{can bring}} him right in here; we're only travellers. Why, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> act <b>so</b> queerly? Has {{anything}} happened?" [...] Mrs. Kenton {{was surprised to find}} herself gathered into her husband's arms and embraced with a rapture for which she could see no particular reason.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! <b>What</b> should <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think <b>so?</b> <b>You</b> think I am cross, I suppose. Well, never mind, I {{will go on}} for myself," [...] said he, {{snatching}} the book.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's your fault, ain't it? You oughtn't to {{have made}} so much money, and then they'd have had to work." [...] She laughed at Lapham's Spartan mood, {{and went on to}} excuse the young people. [...] "Irene's been up two nights hand running, and Penelope says she ain't well. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> cross about the girls? Been doing {{something}} you're ashamed of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{that must}} be coming by slow degrees, {{as a matter of}} course, you know. Women are slower than us men to admit such totally novel impressions; and I dare say Anneke fancies one father enough for her, just at this moment: though she sends very {{pleasant}} messages to Sir Harry, I can assure you, when in the humour! But, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> grave, my good Corny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whew--w--w! That's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> {{down in the}} mouth! L. D. {{going to}} marry Crosbie! Why, that's {{the man who is}} to be the new {{secretary}} at the General Committee Office. Old Huffle Scuffle, who was their chair, has come to us, you know. There's been a general move at the G. C., and this Crosbie has got to be secretary. He's a lucky chap, isn't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{lay awake}} last night {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> like him <b>so.</b> He's so bitter; {{he makes me}} feel unhappy. He never seems content with anything. And he despises"--her face hardened--"I mean, he hates us all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O you cannibal, {{to think}} of such a thing!" [...] cried Peterkin, {{throwing}} the bone of his drumstick after our retreating comrade.--"But 'tis always thus," [...] he added, with a sigh: [...] "man preys upon man, monkey upon monkey. Yet I had hoped better things of Jack. I had believed him {{to be at least}} a refined species of gorilla. I say, Ralph, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> look <b>so</b> lugubrious?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said that}} it might {{possibly}} be done {{in two or three}} days--that was all. <b>What</b> on earth <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> impatient? You've nothing to do. Nobody else wants to see you; and nobody here wants to get rid of you." ...|$|R
