40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increasing}} {{influx of}} heavy metals into water bodies from industrial, agricultural, and domestic activities is of global concern {{because of their}} well documented negative effects on human and ecosystem health. A recent study of streams in Blantyre and Zomba, Malawi revealed lead levels of up 0. 118 mg/L, exceeding the World Health Organisation acceptable level of 0. 01 mg/L. Our ongoing study on low cost effective heavy metal remediation techniques in developing countries has already demonstrated that Moringa oleifera, the well known source of natural <b>water</b> <b>clarifiers,</b> is effective in heavy metal detoxification of water. This paper presents the first reported use of a related species, the African moringa, Moringa stenopetala for lead detoxification and preliminary investigation of {{the interaction of the}} metal with the polyelectrolytes of M. oleifera and stenopetala. The potential of M. stenopetala for lead removal was tested by means of jar tests. With an initial lead concentration of 7 ppm, M. stenopetala seed powder, at doses of 0. 50, 1. 00, 1. 50, 2. 00 and 2. 50 g/ 100 mL, reduced the concentration of lead by 20. 00 ± 0. 00, 46. 19 ± 2. 06, 71. 19 ± 2. 06 and 89. 43 ± 0. 60 and 96. 23 ± 0. 12 % respectively. M. stenopetala was more effective than M. oleifera in removing lead from water (p= 0. 001 at 95 % confidence level). For oleifera, lead levels decreased exponentially during the first 5 h. of the reaction and then equilibrium was established; for stenopetala, a linear decrease was observed. The pH of the mixture rose from 2. 30 to a maximum of 2. 53 and 2. 57 and then fell to an equilibrium value of 2. 30 and 2. 29 for oleifera and stenopetala respectively. Lead removal was also affected by pH, ionic strength, and water hardness...|$|R

40|$|Microfluidic droplet-based {{techniques}} {{allow for}} the formation of extremely uniform emulsions with precise control over the contents of each phase. In this thesis, we exploit these small scale fluid manipulation techniques to study several related phenomena in the area of complex fluids engineering: phase separation and dewetting in three-phase liquid systems, partitioning of high value nanomaterials, and the coalescence and creaming of dilute oil-in-water emulsions. Phase separation occurs, for example, in aqueous systems composed of two or more dissimilar polymers. Using a model system composed of polyethylene glycol, dextran, and water, we study dehydration-driven wetting transitions in a microfluidic array-type device, and then use this technique to estimate the very low interfacial tension between the aqueous phases as a function of polymer concentration. Next, we scale up the droplet-based fluid handling techniques to develop a millifluidic platform for screening the effect of <b>water</b> <b>clarifiers</b> on the stability of dilute crude-oil-in-water emulsions. Finally, the tools and techniques previously developed are adapted and extended to study aqueous two phase extraction, which has recently emerged as a promising technique for sorting synthetic nanomaterials such as single walled carbon nanotubes. The partition coefficient of a nanotube depends on many system parameters, including the presence and concentration of surfactants and salts, and the properties of the phase forming polymers. Knowledge of these relationships provides insight into the fundamental processes governing partitioning and are required for rational design of large scale separation processes. We demonstrate that a microliter scale droplet-based fluid handling approach coupled with inline absorption spectroscopy can facilitate the identification and optimization of the critical parameters for aqueous two phase extraction of carbon nanotubes. The primary contribution of this thesis is a set of robust tools and techniques to quickly, and with high compositional resolution, quantify phenomena such as phase change and partitioning in complex fluid systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} industry will use and discharge large quantities of chemicals into the marine environment during operational activities, with some of those chemicals considered hazardous. Chemical substitution, as part of the environmental regulatory regime, has been advocated as a simple and effective tool to reduce inputs of hazardous substances to the environment. In 2007 the UK National Plan was introduced, to prioritise into four groups and subsequently phase out in stages the most hazardous substances used and discharged during {{offshore oil}} and gas operations. Level 1 substances categorised for phase out in 2010 were virtually eliminated from discharge between 2006 and 2012 and there was a significant decline in discharge of substances at Level 2 to 4 over the same period. The discharge of substitutable substances had been reduced to less than 5 tonnes at most production installations by 2012. More than 91 % of this discharge is contributed by corrosion inhibitor, scale inhibitor, demulsifier and <b>water</b> <b>clarifier</b> formulations. The discharge of corrosion inhibitors accounted for the largest contribution to UK National Plan Level 2 substitutable substance discharges, and they appear to be the type of product with the fewest options found for substitution. This implies that a finite discharge of substances from these groups will continue to require formal justification beyond the target date, as occurred for Level 1 substances after the 2010 target date. The overall figures for substitutable substance discharges from 2006 to 2012 suggest that the introduction of the UK National plan with prioritisation of substances for substitution and ongoing encouragement of operators and, indirectly, suppliers to work towards reduction goals for substitutable substances is resulting in a reduction in discharges and contributing to their ultimate phase out. The next few years will be particularly challenging as the deadline for the phase-out of discharges of substitutable substances included in OSPAR Recommendation, 2006 / 3 is 1 January 2017 and, in addition, by 2018 all chemical substances used offshore will need to have been registered under the EC REACH Regulation. The approach described in this paper illustrates the benefits of a prioritised strategy for chemical substitution and an ongoing dialogue between the industry and regulator. A continuing case by case dialogue with offshore operators and suppliers will be essential to ensure that alternative technical solutions are trialled and options for substitution are investigated at the earliest stage...|$|E
40|$|MIng (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This study {{investigated}} In situ biodiesel production with supercritical methanol. A micro-algae based feedstock was used and {{obtained from a}} local water treatment plant situated just outside of Bethal, South Africa (S 26 ° 29 ’ 19. 362 ” E 29 ° 27 ’ 11. 552 ”). The wet feedstock was used as harvested with only the excess moisture being removed. Characterisation of the feedstock showed that {{a wide variety of}} macro-algae, micro-algae, cyanobacteria and bacterial species were present in the feedstock. The main algal species isolated from the feedstock were Nostoc sp. and Chlamydomonas. The feedstock was found to have a higher heating value (HHV) of 22 MJ. kg- 1 and a lower heating value (LHV) of 16. 03 MJ. kg- 1 with an inherent moisture content of 270 g. kg- 1 feedstock. The protein and fat content of the feedstock was determined by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and found to be 370. 1 g. kg- 1 and 61. 6 g. kg- 1 on a moisture free basis respectively. The high protein and fat content gives a theoretical bio-yield of 430 wt%. The low lignin content and high cellulose and hemi-cellulose content indicated that the feedstock would be suitable for energy production. Three experimental sets were performed to determine the effect certain reaction parameters will have on the bio-char, bio-oil and biodiesel yields. The first set entailed hydrothermal liquefaction without the addition of methanol. The second set involved in situ biodiesel production with supercritical methanol, while both supercritical methanol and an acid catalyst were used during in situ biodiesel in the third set. For the first set of experiments the effect of temperature (240 °C to 340 °C in intervals of 20 °C) on the crude bio-oil and bio-char yields were investigated. The highest bio-char yield was found to be 336 g g char. kg- 1 biomass at 280 °C, while the highest crude bio-oil yield was 470. 7 g crude bio-oil per kg biomass at 340 °C. In the second set of experiments the dry biomass loading was kept constant at 500 g. kg- 1 and the temperature varied (240 °C to 300 °C in intervals of 20 °C) along with methanol to dry biomass ratio (1 : 1, 3 : 1 and 6 : 1). The optimum bio-oil yield of 597. 1 g bio-oil per kg biomass for this set was found at 500 g. kg- 1 biomass loading, 300 °C and 3 : 1 methanol to dry biomass ratio. The highest bio-char yield was found to be 382. 6 g bio-char. kg- 1 biomass for a 1 : 1 methanol to dry biomass weight ratio set with 500 g. kg- 1 biomass loading at 280 °C. An increase in methanol ratio also led to an increase in crude bio-oil yields however the 3 : 1 methanol to dry biomass mass ratio was found to give the highest bio-oil yield and the purest biodiesel, with less unsaturated FAME. The 6 : 1 methanol to dry biomass mass ratio did however increase the FAME yield, which tends to show completion of the in situ production of biodiesel. This was also seen in the amount fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) present in the crude bio-oil as the degree of transesterification starts to increase with an increase in methanol. The FAME content was determined using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). During the last set of experiments the temperature (260 °C to 300 °C in intervals of 20 °C) and methanol to dry biomass ratio (1 : 1, 3 : 1 and 6 : 1) was varied at a constant catalyst loading of 1 wt% of the dry biomass. The optimum yields achieved were 627 g crude bio-oil per kg biomass and 376 g bio-char per kg biomass at 300 °C and 280 °C, respectively. These yields were achieved at 500 g. kg- 1 biomass loading and 6 : 1 methanol ratio. Compared to the experiments where no catalyst was used, a slight increase in the yield was observed with the addition of an acid catalyst. This might be due to the base metals present in the feedstock that can lead to saponification during transesterification without the addition of an acid catalyst. An overall improvement in the extraction of crude bio-oil was observed with in situ production compared to hydrothermal liquefaction. During in situ liquefaction, the bio-oil yield increased by 150 g crude bio-oil per kg biomass higher, while the bio-char yields did not significantly vary at the optimum point of 280 °C this finding has a significant value for green coal research. The highest HHV for the bio-char of 27 MJ. kg- 1 +/- 0. 17 MJ. kg- 1 was found at 280 °C and a 3 : 1 methanol ratio. The HHV of the bio-char decreases with an increase in temperature as more of the hydrocarbons are dissolved and form part of the bio-crude make-up. The highest HHV recorded for the crude bio-oil was 42 MJ. kg- 1 at a 6 : 1 methanol ratio, a temperature of 300 °C and an acid catalyst. The crude bio-oil HHV, which increased with an increase in temperature, is well within the specifications of the biodiesel standard (SANS, 1935). The highest FAME yield of 39. 0 g. kg- 1 was obtained using a 6 : 1 methanol ratio and a temperature of 300 °C in the presence of an acid catalyst. The crude oil contained 49. 0 g. kg- 1 triglycerides with alkenes (C 13, C 15 and C 17) making up the balance. The purest biodiesel yield was achieved at 3 : 1 methanol to dry biomass mass ratio, as it had the lowest yield unsaturated methyl esters. The overall FAME yield increased with an increase in methanol ratio. The derivatised FAME yields were the highest during hydrothermal liquefaction (55. 0 g. kg- 1 biomass). The in situ production of biodiesel from waste <b>water</b> <b>clarifier</b> effluent stream was found to be possible. Further investigation is needed into sufficient harvesting methods, including the optimum harvesting location, as this will result in fewer impurities in the stream and subsequent higher yields.

The biomass from lake <b>water</b> and <b>clarifier</b> sludge was able to degrade all microcystins (MCs) at initial concentrations of 103 ̆bcgL- 1 with pseudo-first order reaction half-lives ranging from 2. 3 to 8. 8 days. CYN was degraded only in the sludge with a biodegradation rate of 1. 0710 - 1 d- 1 and a half-life of 6. 0 days. This is the first study reporting multiple MCs and CYN biodegradation in the coagulation-flocculation sludge of a DWTP. The removal of PAB from the lake water and the sludge prolonged the lag time substantially, such that no biodegradation of MCLY, LW and LF was observed within 24 days. Biodegradation rates were shown to increase {{in the presence of}} C-phycocyanin as a supplementary carbon source for indigenous bacteria, a cyanobacterial product that accompanies cyanotoxins during cyanobacteria blooms. MCs in mixtures degraded more slowly (or not at all) than if they were degraded individually, an important outcome as MCs in the environment are often present in mixtures. The results from this study showed {{that the majority of the}} bacterial biomass responsible for the biodegradation of cyanotoxins is associated with particles or biological flocs and there is a potential for extreme accumulation of cyanotoxins within the DWTP during a transient bloom. 9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Inadequate {{treatment}} of wastewater effluent {{is one of}} the major point sources of pollution of organic micropollutants (OMPs) into aquatic environments. Wastewater treatment plants need to be upgraded to reduce OMP contamination. Recently, the combination of pre-ozonation and granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration has been proposed as a potential OMP treatment method. The aims of this study are to examine the treatment efficiency of selected OMPs, the effects of an ozonated feed <b>water</b> (second <b>clarifier</b> effluent) on GAC adsorption, effects of ozonation on GAC bed life and to identify the dosages of ozone for the design of a pilot plant. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted. The results show that combining the two treatment methods lead to higher elimination/removal rates of the target compounds. The data obtained in the study was used to plot adsorption isotherms and breakthrough curves to investigate the effect of ozonation on GAC bed life. The study found that ozonation reduces the adsorption capacity of the GAC for the selected compounds. Increasing the ozone dosage from 0. 2 to 0. 4 gO 3 /gDOC further lowers the adsorption capacity. However, at 0. 8 gO 3 /gDOC, the adsorption capacity improves. Consequently, according to COMSOL simulations based on the LDF model, ozonation of the feed water at dosages 0. 2 and 0. 4 gO 3 /gDOC results in the breakthrough point occurring earlier than without ozonation. However, a later breakthrough point is obtained with a dosage of 0. 8 gO 3 /gDOC. This is likely due to the effect of low post-ozonation concentrations outstripping the effects of a poorer adsorption capacity. Therefore, an ozone dose of 0. 8 g/gDOC is recommended for the pilot plant while a lower dose could be examined to confirm the findings in this study. Further research is recommended to assess the behaviour of the oxidation by-products and their removal efficiency by GAC filtration...|$|R

It is not an exception for the population of the Ukraine, among which more than 2 / 3 of the total morbidity incidences is non-communicable diseases: desieses of cardiovascular system, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes. To the mind of experts in the field of public health and environment protection, the first place among factors affecting the level of population’s health in Ukraine is given to the water that is ahead of air and food products in this aspect. Taking into consideration the fact that after annexation of the Crimea by the Russian Federation in March of 2014 and uncertainty in the military-political situation on the East of the Ukraine, Zaporizhzhya Priazovye is becoming a recreational zone, and with each year it will be used by more and more Ukrainian citizens. The objective of our research was to investigate nascent, stages of development and nowadays problems of region’s water supply as well as hygienic substantiation of complex ways of nowadays problem of Zaporizhzhya Priazovye water supply. As a result of conducted researches it was found that single economically feasible way of providing population of Zaporizhzhya Priazovye with water with normative total hardness and general mineralization is supply of the Dnipro water carried out by operation of Western group water conduit. To reduce the formation of chlorination by-products in the process of water purification it is necessary to use iron-containing chlorine-sulfate coagulant "Aula" of brand A according to the technical requirements TR U 24. 1 - 33075701 - 002 : 2011.
