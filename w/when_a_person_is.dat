5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of}} the imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E

5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention {{for a longer period}} must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

25|$|Immunity can be {{acquired}} either actively or passively.

25|$|Cued recall is <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> given a list {{of items}} to {{remember}} and is then tested with cues to remember material.

Then the experimenter gives the participant a word to cue the participant to recall the word with which it was originally paired. The word presentation can either be visual or auditory.|$|E
25|$|People {{under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol myopia act in a risky manner because of the myopia's inhibiting effects on their ability to analyze the probable outcomes of their actions. Alcohol activates dopaminergic circuits in the midbrain that also regulate the brain's analyzation and recognition of the outcomes of an action. It is not yet clear on exactly how alcohol effects these dopaminergic circuits. The following behaviors are influenced by risk taking <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> experiencing the effects of alcohol myopia.|$|E
25|$|Reaffirm held beliefs: The {{confirmation}} bias identifies {{how people}} readily read information that confirms their established opinions, and readily avoid reading information that contradicts their opinions.
