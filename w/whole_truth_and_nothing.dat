[...] On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of St Mary Magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the Church of England. Among her visitors was Mr Justice Ledinard, who had helped deliver Virtue Hall to Gascoyne. [...] Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that [...] "I have said the <b>whole</b> <b>truth</b> in court, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> but the truth; and I don't choose to answer any questions, unless it be in court again." [...] Despite calls for clemency, she was taken to the convict ship Tryal for her voyage to British America. [...] Several threats made by the ship's crew, however, meant she eventually sailed on board the Myrtilla in August 1754. [...] Canning arrived in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend Elisha Williams. [...] She was not employed as a servant, but was taken in as a member of Williams' family. [...] Williams died in 1755, and Canning married John Treat (a distant relation of the former governor Robert Treat) on 24November 1756, had a son (Joseph Canning Treat) in June 1758, and a daughter (Elizabeth) in November 1761. [...] She had two more sons (John and Salmon), but died suddenly in June 1773.|$|R
