5|$|Faith et al. 2013 further {{suggested}} that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats.

In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein observed that the bluebuck's habitat preferences <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbuck (Redunca).|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{population}} of P.fluviatile was discovered under the ruins of Trajan's Forum {{in the heart of}} Rome, living in canals built by the Etruscans which connect to the Cloaca Maxima. Based on a genetic analysis, which demonstrated that these crabs <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> in Greece, researchers believe that they had been brought by the Greeks before the founding of the city, some 3000 years ago. The crabs' unusual size, up to , and longevity (up to 15years) are also interpreted as evidence of a long-established population, by analogy with island gigantism.|$|E

5|$|Slaveowners {{and state}} governments tried to prevent slaves from making or playing musical {{instruments}} because {{of the use of}} drums to signal the Stono Rebellion in 1739. Blassingame, however, points out that in spite of restrictions, slaves were able to build a strong musical tradition drawing on their African heritage. Music, songs, and dances <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> performed or played in Africa. Instruments reproduced by slaves include drums, three-stringed banjos, gourd rattles, and mandolins.|$|E
5|$|During {{preparations}} for the , Ron Dennis, the McLaren CEO and Chairman, noted that the team was encouraged by the aerodynamic data they had collected on the chassis, particularly its mid-corner speeds which he claimed <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> produced by other teams. He further added that the car's performance issues could {{be traced back to}} a lack of outright power and poor fuel efficiency from the engine. Éric Boullier, the team principal, further suggested that the main problem that the team faced was improving the efficiency of the RA615H's energy recovery systems, both in harvesting and deploying the additional power, and that by developing these areas, the car could make up several seconds on lap time, enough for the car to compete regularly for podium finishes.|$|E

These figures <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> from surrounding areas, but Didsbury did have a relatively larger education sector than other nearby wards, perhaps explained by the high density of schools in the area. A significant number of people (12%) commute to areas outside Didsbury; at the 2001 census there were 6,555 jobs in Didsbury, compared with the 7,417 employed residents.|$|E
5|$|In Tatum's initial {{season at}} Maryland, his results <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> at Oklahoma. After {{compiling}} a 3–6 record the year prior, the Terrapins improved to 7–2–2 under Tatum. Whereas his predecessor Clark Shaughnessy had pioneered the T-formation, Tatum installed the split-T offense that his former colleague Don Farout had invented. The team's two losses {{came at the}} hands of two ranked period powerhouses, Duke and North Carolina. Maryland's star running back, Lu Gambino, scored three touchdowns against West Virginia to lead the team to their first victory in the third meeting of the series. The Terrapins' regular-season play earned them a berth in their first postseason game.|$|E
5|$|When President Lincoln finally {{issued the}} Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, Tubman {{considered}} it {{an important step}} toward the goal of liberating all black men, women, and children from slavery. She renewed her support for a defeat of the Confederacy, and before long she was leading a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. The marshes and rivers in South Carolina <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of the Eastern Shore of Maryland; thus her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge among potential enemies were put to good use. Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants. She later worked alongside Colonel James Montgomery, and provided him with key intelligence that aided the capture of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E

5|$|While {{the stadium}} has a {{capacity}} of 20,059, the highest attendance for a Mariners game is 19,238 against Newcastle Jets in round 19 of the 2007–08 season. Difficulties in drawing spectators led the Mariners to schedule matches in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons away from Central Coast Stadium, at North Sydney Oval and Brookvale Oval. The club's goal was to play closer to its fan base in north Sydney, which majority owner Michael Charlesworth estimated to be about 20% of its total supporters. Following attendances at North Sydney Oval that <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> at Central Coast Stadium, Football Federation Australia CEO David Gallop suggested in December 2014 {{that it would be}} unlikely that the club would be permitted to continue playing in north Sydney.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in 1940 or early 1941, Treloar {{requested}} that he be appointed to command the War Records Section, which formed part of the Second Australian Imperial Force's administrative headquarters. The Cabinet agreed to this during February 1941. Treloar's responsibilities in this role were to coordinate and control the collection of material {{to be included in}} the AWM as well as to supervise the official war artists and photographers; these duties <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> he and Bean had undertaken during World War I. While Treloar was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel, he primarily worked for the AWM, which reimbursed the Army for his salary and allowances. This arrangement gave Treloar less influence with the Army than he had enjoyed as head of the AWRS during World War I. General Thomas Blamey, the commander of the AIF, subsequently redesignated the War Records Section the Military History and Information Section (MHIS) on the grounds that its original name had not adequately described the unit's role. In contrast to the DOI's propaganda activities, the MHIS focused on collecting records, images and items that would be useful to historians.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s the Australian Army's organisation, {{equipment}} and doctrine <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports. While the Army recognised {{that there was}} a threat of war with Japan, little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia's eastern seaboard, along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia. The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s, but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations {{due to a lack of}} resources as a result of limited defence expenditures. Nevertheless, the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand the Army in the event of war, and indeed during the course of the war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service.|$|E
