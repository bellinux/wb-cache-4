25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Parks {{and others}} have {{identified}} libraries as potentially important safe places for LGBTQ youth and teens, especially {{in the face of}} bullying. He suggests the inclusion of LGBTQ titles in library displays or book talks to promote greater visibility. However, according to an 2005 study by Ann Curry, though many LGBTQ teens have the very similar concerns to their adult counterparts, librarians often do not answer their questions related to LGBTQ topics in a sensitive or welcoming manner. Studies by Carmichael and Greenblatt have emphasized that the library is an important place for teens <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> out to find information because of the potential anonymity it provides. In his examination of public libraries in areas with large concentrations of same-sex families, Naidoo finds that many children's librarians are unaware of the LGBTQ families in their community and provide a mixed-bag of services, collections, and programs.|$|E

He did say, however, that some actors who starred in the first season would be returning. He announced, [...] "The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [...] stories are done. People <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> back will be playing entirely new characters." ...|$|E

She has said of teaching at a community college, [...] "I feel like I can make a greater difference in their lives. I just love that population. It just feels really comfortable to me. I love the women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> back to school and getting their degrees, because they're so focused." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles, and clips of radio {{broadcasts}} are heard with disc jockeys stating that U2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30,000 people. Police show up to the set and inform the band's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing, due to {{the large number of}} people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> to watch the performance. [...] Two minutes into the video, U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th St. and S. Main St., and perform [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building. Towards the end of the song, the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down, and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police.|$|E
500|$|Love Among the Walnuts {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Helbig and Perkins {{commented that}} [...] "the large cast consists of individualized, complementary, and affectionately handled characters" [...] and the novel's themes [...] "are conveyed with skill and invention". Publishers Weekly praised {{the story for}} its [...] "cast of offbeat characters and some punchy dialogue" [...] while writing that its [...] "plot will have more appeal for adults than children." [...] In The Horn Book Magazine, Anne St. John commented that Sandy's [...] "emotional responses and internal struggles will ring true with teenagers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> of age {{in a time of}} turmoil". According to Elaine McGuire of Voice of Youth Advocates, Love Among the Walnuts is [...] "dripping with charm but never cloying... a fabulous book with lots of lessons about our sickeningly fast-paced '90s lifestyles." [...] Paula Rohrlick, writing in Kliatt, compared Love Among the Walnuts favorably to Ferris's later work, Once Upon a Marigold, describing both stories as [...] "madcap".|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the number}} of men serving in the military, many band {{programs}} opened up to women during this time. At Texas Tech, a local sorority for women in the band was established as Tau Beta Sigma. The women of Tau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to be chartered as an auxiliary chapter of the fraternity, which was supported by founder A. Frank Martin, who was serving as National Executive Secretary, and Max Mitchell, Grand Second Vice President. On January 25, 1944, Martin wrote to fellow founder, William Scroggs, [...] "If we do not meet this new situation and give recognition to the girls <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> into the bands or make it possible to give aid or assistance to the many universities and colleges that have bands composed of both boys and girls, we will be playing second fiddle {{within the next five years}} to some band fraternity that will grant membership to boys and girls and their chapters will open up in the smaller schools where ours have died." [...] The fraternity was unable to decide whether or not to accept Tau Beta Sigma's petition due to the severely reduced number of members and the cancelation of the 1943 and 1945 national conventions.|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the drama}} Proof (2005), she starred as the {{depressed}} {{daughter of a}} brilliant, eccentric mathematician (played by Anthony Hopkins). The film {{was based on the}} play of the same name, in which Paltrow also played the same character at London's Donmar Warehouse between May and June 2002. On her portrayal in the film version, Eye for Film remarked: [...] "As she has already shown in Sylvia, The Royal Tenenbaums and even Sliding Doors, Paltrow has an uncanny talent for playing women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> apart at the seams and her [...] veers from lovably eccentric to more disturbingly unhinged and back again with fluent ease. The scenes, which she and Hopkins share, as two difficult people bound together by affection, dependency and mutual respect, are entirely believable and all the more touching for it". For her performance, Paltrow earned her second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama.|$|E

2500|$|Now an Undead Death Knight, Arthas {{meets with}} {{the leader of}} the dreadlords, Tichondrius, who assigns him a series of [...] "tests". Arthas first exhumes the remains of Kel'Thuzad and {{contains}} them in the magic urn that holds the ashes of his father, which was protected by Uther the Lightbringer, head paladin of The Order of the Silver Hand as well as Arthas' former mentor and close friend. Arthas kills him too, then sets off to Quel'thalas, kingdom of the high elves. He then later attacks the gates and destroys their capital of Silvermoon. He kills Sylvanas Windrunner, the Ranger General of Silvermoon (only to resurrect her as a banshee), corrupts their sacred Sunwell and revives Kel'Thuzad as a Lich. The Lich informs him of the Burning Legion; a vast demonic army <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> to consume the world. Kel'Thuzad's true master is the Lich King, who was created to aid the Legion with his Undead Scourge, but in truth he wishes for the Legion to be destroyed. Arthas and Kel'Thuzad open a dimensional portal and summon the demon Archimonde and the Burning Legion, who begins his purging of Lordaeron with the destruction of Dalaran. Arthas and Kel'Thuzad are cast aside by Archimonde, and Kel'Thuzad reveals to Arthas that the Lich King has already foreseen it and is planning to overthrow the Burning Legion.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 2014 {{interview}} Greenwald said {{he believed}} he risked detention if he reentered the U.S., but insisted that he would [...] "force the issue" [...] on principle, and return for the [...] "many reasons" [...] he had to visit, including if he won a prestigious award {{of which he was}} rumoured to be the winner. Later that month, it was announced that he was, in fact, among the recipients of the 2013 Polk Awards, to be conferred April 11, 2014 in Manhattan. In a subsequent interview, Greenwald stated he would attend the ceremony, and added: [...] "I absolutely refuse to be exiled from my own country for the crime of doing journalism and I'm going to force the issue just on principle. And I think going back for a ceremony like the Polk Awards or other forms of journalistic awards would be a really good symbolic test of having to put the government in the position of having to arrest journalists <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> back to the US to receive awards for the journalism they have done." [...] On April 11, Greenwald and Laura Poitras accepted the Polk Award in Manhattan. Although their entry into the United States was trouble-free, they traveled with an ACLU lawyer and a German journalist [...] "to document any unpleasant surprises". Accepting the award, Greenwald said he was [...] "happy to see a table full of Guardian editors and journalists, whose role in this story is much more integral than the publicity generally recognizes". On April 14, the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service was awarded jointly to The Guardian and The Washington Post for revelation of widespread secret surveillance by the NSA. Greenwald, along with Laura Poitras and Ewen MacAskill, had contributed to The Guardian′s reporting.|$|E
