5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> hers. In all my life, I have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} visual capture {{experienced}} {{in daily life}} {{is known as the}} “ventriloquism effect”. This is when ventriloquists make their speech appear to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> their puppet rather than their own mouths. In this situation, visual capture allows the audio stimuli to be controlled by the vision system and produce a congruent experience that the sound <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the puppet.Another popular example of visual capture happens while watching a movie in a theater, and the sound appears to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the actors lips. Although this may seem true, the sound <b>is</b> actually <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the speakers, often spread out across the theater rather than directly behind wherever the character’s mouth may be.|$|R
5|$|The {{general area}} of the villages of Dalj, Erdut and Aljmaš was {{targeted}} by an artillery bombardment between 3:00a.m. and 4:30a.m. on 1 August 1991. Croatian sources indicate that the artillery fire <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> units assigned to the JNA 51st Mechanised Brigade deployed on the left bank of the Danube River, on the territory of Serbia, {{as well as the}} Croatian Serb TO. The JNA report on the events prepared for Croatian authorities denies that the JNA artillery took part in the bombardment, and indicates a somewhat later time of the initial fighting, placing it at 4:10a.m. Witness testimony given at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) trial of Slobodan Milošević supports the timeline placing the initial combat at 3:00a.m.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{indicated}} in his written {{statement that the}} incident happened when he <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Embassy, although the report from Pakistani police stated that the GPS record showed he <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> his private residence at Scotch Corner, Upper Mall. Davis stated that after withdrawing cash from a bank cash machine, he was driving alone in his white Honda Civic and had stopped at a traffic light near Qurtaba Chowk in the Mozang Chungi area of Lahore when two men pulled alongside him on a motorbike. After {{one of the young}} men allegedly brandished a pistol, Davis opened fire and killed both of them with his own 9mm Glock pistol.|$|E

At some point Boreas also recaptured the Hazards Bounty.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, 70 {{percent of}} the DIA's funding <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the State of Michigan, that year the state facing a {{recession}} and budget deficit cut funding by more than 50 percent.

25|$|The {{earliest}} settlers to {{the district}} arrived in the 1840s, and farmed the area with wheat and sheep predominantly. The town soon grew into an important grain storage and loading point, with a jetty constructed in 1874, only the second to be built on the Eyre Peninsula. This provided a much needed outlet for the copper ore which <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Burrowing Mine. The original jetty was taken down in 1999 due to safety concerns, but the other newer jetty is still in use.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not unusual}} for {{electric}} recordings to be played back on acoustic phonographs. The Victor Orthophonic phonograph was a prime example where such playback was expected. In the Orthophonic, which benefited from telephone research, the mechanical pickup head was redesigned with lower resonance than the traditional mica type. Also, a folded horn with an exponential taper was constructed inside the cabinet to provide better impedance matching to the air. As a result, playback of an Orthophonic record sounded like it <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a radio.|$|E
