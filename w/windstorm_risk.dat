40|$|Possible future {{changes of}} {{clustering}} and return periods (RPs) of European storm series with high potential losses are quantified. Historical storm series are identified using 40 winters of reanalysis. Time series of top events (1, 2 or 5 year return levels (RLs)) {{are used to}} assess RPs of storm series both empirically and theoretically. Additionally, 800 winters of general circulation model simulations for present (1960 – 2000) and future (2060 – 2100) climate conditions are investigated. Clustering is identified for most countries, and estimated RPs are similar for reanalysis and present day simulations. Future changes of RPs are estimated for fixed RLs and fixed loss index thresholds. For the former, shorter RPs are found for Western Europe, but changes are small and spatially heterogeneous. For the latter, which combines the effects of clustering and event ranking shifts, shorter RPs are found everywhere except for Mediterranean countries. These changes are generally not statistically significant between recent and future climate. However, the RPs for the fixed loss index approach are mostly beyond the range of pre-industrial natural climate variability. This is not true for fixed RLs. The quantification of losses associated with storm series permits a more adequate <b>windstorm</b> <b>risk</b> assessment in a changing climate...|$|E
40|$|In late February 2010 the {{extraordinary}} windstorm Xynthia crossed over Southwestern and Central Europe and caused severe damage, affecting particularly the Spanish and French Atlantic coasts. The storm was embedded in uncommon large-scale atmospheric and boundary conditions {{prior to and}} during its development, namely enhanced sea surface temperatures (SST) within the low-level entrainment zone of air masses, an unusual southerly position of the polar jet stream, and a remarkable split jet structure in the upper troposphere. To analyse the processes {{that led to the}} rapid intensification of this exceptional storm originating close to the subtropics (30 °N), the sensitivity of the cyclone intensification to latent heat release is determined using the regional climate model COSMO-CLM forced with ERA-Interim data. A control simulation with observed SST shows that moist and warm air masses originating from the subtropical North Atlantic were involved in the cyclogenesis process and {{led to the formation of}} a vertical tower with high values of potential vorticity (PV). Sensitivity studies with reduced SST or increased laminar boundary roughness for heat led to reduced surface latent heat fluxes. This induced both a weaker and partly retarded development of the cyclone and a weakening of the PV-tower together with reduced diabatic heating rates, particularly at lower and mid levels. We infer that diabatic processes played a crucial role during the phase of rapid deepening of Xynthia and thus to its intensity over the Southeastern North Atlantic. We suggest that windstorms like Xynthia may occur more frequently under future climate conditions due to the warming SSTs and potentially enhanced latent heat release, thus increasing the <b>windstorm</b> <b>risk</b> for Southwestern Europe...|$|E
40|$|Wind borne debris {{is one of}} the {{principal}} causes of building envelope failure during severe storms. It is often of interest in <b>windstorm</b> <b>risk</b> modelling to estimate the potential flight trajectories and impact energy of a piece of debris. This thesis presents research work aimed at the development and validation of a numerical model for the simulation of plate-type windborne debris. While a number of quasi-steady analytical models are available at present, these models are unable to account for the fluid-plate interaction in highly unstable flows. The analytical models are also limited to simple launch flow conditions and require extensive a-priori knowledge of the debris aerodynamic characteristics. In addition, the use of Euler angle parametrisations of orientation in the analytical models results in mathematical singularities when considering 3 D six degree-of-freedom motion. To address these limitations, a 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is sequentially coupled with a quaternion based singularity-free six degree of freedom Rigid Body Dynamics (RBD) model in order to successfully simulate the flight of plate-type windborne debris. The CFD-RBD model is applied to the numerical investigation of the flow around static, forced rotating, autorotating and free-flying plates as well as the treatment of complex launch conditions. Key insights into the phenomena of plate autorotation are highlighted including the genesis of the aerodynamic damping and acceleration torques that make autorotation possible. The CFD-RBD model is then validated against measurements of rotational speed and surface pressure obtained from recent autorotation experiments. Subsequently a general 3 D spinning mode of autorotation is demonstrated and the CFD-RBD model is extended to include plate translation in order to simulate windborne debris flight. Using the CFD-RBD flight model, a parametric study of windborne debris flight is carried out and four distinct flight modes have been identified and are discussed. The flight results are contrasted against available free-flight experiments as well as predictions from existing quasi-steady analytical models and an improved quasi-steady force model based on forced rotation results is proposed. The resulting CFD-RBD model presents the most complete numerical approach to the simulation of plate-type windborne debris, directly simulating debris aerodynamics, and incorporates complex launch flow fields in the initial conditions.

40|$|Assessments of local-scale {{windstorm}} hazard require highly resolved {{spatial information}} on wind speeds and gusts. In this study, maximum (peak) sustained wind speeds on a 3 -km horizontal grid over Switzerland are obtained by dynamical downscaling from the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20 CR) employing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Subsequently, simulated peak gusts are derived using four wind gust parameterizations (WGPs). Evaluations against observations at 63 locations in complex terrain include four high-impact windstorms (occurring in 1919, 1935, 1990, and 1999) and 14 recent windstorms (occurring between 1993 and 2011). Peak sustained wind speeds and directions are generally well simulated, although wind speeds are mostly overestimated. In general, performance and skill measures {{are best for}} locations on the Swiss Plateau and inferior for Alpine mountain and valley locations. An independent ERA-Interim WRF downscaling configuration produces overall comparable results, implying that the 20 CR ensemble mean is a reliable data set in dynamical downscaling exercises. The four evaluated WGPs largely reproduce the observed gustiness, although the timing and magnitude of the peak gusts are not regularly captured. None of the WGPs stands out as single best for the complex topography of Switzerland. Differences among the WGPs are small compared to the biases inherited from the sustained-wind part in the WGP formulations. All WGPs transform overestimated peak sustained winds into underestimated peak gusts, which points to an underrepresentation of the turbulent part in the WGP formulations. The range of simulated peak gusts from downscaling all 20 CR ensemble members does not reliably include the observed peak gust, indicating limited benefit in applying an ensemble approach. Despite the limitations, we infer that with spatial optimisations of the simulation (e. g. by bias correction or adaptation of the WGP schemes), downscaling of 20 CR input is an efficient option for high-resolution assessments of <b>windstorm</b> hazard and <b>risk</b> in Switzerland...|$|R
