5|$|After the war, {{allegations}} that Leopold's surrender {{had been an}} act of collaboration provoked a political crisis, known as the Royal Question, about <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> could return to the throne, which ultimately ended with his abdication.|$|E
5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Raonic was {{questioned}} about <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{would follow the}} example of Rusedski, the last prominent Canadian tennis player, who decided to represent Great Britain instead. Raonic declared that he would play for Canada.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{wrote the}} main parts of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect with actors Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern in mind. According to Jones, Adams telephoned {{him when he}} was writing the pilot to ask <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would {{essentially}} play himself; Adams later stated that although Dent was not a portrayal of Jones, he wrote the part to play to Jones's strengths as an actor.|$|E
5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The scholaster, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first {{introduced}} him to Latin. From the Historia {{it is clear that}} he also knew French and possibly Italian, but there is not enough evidence to determine <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
5|$|Delsener {{presented}} {{the plan to}} Paul Simon {{in the summer of}} 1981. Simon was enthusiastic about the idea, but questioned whether it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie One-Trick Pony. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He questioned <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E
5|$|Dorothy soon fell in {{love with}} Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> intended to stay in New York or return to London.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} {{publications}} of Leaves of Grass, Whitman had financial difficulties {{and was forced}} to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's Daily Times starting in May 1857. As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials. He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was fired or chose to leave. Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.|$|E
5|$|During the postgame celebration, ABC {{commentator}} Jack Arute asked Dennis Franchione <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{would return}} to the team the following year. Coach Franchione responded by asking the announcer to let the players enjoy their victory. At the beginning of the subsequent press conference, Coach Franchione announced his resignation, effective immediately. Shortly thereafter, Texas A announced defensive coordinator Gary Darnell would lead the Aggies in their bowl game.|$|E
5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> or she is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E

5|$|In 1333 he {{took part}} in Edward's Scottish campaign, though it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{was present at the}} great English victory at the Battle of Halidon Hill. After further service in the north, he was {{appointed}} the King's lieutenant in Scotland in 1336. The next year {{he was one of the}} six men Edward III promoted to the higher levels of the peerage. One of his father's lesser titles, that of Earl of Derby, was bestowed upon Grosmont.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Wolf {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term by running for re-election in 2016. He was succeeded by Julian Cyr (D-Truro). There remains speculation as to <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> will return to focusing on work as owner and pilot for his airline company, although he is considered a potential candidate for Governor in 2018.|$|E
