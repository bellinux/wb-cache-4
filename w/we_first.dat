5|$|Then for {{the next}} week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What {{do you think about this}} bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
5|$|<b>We</b> <b>first</b> {{learned about}} the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is also {{important}} to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E

Ever since <b>we</b> <b>first</b> raised this issue some years ago there still has not been an adequate repudiation of incitement by the Palestinian Authority. It is even more disturbing that the problem appears to have gotten worse. These textbooks don't give Palestinian children an education, they give them an indoctrination.|$|E
25|$|Illus was an Isaurian, but {{the time}} and place of his birth are unknown; he had a brother, called Appallius Illus Trocundus. Illus is said to have held various offices under the Emperor Leo I (457—474), and to have been an {{intimate}} friend of Zeno, apparently before his accession. John Malalas considered Illus an uncle of Zeno. But <b>we</b> <b>first</b> read of him in Zeno's reign and in hostility to that emperor.|$|E

It is used when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> see her, again when she stands before Edoras. A slow variation of it is played before Theodred's Dirge, and it eventually plays in a very triumphant setting when she rides off to battle.|$|E
25|$|In a {{different}} direction, for compact operators on a Banach space, a result {{analogous to the}} Jordan normal form holds. One restricts to compact operators because every point x in the spectrum of a compact operator T, the only exception being when x is the limit point of the spectrum, is an eigenvalue. This is not true for bounded operators in general. To give some idea of this generalization, <b>we</b> <b>first</b> reformulate the Jordan decomposition {{in the language of}} functional analysis.|$|E
25|$|Top-down approach: This is {{the direct}} {{fall-out}} of the recursive formulation of any problem. If {{the solution to}} any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, <b>we</b> <b>first</b> check the table {{to see if it}} is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>first</b> came out we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started!". Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before <b>we</b> <b>first</b> came out there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!". According to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.|$|E

As he grew older, the boys named their troupe the Adelphians and began to have their shows in barns where they could fit larger audiences.
