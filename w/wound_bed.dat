25|$|Scarring {{can occur}} around {{or over the}} flap opening, causing it to become less {{effective}} or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the <b>wound</b> <b>bed</b> to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{accelerate}} {{the healing of}} diabetic wounds, various kinds of growth factors have been employed. It is the short half-life of administered growth factors in hostile <b>wound</b> <b>beds</b> that have limited wide-spread clinical usage. To overcome this limitation, growth factor gene therapy could be an attractive alternative rather than direct application of factors onto the <b>wound</b> <b>beds.</b> We administered two growth factor DNAs, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into a cutaneous wound on diabetic mice. We compared the different characteristics of the healing wounds. Methods: Streptozotocin was injected intraperitoneally to induce diabetes into C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The ultrasound micro-bubble destruction method with SonoVue as a bubbling agent was used for non-viral gene delivery of EGF 828 and VEGF 165 DNAs. Each gene was modified for increasing efficacy as FRM-EGF 828 or minicircle VEGF 165. The degree of neoangiogenesis was assessed using qualitative laser Doppler flowmetry. We compared wound size and histological findings of the skin wounds in each group. Results: In both groups, accelerated wound closure was observed in the mice receiving gene therapy compared with non treated diabetic control mice. Blood flow detected by laser doppler flowmetry was better in the VEGF group than in the EGF group. Wound healing rates and histological findings were more accelerated in the EGF gene therapy group than the VEGF group, but were not statistically significant.

25|$|Suspected Deep Tissue Injury: A purple or maroon {{localized}} area of discolored intact skin or blood-filled blister due {{to damage}} of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear. The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer or cooler {{as compared to}} adjacent tissue. A deep tissue injury {{may be difficult to}} detect in individuals with dark skin tones. Evolution may include a thin blister over a dark <b>wound</b> <b>bed.</b> The wound may further evolve and become covered by thin eschar. Evolution may be rapid exposing additional layers of tissue even with optimal treatment.|$|E
25|$|Stage IV: Full {{thickness}} tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may {{be present}} on {{some parts of the}} <b>wound</b> <b>bed.</b> Often include undermining and tunneling. The depth of a stage IV pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) subcutaneous tissue and these ulcers can be shallow. Stage IV ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (e.g., fascia, tendon or joint capsule) making osteomyelitis likely to occur. Exposed bone/tendon is visible or directly palpable. In 2012, the NPUAP stated that pressure ulcers with exposed cartilage are also classified as a stage IV.|$|E
2500|$|Proliferation (growth of new tissue): In this phase, angiogenesis, {{collagen}} deposition, {{granulation tissue}} formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction occur.

In fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation, fibroblasts grow {{and form a}} new, provisional extracellular matrix (ECM) by excreting collagen and fibronectin. [...] Concurrently, re-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which epithelial cells proliferate and 'crawl' atop the <b>wound</b> <b>bed,</b> providing cover for the new tissue. In wound contraction, myofibroblasts decrease {{the size of the}} wound by gripping the wound edges and contracting using a mechanism that resembles that in smooth muscle cells.

The treatment also reduces bacterial load [...] by effective evacuation and immobilization of microorganisms from the <b>wound</b> <b>bed,</b> and subsequent chemical binding of available water that is necessary for their replication.

The release of fibroblast growth factor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and vascular endothelial growth factor contained in PRP from HCF was sustained for a longer period than those from PRP, calcium-activated PRP (C-PRP), or a mixture of fibrin and PRP (F-PRP). Treatment of full-thickness skin wounds in mice with HCF-PRP resulted in much faster wound closure as well as dermal and epidermal regeneration at day 12 compared to treatment with either C-PRP or F-PRP.

As serum based fluid moves out of the vessels into the interstitial spaces the resultant soft tissue oedema manifests on the wound surface as exudate. In the chronic wound this exudate contains a surfeit of proteolytic enzymes and other components not seen in acute wounds and these compounds have a corrosive effect on the <b>wound</b> <b>bed</b> and surrounding peri-wound skin. The application of dressings, topical negative pressure, compression garments and leg elevation/exercise have been identified as methods for management of wound exudate.|$|E

40|$|Expression of angiogenic {{factors such}} as VEGF under {{conditions}} of hypoxia or other kinds of cell stress contributes to neovascularization during wound healing. The inducible endoplasmic reticulum chaperone oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP 150) is expressed in human wounds along with VEGF. Colocalization of these two molecules was observed in macrophages in the neovasculature, suggesting a role of ORP 150 in the promotion of angiogenesis. Local administration of ORP 150 sense adenovirus to wounds of diabetic mice, a treatment that efficiently targeted this gene product to the macrophages of <b>wound</b> <b>beds,</b> increased VEGF antigen in wounds and accelerated repair and neovascularization. In cultured human macrophages, inhibition of ORP 150 expression caused retention of VEGF antigen within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while overexpression of ORP 150 promoted the secretion of VEGF into hypoxic culture supernatants.

Cell viability studies showed that the hydrogel and its degradation by-products are noncytotoxic.

Wound healing was monitored through macroscopic and histological analysis. From macroscopic analysis, the <b>wound</b> <b>beds</b> of the animals treated with CH were considerably smaller than those of the controls. Histological analysis revealed lack of a reactive or a granulomatous inflammatory reaction in skin lesions with CH and the absence of pathological abnormalities in the organs obtained by necropsy, which supported the local and systemic histocompatibility of the biomaterial.
