5|$|James de Connick {{established}} the first breed {{standard for the}} French Spaniel in 1891. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have.</b> <b>The</b> French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier {{as the president of the}} association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.|$|E
5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia.

I went to Daniel, supposedly a friend, and I said, 'This is going to fail and <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capability to do it, so let us ghost-write it.'" [...] Dworsky refused. Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: [...] "We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop."" [...] Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he [...] "no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: [...] "He (Dworsky) {{made a lot of}} money. He begged me for the job. I'd like to shoot him." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} David Scarpa started writing {{a draft of}} the script in 2005, Thomas Rothman was in charge of Fox and felt a {{responsibility}} to remake the film. Scarpa felt everything about the original film was still relevant, but changed the allegory from nuclear war to environmental damage because [...] "the specifics of [...] <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capability to destroy ourselves have changed." [...] Scarpa noted the recent events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 informed his mindset when writing the screenplay. He scrapped Klaatu's speech {{at the conclusion of the}} story because [...] "audiences today are willing to tolerate that. People don't want to be preached to about the environment.

500|$|The badge design {{resembles a}} heraldic shield, and {{consists}} of two layers which represent [...] "the partnership between the ownership, the community, {{the players and the}} fans." [...] The logo incorporates the Space Needle, an internationally recognized Seattle landmark. The official team colors are Sounder Blue, signifying the waters of the Puget Sound; Rave Green, representing the forests of the Pacific Northwest; and Cascade Shale, representing the Cascade Range to the east of Seattle. Fans chose a name for the team in an online poll held between March 27 and 31, 2008. The initial list of possibilities– Seattle FC, Seattle Republic and Seattle Alliance– deliberately did not include Seattle Sounders in order to provide a [...] "fresh start." [...] Despite the names having been selected through fan research and internal committees, the omission of the traditional Sounders name embittered many in the Seattle community. In response to the backlash, the team added a fourth [...] "write-in" [...] option for the team name, allowing for any name to be suggested on the ballot. Of the more than 14,500 votes received in choosing the new team name, 49% of the votes included some form of the name [...] "Sounders". Upon announcing the name of the club, Hanauer acknowledged the significance of keeping with tradition: [...] "The team playing at the highest level in our region has always been called Sounders. Starting with the NASL and then the USL 1st Division, <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> chance to create a separate and distinct identity with the new MLS team." [...] (The naming of the original Seattle Sounders (NASL) team was, in fact, {{as the result of a}} [...] "name the team" [...] contest in 1974, in which the top three picks were Sounders, Seahawks and Mariners, in that order.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Questlove {{said that}} the band benefited from the {{security}} and practice time provided by their job as the house band on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Working for NBC, the band is expected to write [...] "short, concise songs, even if they don't get used on air. We have to create three to seven songs every day." [...] Many of these short pieces were used for Undun. Questlove said the new practice space refocused the band's songwriting style, which was previously dependent on jamming during soundchecks on tour. Questlove said the financial stability of the new job also allowed The Roots to be more musically adventurous: [...] "we could finally follow all those crazy ideas that we've had without fear of being dropped by our label... Now we have a safety net. Our Def Jam life is now an evening job. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> comfort and confidence to start making the albums we want to make.

2500|$|In 1852, {{when his}} first major novels of Russian society were still to come, Turgenev wrote an {{obituary}} for Nikolai Gogol, intended for publication in the Saint Petersburg Gazette. The key passage reads: [...] "Gogol is dead!... What Russian heart is not shaken by those three words?... He is gone, that man whom <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right (the bitter right, given to us by death) to call great." [...] The censor of Saint Petersburg did not approve of this and banned publication, but the Moscow censor allowed it {{to be published in}} a newspaper in that city. The censor was dismissed; but Turgenev was held responsible for the incident, imprisoned for a month, and then exiled to his country estate for nearly two years. [...] It was during this time that Turgenev wrote his short story Mumu ("Муму") in 1854. [...] The story tells a tale of a deaf and dumb peasant who is forced to drown the only thing in the world which brings him happiness, his dog Mumu. [...] Like his A Sportsman's Sketches (Записки охотника), this work takes aim at the cruelties of a serf society. This work was later applauded by John Galsworthy who claimed, [...] "no more stirring protest against tyrannical cruelty was ever penned in terms of art." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{official}} {{close to}} the presidency said the dilution of Mugabe's powers promised in the agreement was [...] "illusory", and described the MDC as merely a [...] "junior partner" [...] whose only role would be [...] "to gain legitimacy and international funds". ZANU-PF planned to take the ministries of defence, justice, home affairs, farming, information, and mines. The mining sector is the last occasionally functioning {{part of the economy}} given the country's wealth of natural resources and this carries huge opportunities for corruption. The MDC would be offered the finance ministry, in an effort to persuade donors that real reform was taking place so that would trigger billions in aid and reconstruction. The presidential official said [...] "It's a tricky situation for the MDC...Nonetheless <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opposition in government and they have to fix the economy, just as they told the electorate." [...] A ministerial post involving kick starting foreign aid is seen by some as a poison chalice for the MDC. If the party were to succeed it would help shore up support for the ZANU-PF and make it harder to oust in the future, while a failure would cause the MDC to be branded as incompetent and would undermine its own support. MDC officials were said {{to be aware of the}} risk of being manipulated and refused to sign up for a ministry that lacks real authority. According to an MDC spokesman, [...] "It would appear that Zanu-PF does not understand power-sharing. We are still poles apart, with them insisting on taking all the key ministries, literally rendering the (opposition) peripheral in government – in fact, a situation where we would be in but out of government." ...|$|E

60|$|For a {{week after}} the {{marriage}} Mrs. Browning--by which more familiar name <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to call her--remained in her father's house; her husband refraining from seeing her, since he could not now ask for her by her proper name without betraying their secret. Then, on September 19, accompanied once more by her maid and the ever-beloved Flushie, she left her home, to which she was never to return, crossed the Channel with her husband to Havre, and so travelled on to Paris. Her father's anger, if not loud, was deep and unforgiving. From that moment he cast her off and disowned her. He would not read or open her letters; he would not see her when she returned to England. Even the birth of her child brought no relenting; he expressed no sympathy or anxiety, he would not look upon its face. He died as he lived, unrelenting, cut off by his own unbending anger from a daughter who could with difficulty bring herself to speak a harsh word of him, even to her most intimate friends.|$|E
6000|$|Extension of {{arable land}} {{by at least}} 8,000,000 acres; {{creation}} {{of hundreds of thousands}} of small holdings by tithe redemption, or another scheme still in the blue; increase and perpetuation of garden-allotments--besides all these we want, of course, agricultural schools and facilities for training; co-operatively organised finance, transport, and marketing of produce; for without schooling, and co-operation, no system of small holding on a large scale can possibly succeed. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> labourer's minimum wage, which, I think, will want increasing; but we want good rural housing on an economically sound basis, an enlivened village life, and all that can be done to give the worker on the land a feeling that he can rise, the sense that he is not a mere herd, at the beck and call of what has been dubbed the [...] "tyranny of the countryside." [...] The land gives work which is varied, alive, and interesting beyond all town industries, save those, perhaps, of art and the highly-skilled crafts and professions. If we can once get land-life back on to a wide and solid basis, it should hold its own.|$|E

6000|$|In January last, Friedrich, {{intensely}} meditating this business, had {{in private}} a bright-enough idea: That of secularizing those so-called Sovereign Bishoprics, Austrian-Bavarian by locality and nature, Passau, Salzburg, Regensburg, idle opulent territories, with functions absurd not useful;--and of therefrom cutting compensation to right and to left. This notion he, by obscure channels, {{put into the}} head of Baron von Haslang, Bavarian Ambassador at London; where it germinated rapidly, and came to fruit;--was officially submitted to Lord Carteret in his own house, in two highly artistic forms, one evening;--and sets the Diplomatic Heads all wagging upon it. [Adelung, iii. B, 84, 90, [...] "January-March, 1743."] With great hope, at one time; till rumor of it got abroad into the Orthodox imagination, into the Gazetteer world; and raised such a clamor, in those months, as seldom was. [...] "Secularize, Hah! One sees the devilish heathen spirit of you; {{and what kind of}} Kaiser, on the religious side, <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> happiness of having!" [...] So that Kaiser Karl had to deny utterly, [...] "Never heard of such a thing!" [...] Carteret himself had, in politeness, to deny; much more, and for dire cause, had Haslang himself, over the belly of facts, [...] "Never in my dreams, I tell you!"--and to get ambiguous certificate from Carteret, which the simple could interpret to that effect.

60|$|There is {{this to be}} said in defence of men {{of letters}} on the {{business}} side, that literature is still an infant industry with us, and, so far from having been protected by our laws, it was exposed for ninety years after {{the foundation of the}} republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods. It is true that <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> international copyright law at last, and we can at least begin to forget our shame; but literary property has only forty-two years of life under our unjust statutes, and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them, as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property; it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them, and recover damages, if he can. This may be right enough in itself; but I think, then, that all property should be defended by civil suit, and should become public after forty-two years of private tenure. The Constitution guarantees us all equality before the law, but the law-makers seem to have forgotten this in the case of our literary industry. So long as this remains the case, we cannot expect the best business talent to go into literature, and the man of letters must keep his present low grade among business men.|$|E
60|$|But I do not, as a fact, {{feel that}} the cathedral is a ruin; I doubt if I should feel it even if I wished to lay it in ruins.

As a matter of feeling, as a matter of fact, as a matter quite apart from theory or opinion, it is not in the religious centres that <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> feeling of something beautiful but receding, of something loved but lost. It is exactly in the spaces cleared and levelled by America for the large and sober religion of the eighteenth century; it is where an old house in Philadelphia contains an old picture of Franklin, or where the men of Maryland raised above their city the first monument of Washington. It is there that I feel like one who treads alone some banquet hall deserted, whose lights are fled, whose garlands dead, and all save he departed. It is then that I feel as if I were the last Republican.|$|E
