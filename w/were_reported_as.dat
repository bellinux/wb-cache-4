5|$|As a {{developing}} typhoon, the outer rainbands of Saomai affected the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam, causing moderate damage. Localized power outages were reported, and damage totaled to US$650,000.

Concurrently, the approach of a front into the country interacted with the typhoon, resulting in unprecedented rainfalls in Japan. Due to the floods, approximately 400,000people were evacuated in three prefectures. In Nagoya, observed rainfall totals were the highest since records began in 1891. Despite making landfall on Okinawa, damage was not as severe, though several landslides and strong winds were reported. Overall, damage in Japan and its outlying islands totaled JP¥24.8billion (US$223million) and eleven fatalities <b>were</b> <b>reported.</b> <b>As</b> Saomai tracked near China, its outer rainbands and strong waves prompted the evacuation of 20,000people and caused record high stream heights.|$|E

After reaching cooler waters and an unfavorable environment, the hurricane rapidly weakened and dropped to a tropical depression status on July 15. The system continued to lose its convection and eventually degenerated by the next day.
