500|$|The Moon Shaped Pool tour drew {{criticism}} for its {{inclusion of a}} date in Tel Aviv on 19 July, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. Radiohead were subject to protests at some concerts, where sections of the audience unfurled Palestinian flags. On 23 April, more than 50 prominent figures, including musician Roger Waters, whose 2017 album Is This the Life We Really Want? was produced by Godrich, signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel the show. Yorke told Rolling Stone he found the criticism [...] "extremely upsetting ... choose to, rather than engage with us personally, throw shit at us in public. It's deeply disrespectful to assume that we're either being misinformed or that we're so retarded we can't make these decisions ourselves. I thought it was patronising in the extreme." [...] He felt the criticisms created [...] "divisive energy" [...] rather than [...] "bring people together". Godrich added {{that he did not}} [...] "believe in cultural boycotts ... I don't think they're positive, ever ... The people you'd be denying [...] are the people who <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and don't necessarily agree with their government." [...] Waters responded in a public statement saying he had written to Yorke months earlier, but that Yorke had replied angrily and not replied to further correspondence. On 11 July, filmmaker Ken Loach wrote in the Independent that [...] " [...] stubborn refusal to engage with the many critics of their ill-advised concert in Tel Aviv suggests to me that they only want to hear one side – the one that supports apartheid... Radiohead need to decide if they stand with the oppressed or with the oppressor." [...] Yorke responded in a statement: [...] "Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression." [...] The show went ahead as planned, with Yorke telling the audience: [...] "A lot was said about this, but in the end we played some music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps so, though I hardly think Mr. Thurston <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> For instance?" [...] asked Millicent, {{finding his}} humor infectious, for English Jim could gather {{all the men}} in camp about him, when half in jest and half in earnest he began one of his discourses.|$|E
60|$|OLIVER. I'm sure I do. I want {{every man}} {{to be able to}} live and be free. But we shall never manage it by {{fighting}} over the money. If you want what is natural and good, I'm sure the owners <b>would</b> soon <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R

It was a sudden impulse that I couldn't resist, and you know a fellow is scarcely accountable for his impulses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, dear me, I've {{no doubt}} that's very true, very true." [...] Mrs. Cosham sighed. [...] "Swift <b>would</b> have <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> anyhow--" [...] She looked at him, {{and thought that}} {{there were signs of}} {{distinct}} power in his brow. He would do well, she thought, to devote himself to satire.|$|R
60|$|Charlie Ward. There's {{no mistake}} but you're the same Paul still; nice and plain and simple, only for your hard talk. And {{what about the}} rheumatism? It's hardly you got through that fit you had, and you don't look as if much {{hardship}} <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure Mrs. Garth <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> there," [...] said Mr. Farebrother, who {{for some}} reason seemed more {{inclined}} to ruminate than to speak. [...] "One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about Fred is wrong--or rather, mistaken--though no man ought to make a claim on such feeling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Frank; I do {{not mean}} to say that you do not love her. What I do mean is this: that it is not {{becoming}} in you to give up everything--not only yourself, but all your family--for such a love as this; and that she, Mary herself, acknowledges this. Every one is of the same opinion. Ask your father: I need not say that he <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> about everything if he could. I will not say the de Courcys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me when <b>you</b> understood," [...] murmured Diana, and her {{expression}} was so smug and satisfied that Patsy was seized with an irresistible spirit of mischief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But I am not {{the keeper}} of his conscience. Come, Anne, if this affair did not concern Leslie--if it were a purely {{abstract}} case, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me,--you know <b>you</b> would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{did want}} to consult you, mother. But then, you see, he wanted to consult his books even more, and he knew very well that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him; and <b>you</b> know you would too. So please don't say {{anything}} more about it, but let Ruth run upstairs and see to our things at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{perfectly}} good fellow. Lord Beaumont of Foxwood--don't {{you know his}} name? He {{is a man of}} transparent sincerity, a nobleman who does more work than a navvy, a socialist, an anarchist, I don't know what; anyhow, he's a philosopher and philanthropist. I admit he has the slight disadvantage of being, beyond all question, off his head. He has that real disadvantage which has arisen out of the modern worship of progress and novelty; and he thinks anything odd and new must be an advance. If you went to him and proposed to eat your grandmother, he <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> so long as you put it on hygienic and public grounds, as a cheap alternative to cremation. So long as you progress fast enough it seems a matter of indifference to him whether you are progressing to the stars or the devil. So his house is filled with an endless succession of literary and political fashions; men who wear long hair because it is romantic; men who wear short hair because it is medical; men who walk on their feet only to exercise their hands; and men who walk on their hands for fear of tiring their feet. But though the inhabitants of his salons are generally fools, like himself, they are almost always, like himself, good men. I am really surprised to see a criminal enter there." ...|$|E

5000|$|Archbishop McQuaid: Oh, I <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Father. Did {{you read}} his review in last Sunday's Observer {{of a new}} history of monasticism? I learned the last {{sentence}} by heart. I shall quote it: [...] "The early monastic founders asked everything of their followers and they got everything; the moderns ask little and they get nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for telling me so much, and I can grasp the main issues," [...] she said at length. [...] "If my opinion is of value I <b>would</b> say I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that the bold course is best. But you will need much money, and as it is evident money will not be plentiful, so I must do my part in helping you. Because this {{establishment}} and our mode of life here is expensive, while it will please my father to be near the scene of operations, we will let High Maples and retire to a mountain ranch. I fear we have maintained a style circumstances hardly justified too long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You dog!" [...] exclaimed Jeekie in a {{voice of}} furious indignation. [...] "Do you think that white men and their high-born companions, such as myself, were made to fill your vile stomachs? I tell you that a meal of the deadly Bean <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> better <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> for if you dare so much as to look on us, or {{on any of the}} white race with hunger, agony shall seize your vitals and you and all your tribe shall die as though by poison. Moreover, we do not touch the flesh of men, nor will we see it eaten. It is our 'orunda,' it is consecrate to us, it must not pass our lips, nor may our eyes behold it. Therefore we will camp apart from you further up the stream and find our own food. But to-morrow at the dawn the {{messengers}} must leave as we have commanded. Also you shall provide strong men and a large canoe to bear Little Bonsa forward towards her own home until she finds her people coming out to greet her.|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR MISS ANDERSON,--I {{have been}} acting on your parting advice {{to look out}} for that Mr. Lafflin of mine, and I have {{discovered}} that he is an unmitigated scamp. Consequently there is nothing more to keep me in Washington, and I should now like your advice about coming to Fortress Monroe. Do you find it malarial? On the boat your aunt asked me to come, but you said nothing about it, and I was left to suppose that you did not think it <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me. Do <b>you</b> still think so? or what do you think? I know you think it was uncalled for and in extremely bad taste for me to tell you what I did the other day; and I have thought so too. There is only one thing that could justify it--that is, I think it might justify it--if you thought so. But I do not feel sure {{that you would like to}} know it, or, if you knew it, would like it. I've been rather slow coming to the conclusion myself, and perhaps it's only the beginning of the end; and not the conclusion--if there is such a difference. But the question now is whether I may come and tell you what I think it is--justify myself, or make things worse than they are now. I don't know that they can be worse, but I think I should like to try. I think your presence would inspire me.|$|R

40|$|After the botched 2014 {{execution}} of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma, John Oliver tackled {{the issue of}} the death penalty on the second episode of his HBO show, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. Oliver opens the discussion with a sound bite from former U. S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who says, “I [] do believe in the death penalty, but [] only with respect to those [that] are guilty of committing the crime. ” Oliver responds, “Okay, bold idea. We shouldn’t execute innocent people. I think most people <b>would</b> probably <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> that. <b>You,</b> sir, are a regular Atticus Finch. But [] executing the innocent is not really the tough question here. ” Oliver was right, of course; this should not be a tough question, but the number of judicial and institutional hurdles— both procedural and substantive—currently in place should raise grave concerns about our commitment to ensuring that only the guilty are executed. Since 1973, there have been 157 death row exonerations. That is approximately one exoneration for every ten executionsin this country. Recent research suggests that the rate of wrongful convictions in capital cases where a death sentence was imposed is approximately four percent, which means that approximately 120 of the roughly 3, 000 inmates on death row in this country are not guilty. The fact that countless individuals sit behind bars for crimes they did not commit is troubling enough, but even more terrifying, obviously, is the prospect of their execution. There is {{every reason to believe that}} we already have executed innocent individuals...|$|R
60|$|You {{speak as}} a connoisseur; {{how would the}} common eye of the public <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in that opinion?--I think it <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me.
