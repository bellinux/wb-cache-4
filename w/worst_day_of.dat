5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer {{to take over the}} troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E

[...] In June 1963, the Jim Crow signs {{regulating}} segregated public places in Birmingham were taken down.|$|E
500|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was {{expected}} to be unhelpful for fast bowling. Opener Len Hutton was dropped by Hassett on 25, after flicking the ball behind square leg from Loxton’s bowling. This proved to be costly, as Hutton reached 81 before falling at 1/168. England were 2/268 {{at the end of the}} first day. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and said that it was the country’s <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses.|$|E

500|$|During 1997, Ann Romney began {{experiencing}} severe numbness, fatigue, {{and other}} symptoms, {{and just before}} Thanksgiving in 1998, {{she was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. [...] Mitt Romney described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> his life. He later said: [...] "I couldn't operate without Ann. We're a partnership. We've always been a partnership so her being healthy and our being able to be together is essential." [...] She initially experienced a period of severe difficulty with the disease, and later said: [...] "I was very sick in 1998 when I was diagnosed. I was pretty desperate, pretty frightened and very, very sick. It was tough at the beginning, just to think, this is how I'm going to feel {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
500|$|According to reports, after Germany {{had scored}} their seventh goal, Neymar, who was {{watching}} the match on television, switched off his set and went to play poker. Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari said {{the result was the}} [...] "worst loss by a Brazilian national team ever" [...] and accepted all responsibility for the defeat. He called it [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> my life", and resigned after the tournament. Stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Júlio César both offered apologies to the people of Brazil. Fred, who was booed by Brazilian fans during the match, said it was the worst defeat in his and his teammates' careers. He later announced his retirement from international football following the tournament. Recovering from his injury, Neymar expressed his support to his teammates and, despite the 7–1 score, said he was proud {{to be part of this}} team.|$|E
500|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was {{predicted}} to be unhelpful for fast bowling. Thirty minutes before tea, England brought up their 150 without loss, and continued unhindered after two brief interruptions due to rain. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate. Bradman brought on Johnson, who had delivered only three overs so far, {{the rest of}} the proceedings having been through fast bowlers. Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman gave Johnson a ring field with no slip. Johnson bowled two consecutive maidens, but Washbrook was scoring freely at the other end, so Bradman called for the new ball and brought back the fast bowlers. Johnson was still wicketless when England closed the day at 2/268. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton accused Australia of going [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and regarded their performance as their <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses.|$|E
5000|$|Kurtzman met Alfred Andriola in 1942, {{encouraged}} by a quote in Martin Sheridan's Classic Comics and their Creators where Andriola offered help to aspiring cartoonists. Kurtzman made an appointment, but Andriola's {{response to his}} work was discouraging—he told Kurtzman {{to give up on}} cartooning. Kurtzman called this meeting [...] "one <b>of</b> the <b>worst</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> [...] life", though he ignored Andriola's advice and continued to peddle his portfolio.|$|R

I got signed, I got dropped, I got signed again. That's actually what the 'Marry the Night' video is about. It's {{about one of}} the most horrible days of my life when I got dropped from my first record label and it's the story of what happened that day." [...] A second preview of the music video, shot in a dance studio, premiered on November 25, 2011. Gaga told Vanity Fair magazine that the video is [...] "autobiographical" [...] and illustrates [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> my life." [...] The entire video premiered on December 1, 2011 on E! Online at 8.00 pm EST. However, the video appeared online several hours before its official release. Gaga took her Twitter to express dissatisfaction with the leak of the video, saying that it was [...] "like an old tampon." [...] The video for the song is 13minutes long.|$|E
500|$|Former Test batsman Jack Fingleton, {{who covered}} the tour as a journalist, said Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and {{described}} the efforts as the country's <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses. England had batted conservatively, steadily accumulating runs on a pitch unfavourable for fast bowlers, and Miller bowled placidly. Fingleton's fellow journalist and former playing colleague O'Reilly criticised the bowling display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said none of the bowlers could be excused. He lambasted the attack for operating [...] "without objecthopelessly and meaninglessly" [...] throughout the day. He decried the [...] "so-called attack" [...] for being [...] "so blatantly inaccurate both in direction in length" [...] and likened it to what was on offer in [...] "another monotonously uninteresting county match". O'Reilly criticised Bradman's players for what he regarded as an overly casual and relaxed disposition in the morning, which gradually became more lethargic throughout the day as the home team strengthened their position. O'Reilly speculated that the tourists had become complacent because of their comfortable 20 series lead.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the innings, Bradman used off theory, but left a large gap square of the wicket in an attempt to coax England's out-of-form top-order to play risky shots into the {{inviting}} gap. However, Bradman's offer was spurned as Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously. Meanwhile, Australia's attack appeared unsettled. Bradman set defensive fields for most of the first day as England's openers put on 168 for the first wicket. O'Reilly said that Bradman's defensive field settings [...] "made the sorry admission of impotency". England's batsmen dominated to reach stumps at 2/268. Jack Fingleton said that Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and was its <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> bowling since the Second World War, citing the proliferation of full tosses. O'Reilly criticised the display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said that no bowler could be excused. He said that the attack [...] "functioned without objecthopelessly and meaninglessly" [...] throughout the day. He lambasted the bowlers for performing at a standard akin to county cricket. O'Reilly criticised the players for having a casual and lethargic manner, speculating that Bradman had been allowed them to become complacent.|$|E
50|$|Croll {{was born}} in a Moscow, Russia and was brought to Canada with his family as a young boy, at which point his name was anglicized.

However, during these periods, women were still able to receive RH services from other facilities in nearby districts, including privately run midwife clinics and hospitals contracted by the voucher programme. Furthermore, financial flows through the voucher programme {{made it possible for}} public providers to buy critical supplies that were out of stock, due to interrupted supply chains affected by the ongoing conflict.|$|R
500|$|Almost 250 {{different}} fires {{started in}} Yellowstone {{and the surrounding}} National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the fires and later dubbed [...] "Black Saturday", more than [...] were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted {{as far away as}} Billings, Montana, [...] to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over [...] high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of [...] a day, and there were even occasions when more than [...] in one hour were recorded.|$|E
500|$|United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{said his}} side {{deserved}} {{to win the}} game despite Chelsea performing better in the second half, and acknowledged the historical significance of the win, which came 40 years after the club's first European Cup title and 50 years after the Munich air disaster. He also said it was the first penalty shoot-out he had ever won as a manager: [...] "I won the Charity Shield that way, but that doesn't really count. The European Cup? The FA Cup? The Scottish cups? Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky — magnificent." [...] Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad. Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his relief at his side's shoot-out victory, saying, [...] "In my opinion I played well in the game, scored a goal, and then missed the penalty. It would have been the <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> my life. We deserved to win as we played better in the whole game. It means everything to me, we have won both trophies, it is the best day in my life." [...] He then attempted to quash further speculation about his future and a potential transfer to Real Madrid, saying, [...] "I am going to stay." ...|$|E
500|$|... 1988 {{started with}} a wet spring season {{although}} by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from [...] throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to [...] on the park land alone. By {{the end of the}} month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single <b>worst</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the fires, more than [...] were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the [...] that were burned {{over the next couple of}} months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.|$|E

Following the unsuccessful attempt by Horthy to take Hungary out for the war, the Arrow Cross party carried out a military take-over on October 15, 1944. In the ghetto the <b>worst</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> nightmare began. Through sheer luck, Ilka Gedő managed to escape deportation and survived.|$|R

The transpolar flights in summer 1937 occurred following the arrest and execution of {{a large body of}} the Red Army officer corps. Fifteen of sixteen total army commanders were executed; more than three-fourths of the VVS senior officers were arrested, executed, or relieved of duty. News coverage of the arrests was relatively little compared to treatment of aviation exploits, deflecting attention away from the arrests.|$|R
