5|$|Tensions between Edward and the barons {{remained}} high, and the earls {{opposed to}} the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, {{but he was not}} personally interested in practical administration, nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> particularly imaginative or effective politician.|$|E

He tended to fall out with former associates including Shelley's widow and Trelawney. His writings on Byron and Shelley are often imprecise. Shelley's fame grew throughout the 19th century and his legacy became an obsession for Medwin as for others in the Pisan circle. Medwin was opportunistic and disregarded the feelings of many former friends, but he remains {{the main source of}} information on Shelley's childhood. His Conversations of Lord Byron is now seen generally as vivid and essentially a true picture of the man.|$|E

25|$|Historian Martin H. Folly {{argues that}} Bevin was not {{automatically}} pro-American. Instead {{he pushed his}} embassy in Washington to project a view of Britain that neutralized American criticisms. He felt Britain's problems were in part caused by American irresponsibility. He was frustrated with American attitudes. His strategy was to bring Washington around to support Britain's policies, arguing Britain had earned American support and ought to compensate it for its sacrifices against the Nazis. Bevin was not coldly pragmatic, says Folly, nor was he uncritically pro-American; nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> puppet manipulated by the British Foreign Office.|$|E
25|$|Charles Vincente Domingo (ca. 1875 – late 1950s) {{was born}} in Mozambique but {{spent most of his}} life in {{northern}} Nyasaland, where he was educated at the Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900) mission at Livingstonia and later became a teacher and licenced preacher there. He left the Free Church in 1908 over delays to his ordination and later established an independent Seventh-day Baptist church and school in the Mzimba district. Domingo was one of three Africans sponsored by Joseph Booth who created independent churches in Nyasaland in the early 20th century, the others being John Chilembwe and Elliot Kamwana. Domingo did not favour armed revolt, as Chilembwe did, nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> charismatic preacher seeking rapid social change like Kamwana. He was a moderate social reformer who strongly criticised the inequalities of colonial rule, and a teacher who believed that Africans should run their own churches free of external supervision and use these churches to promote a high standard of education to create a cultured African elite to undertake its own social and political advancement. He failed because of inadequate resources in poverty-stricken northern Nyasaland and government suspicion of his motives, but he remains one of the pioneers of Malawi’s independence.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, when Caracciola socialised {{with the}} upper Nazi echelons {{he did so}} merely as an [...] "accessory", not as an active member, and at no time <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> member of the Nazi Party.

Caracciola lived in Switzerland from the early 1930s, and despite strict currency controls, his salary was paid in Swiss francs. During the war, he continued to receive a pension from Daimler-Benz, until the firm ceased his payments under pressure from the Nazi party in 1942.|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: [...] "Wilfrid left {{a distinctive}} {{mark on the}} character of the English church in the seventh century. He was not a humble man, nor, so far as we can see, <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> man greatly interested in learning, and perhaps he would have been more at home {{as a member of the}} Gallo-Roman episcopate where the wealth which gave him enemies in England would have passed unnoticed and where his interference in matters of state would have been less likely to take him to prison." [...] R. W. Southern, another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was [...] "the greatest papal enthusiast of the century". James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him [...] "He was certainly one of the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman." ...|$|E
500|$|Remaining {{captain of}} England, Hammond led the M.C.C. side which toured Australia in 1946–47. The visit was {{unsuccessful}} as England lost the five-match Test series 3–0. According to Wisden, Hammond's inability to make large scores {{was one of}} the reasons for the failure. Nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> success as captain. He was criticised for his field placement and people at home wondered if he had lost control of the team. While he suffered some ill luck, Wisden said that he [...] "was not the same inspiring leader as at home against Australia in 1938". Other journalists noted that he did not consult his players, one of whom later commented that he showed little imagination in his use of bowlers. Hammond approached the tour as an exercise in goodwill, promising his men an enjoyable time. It was noted that Bradman, the Australian captain, took a more competitive attitude towards the series. Team spirit was good on the outward journey, but Hammond's forthcoming divorce and other domestic concerns caused him to become isolated from the players and increasingly moody. He had poor relations with the press, who were very critical of his captaincy and reporting details of the dissolution of his marriage. As the tour progressed, he lost his dynamism as a leader, gave poor advice to the batsmen and made poor selections for the team.|$|E

500|$|On 4 November 1794, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer {{replaced}} the ill Dumerbion as army commander. Schérer wrote that Sérurier was [...] "a very good officer, {{devoted to his}} duties; his patriotism has been attacked {{in the time of}} Hébert and his consorts; he has emerged victorious from all these charges. In my opinion he is worthy of the post he holds on the right of the active army." [...] Sérurier's promotion was not confirmed until 13 June 1795. The Austro-Sardinian commander Joseph Nikolaus De Vins attacked the French lines on 24 June. Most of the assaults failed but since a few positions were captured and could not be retaken, the French withdrew from Vado to Borghetto Santo Spirito by 5 July. In the new line, Masséna with 14,000 troops held the coast while Sérurier and 6,000 men defended Ormea. On 5 July Sérurier reported that a key position had been partly lost, causing consternation at army headquarters. Later that day he reported that one of his brigadiers, Louis Pelletier, retook the position. Curiously, this incident did not count against him; instead Sérurier was given command of the left wing in place of Garnier. On the evening of 31 August, his headquarters at Saint-Martin-Vésubie was surrounded by the enemy. Though only 318 soldiers were at hand, Sérurier resisted successfully until early the following morning when he attacked and scattered his attackers, capturing 86 of them. The enemy commander, the émigré Chevalier Bonnaud committed suicide. Not only <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> good soldier, but Sérurier's troops liked him, he treated the local civilians with decency and his diplomacy allowed him to serve as a link between his army and the neighboring Army of the Alps.
