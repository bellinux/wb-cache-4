5|$|A few kennels {{breeding}} their ancestors, the St. John's <b>water</b> <b>dog,</b> were in England.

5|$|The modern Labrador's {{ancestors}} originated on {{the island}} of Newfoundland, now part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's <b>water</b> <b>dog,</b> a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with mastiffs brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin, and muzzle - known as tuxedo markings - characteristic of the St. John's Dog often appear in modern Lab mixes, and will occasionally manifest in Labradors as a small white spot on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.|$|E

25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the PWD are widely {{thought to be the}} Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other <b>water</b> <b>dog</b> breeds, PWDs are intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are {{significant differences between the two}} breeds. The Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> is off-square, slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the buttocks, and from withers to ground. Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.|$|E
25|$|In {{his victory}} {{speech on the}} night of his election, President Obama {{repeated}} his promise to Sasha and Malia to get a puppy to take with them to the White House. The selection was slow because Malia is allergic to animal dander; the president subsequently said that the choice had been narrowed down to either a labradoodle or a Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog,</b> and that they hoped to find a shelter animal. On April 12, 2009, it was reported that the Obamas had adopted a six-month-old Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> given to them as a gift by Senator Ted Kennedy; Malia and Sasha named the dog Bo. The White House refers to Bo as the First Dog. In 2013, the family adopted a second Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> named Sunny.|$|E
25|$|These {{theories}} {{explain how}} the Poodle and the Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> may have developed from the same ancient genetic pool. At one time the Poodle was a longer-coated dog, as is one variety of the Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog.</b> The possibility also exists {{that some of the}} long-coated water dogs grew up with the ancient Iberians. In early times, Celtiberians migrated from lands which now belong to southwestern Germany. Swarming over the Pyrenees, circulating over the whole of western Europe, they established bases in Iberia, as well as in Ireland, Wales, and Brittany.|$|E

5000|$|Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dogs</b> - Dating {{from the}} 16th century in Portugal, Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dogs</b> {{were used by}} {{fishermen}} to send messages between boats, to retrieve fish and articles from the water, and to guard the fishing boats. Labrador Retrievers {{have been used by}} fishermen to assist in bringing nets to shore; the dog would grab the floating corks on the ends of the nets and pull them to shore.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Water</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{a type of}} gun dog bred {{to flush}} and {{retrieve}} game from water, often serving the waterfowl hunter.

Some of the oldest <b>dog</b> breeds are <b>water</b> <b>dogs.</b> The term was originally water spaniels (a misnomer, as not all are spaniels). With the advent of kennel clubs many [...] "water spaniels" [...] were accepted under the names including the designation retriever rather than spaniel.|$|R
25|$|The poodle is a {{group of}} formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origins of the poodles are still {{discussed}} with a dispute over whether the poodle descends from the old French Barbet breed or from Germany as a type of <b>water</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> has {{recently}} gained more fame {{by being the}} chosen breed of U.S. president Barack Obama, who has two of them, Bo and Sunny.

25|$|As well, many newer dog breeds can {{be traced}} back to a common {{foundational}} breed making them difficult to separate genetically. For example, Labrador Retrievers, Flat-coated Retrievers, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and Newfoundland Dogs share the ancestry of the St. John's <b>water</b> <b>dog</b> – a now extinct naturally occurring dog breed from the island of Newfoundland.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> is {{a fairly}} rare breed; only 36 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain's Crufts {{competition}} in 2013.

25|$|The Portuguese <b>Water</b> <b>Dog</b> is a {{breed of}} working dog as {{classified}} by the American Kennel Club. Portuguese Water Dogs are originally from the Portuguese {{region of the}} Algarve, from where the breed expanded to all around Portugal's coast, where they were taught to herd fish into fishermen's nets, to retrieve lost tackle or broken nets, and to act as couriers from ship to ship, or ship to shore.|$|E

Not having heirs interested in the kennel, Bensaúde bequeathed it to Conchita Cintrón in 1967. Having registered the kennel with the name Al-Gharb, Conchita, taking advantage of her extensive contacts in North American high-society publicized the breed in the US with great success.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} cross {{was of a}} yellow-coloured retriever, 'Nous', with a Tweed Water Spaniel female dog, 'Belle'. The Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct, but {{was then}} common in the border country. Marjoribanks had purchased Nous in 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated retriever pups. In 1868, this cross produced a litter that included four pups; these four became {{the basis of a}} breeding program which included the Irish Setter, the sandy-coloured Bloodhound, the St. John's <b>water</b> <b>dog</b> of Newfoundland, and two more wavy-coated black retrievers. The bloodline was also inbred and selected for trueness to Marjoribanks' idea of the ultimate hunting dog. His vision included a more vigorous and powerful dog than previous retrievers, one that would still be gentle and trainable. Russian sheepdogs are not mentioned in these records, nor are any other working dog breeds. The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is all sporting dogs, in line with Marjoribanks' goals. The Golden Retriever was active and powerful and had a gentle mouth for retrieving games while on hunts.|$|E

5000|$|Moscow <b>Water</b> <b>Dogs</b> were bred in Krasnaya Zvezda, Belarus, by interbreeding Newfoundland {{males with}} East European Shepherd and Caucasian Shepherd Dog females, and by mating the {{offspring}} with each other.

500|$|Several early {{descriptions}} of the St. John's <b>water</b> <b>dog</b> exist. In 1822, explorer W.E. Cormack crossed the island of Newfoundland by foot.

500|$|Very {{unlike the}} Irish Water Spaniel in appearance, the English Water Spaniel [...] more closely resembled a curly-haired {{version of the}} Springer Spaniel, with some traits of the Collie, poodle, and setter.

500|$|The {{foundational}} {{breed of}} what is now the Labrador Retriever was known as the St. John's <b>water</b> <b>dog,</b> St. John's dog, or Lesser Newfoundland.
