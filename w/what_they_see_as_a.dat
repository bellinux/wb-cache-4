Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond the Chicago metropolitan area have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking.|$|E
25|$|During {{the visit}} of Queen Elizabeth II to Alberta and Saskatchewan in 2005, First Nations stated that they felt relegated to a merely {{ceremonial}} role, having been denied by federal and provincial ministers any access to the Queen in private audience. First Nations leaders have also raised concerns about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> crumbling relationship between their people and the Crown, fueled {{by the failure of}} the federal and provincial cabinets to resolve land claim disputes, as well as a perceived intervention of the Crown into aboriginal affairs. Formal relations have also not yet been founded between the monarchy and a number of First Nations around Canada; such as those in British Columbia who are still engaged in the process of treaty making.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, just as some {{scholars}} praise <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{confirmation of the}} compatibility of Islam and gender equality, others point out that by requiring the framing of gender equality within an Islamic framework, {{the means by which}} Muslim women can advocate for equality is inherently limited. This process also arguably reduces Islamic women to a single, universal category that does not recognize their individual choices. Critics consequently point out that the Mudawana represents an improvement in women's status but still falls short of establishing their full equal standing with men in either the family or the social sphere. For example, the law still recognizes the father as head of the family and designates him the default legal tutor to his children.|$|E

500|$|Stephenson {{is decidedly}} not a prodigy; but his babe-in-the-woods routine has proved irresistible for some, who are hailing his {{seemingly}} innate ability to meld {{the products of}} exhaustive historical research with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> brilliant, idiosyncratic {{sense of humor and}} adventure. Time's critic has declared that Stephenson has a [...] "once-in-a-generation gift", and that Quicksilver [...] "will defy any category, genre, precedent or labelâ€”except for genius". This is promotional copy disguised as literary criticism. There is nothing category-defying about this ridiculous book.|$|E
500|$|Another {{theme is}} the notion of network {{executives}} forcing ideas onto a show. The interaction between the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them. The writers understand the show's inner workings, but the network executives approach improvements to the show from a business point of view. They try to incorporate <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rebellious character with the comment [...] "This is popular with the kids", but the viewers later reject the character. The writers themselves are satirized in the episode, and are depicted as lazy and pretentious with few original ideas.|$|E
500|$|Project Sylpheeds setting, exposited through {{flashback}} sequences {{during the}} game, is a fictional 27th century {{in which human}} civilization has expanded beyond Earth for 500years, colonizing several worlds and forming the Terra Central Government (TCG). [...] Seated on Earth, the government uses military force to suppress colonial uprisings. [...] The ADAN Alliance, formed by colonists of four star-systems, initially engaged in politics to seek independence for their worlds. [...] The central government's responded by destroying the terraforming facilities of an alliance planet, Acheron, killing many colonists and turning the world inhospitable.

500|$|On , Rainer Plaga, a German astrophysicist, {{posted a}} {{research}} {{paper on the}} arXiv Web archive concluding that LHC safety studies have not definitely ruled out the potential catastrophic threat from microscopic black holes, including the possible danger from Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. In a follow-up paper posted on the arXiv on , Steven Giddings and Michelangelo Mangano, {{the authors of the}} research paper [...] "Astrophysical implications of hypothetical stable TeV-scale black holes", responded to Plaga's concerns. They pointed out <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> basic inconsistency in Plaga's calculation, and argued that their own conclusions on the safety of the collider, as referred to in the LHC safety assessment (LSAG) report, remain robust. Giddings and Mangano also referred to the research paper [...] "Exclusion of black hole disaster scenarios at the LHC", which relies on a number of new arguments to conclude that there is no risk due to mini black holes at the LHC. On 19 January 2009 Roberto Casadio, Sergio Fabi and Benjamin Harms posted on the arXiv a paper, later published on Physical Review D, ruling out the catastrophic growth of black holes in the scenario considered by Plaga. In reaction to the criticisms, Plaga updated his paper on the arXiv on 26 September 2008 and again on 9 August 2009. So far, Plaga's paper has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.|$|E
500|$|Planning for the Cycle Center {{was part}} of the larger [...] "Bike 2010 Plan", in which the city aimed to make itself more {{accommodating}} to bicycle commuters. This plan (since replaced by the [...] "Bike 2015 Plan") included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on Chicago 'L' trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area's other mass transit providers, Metra and Pace, have developed increased bike accessibility. Mayor Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. Environmentalists, urban planners and cycling enthusiasts around the world have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond Chicago have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking. The Toronto Star notes that it is revered as [...] "a kind of Shangri-La", and describes it as [...] "a jewel-like glass building on the Chicago waterfront, [...] has many of the amenities of an upscale health club [...] close {{to the heart of the}} city", with the additional statement that [...] "It's not heaven, but it's close". [...] A Vancouver official told The Oregonian that it was [...] "the ultimate in bicycle stations", and would be natural for bicycle friendly cities to emulate.|$|E
500|$|As of October 2008, Wu starred with Jessica Rose and Phillip DeFranco in Hooking Up from HBOLabs (the online arm of HBO), a scripted 10-episode web-based series. Hooking Up {{is set at}} {{a fictional}} {{university}} where the students {{spend most of their}} time emailing and twittering, but still manage to miscommunicate. It is his first work on a scripted production. Guest appearances on Hooking Up will be made by Kevin Nalty, Michael Buckley, and other internet celebrities. The entire cast of Hooking Up is composed of YouTube video bloggers in the hope of attracting a young, internet knowledgeable audience. By the show's second day on YouTube, it had received more than 450,000 views. According to NewTeeVee.com, an evolving consensus is that for an online video to be a hit, somewhere between 100,000 and one million views are needed, giving Hooking Up a strong start. Maria Russo of the Los Angeles Times felt that Wu was better looking than star DeFranco and wondered why Wu plays the [...] "tired role of the East Asian friend who helps the white guy get the chicks," [...] while Bobbie Johnson of The Guardian said that many web surfers had [...] "scoffed at <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cynical attempt to cash in." [...] On October 2, 2011, Wu hosted [...] "Flicks" [...] on Cartoon Network during an airing of Around the World in 80 Days.

2500|$|Transnational Islamist ideology, {{specifically}} of {{the militant}} Islamists, assert that Western policies and society are actively anti-Islamic, or {{as it is}} sometimes described, waging a [...] "war against Islam". Islamists often identify <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> historical struggle between Christianity and Islam, dating {{back as far as}} the Crusades, among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. Osama bin Laden, for example, almost invariably described his enemy as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. Defensive jihad differs from offensive jihad in being [...] "fard al-ayn", or a personal obligation of all Muslims, rather than [...] "fard al-kifaya", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required from others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than an aggressor, and of giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|Other leftists {{believe in}} Marxian {{economic}}s, {{which are based}} on the economic theories of Karl Marx. Some distinguish Marx's economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx's approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of revolutionary socialism or his belief in the inevitability of proletarian revolution. Marxian economics does not exclusively rely upon Marx, but it draws from a range of Marxist and non-Marxist sources. The [...] "dictatorship of the proletariat" [...] or [...] "workers' state" [...] are terms used by some Marxists, particularly Leninists and Marxistâ€“Leninists, to describe <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporary state between the capitalist state of affairs and a communist society. Marx defined the proletariat as salaried workers, in contrast to the lumpenproletariat, who he defined as outcasts of society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes. The political relevance of farmers has divided the left. In Das Kapital, Marx scarcely mentioned the subject. Mao Zedong believed that it would be rural peasants, not urban workers, who would bring about the proletarian revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Julio de la Cueva {{wrote that}} [...] "despite {{the fact that}} the Church... suffer appalling persecution", the events have so far met not only with [...] "the {{embarrassing}} partiality of ecclesiastical scholars, but also with the embarrassed silence or attempts at justification {{of a large number of}} historians and memoirists". Analysts such as Helen Graham have linked the Red and White Terrors, pointing out that it was the coup that allowed the culture of brutal violence to flourish: [...] "its original act of violence was that it killed off the possibility of other forms of peaceful political evolution". Others see the persecution and violence as predating the coup and found in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "radical and antidemocratic" [...] anticlericalism of the Republic and its constitution, with the dissolution of the Jesuits in 1932, the nationalisation of virtually all church property in 1933, the prohibition of teaching religion in schools, the prohibition of teaching by clergy and the violent persecution beginning in 1934 in Asturias, with the murder of 37 priests, religious and seminarians and the burning of 58 churches.|$|E

2500|$|DNA barcoding has {{met with}} {{spirited}} reaction from scientists, especially systematists, ranging from enthusiastic endorsement to vociferous opposition. [...] For example, many stress the fact that DNA barcoding does not provide reliable information above the species level, while others indicate that it is inapplicable at the species level, but may still have merit for higher-level groups. Others resent <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gross oversimplification of the science of taxonomy. And, more practically, some suggest that recently diverged species might not be distinguishable {{on the basis of}} their COI sequences. Due to various phenomena, Funk & Omland (2003) found that some 23% of animal species are polyphyletic if their mtDNA data are accurate, indicating that using an mtDNA barcode to assign a species name to an animal will be ambiguous or erroneous some 23% of the time (see also Meyer & Paulay, 2005). Studies with insects suggest an equal or even greater error rate, due to the frequent lack of correlation between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome or the lack of a barcoding gap (e.g., Hurst and Jiggins, 2005, Whitworth et al., 2007, Wiemers & Fiedler, 2007). Problems with mtDNA arising from male-killing microorganisms and cytoplasmic incompatibility-inducing symbionts (e.g., Wolbachia) are also particularly common among insects. Given that insects represent over 75% of all known organisms, this suggests that while mtDNA barcoding may work for vertebrates, it may not be effective for the majority of known organisms.|$|E
2500|$|Network {{notes were}} parodied at the {{beginning}} of the episode [...] "Day of the Jackanapes". Krusty is shown being pestered by network executives who comment on every choice he makes. He announces his departure of The Krusty the Klown Show after the executives give him notes during filming of a sketch. At the end of the episode, Mr. Teeny is uncertain of where he should throw the plastic explosives that Bart wore. When he sees the two executives discussing in a room, he throws it onto them. Instead of dying of the explosion however, the pieces of the executives reconstitute into what Jean describes as a [...] "super-executive". These sequences were inspired by Jean's dissatisfaction with some network executives, who he felt took control over a television series he was working on before he returned to The Simpsons in 1999. [...] "I had just worked on a show on another network [...] we had a show where there were a lot of notes from executives", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes. In [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] The Simpsons writers mocks the notion of network executives forcing ideas onto a show. The interaction between the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them. The writers understand the show's inner workings, but the network executives' approach improvements to the show from a business point-of-view.
