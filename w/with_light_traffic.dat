40|$|International audienceSound unpleasantness due {{to urban}} road traffic at {{crossroads}} was investigated through a listening test performed in a laboratory environment. Thirty-two sound sequences were created. Four factors were studied: sound level, type of crossroads, traffic density and traffic composition. The results showed that sound unpleasantness was mainly influenced by sound level. Decreasing traffic density {{by a factor of}} 2 also reduced sound unpleasantness. The roundabout was judged less unpleasant than the crossroads <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>lights,</b> when <b>traffic</b> density was high. This outcome may be explained by differences in traffic flow dynamics between the crossroads <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> and the roundabout: on the one hand, for the crossroads <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>lights,</b> the <b>traffic</b> flow resembled a constant pulsed flow, with alternate cycles of acceleration/deceleration; on the other hand, for the roundabout, the traffic flow was more similar to a constant fluid flow, with less marked cycles of acceleration/deceleration. For the roundabout only, sound unpleasantness increased with the presence of heavy vehicles (or buses). Actually, sound sequences <b>with</b> only <b>light</b> vehicles were rated less unpleasant for the roundabout than for the crossroads <b>with</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>lights.</b> This could be due to differences in their spectral pattern. In particular, for traffic-light scenarios, higher levels within the frequency range [400, 3000] Hz occurred when vehicles passed by, in connection with higher vehicle speeds, and higher levels in the high frequencies (around 16 kHz) occurred more often when vehicles stopped, indicating the presence of braking noise with a shrill character...|$|R

New additions are a 24-hour day-to-night cycle, weather effects and traffic with licensed vehicles, adding a realistic aspect to the game. The new dynamic weather system has been reported to alter the gameplay experience, making the vehicle more prone to sliding on slick surfaces. If any damage is inflicted upon a vehicle after races, the player does not necessarily need to drive back to a garage for a full repair, but, instead, can choose the [...] "Quick Fix" [...] option through which old, junkyard-esque parts will be added to the car. To get back that [...] "nice, new car look", the player must actually drive back to repair their vehicle at a garage or gas station. This also means that totaling a vehicle is only possible within a single race or event. With the RAGE system being used for this game, traffic levels fluctuate throughout the day, <b>with</b> <b>light</b> <b>traffic</b> at night, heavy traffic in the morning and afternoon, and heaviest traffic in the evenings. Motorcycles are again part of the game, including the Ducati 999R and the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14. Convertible cars, customizable interiors, in-game photo mode, and customizable exotics are all new additions. Developers placed great emphasis on the elimination of load screens, stating that the player could literally jump from career mode to an online race in under ten seconds.|$|E

In the MCLP, the objective function is to minimize the total link cost. The proposed algorithm is composed of two phases: in the first phase, it generates feasible paths to satisfy the traffic capacity constraint, and finds the exact solution through matching in the second phase. In addition, we have derived several properties of the proposed algorithm. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm has good efficiency for small network <b>with</b> <b>light</b> <b>traffic.</b> Our proposed algorithm {{can be applied to}} find multicast loops for real-time multimedia traffic distribution. ...|$|E

40|$|Pervious {{concrete}} is {{a special}} type of concrete with a high porosity used for concrete flatwork applications that allows water from precipitation and other sources to pass through it, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and recharging ground water levels. The void content can range from 18 to 35 % with compressive strengths of 400 to 4000 psi. The infiltration rate of pervious concrete will fall into the range of 2 to 18 gallons per minute per square foot (80 to 720 liters per minute per square meter). Typically pervious concrete has little to no fine aggregate and has just enough cementitious paste to coat the coarse aggregate particles while preserving the interconnectivity of the voids.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a family of {{heuristic}} approximations for the expected response time of K-dimensional symmetric Fork-Join systems in statistical equilibrium with general inter-arrival and service time distributions. To do this, we rely on the light traffic interpolation technique popularized by Reiman and Simon. The starting point for our approach is the formula for the heavy traffic limit for two dimensional Fork-Join queues that was obtained in [17, 19]. By observing a fortuitous agreement between the light traffic derivative and the heavy traffic limit for this system under Markovian assumptions. we are able to obtain an approximation to the heavy traffic limit for -dimensional systems with general inter-arrival and service distributions.

40|$|This study {{examined}} destination entry while driving with four commercially available route guidance systems.

Test participants drove an instrumented passenger car, accompanied by an experimenter, on a 7. 5 mile multilane test track <b>with</b> <b>light</b> <b>traffic.</b> Results indicated that, on average, all three systems with visual-manual methods of destination entry were associated with lengthier completion times, longer eyes-off-road-ahead times, longer and more frequent glances to the device, and greater numbers of lane exceedences than the voice system. However, the voice system was associated with substantially longer and more frequent glances away from the road scene to a containing destination information.

40|$|Millimeter wave (mmWave) {{communications}} systems are promising candidate to support extremely {{high data rate}} services in future wireless networks. MmWave communications exhibit high penetration loss (blockage) and require directional transmissions to compensate for severe channel attenuations and for high noise powers. When blockage occurs, {{there are at least}} two simple prominent options: 1) switching to the conventional microwave frequencies (fallback option) and 2) using an alternative non-blocked path (relay option). However, currently it is not clear under which conditions and network parameters one option is better than the other. To investigate the performance of the two options, this paper proposes a novel blockage model that allows deriving maximum achievable throughput and delay performance of both options. A simple criterion to decide which option should be taken under which network condition is provided. By a comprehensive performance analysis, it is shown that the right option depends on the payload size, beam training overhead, and blockage probability. For a network <b>with</b> <b>light</b> <b>traffic</b> and low probability of blockage in the direct link, the fallback option is throughput- and delay-optimal. For a network with heavy traffic demands and semi-static topology (low beam-training overhead), the relay option is preferable.

40|$|A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a multi-hop {{wireless}} network with dynamically changing topology. With {{the development of}} MANET technology, various routing protocols have been proposed over the years with minimum control overhead and network resources. AODV {{is the most popular}} routing protocol among others. It is a single path, loop free, On-demand type routing protocol and its performance is better than other routing protocols in MANET environment. However, single path abstraction {{is considered one of the}} biggest drawbacks of AODV. Also, it has more routing overhead both at the time of route discovery and route repair. In the networks <b>with</b> <b>light</b> <b>traffic</b> and low mobility AODV scales flawlessly to the larger networks with low bandwidth and storage overhead. But in networks with heavy traffic, a big number of routes will break resulting in repeated route discoveries and error reports in the network, which is an overhead. The mobile nodes in MANET have limited resources such as battery power, limited bandwidth which the single path protocols cannot handle efficiently. Thus routing is a vital issue in the design of a MANET. Multipath routing allows the establishment of multiple paths between a single source and single destination node. Researchers have proposed many multipath extensions of AODV protocol to establish reliable communication and ensure better load balancing than the conventional protocol. This paper reviews some multipath extensions of AODV routing protocol and a comparative study is done. There is no frontrunner o...|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of distraction-related factors, drivers’ characteristics, {{conditional}} and environmental properties, and features of cars and roads on the occurrence of eight different crash types (including three kinds of single-vehicle crashes and five kinds of two-vehicle crashes) were investigated. Considering single-vehicle crashes along with two-vehicle crashes made this study unique. To investigate the aforementioned effects, the Nested Logit model, which has rarely been used in previous studies was developed. By examining how a factor affects multiple crash type outcomes, {{it is possible to}} devise countermeasures, improvements to roadway geometry, and traffic control strategies, while minimizing unintended consequences. The results should be of value in the design of educational programs; for example, according to the results of run-off-road crashes, drivers’ distraction increases the probability of this type of crash. One {{of the best ways to}} reduce this type of crash is to highlight the devastating effects of distraction in safety improvement programs even in uncrowned roads and roads <b>with</b> <b>light</b> <b>traffic.</b> Furthermore, results can help in road safety improvement, for example reducing the brightness of roads increases the probability of run-off-road crashes. Therefore, in addition to increasing the brightness, increasing the number of reflecting traffic signs or pieces of reflector paint at the curbs also help drivers detect the path more accurately. Reduction of brightness also increases the probability of collision with a pedestrian. It is recommended that authorities provide an enough lightening equipment at the locations which are used by pedestrians. Also, pedestrians can equip some reflectors stuck to their clothes, letting them be easily detected by drivers at night.|$|E
