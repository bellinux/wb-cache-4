50|$|The {{following}} description {{applies to}} a loam soil and agricultural crops. When a field is flooded, {{it is said}} to be saturated and all available air space is occupied by water. The suction required to draw water into a plant root is zero. As the field drains under the influence of gravity (drained water is called gravitational water or drain-able water), the suction a plant must produce to use such water increases to 1/3 bar. At that point, the soil is said to have reached field capacity, and plants that use the water must produce increasingly higher suction, finally up to 15 bar. At 15 bar suction, the soil water amount is called wilting percent. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration; the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts. The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000 bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000 bar suction. All water below <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage</b> is called unavailable water.|$|E
40|$|Information about {{effects of}} {{different}} land use systems on soil physico-chemical properties {{is crucial for}} best land management practices. This study was, therefore, conducted to evaluate the same on Nitosols of Achefer District, Northwestern Ethiopia. The landuse systems studied included grassland, cultivated land, plantation forest and natural forest. The research was superimposed on land use systems that were located nearby on similar soil, contour line and slope classes. Undisturbed core and disturbed composite soil samples were collected randomly from two sites with three replications for each landuse system at two varying depths (0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm). The undisturbed soil samples were analysed for bulk density, particle density, porosity and moisture content at different pressures; while the composite soil samples were analyzed for pH, organic carbon, total N and available P. Results of the study indicated that the lowest bulk and particle densities, the highest total porosity, and higher moisture content at both field capacity and permanent <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage</b> were found under natural forest land use system. In contrast, the highest bulk and particle densities, the lowest total porosity and lower water contents at both field capacity and permanent <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage</b> were obtained under the cultivated landuse system. Soil pH was moderately acidic under all landuse systems. The lowest organic carbon, total N, and C:N ratio were recorded under cultivated land; whereas the highest values of the same parameters were found under natural forest. In all landuse systems, organic carbon and total N decreased with soil depth. The highest and lowest available P contents were recorded under natural forest and grassland, respectively. From {{the results of the}} study it was possible to conclude that conversion of forest lands to cultivated and grasslands had detrimental effects on the soil physico-chemical properties under subsistance farming systems of the study area. It is, therefore, recommended that appropriate and integrated land management options for different land use syetems are required to sustain agricultural productivity while protecting the environment...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the photosynthate allocation between flush and young pods, {{and the effect of}} (naphthalene acetic acid) and (gibberellic acid) application to sink strength. Two cocoa clones KW 163 and KW 165 located in Kaliwining Experimental Station of Indonesian Coffea and Cocoa Research Institut were used on this experiment. Each clone was treated with flushes and without flush. Beside that, the young pods sprayed with NAA 250 mg L- 1, GA  250 mg L- 1, NAA 250 mg L- 1 dan GA 250 mg L- 1 and control (K = without NAA and GA). There were 2 x 4 treatment combinations for each clone, and replicated three trees for each combination. The parameter were cherelle <b>wilt</b> <b>percentage,</b> sucrose content, fresh and dry weight, long and diameter of healthy and wilting pods. The result showed that sink strength of young pods was lower than that of flushes, which caused application photosynthate translocation to the young pods was lower. NAA and GA application to the pods could improve sucrose allocation, increased pod weight and cherelle wilt was suppressed. The lack of photosynthate on young pod cause metabolism change, so pod became cherelle wilt. But, there was still not known the optimum concentration and method of application of those growth regulators to obtained minimum cherelle wilt. Key words: Cocoa, flush, pod, naphthylacatic acid, gibberellic acid, cherelle wilt. </p...|$|R

40|$|Tuberose (Polianthus tuberosa) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} cut flower; but its longevity and quality characteristics are compromised by stress during storage and transportation. Thus, {{it is important}} to determine the most appropriate preservative solution to best maintained cut flowers. Tests were done to examine the effects on of nano-silver (NS) (0, 15, 30 and 45 mg L- 1 and sucrose (0, 4 and 8 %) on the quality properties of fresh weight, relative water content, water uptake, total soluble solids, <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage,</b> flower opening and flower longevity. Results showed that averages of evaluations for flower longevity, open flower and stem diameter, fresh weight and relative water content increased under sucrose application and that those for while flower longevity, open flower and stem diameter, water uptake, fresh weight and relative water uptake were increased by NS application. However, applications of 4 % sucrose or 45 mg L- 1 NS treatments enhanced all measured parameters, with only a few exceptions. These parameters were further increased under the treatment of sucrose at 4 % combined with 45 mg L- 1 NS, suggesting that the quality of tuberose cut flowers can be improved by treatment with a combination of sucrose and NS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate some of the drought resistance criteria at seedling stage in wheat. A factorial experiment in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used with two factors consisted of stress levels (0, - 5 and - 8 bar) using PEG 6000 and genotypes (10 genotypes of bread wheat; Azar 2, Gahar, Koohdasht, Bow, Zagros, Cham, Niknejad, El Neilairi, Bohoih and Giza 164) in three replications in a hydroponic condition. Stress Tolerance Index (STI), Water Use Efficiency (WUE), Biological Yield (BY), Shoot Dry Weight (SDW), Root Dry Weight (RDW), Root/Shoot weight ratio (R/S), Root Length (RL), Relative Water Content (RWC), <b>Wilting</b> <b>Percentage</b> (WP) and first and 2 nd Leaves Extention Rate (LER 1 and LER 2) were measured at seedling stage. Increasing stress levels caused reduction in BY, SDW, RDW, RL, RWC, LER 1 and LER 2, but an increase in WUE, DWR, R/S and WP. Azar 2, Gahar, Koohdasht, Zagros and Bow were in favorite condition in regard to STI, WUE and other criteria. Therefore, they are drought tolerant and might be suitable genotypes at water deficit conditions. Niknejad, El Neilairi and Cham were moderate and Giza 164 and Bohoih were sensitive genotypes to drought conditions. This research revealed that at - 5 bar, WUE, BY, SDW, R/S and LER 2 and at - 8 bar, WUE, BY and WP were suitable criteria for selection of drought resistant genotypes at seedling stage...|$|E
40|$|Studies to {{determine}} the effect of various soil moisture regimes on the internal water balance and on the growth and yield of sugar cane were conducted in the Department of Agricultural Botany, D. P. College of Agriculture, Philippines from 1965 to 1967. Experiments were also conducted {{to determine}} a relationship between some physiological processes and plant growth as a result of moisture stress. The results showed that with an increase in soil moisture stress, growth based on stem height, leaf area, total number of leaves, length of internode and diameter of canes, dry weight of tops and yield based on total millable cana, per cent juice in cane and per cent sucrose content in the juice all decreased significantly optimum growth and yields were obtained at field capacity. The internal water balances in sugar cane, measured by relative turgidity was found to have more profound effect on plant growth rather than the degree of moisture stress in the soils This was concluded since the plants subjected to low atmospheric stress (low air tem perature) made a growth (based on stem and leaf area increment) which was almost independent of soil moisture between the range of field capacity and permanent <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage.</b> This was further attributed to a favor able internal water balance maintained by plants under such conditions. When the relative turgidity in plants was changed from 90 to 80 per cent, the reduction in growth was largely attributed to a reduction in the relative activity of gibberellin-like substances. However, when the relative turgidity fell below 80 per cent, the reduction in growth was attributed to a loss of turgence subsequently inhibiting the net assimilation rate...|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid-responsive element binding protein (AREB 1) {{is a basic}} domain/leucine zipper {{transcription}} factor that binds to the abscisic acid (ABA) -responsive element motif in the promoter region of ABA-inducible genes. Because AREB 1 {{is not sufficient to}} direct the expression of downstream genes under non-stress conditions, an activated form of AREB 1 (AREB 1 Delta QT) was created. Several reports claim that plants overexpressing AREB 1 or AREB 1 Delta QT show improved drought tolerance. In our studies, soybean plants overexpressing AREB 1 Delta QT were characterized molecularly, and the phenotype and drought response of three lines were accessed under greenhouse conditions. Under conditions of water deficit, the transformed plants presented a higher survival rate (100 %) than those of their isoline, cultivar BR 16 (40 %). Moreover, the transformed plants displayed better water use efficiency and had a higher number of leaves than their isoline. Because the transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductance than its isoline under well-watered conditions, it was suggested that the enhanced drought response of AREB 1 Delta QT soybean plants might not be associated with altered transpiration rates mediated by ABA-dependent stomatal closure. However, {{it is possible that the}} smaller leaf area of the transgenic plants reduced their transpiration and water use, causing delayed stress onset. The difference in the degree of <b>wilting</b> and <b>percentage</b> of survival between the 35 S-AREB 1 Delta QT and wildtype plants may also be related to the regulation of genes that protect against dehydration because metabolic impairment of photosynthesis, deduced by an increasing internal CO 2 concentration, was not observed in the transgenic plants...|$|R

This nursery was infested artificially with the four clonal lineages of C. maydis found in Egypt that causes late wilt of maize and commonly used in Egyptian maize breeding programs (Zeller et al. 2002). Maize grains cv. Baladi were used in this study. The abovementioned treatments in greenhouse were involved in field experiments. Disinfected maize grains (Baladi cv.) were soaked in each treatment at the rate of 100  ml/ 100 grain. Control grains were soaked in sterile distilled water only. Randomized complete block arrangement in three replicate plots was used. Each replicate included three ridges of 4.5 -m length and 0.7 -m width for each ridge, i.e., the experimental plot area was 3.15  m 2. Thirteen maize plants for each treatment were used in each replicate. Grains were sown in holes (five holes/ridge with three grains/hole); thereafter, they were thinned to one plant/hole. The abovementioned treatments were also applied before irrigation with water at three equal doses (10  ml per hole) each 15  days. Irrigation, recommended fertilizer levels, and agronomical practices were used as usual. Disease incidence of late <b>wilt</b> as infection <b>percentage</b> was recorded 110  days after sowing. Quantitative maize yield and qualitative maize yield, i.e., ear length, ear diameter, no. of rows per ear, no. of kernels per row, no. of kernels per ear, and 100 -kernel weight, were evaluated during harvest period.|$|R
40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} problems affecting sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) growth and yield in many tropical countries including Highland Papua of Eastern Indonesia, where it is grown as a staple crop under rainfed conditions. Some genotypes survive during drought, while many others fail. This condition regularly devastates sweet potato growth and threatens the lives of highland Papuan people. On the other hand, research into the effects of drought and on the growth, yield, and water relations of sweet potato remains limited. A series of pot and field trials therefore was conducted to identify the drought tolerance of sweet potato cultivars available in Australia. The influence of soil water regimes on the physiology, growth, and yield of sweet potato was studied to determine the critical soil water levels that sweet potato could tolerate and produce acceptable yields. The influence of nutrient supply (N and K) on water use efficiency in sweet potato was also studied. A grafting trial was carried out to examine the nature of the physiological signal between shoot and root in relation to transpiration efficiency and yield responses in sweet potato. The cultivars Lole and Hawaii showed more strongly developed drought resistant characters than all of the other cultivars. They have better water use efficiency, maintain higher plant water status under drought stress by delaying <b>wilting,</b> and lower <b>percentage</b> decrease in leaf water potential indicating their greater tolerance to water stress at the stage of vegetative growth. Field trials were conducted to determine tuber yields from the same 15 sweet potato cultivars under well-watered conditions. The Lole and Hawaii cultivars produced low tuber yields, whereas the Beerwah Gold and Wanmun cultivars produced the greatest yields when not water stressed. The Lole cultivar representing the vegetative tolerant and Wanmun cv representing the susceptible genotypes were grown in a glasshouse to observe the degree to which sweet potato cultivars could withstand water stress conditions and still produce good tuber yields. The Wanmun cultivar, which grew and produced good yields under well-watered conditions, was strongly affected by water stress. On the other hand, the Lole cultivar showed more drought tolerance, indicated by greater plant water status, including leaf water potential and relative water contents. At maturity, tuber sucrose contents increased while the starch contents decreased. Under drought conditions, cv Lole tubers had higher sucrose and lower starch contents than cv Wanmun. Tuber yields were greater in cv Wanmun when not stressed; Lole on the other hand produced marketable tuber size when water was restricted to ≥ 40...|$|R
