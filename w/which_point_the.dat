5|$|Since the {{remainders}} decrease {{with every}} step but can never be negative, a remainder r'N must eventually equal zero, at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> algorithm stops.

Thunderbirds, Lady Penelope and Captain Scarlet and Thunderbirds annuals {{were published in the}} late 1960s; during the same period, eight original novels were written.

5|$|Across {{the county}} {{line in the}} town of Caton, NY225 {{continues}} west through the gully for another , slowly rising in elevation as it heads past a small number of isolated homes. The creek reaches its source near NY225's junction with the southern terminus of CR34 (Whiskey Creek Road), at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> route ascends out of the valley and heads southwest across lightly developed, relatively level terrain to the small hamlet of Caton. In the center of the community, NY225 intersects CR32 (Caton–Seeley Creek Road) and CR120 (Tannery Creek Road). NY225 turns northwest at this intersection, becoming Caton Road as it follows Caton Creek out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly two}} weeks of inactivity, an area of {{disturbed}} weather developed in the Bay of Campeche and quickly became better organized. It was designated Tropical Depression Two {{on the evening of}} June 28, and, two hours later, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that it had strengthened into a tropical storm, at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> system was named Bret.

As the group advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where {{they were to be}} quartered, they were met by a crowd of 500.

This Edmund Clerke was the Sheriff of Hampshire and clerk to the Signet in 1671.

5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1960s, the Supremes {{achieved}} mainstream {{success with}} Ross as lead singer and Holland-Dozier-Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. Ross left {{to pursue a}} solo career in 1970 {{and was replaced by}} Jean Terrell, at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> group's name reverted to The Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s. The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after 18 years.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Doria was {{an unusual}} and erratic {{hurricane}} that existed during September 1967. The fourth named storm and hurricane of the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season, Doria developed on September 8 off {{the east coast of}} Florida. It meandered until attaining tropical storm status, at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> storm accelerated towards the northeast. On September 10, Doria intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After moving out to sea, the storm turned westward towards the United States. A compact cyclone, Doria weakened to a tropical storm shortly before moving ashore in the Mid-Atlantic States. The storm ultimately dissipated on September 21.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E

The Christian kingdoms pushed the Muslim Moors and Almohads back in frequent Papal-endorsed Iberian Crusades from 1212 to 1265.

5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of Plasmodium, a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E

In between the two streets, NY376 intersects Main Street (CR114).
