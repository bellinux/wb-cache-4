25|$|Though {{this period}} of Bourgeoys' life in New France pales in {{comparison}} to her later years in terms of expansionary scope and influence, it is often seen as much more intimate. Bourgeoys would have known practically everyone in the colony. However, she also faced difficult struggles during her first years there. There were no children to teach due to the high levels of infant mortality, which frustrated her plan to provide education. Despite this, she took it upon herself to help the community in any <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> often working alongside the settlers.|$|E
25|$|Helm {{believed}} in making all philanthropic and missionary work distinctively Church work. To this end she {{wrote for the}} Church papers. Many of her articles appeared in the Nashville Christian Advocate and in the St. Louis Christian Advocate. Through them, she became known to the entire Church. Many of the bishops and other dignitaries of the Church were her staunch friends. Soon after the department of Church Extension of the M. E. Church, South, was organized, in 1882, with Dr. David Morton as General Secretary, she went to {{him and told him}} she wanted to assist in that work in any <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> He appreciated her her commitment, and she began writing in the interest of Church Extension.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard) Chalet Maid/Yellowcoat – Peggy was {{the maid}} who looked after the staff chalet lines under the {{supervision}} of the fearsome Miss Cathcart. She always aspired to be a Yellowcoat, and tried her hardest to get involved with the entertainment in any <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> Born in Lancashire in 1931, her father worked for the coal and gaslight company and had a passion for motorbike racing, and Peggy was an experienced rider who had a licence by the time she was 16. Her father had died by the time she joined Maplins, and Peggy was supporting her widowed mother from her wages. In addition to her regular duties, she often helped out the entertainment staff, and could always be seen in the evenings in the Hawaiian ballroom, enjoying (and often joining in with) the evening entertainments. She frequently tried to get involved in the entertainment events, but was always stopped by Gladys, who forbade Peggy's involvement as she was not on the entertainment staff. However, on several occasions, Gladys was overruled by Jeffrey Fairbrother, who allowed Peggy to take part in certain events, which usually involved dressing up in silly costumes to take the place of certain members of the entertainment staff (usually Yvonne) who found it humiliating. Peggy used to play the organ in chapel, and stepped in when Ramona didn't turn up to play at the Marines event. Peggy had a rather vivid imagination and was often easily taken in by others' lies, particularly Ted's ridiculous tales when he needed a cover story. Peggy finally became a Yellowcoat in the final episode, when Dawn was hospitalised and they needed a replacement. After spending just one day as a Yellowcoat, she collapsed from nervous exhaustion and was admitted to hospital. Her job as a Yellowcoat was tragically short-lived, due to Maplins abolishing Yellowcoats after the 1960 season. She stayed on at the camp temporarily after the season ended, but in her old position as a chalet maid, claiming it was still a job and better than being out of work. It was left unknown whether Peggy continued working at Maplins after the 1960 season or whether she moved on.|$|E

At times she can be very bossy, arrogant, and uppity.

500|$|Fortunately for Northrup – {{as it was}} {{the peak}} of the McCarthyite [...] "Red Scare" [...] – Hubbard's {{allegations}} were apparently ignored by the FBI, which filed his letter but took no further action.

She met him in Wichita to resolve the situation.

5000|$|Coppola had {{initially}} expressed {{an aversion to}} a remake, but after watching the 1971 version {{at the urging of}} production designer Anne Rose, she was left contemplating <b>ways</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> update the film. Specifically, she became interested in showing the story from the women's point of view, as opposed to the man's. The material came to Coppola at a time where she wanted to make a more optimistic film than 2013's The Bling Ring, stating that she wanted to [...] "cleanse myself" [...] from what she terms was [...] "such a tacky, ugly world".|$|R

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{terrorist}} attack known as the Alexandria Incident, which claimed 3,000 lives, Cable re-formed the mutant black ops team [...] so that mutantkind not only had a continued place in the world, but also had a stake in it. While Cable recruited Fantomex, Marrow and Dr. Nemesis as his teammates, Psylocke actually sought Cable because she couldn't bear staying away from X-Force as she admitted she was addicted to killing. Their first mission had the team track and face Volga, a wealthy business man responsible for the abduction and weaponization of several mutants and depowered mutants. As a member of X-Force, Psylocke grew more bloodthirsty, self-loathing and broken by the day, admitting that resorting to killing was the only <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel anything at all. She also kept a sexual relationship with Cable. X-Force also faced Fantomex, who was driven to the point of insanity and received god-like powers. Psylocke ultimately used her mind blade to scramble Fantomex's brain.|$|E
2500|$|Adonis Jordan {{was born}} as the fourth son to Josephine Jordan in Brooklyn, New York. [...] His mother named her son after the Greek mythological {{character}} Adonis, {{a handsome young}} man who was fabled to be the love interest of the goddess Aphrodite. She worked as a secretary for an insurance company while her son spent his time playing pick-up street basketball on Brooklyn blacktop courts. [...] Jordan was enrolled by his mother at Theodore Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, New York, across town from where she worked. [...] Although the decision necessitated a 45-minute commute each <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be assured that her son would receive an education in a safer environment compared to their Brooklyn surroundings. [...] Adonis Jordan played high school basketball at Roosevelt High and blossomed in his second year, being one of only two sophomores named to the New York All-City team. [...] However Jordan's stay in New York was cut short when his mother suddenly decided to relocate to California in 1987 after a two-week visit to see relatives in the state.|$|E

The tears, whatever might be their effect upon her, did Henrietta good, and restored her to something more like her proper senses. She grew rather alarmed, too, when she saw her mamma's pale looks, as she leant back almost exhausted with anxiety and repressed agitation.|$|R
2500|$|On October 5, 1993, Bloomquist {{was arrested}} and charged for {{possessing}} 2.7grams of cocaine. [...] "A girl I dated talked me into having someone get some cocaine for her," [...] Bloomquist said. [...] "She had gotten into trouble and the only <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get out was by setting me up. And she talked me into doing something that no one else has ever been able to do." [...] Bloomquist was found not guilty of felony sale and distribution and guilty of misdemeanor drug possession and possessing drug paraphernalia. [...] "When they searched the house they found a short straw that had some residue of cocaine in it. The girl had left it there," [...] Bloomquist said. He was sentenced in November 1994 to the maximum penalty, a $5,000 fine and one year in prison. It was his first misdemeanor conviction, and he filed an appeal. His sentence was cut in half to 6 months in jail. He served his time as a work release beginning in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Since first {{being brought}} to {{scholarly}} attention in 1958, numerous media sources and publications have asserted {{over the years that}} a single surviving print reportedly showing the only known image of Mozart's widow is that of Constanze (Mozart) Nissen herself at age 78. The photograph, or daguerreotype, was supposedly taken in Altotting, Bavaria in October 1840 outside the home of composer Max Keller. However, several Mozart scholars have refuted the claim as a hoax for various reasons. First, the photograph could not have been taken outdoors since claims that the lenses to produce such images were not invented by Joseph Petzval until after Constanze had died in 1842. Second, it is documented that Constanze was crippled from debilitating arthritis in her final years of life. As Agnes Selby, author of Constanze, Mozart's Beloved, offered her opinion regarding the photograph on the Classical Music Guide Forums website on July 8, 2006: [...] "There is absolutely no <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have traveled to visit Maximillian Keller during the period when the photograph was taken. Contrary to the statements made in the newspaper, Constanze had no contact with Keller since 1826." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song {{received}} polarizing {{reviews from}} music critics. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine praised {{the composition of}} the song, writing [...] "Harris's electro fingerprints are all over this one — it plays like a straight house track, with some dreamy Rihanna vocals added in over the beat." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator commented on the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "We found love in a hopeless place", writing that it is possibly the best lyric in pop music so far in 2011. A reviewer for Instinct magazine praised the song, writing that [...] "We Found Love" [...] does not mark a departure from the dance-floor oriented material Rihanna debuted on Loud, but it certainly boasts [...] "a higher-energy, peak-hour vibe". Similarly, Michael Cragg of The Guardian commented that the song takes the dance direction Rihanna hinted at on [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] and continues releasing similar songs, making reference to [...] "We Found Love". Cragg also likened the song to Leona Lewis's recent single, [...] "Collide", but criticized the song's structure, writing [...] " [...] is slightly odd". He ended his review writing, [...] "Either <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have recited Nick Clegg's conference speech from Wednesday over the sound of Harris cracking his knuckles {{and it would be a}} hit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Miller also {{researched}} how troublesome {{children were}} treated at the Tavistock Clinic, where imitation {{is often used}} during therapy; [...] "there are ways in which a skilful therapist will gently mock a child out of a tantrum by giving an amusing imitation of the tantrum immediately after it's happened. The child then has a mirror held up to it and is capable of seeing {{what it looks like}} to others." [...] In his review of the adaptation for the Financial Times, Chris Dunkley referred to this issue, calling Cleese's Petruchio [...] "an eccentrically pragmatic social worker using the wayward client's own doubtful habits to calm her down." [...] Actress Sarah Badel had a similar conception of the psychology behind the production. She constructed an [...] "imaginary biography" [...] for Katherina, arguing [...] "She's a woman of such passion [...] a woman of such enormous capacity for love that the only <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be happy is to find a man of equal capacity. Therefore she's mad for lack of love [...] he feigns madness, she is teetering on the edge of it. Petruchio is the only man who shows her what she's like." [...] In this reading of the play, the production was at least partially based on Miller's own 1972 Chichester Festival stage production starring Joan Plowright and Anthony Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|Shaw also {{testified that}} four months later, in September 1988, she got drunk with Allan and {{accompanied}} {{her to a}} 1 am rendezvous with Terre'Blanche. She alleged she watched from a wall as the couple kissed, embraced and fondled {{for half an hour}} in the back of Allan's car. Terre'Blanche denied ever having met Shaw. [...] Allan alleged that Shaw had sinister motivations for testifying against her, saying [...] "she has told people she was obsessed with me and that was the only <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> exorcise me. She was openly bisexual." [...] She also agreed with the statement that Shaw was a [...] "habitual liar" [...] and continued [...] "I disapproved of the number of men she had traipsing into her bedroom and suggested she should have a turnstile on her bedroom door". Andrew Broulidakis, a childhood friend of Allan's who also knew Shaw, brought into question the latter's character in a draft statement supplied to the court. Sebastian Faulks remarked in The Guardian: [...] "What is it that makes George Carman worth £10,000 a day when plaintiffs witness Andrew Broulidakis was so easily able to wrong foot him." [...] A witness also alleged that Shaw had disparagingly referred to Allan as a [...] "frigid bitch" [...] {{and it would be a}} [...] "scream" [...] to have her [...] "nailed for gang-banging Nazis". Shaw also faced allegations that she had deliberately gotten pregnant to ensnare a boyfriend and that she had said [...] "I Never trust a man until I've slept with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West {{called for}} a [...] "spirit of candor" [...] in society that would allow for {{tolerance}} of gay and bisexual people as an [...] "inevitable evil". Much influenced by the theories promoted by sexologists like Magnus Hirschfeld, Edward Carpenter, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud, Sackville-West presented her sexuality as abnormal and wrong and due to some psychological flaw she was born with, portraying heterosexuality as the norm that she wanted, but {{failed to live up}} to. Several times, Sackville-West stated that she wrote Portrait of a Marriage for scientific purposes so people would be able to understand bisexual people, which would [...] thus allow her, despite her self-condemnation, to present her sexuality as in some way normal. Several of the sexologists Sackville-West cited, most notably Carpenter and Ellis, had argued that homosexuality and bisexuality were in fact normal, and despite her condemning herself, her use of a [...] "scientific" [...] approach backed up with quotes from Ellis and Carpenter allowed her to present her bisexuality as implicitly normal. Writing in the third person, Sackville-West declared [...] "she regrets that the person Harold married wasn't entirely and wholly what he had thought of her, and that the person who loves and owns Violet isn't a second person, because each suits each other". Sackville-West presented her sexuality as part of the personality she had been born with, portraying herself as an accursed woman who should be the object of sympathy, not condemnation. Even in 1973, when her son Nigel Nicolson published Portrait of a Marriage, he was uncertain {{if he was going to}} be charged with obscenity or not, going to considerable lengths to stress the legitimacy of a love for a person of the same sex in his introduction. Despite portraying herself as some way [...] "deviant" [...] because of her feelings for women, Sackville-West also wrote in Portrait of a Marriage of the discovery and acceptance of her bisexuality as a teenager as the joyous [...] "liberation of half my personality", suggesting that she did not really see herself as a woman with [...] "deviant" [...] sexuality, as this statement contradicted what she had written at the beginning of the book about her [...] "perverted" [...] sexuality. Johnson wrote that Sackville-West, in presenting the lesbian side of herself in terms that depicted Trefusis as evil and Nicolson as good, was the only way possible at the time to express this side of her personality, writing [...] "even if annihilating herself seemed the only <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> present any type of acceptable self." ...|$|E
