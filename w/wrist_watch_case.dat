50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{shortly before the}} Hamilton Watch Company took over, Illinois began {{commissioning}} its own unique <b>wrist</b> <b>watch</b> <b>cases.</b> The company cased and boxed its watches at the factory, marking {{the beginning of what}} many collectors consider the company's golden era, during which the finest watches were made. Models include the Picadilly, Major, Marquis, Chieftain, Ritz, New Yorker and Manhattan (the New Yorker came with a leather strap, the Manhattan with a metal one), Jolly Roger, Viking, Wembley/Medalist, Speedway, Guardsman, Trophy/Westchester, the Beau series (Beau Monde, Beau Geste, Beau Brummel, and Beau Royale), the Mate, and the top of the line 14-karat solid gold Consul. Many collectors consider The Consul to be the finest American <b>wrist</b> <b>watch</b> ever made—examples with original silver pinstripe dials, starburst dials, and with a small second hand are especially desired. Some of these art deco models also came in 2-tone gold (white gold sections along with yellow or green gold) which are also very desired and rare.|$|R

40|$|Vibro-tactile {{stimulation}} {{has been}} revealed as a potentially effective means to deliver spontaneous notifications like alerts to recipients that {{are focused on}} other tasks (although only at very low bit rates, and {{depending on the place}} at which the tactors are placed). This work addresses the issue of the amount of information that can be perceived via stimuli coming from wrist worn tactors, given the recipient is not expecting or attentive to the potential occurrence of an alert. Assuming apparel like <b>wrist</b> <b>watches</b> with embedded tactors to represent the alert delivery platform, we investigate-respecting physiognomical properties of tactile perceptionthe effectiveness of different tactor placements. We compare the case of embedding 4 tactors underneath the “face ” of the <b>wrist</b> <b>watch,</b> against the <b>case</b> of embedding it into the wristband (“wrist”). A user study of 1, 823 trials has been conducted involving recipients exposed to different levels of engagement in a certain activity. The experiments show, that the amount of information perceived via spontaneous tactile alerts ranges from 1. 90 – 2. 49 bits at low, to 1. 59 – 2. 41 bits at high levels of engagement. The “wrist ” tactor placement achieves a 41. 6 % higher perception bit rate than the “face” tactor placement...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effects of {{environmental}} claims and claim specificity on advertisement effectiveness. An experimental study is conducted using hypothetical print advertisements for three product categories, namely laundry machines, <b>wrist</b> <b>watches,</b> and DVD players. Findings indicate {{that the existence of}} environmental claims significantly improves respondent evaluations in the <b>wrist</b> <b>watches</b> and DVD players categories, whereas in the laundry machines category no such effects are observed. In addition, advertising claim specificity (using vague versus specific claims) significantly improves consumer evaluations of DVD players but does not seem to exert significant effects on evaluations of laundry machines and <b>wrist</b> <b>watches.</b> Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.

The first series of purpose-made <b>wrist</b> <b>watches</b> was produced by Girard-Perregaux in 1880 for the German Navy. During World War I numerous companies, including Omega, Longines, and others produced <b>wrist</b> <b>watches</b> for the military. These watches were of virtually identical style with an enamel dial, wide white numerals, and a luminescent radium hour hand. Often they did not bear {{the name of the}} manufacturer, though the movement, originally designed in the 1890s for ladies’ pendant watches, was marked [...] "Swiss". From pocket watches those trench watches inherited hinged front and back covers. The lugs for a strap looked like a thick wire attachment to the classical round shape of pocket watches rather than an integrated part of the body of the later and modern <b>wrist</b> <b>watches.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Personal {{items such}} as mobile phones and <b>wrist</b> <b>watches</b> are {{commonly}} used by doctors working in the operation theatre.

Method: Forty five anaesthetic doctors working in the operation theatres at Colombo South Teaching Hospital and Ratnapura General Hospital were enrolled in the study. Swabs from fingertips, keypads of mobile phones and <b>wrist</b> <b>watches</b> were taken using moist sterile swabs and plated on Mac Conkey and Blood agar plates.
