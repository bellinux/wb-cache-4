500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, the latter of which is set {{six months after the}} events of Iron Man, Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E

When asked about {{the first time she}} performed an Amanar in competition, Maroney said, [...] "The first time I did it was at Visa Championships and I was just thirteen years old. I was just really little and I didn't really know what was going on. [...] But I just did it, and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> happy that I landed on my feet." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{sneak peek}} {{of the video}} was shown on the April 5, 2012 episode of American Idol, while the full video premiered later that day on Lopez's Vevo Channel. Lopez's boyfriend Casper Smart, also a choreography and dancer, appears in the video. Lopez told Extra TV {{that it was very}} [...] "natural" [...] working with Smart, [...] "It was just a very natural thing for us to do that together. Everything that the song is saying—where I'm at—it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> natural. It didn't feel forced." [...] The video uses product {{placement}} for both Lopez's fragrance, Glowing and Voli vodka, for which Pitbull is a spokesperson for.|$|E
2500|$|It was Ferrari's eighth one-two {{finish of}} the season. Barrichello said [...] "To win, it was very, very, very good... I {{got to the}} last corner, I didn't {{know what to do}} and nothing has been said. Michael <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> kind to, you know, let us finish equally. I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?" [...] Schumacher said [...] "The end of the race was not planned... We tried to cross the line {{together}} but failed by a tiny bit and in fact we did not know who had won until {{we got out of the}} cars. I just felt Rubens deserved to win this race." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ullman {{became an}} American citizen in December 2006 and holds dual {{citizenship}} in the United States and the United Kingdom. The {{results of the}} 2004 United States presidential election, and a comment made by actor Tom Hanks, prompted her desire to naturalise. “Tom Hanks was standing in a corridor at a party and I said something, and he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> nice and he went, ‘Oh, yeah. I know that but you’re British. You know, you don’t {{have to put up}} with that stuff ... I went, ‘No. Actually I’ve been here a long time.‘ I thought, that’s it. I’m going to join in. So I took the [...] test.” In 2006, she topped the list for the [...] "Wealthiest British Comedians," [...] with an estimated wealth of £75 million. In 2015, Ullman's wealth was estimated to be £77 million, making her the wealthiest British actress and female comedian. In 2017, The Sunday Times increased it to £80 million.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} {{section of}} the line passes through relatively large towns and the stations are conveniently located for each centre, except for Neckarbischofsheim Nord station. Between Aglasterhausen and Neckarelz on the other hand, the intermediate station, except for Obrigheim, were far from the places they served, which <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> small villages. Therefore, the section had low utilisation, ultimately leading to its closure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more that}} we learn about these animals the more we find that there is {{basically}} no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors like velociraptor.

2500|$|Westbrook's {{struggle}} with cocaine addiction {{has been widely}} documented in the British press and media. She has confessed that she first tried the drug {{at the age of}} 14, in a nightclub. After winning her role in EastEnders at the age of 16, Westbrook was a regular on the London club scene, and her cocaine usage escalated. She has commented [...] "I was always in clubs and everyone was doing coke and it was glamorous – except obviously, it wasn't at all. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> young, very stupid and very easily led...I think there should be someone at EastEnders to say to young people when they come in, 'Look, your life is about to change, you're going to be invited to things, and you'll be offered drugs.' Someone who can tell them what sort of people are about, and what sort of papers, and how quickly what you've worked for all those years can be gone." [...] It is estimated that she has spent over £250,000 on drugs, used 5g of cocaine every single day throughout her first pregnancy, and has admitted that during her lowest ebb she attempted suicide several times.|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the show}} denies {{that the three}} judges {{influence}} performance order, the production company has never confirmed that the order is random or based on any objective criteria. The lack of objective criteria is underlined by Morgan's comments {{four days after the}} final: [...] "I think Flawless were unlucky to have gone on first. If they had gone last it may have been different. They're both amazing dance groups. Diversity <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> lucky." ...|$|R

5000|$|On another occasion, Bellisario stated, [...] "I can't {{say enough}} about Michael Weatherly...He started out on NCIS playing a {{character}} who <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> unlikable to some women because he {{was just such a}} chauvinist, and he has gradually over the seasons changed.

5000|$|While on the road, {{everything}} they wanted was paid for, {{but once they}} got back to England, four years and 21 tours later {{there was no money}} in the bank.

More likely, Peter Case <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>very</b> capable instead of great. This is (again) a collection of well-crafted songs; all of the pieces (again) seem to be here. The playing and songs are top-drawer; the voice is simply…nice." ...|$|R
