5|$|A study {{commissioned}} by Experian rated Trafford as {{the strongest and}} most resilient borough in North West England to dealing <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> changes in the economy. Trafford's low reliance on vulnerable businesses in the current recession and its high proportion of multinational companies were two factors which give the borough its high ranking.|$|E
5|$|Habré started, on 2 January 1987, his reconquest of {{northern}} Chad with a successful {{attack on the}} well-defended Libyan communications base of Fada. Against the Libyan army the Chadian commander Hassan Djamous {{conducted a series of}} swift pincer movements, enveloping the Libyan positions and crushing them <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> attacks from all sides. This strategy was repeated by Djamous in March in the battles of B'ir Kora and Ouadi Doum, inflicting crushing losses and forcing Gaddafi to evacuate northern Chad.|$|E
5|$|When Fauré {{returned}} to Paris in October 1871, {{he was appointed}} choirmaster at the Église Saint-Sulpice under the composer and organist Charles-Marie Widor. In {{the course of his}} duties, he wrote several canticles and motets, few of which have survived. During some services, Widor and Fauré improvised simultaneously at the church's two organs, trying to catch each other out <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> changes of key. Fauré regularly attended Saint-Saëns's musical salons and those of Pauline Viardot, to whom Saint-Saëns introduced him.|$|E

5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, and releases it {{at times of}} high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations. It {{is also used to}} cope <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> surges in the demand for electricity, such as at the end of television programmes. Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
25|$|Agranulocytosis may be asymptomatic, or may {{clinically}} present <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> fever, rigors {{and sore}} throat. Infection of any organ may be rapidly progressive (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection). Septicemia may also progress rapidly.|$|E

25|$|Cluster {{headaches}} {{are relatively}} rare (1–3 in 10,000 people) {{and are more}} common in men than women. They present <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (tearing, runny nose and red eye).|$|E

25|$|Pain is not {{typically}} present in pellucid marginal degeneration, and aside from vision loss, no symptoms accompany the condition. However, in rare cases, PMD may present <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> onset vision loss and excruciating eye pain, which occurs if the thinning of the cornea leads to perforation. While PMD usually affects both eyes, some unilateral {{cases have been}} reported.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the deaths}} {{associated}} with Tasers are given a diagnosis of excited delirium, a term for a phenomenon that manifests as a combination of delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent and bizarre behavior, insensitivity to pain, elevated body temperature, and increased strength. Excited delirium is associated <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> death (usually via cardiac or respiratory arrest) particularly following the use of physical control measures, including police restraint and Tasers. Excited delirium most commonly arises in male subjects {{with a history of}} serious mental illness and/or acute or chronic drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine. Alcohol withdrawal or head trauma may also contribute to the condition.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{progressive}} aphasia (PPA), {{while its}} name can be misleading, {{is actually a}} form of dementia that has some symptoms closely related to several forms of aphasia. It {{is characterized by a}} gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.|$|E

25|$|From late 1976, Loyde {{lived in}} the United Kingdom, unhappy with the Australian media's {{continued}} linking of his music to violent sharpie brawls. In London, he unsuccessfully attempted to get Obsecretion released and Southern Electric's new material recorded. He ran Front of House sound for new wave bands including Doll by Doll. He returned to Australia in 1979 to form Lobby Loyde <b>with</b> <b>Sudden</b> Electric. He recruited former band mates Mándu and Matthews and {{they were joined by}} Gavin Carroll on bass guitar. Sydney's radio station, 2JJ broadcast a live-to-air performance in mid-1979 which was recorded as Live with Dubs – the vocals were re-done by Mándu and guest vocalist Anderson (then with Rose Tattoo) – and released in 1980 by Mushroom Records.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the tea season was {{during the early stages}} of the South-West monsoon in the China Sea, so head winds would be experienced, and very light or {{variable}} winds together <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> squalls. Many captains sailing for the Sunda Strait therefore chose to head westward to the coast of Annam (present day Vietnam) to pick up land breezes. This involved tacking at the most favourable moment to be close inshore for the {{start of the}} land breeze, often in the middle of the night. Crossing to the Annam coast meant passing the Paracels, an area of low-lying islands and reefs which presented obvious dangers. From the coast of Annam, the usual route was to head south to the coast of Borneo, again to take advantage of land and sea breezes.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 146 Propertius manuscripts survive, {{the oldest of}} which dates from the 12th century. However, some of the poems in these manuscripts appear disjointed, such as I.8, which begins as a plea for Cynthia to abandon a planned sea voyage, then closes <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> joy that the voyage has been called off. This poem has {{therefore}} been split by most scholars into a I.8a (comprising the first 26 lines) and I.8b (lines 27-46). More complicated organizational problems are presented by poems like II.26, a confusing piece in which Propertius first (1) dreams of Cynthia being shipwrecked, and then (2) praises Cynthia's faithfulness. Following this, he (3) declares that she plans to sail and he will come along, (4) shifts to the couple together on the shore, and then (5) quickly has them back on-board ship, ready to face the potential dangers of the sea. The images seem to conflict logically and chronologically, and have led different commentators to rearrange the lines or assume some lacuna in the text.|$|E

25|$|The score has a slow {{opening and}} {{immediately}} provides a romantic sense of mystery. However, the music then launches into a quicker tempo, brass fanfares propelling the music {{along with a}} rhythmically incisive motif. An andante section for strings follows using a straightforward lilting rhythm. The simplicity of this section is a marked contrast to the next, marked vivace where the {{different parts of the}} orchestra compete with each other with an underlying consistent rhythmic drive. The following section is also manufactured of contrasts with lyrical strings followed by a solo clarinet and sparse accompaniment. High strings, harp (for the watery effect) and occasional percussion provide another contrasting orchestral sound, before the composer again re-assembles his palette of orchestral colours, using solo instruments in small groups, or alone, or high violins in long notes soaring above moving fragments of ideas below. The finale of Act 1 has an uneven rhythm <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> accents darting about in Stravinskian fashion, the music being punctuated here and there by astringent wind chords.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} brief life is {{echoed in the}} artist Douglas Florian's 1998 poem, [...] "The Mayfly". The American Poet Laureate Richard Wilbur's 2005 poem [...] "Mayflies" [...] {{includes}} the lines [...] "I saw from unseen pools a mist of flies, In their quadrillions rise, And animate a ragged patch of glow, <b>With</b> <b>sudden</b> glittering".|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} a folk drone, A–E, and a melodic fragment, E–G–F, which alternate <b>with</b> <b>sudden</b> plunges to a low B–D dyad. Thomas describes the effect as [...] "almost cinematic... suggest the bright open air of the mountains". As the soprano begins to sing, her words are supported by the orchestra until she reaches a climaxing top A. The movement is resolved when the strings hold a chord without diminuendo for nearly {{one and a half}} minutes. The final words of the movement are the first two lines of the Polish Ave Maria, sung twice on a repeated pitch by the soprano.|$|E
