40|$|Reverse genetics, the {{generation}} of influenza viruses from cDNA, presents a rapid method for creating vaccine strains. The technique necessitates the use of cultured cells. Due to technical and regulatory requirements, the choice of cell lines for production of human influenza vaccines is limited. PER.

We, therefore, investigated the effect of elevated storage temperatures on the immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic influenza A H 5 N 1 <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> virus <b>vaccine.</b> Either suspended in liquid or kept as a freeze-dried powder, vaccines could be stored for 1 year at ambient temperature (20 °C) with minimal loss of immunogenicity in mice. Elevation of the storage temperature to 40 °C, however, resulted in a significant loss of immunogenic potency within 3 months if vaccines were stored in liquid suspension. In sharp contrast, freeze-dried powder formulations were stable at 40 °C for at least 3 months. The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th 1 -type response to <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> virus <b>vaccine.</b> These results indicate that <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> virus <b>vaccines</b> may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones {{for over a year}} with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3 months.

A mutant virus which is resistant to all these Mabs also resists neutralisation by bovine polyclonal sera, and this characteristic was exploited {{in the current study}} to investigate the biological relevance of neutralisation sites in FMDV virulence and vaccine protection. The five site neutralisation-resistant mutant was shown to be as pathogenic as wild-type virus in the guinea pig model of FMD.

In this work, we describe the inactivation of human influenza virus X- 31 by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and analyze the effects on the structure by spectroscopic measurements, light scattering, and electron microscopy. We also investigated the effects of HHP on the glycoprotein activity and fusogenic activity of the viral particles. The electron microscopy data showed pore formation on the viral envelope, but the general morphology was preserved, and small variations were seen in the particle structure. The activity of hemagglutinin (HA) during the process of binding and fusion was affected in a time-dependent manner, but neuraminidase (NA) activity was not affected. Infectious activity ceased after 3 hours of pressurization, and mice were protected from infection after being vaccinated. Our results revealed full viral inactivation with overall preservation of viral structure and maintenance of fusogenic activity, thereby conferring protection against infection.

40|$|Animal {{models of}} HIV- 1 {{have a key}} {{role to play in}} elucidation of the {{cellular}} mechanisms responsible for protective immunity. Vaccination of domestic cats with <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) elicits virus-neutralizing Abs and virus-specific CTL in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs and affords protection from homologous virus challenge.

Long term protection in vaccinated cats correlates with both higher levels of FIV Env-specific CTL in the peripheral blood following vaccination and the presence of FIV Env-specific memory CD 8 + CTL in the lymph nodes, which persist for up to 1 yr following challenge in the absence of detectable virus.

ANIMALS: Forty-two SAC (25 Alpacas, 17 Llamas) aged between 1 and 16 years. METHODS: The animals were vaccinated twice at intervals of 21 days. They were observed clinically for adverse local, systemic, or both reactions throughout the trial. Blood samples collected on days 0, 14, 21, 43, and 156 after vaccination were tested {{for the presence of}} BTV- 8 virus by real time-polymerase chain reaction and of specific antibodies by competitive ELISA and a serum neutralization test. RESULTS: All vaccinated animals developed antibodies to BTV- 8 after the 2 nd administration of the vaccine. No adverse effects were observed except for moderate local swellings at the injection site, which disappeared within 21 days. Slightly increased body temperatures were only observed in the first 2 days after vaccination. The BTV was not detected in any of the samples analyzed.

Analyses of antibody responses to bacterial expression products of FIV Env, which were high in Env-immunized cats but low in animals receiving the WIV vaccine, suggested that the partially denatured, monomeric Env induces a less effective antiviral immune response than WIV.

Incubation of these formulations with RAW-blue cells and a panel of receptor-specific HEK-blue cell lines revealed that inulin was able to activate NFκB through the selective interaction with toll-like receptor 2, 4 and 5. However, only low responses were seen after the addition of an endotoxin inhibitor suggesting that the observed effects were mainly caused by contamination of our samples. Immune responses following pulmonary immunization of BALB/c mice were analysed by measuring different subtypes of immunoglobulins, amounts of antibody-secreting cells and amounts of cytokine-producing CD 4 + cells. None of the formulations tested induced responses that {{were significantly higher than}} those induced by liquid WIV control indicating that the strong in vitro responses that were observed from inulin do not translate into in vivo adjuvanticity. In addition, immunization with any of the formulations resulted in immune responses with a strong Th 2 bias as indicated by high amounts of IL- 4 secreting cells and serum IgG 1.

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{influenza}} virus to randomly mutate and evolve into new types with diverse antigenic determinants {{is an important}} challenge in the control of influenza infection. Particularly, variations within the amino acid sequences of major neutralizing epitopes of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) hindered the development of universal vaccines against H 5 N 1 lineages. Based on distribution analyses of the identified major neutralizing epitopes of hemagglutinin, we selected three vaccine strains that cover the entire variants in the neutralizing epitopes among the H 5 N 1 lineages. HA proteins of selected vaccine strains were expressed on the baculovirus surface (BacHA), and the preclinical efficacy of the vaccine formulations was evaluated in a mouse model. The combination of three selected vaccine strains could effectively neutralize viruses from clades 1, 2. 1, 2. 2, 4, 7, and 8 of influenza H 5 N 1 viruses. In contrast, a vaccine formulation containing only adjuvanted monovalent BacHA (mono-BacHA) or a single strain of <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> viral <b>vaccine</b> was able to neutralize only clade 1 (homologous), clade 2. 1, and clade 8. 0 viruses.

In this study, an ability of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to reduce {{the side effects of}} UV-V vaccination in a 6 -month-old adult BALB/c mouse model was investigated, using the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV. Immunization of adult mice with UV-V, with or without alum, resulted in partial protection from lethal doses of SARS-CoV challenge, but extensive eosinophil infiltration in the lungs was observed. In contrast, TLR agonists added to UV-V vaccine, including lipopolysaccharide, poly(U), and poly(I·C) (UV-VTLR), strikingly reduced excess eosinophilic infil-tration in the lungs and induced lower levels of interleukin- 4 and- 13 and eotaxin in the lungs than UV-V-immunization alone. Additionally, microarray analysis showed that genes associated with chemotaxis, eosinophil migration, eosinophilia, and cell movement and the polarization of Th 2 cells were upregulated in UV-V-immunized but not in UV-VTLR-immunized mice. In particular, CD 11 b cells in the lungs of UV-V-immunized mice showed the upregulation of genes associated with the induction of eosinophils after challenge.

When exposed to osmotic stress, clustering of vaccine particles was enhanced in an acidic medium (pH 2. 0) at ≥ 25 °C.

A structural integrity of membrane was destroyed upon exposure to hyper-osmotic stress, leading to irreversible morphological change, as observed by undulation in stopped-flow light scattering intensity and transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with these analyses, hemagglutination activity decreased more significantly with an increasing magnitude of hyper-osmotic stress than {{in the presence of}} the hypo- and iso-osmotic stresses.

Influenza vaccines delivered by bioneedles are a viable alternative to conventional liquid influenza vaccines.

A strong correlation was observed between high virus neutralizing antibody titers and protection following challenge. To investigate further the immune mechanisms responsible for immunity, all of the vaccinates were rechallenged 35 weeks following the initial challenge. Results of virus isolation from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} indicated that 9 of 10 vaccinates were protected from viremia following the second challenge, suggesting that vaccine-induced immunity to FIV persisted for at least 8 months. However, more stringent analysis for evidence of infection revealed that 5 of 10 vaccinates harbored virus in lymphoid tissues. Unlike the protection observed immediately following vaccination, which correlated positively with virus neutralizing antibody titer, the ability to resist a second challenge with FIV was more closely correlated with the induction of Env-specific cytotoxic T-cell activity.

The production of IL- 2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by PBMC was also strongly stimulated by WV, but much less by SU vaccines, among which the v-SU vaccine was a better stimulator of IL- 2 secretion. In contrast to WV vaccine both SU vaccines were powerful stimulators of PBMC proliferation. Our {{results suggest that the}} presence of influenza core components leads to the activation of DC and triggers the production of cytokines by PBMC. SU vaccines are in contrast excellent stimulators of T cell growth. A combination of WV and SU vaccines in immunization regimes might allow optimal T cell priming as well as the efficient generation and maintenance of memory cells...|$|R

The present study evaluates the immune response to Clone 30 live vaccine alone and in combination with <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccine</b> administrated by different routes in broiler chickens. To evaluate the various route of vaccination and <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccines</b> on antibody response, Clone vaccine was administered in different routes such as eye drop, spray, and drinking water with or without <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods {{was used to assess}} the antibody response. Results indicated significant difference among different groups and the antibody titer showed highest in eye drop with <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccine</b> group in both the tests at 42 th. day...|$|R
40|$|Infection with {{influenza}} virus {{has been associated}} with seemingly opposing effects on the development of asthma. However, there are no data about the effects of mucosal vaccination with inactivated influenza on the inception of allergic asthma. To assess the immunological effects of inhaled <b>inactivated</b> influenza <b>vaccine,</b> using two different types of flu vaccines, on the inception of allergic sensitization and allergen-mediated airway disease in a mouse model. BALB/c mice were intranasally or intratracheally vaccinated with whole or split {{influenza virus}} vaccine (days - 1 or - 1, 27) before systemic sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA) (days 1, 14) and repeated airway allergen challenges (days 28 - 30). Allergen sensitization (IgE serum levels), airway inflammation (differential cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) (in vivo lung function) were analysed. The intranasal instillation of whole influenza vaccine before allergen sensitization significantly reduced the serum levels of total and OVA-specific IgE as well as allergen-induced AHR. Prevention was due to an allergen-specific shift from a predominant T helper (Th) 2 - towards a Th 1 -immune response. Application of split influenza vaccine did not show the same preventive effect. Intranasal administration of <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> influenza <b>vaccine</b> reduced subsequent allergen sensitization and prevented allergen-induced AHR. Our results show that the composition of the influenza vaccine has a major influence on subsequent development of allergen-induced sensitization and AHR, and suggest that mucosal <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> influenza vaccination may represent a step towards the development of a preventive strategy for atopic asthma...|$|R

5000|$|It is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{unlike most}} influenza <b>vaccines,</b> which are <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccines.</b> LAIV is administered intranasally, while <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccines</b> are administered by intramuscular injection. Both live attenuated and <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccines</b> are typically trivalent. That is, they contain material {{from three different}} influenza virus strains recommended by national and international public health agencies as {{most likely to be}} protective against seasonal influenza in any given year. LAIV is sold under the trade name FluMist in the United States and Canada, and Fluenz in Europe. FluMist is manufactured by MedImmune and was first introduced in 2003.|$|R
