Waterproof dress had {{an important role in the}} late nineteenth century. Heretofore little research has been done to examine the development and design of this apparel sector. The three types of waterproofing techniques used and developed in the nineteenth century included oil or paraffin, chemical, and rubber solutions. The rise leisure and consumption contributed to the growth of waterproof dress allowing people of all classes to benefit from the protective apparel. This research explored the technology and design of waterproof dress by collecting related patents between 1880 and 1895. These patents were compared with catalogs and periodicals from the same time period to better understand what innovations made their way to consumers. The patents helped to identify the problems with <b>waterproof</b> <b>apparel</b> that manufacturers sought to resolve. In addition, the patents assisted with clarifying the target consumers for specific apparel types. The research also revealed the longevity of the gossamer or lightweight rubber garment that experienced at least two decades of success. Overall, this research emphasized that waterproof dress was very important in the lives of many consumers toward the end of the nineteenth century...|$|E
40|$|This study makes a new {{estimate}} of the global historical production for perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF), and then focuses on producing a first {{estimate of}} the global historical environmental releases of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The total historical worldwide production of POSF {{was estimated to be}} 96 000 t (or 122 500 t, including unusable wastes) between 1970 − 2002, with an estimated global release of 45 250 t to air and water between 1970 − 2012 from direct (manufacture, use, and consumer products) and indirect (PFOS precursors and/or impurities) sources. Estimates indicate that direct emissions from POSF-derived products are the major source to the environment resulting in releases of 450 − 2700 t PFOS into wastewater streams, primarily through losses from stain repellent treated carpets, <b>waterproof</b> <b>apparel,</b> and aqueous fire fighting foams. Large uncertainties surround indirect sources and have not yet been estimated due to limited information on environmental degradation, although it can be assumed that some POSF-derived chemicals will degrade to PFOS over time. The properties of PFOS (high water solubility, negligible vapor pressure, and limited sorption to particles) imply it will reside in surface waters, predominantly in oceans. Measured oceanic data suggests 235 − 1770 t of PFOS currently reside in ocean surface waters, similar to the estimated PFOS releases. Environmental monitoring from the 1970 s onward shows strong upward trends in biota, in broad agreement with the estimates of use and emissions made here. Since cessation of POSF production by 3 M in 2002, a reduction in some compartments has been observed, although current and future exposure is dependent on emission routes, subsequent transport and degradation...|$|E
40|$|One form of <b>waterproof,</b> {{breathable}} <b>apparel</b> is manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane {{laminated fabric}} using a specific process to seal seams {{that have been}} sewn with traditional techniques. The sealing process involves applying waterproof tape to the seam by feeding the seam through two rollers while applying hot air (600 20 C). This study addressed the potential for exposure to particulate matter from this sealing process by characterizing airborne particles in a facility that produces more than 1000 lightweight PTFE rain jackets per day. Aerosol concentrations throughout the facility were mapped, breathing zone concentrations were measured, and hoods used to ventilate the seam sealing operation were evaluated. The geometric mean (GM) particle number concentrations were substantially greater in the sewing and sealing areas (67, 000 and 188, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23)) compared with that measured in the office area (12, 100 particles cm 2 ? 23). Respirable mass concentrations were negligible throughout the facility (GM = 0. 002 mg m 2 ? 23) in the sewing and sealing areas). The particles exiting the final discharge of the facility's ventilation system were dominated by nanoparticles (number median diameter = 25 nm; geometric standard deviation of 1. 39). The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who sealed the sewn seams were highly variable and significantly greater when sealing seams than when conducting other tasks (p < 0. 0001). The sealing workers' breathing zone concentrations ranged from 147, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23 to 798, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23, and their seam responsibility significantly influenced their breathing zone concentrations (p = 0. 03). The finding that particle number concentrations were approximately equal outside the hood and inside the local exhaust duct indicated poor effectiveness of the canopy hoods used to ventilate sealing operations.
