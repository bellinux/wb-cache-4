5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave {{about a month}} earlier, he stated {{he had been a}} pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced {{there was no reason to}} suspect that the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E

5|$|Later, in an on-air {{phone call}} from {{his office at the}} CNN New York bureau, CNN {{vice-president}} of finance Sean Murtagh reported that a large passenger commercial jet had hit the World Trade Center. Eventually, other television networks interrupted regular broadcasting with news of the crash. President George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> arriving at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. Initial news reports speculated that the crash had been an accident until United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the South Tower 17 minutes after Flight 11 made impact.|$|E
5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> unfit to be president.|$|E
5|$|The {{order by}} Allawi to attack Fallujah again came on 6 November, {{just four days}} after George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> reelected as president. 1st Marine Division {{commander}} General Richard F. Natonski assembled an ad-hoc force of six Marine battalions, three Army battalions, three Iraqi battalions, and the British Black Watch Regiment. The insurgents, loosely led by Zarqawi, Abdullah al-Janabi, and Zarqawi's lieutenant Hadid, had replaced their losses and reportedly now had between 3,000 and 4,000 men in the city. They planned to hinder the Marine advance with roadblocks, berms, and mines, while conducting attacks outside the city to tie down Marine units.|$|E

5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, {{debating whether to}} invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first letter specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E

25|$|Barry Goldwater crusaded {{against the}} Rockefeller Republicans, beating Rockefeller {{narrowly}} in the California primary of 1964 giving the Arizona senator, {{all of the}} California delegates and a majority at the presidential nominating convention. The election was {{a disaster for the}} conservatives, but the Goldwater activists now controlled large swaths of the GOP and they had no intention of retreating. The stage was set for a conservative takeover, based in the South and West, in opposition to the Northeast. Ronald Reagan continued in the same theme. George H. <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> more closely associated with the moderates, but his son George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> firmly allied with the conservatives.|$|E

5000|$|Non-rigid designators {{are defined}} by {{contrast}} with Kripke's notion of a rigid designator, which picks out the same thing uniquely in every possible world; while there are possible worlds in which the 43rd President of the United States is Al Gore instead of George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> there <b>are</b> no possible worlds where George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> anyone other than the man who, in fact, he is. (There are worlds where some person other than George <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> named [...] "George W. Bush," [...] but that's neither here nor there.) Kripke uses this apparent asymmetry to argue (in Naming and Necessity) that no definite description can be {{the meaning of a}} proper name, because names must always be rigid designators, while definite descriptions can designate non-rigidly.|$|R
