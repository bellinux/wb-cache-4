Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> with no areas considered off-limits to construction.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E

25|$|Like fellow South African {{jazz musicians}} Dollar Brand and Hugh Masekela, they {{understood}} that the only <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> play freely was by escaping the oppressive social and political climate of their home country. As a mixed-race band (McGregor the sole white member), they were especially prone to police harassment. In mid-1964, they left South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The labour {{shortage}} was worsened {{by the fact}} {{that a large number of}} the French were also held as prisoners of war in Germany. Beyond these hardships and dislocations, the occupation became increasingly unbearable. Onerous regulations, strict censorship, incessant propaganda and nightly curfews all played a role in establishing an atmosphere of fear and repression. The sight of French women consorting with German soldiers infuriated many French men, but sometimes it was the only <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get adequate food for their families.|$|E
25|$|Fossils in China {{demonstrate}} a migration of Asian mammals into North America around 55 million years ago. By 20 million years ago, evidence in North America shows a further interchange of mammalian species. Some, like the ancient saber-toothed cats, have a recurring geographical range: Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. The only <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> reach the New World {{was by the}} Bering land bridge. Had this bridge not existed at that time, the fauna {{of the world would}} be very different.|$|E

25|$|Common Pueblo {{architectural}} forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses {{are included}} in this area, but the space constrictions of these alcoves resulted in a far denser concentration of their populations.

In a flash of light, the old woman is revealed to be Constance {{and the old man}} Daniel. After her death, she waited in the Hall of Mirrors for Daniel, so that the two could advance to the afterlife together. With Daniel's own passing, the two were finally able to be together the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be in life.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier General Hanford MacNider, {{in charge}} of the G-4 (Logistics) unit in MacArthur's {{headquarters}} group, learned almost immediately upon his arrival in Port Moresby that the previously chosen route to Wairopi across the peninsula, proposed by headquarters staff, was not practical. It traversed the Australian's rear area and a region where the soldiers could be cut off by the Japanese. It was also so mountainous that the only <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> receive supplies would be by air. Two alternative routes were considered, from Kapa Kapa to Jaure, and from Abau to Jaure. From Jaure other minor trails would lead the soldiers to Wairopi and Buna.|$|E

Tancredi and the Count, in their full dress uniforms, fascinate the Prince's daughters and puzzle the Prince, who says {{he thought they were}} still fighting for Garibaldi. Tancredi and the Count react with disgust, saying there was no <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> stay with such a rough outfit when positions with the new king's army were available. Tancredi then produces the ring he has purchased for Angelica. A moment later, Angelica rushes in, having been informed by a note that Tancredi is back.

25|$|The spin quartet {{played a}} {{combined}} 231 Tests for India from 1962 to 1983, and grabbed 853 wickets, with 43 five-wicket inning hauls. Much of this {{success can be}} attributed to the different bowling styles these bowlers possessed. Bedi was an orthodox left arm-spinner, while Chandrasekhar an attacking leg-break bowler. On the other hand, Prasanna and Venkataraghavan were both off-spinners. This <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> target all kinds of batsmen in the opposition and give their captains plenty of options. It was Chandrasekhar and Bedi who were the leaders of the attack. The two played 42 Tests alongside each other and had almost similar figures, of 184 wickets each. Bedi averaged 27.22, while Chandra averaged 28.70 in these games.|$|E
25|$|Clerical housing {{began to}} be rented at 10% of their {{commercial}} value in 1929 (in comparison to 1–2% for others {{living in the same}} type of building). Clergy that had annual income surpassing 3000 rubles could not remain in nationalized or municipalized buildings and they had to be evicted by April 8, 1929. No further leases of such buildings to clergy of any income were permitted, and it was also made illegal for them to reside in the homes of others. The only <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> live then was in private houses that they rented, of which after the collectivization nothing remained except semi-rural cottages. In the context of the persecution few laypeople would offer such housing to clergy out of fear of reprisal. This lack of housing forced many priests to leave their vocation and take civilian jobs.|$|E

25|$|Royal Challengers Bangalore {{started their}} season with an unconvincing win against KKR at Kolkata, {{supported}} by a knock of 96 by Chris Gayle. But they lost their next three matches in Bengaluru to SRH, MI, and CSK. Two great bowling performances ensured RCB secured dominant wins against RR and DD, winning by 9 wickets and 10 wickets respectively. Their next match against RR got washed out after a strong batting performance from RCB. They lost a close match to CSK, but recovered by crushing Kings XI Punjab by 138 runs, {{supported by a}} century by Chris Gayle, and a four wicket haul for Sreenath Aravind and Mitchell Starc. Royal Challengers' good form continued when AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli smashed the highest T20 partnership ever (later beaten by the same pair in IPL 2016) against Mumbai Indians, to secure a good win. Later, RCB lost to Kings XI Punjab in a rain affected match, putting their playoff qualification in doubt. They faced SRH in the next match, again affected by rain. Amidst a lot of drama, and stunning performances from Virat Kohli and Gayle, RCB won an unlikely match in Hyderabad. Now, the only <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{be out of the}} playoffs became very unlikely, yet possible. RCB lost their chance to be placed second in the points table after rain washed out their final match against DD.|$|E

500|$|During {{the spring}} and summer of 2014, several journalists {{observed}} that Frozen was unusually catchy in comparison to the vast majority of films, in that many children in both the U.S. and the UK were watching Frozen so many times that they now knew all the songs by heart and kept singing them again and again at every opportunity, to the distress of their hapless parents, teachers, and classmates. Among the celebrities who disclosed they were the parent of a Frozen-obsessed child are former UK prime minister David Cameron, as well as actors Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner and Vince Vaughn. When Terry Gross brought up this phenomenon with songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez in an April 2014 interview on NPR, they explained there was simply no <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have known how popular their work on Frozen would become. They were [...] "just trying to tell a story that resonated" [...] and [...] "that didn't suck." ...|$|E
50|$|Counterfactual {{thinking}} {{occurs when}} an individual mentally morphs, restructures, or changes events. It is possible that unacknowledged rape vitims use counterfactual thinking to cognitively reorganize the experience into something other than rape. Victims that exhibit counterfactual thinking typically reorganize their thought patterns by thinking of ways the situation could have been worse. Others think about <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have prevented the situation from occurring instead {{of thinking about the}} experience itself. Both of these thought patterns are clearly related to a lack of acknowledgment.|$|R

500|$|Burton {{was still}} {{interested}} in Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian in early 1991. Impressed with Daniel Waters' work on Heathers, Burton approached {{him for a}} rewrite. However, he eventually signed Waters to write the script for Batman Returns. By August 1993, producer David Geffen hired Pamela Norris (Troop Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live) to rewrite. Warner Bros. approached Kevin Smith in 1996 to rewrite the script, though Smith turned down the offer in favor of Superman Lives. Smith later joked that his response was [...] "Didn't we say all we needed {{to say in the}} first Beetlejuice? Must we go tropical?" [...] In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying [...] "The Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made.

500|$|... "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Long and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, [...] "we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So when everybody knew how to draw the horse and we got that out of the <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> animate the horse acting." [...] Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical success of her 1986 album, Control, Jackson was motivated to continue songwriting and took {{a larger role in}} the creative production of her new album. Executives at A requested that she expand on the ideas presented on Control, suggesting a concept album entitled Scandal that would have been about the Jackson family. She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed at her father Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people wanted me to do another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something [...] that I really believed in and that I really felt strong about." [...] The concept of Rhythm Nation emerged as Jackson was a TV watcher, [...] "We would watch BET, MTV... then switched over to CNN, and there'd always be something messed-up happening. It was never good news, always bad news", producer James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris recalled. [...] "State of the World" [...] was one of these songs, influenced by TV and news. Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening in a <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> dance to it. Released on February 6, 1991, [...] "State of the World" [...] was the eighth and the final single of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814. The record label reckoned that they would boost album sales with a radio-only promotion.|$|E
