The four largest objects, Ceres, 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea, account for half of the belt's total mass, with almost one-third accounted for by Ceres alone.|$|E
5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder.

There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E

5|$|Gibraltar {{has three}} marinas: Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. Ocean Village Marina {{is located on}} Gibraltar's Westside, outside the {{northern}} end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to Marina Bay <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> to its north. The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village. Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard. Both Marina Bay and Ocean Village Marina have been incorporated into Ocean Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway. The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture-laden Levanter winds.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of the cyclone {{resulted}} in several days of very heavy, continuous rainfall in the mountainous region on Réunion island. The island is the location for several tropical cyclone rainfall records; due to the orography of the island, tropical moisture will travel upward to the volcanic peaks, where it cools and codifies into rainfall. The heaviest totals occurred from February 24 through February 28. Commerson's Crater, located at an elevation of 2.3km (1.4mi), reported 2463mm (97in) in 48hours, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> short of the worldwide record set by an unnamed tropical cyclone in April 1958. Gamede broke worldwide rainfall records between three and nine days, with its total precipitation amounting to 5512mm (217in) in Commerson's Crater; Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980 remains the wettest tropical cyclone on record, having produced greater totals after ten days. Several locations on the island reported great totals. In a 24‑hour period, Hell-Bourg reported 1489mm (58.6in), and in a 72‑hour period, Cilaos reported 2321mm (91.4in).|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E

5|$|The Dayton area hosts several arenas and venues. South of Dayton in Kettering is the Fraze Pavilion, which hosts many {{nationally and}} internationally known musicians. Several notable {{performances}} have included the Backstreet Boys, Boston, and Steve Miller Band.
