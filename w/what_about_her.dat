50|$|Ani is {{different}} from other hounds, due to her ability to feed on both emotions and touch, and mortal and faery. Irial, the former dark king, has been performing tests to identify <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> {{is different}} and introduce it to his court to strengthen them.

5000|$|Laura Winkiel, an {{associate}} professor of English at the University of Colorado at Boulder, argues that the [...] "SCUM manifesto parodies the performance of patriarchal social order it refuses". Winkiel further suggests that the manifesto is [...] "an illicit performance, a mockery of the 'serious' speech acts of patriarchy". The SCUM women mock the way in which certain men run the world and legitimize their power, Winkiel contends. Similarly, sociologist Ginette Castro states: If we examine the text more closely, we see that its analysis of patriarchal reality is a parody ... The content itself is unquestionably a parody of the Freudian theory of femininity, where the word woman is replaced by man ... All the cliches of Freudian psychoanalytical theory are here: the biological accident, the incomplete sex, [...] "penis envy" [...] which has become [...] "pussy envy," [...] and so forth ... Here we have a case of absurdity being used as a literary device to expose an absurdity, that is, the absurd theory which has been used to give [...] "scientific" [...] legitimacy to patriarchy ... <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> proposal that men should quite simply be eliminated, as a way of clearing the dead weight of misogyny and masculinity? This is the inevitable conclusion of the feminist pamphlet, {{in the same way that}} Jonathan Swift's proposal that Irish children (as useless mouths) should be fed to the swine was the logical conclusion of his bitter satirical pamphlet protesting famine in Ireland. Neither of the two proposals is meant to be taken seriously, and each belongs to the realm of political fiction, or even science fiction, written in a desperate effort to arouse public consciousness.|$|E

It’s the way Grace finds her song on the footpath between two cars. It’s about Alice’s MBA wasted on plugging holes, Kath’s patients crawling alongside her after the night shift and it’s Becky caught in the crosshairs of what’s best and what’s right for her students. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>her?</b> What about Joanne? In Joanne, five of the most exciting voices in theatre explore the pressures on our public services as one young woman buckles under pressures of her own...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the discourse in Tri Rismaharini’s utterances as the first female mayor of Surabaya in a prominent talk show program. Woman with a strategic position in political domain is a rare phenomenon in a patriarchal culture. Risma is phenomenal one since not a party cadre, could be a major. As the public support becomes immensely increase of Risma’s leadership. She was confronted a conflict of interests between political parties’s and the public’s. This condition raised issues about Risma’s resignation. In an interview on a private television, Risma revealed about her feeling {{as leader of the}} city. How Risma conceives political power? How Risma practices political power? How she engages people to understand and be involved toward her policies ? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> political ideology ? Risma’s utterances on the program as a form of social act are interesting to be assessed. The method of this study is critical discourse analysis of Teun van Dijk. Van Dijk divides the analysis into three main parts which are the analysis of social, cognitive and discourse analysis. These analysis stages are used to examine the discourse in conversation or texts produced by a communicator. The analysis shows Risma puts political power as a divine mandate/transcendentalism. Secondly as women, Risma has implemented morality and justice as ethical politics further demonstrates masculinity through totality and accepts authority. ...|$|E

40|$|Fall in the readership, {{search for}} a viable {{economic}} model on the Internet, loss of credibility, etc. : journalism is undergoing a deep crisis in the United States. One {{way to try to}} overcome this crisis would be to engage in a vast reflection on what journalistic identity is, what it can be and what it should be. Literary journalism is a very particular kind of journalism and clearly cannot stand for the whole profession. However, as it lies on the borderlines of journalism – and literature –, literary journalism expresses some temptations of journalists towards other models, references and even values. It may thus seem particularly interesting to approach, even if only obliquely, the issue of journalistic identity. The choices literary journalists make towards reportorial and narrative transparency or opacity may concern different aspects of the journalistic process (cross-checking process, sources identity, relationship to subjects, personal reactions to the reported situation, etc.). They may also offer several degrees on the continuum between total transparency and absolute opacity. Considered together, all these choices reflect varying narratorial stances, varying ways for journalists to create an image of themselves through their texts. Analyzing these narratorial stances allows to apprehend and question these images, and to confront them with traditional professional representations and values. When a literary journalist becomes the protagonist of her story – be it hero or anti-hero –, is she still a journalist? And <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> status as journalist when she becomes an omniscient narrator, telling her story without any indication on the way she reported it? What are the implications for her professional identity if she stresses the flaws of her own account, if she lays down her weaknesses and doubts? And what if she intentionally hides these? These are all questions that this paper intends to explore through an analysis of the narratorial stance in some canonical examples of literary journalism...|$|E
