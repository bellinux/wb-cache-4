25|$|Dronningmølle {{water mill}} was rebuilt in the National Romantic style for Ferdinand Andersen {{and is now}} known as Dronningmølle Slot. The {{building}} has later been converted into holiday apartments. Ferdinand Andersen is also associated with other buildings in the area, such as the beach house Skansen which he constructed at the mouth of Esrum Å in 1899. The house takes its name after a protected defensive structure located on the estate. The now wingless <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> next to the water mill was built in 1878 and remained in use until 1934. Dronningmølle Avlsgård from 1923 was designed by the architect Henning Hansen.|$|E
500|$|About 1610, {{during the}} Plantation {{and at a}} time when the area was sparsely {{populated}} by Irish Gaels, the lands of Lurgan were [...] granted to the English lord William Brownlow and his family. Initially the Brownlow family settled near the lough at Annaloist, but by 1619, on a nearby ridge, they had established a castle and bawn for their own accommodation, and [...] "a fair Town, consisting of 42 Houses, all of which are inhabited with English Families, and the streets all paved clean through also to water Mills, and a <b>Wind</b> <b>Mill,</b> all for corn." ...|$|E

500|$|Decentralization {{followed}} {{the collapse of}} the Roman Empire, as each town operated a water or <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> and the printing press distributed literature, empowering more people. Autobiographies started to be written, more people married for love rather than other arrangements, and the concept of privacy, democracy, and market capitalism was more prevalent. People began to organize themselves more into nation-states. Steam and fossil fuels became the dominant energy regime and electronic communications, like telegraphs, radios, [...] telephones, and television, became the dominant means of communication. With vastly more interaction with other people and cultures, there was more emphasis on studying people and psychology. Personal investments, social exploration, and creativity became highly valued.|$|E

At the governor's place, energy is captured with a rooftop 20Kw solar array and a 30Kw <b>wind</b> <b>mill.</b> The electricity produced is used to electrolyze water into hydrogen. This gas is stored compressed, and can be used later to generate energy or as fuel in hydrogen-powered cars. [...] In June 2011, Henry Puna, the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands traveled to Tenedos to investigate how the island uses hydrogen energy.|$|E
2500|$|The northernmost {{settlement}} is the seaside resort of Norddorf with a decoy pond and a sector light. Amrum's largest village, Nebel, is {{located near the}} eastern coastline. Notable sights there include the church of St. Clement with its [...] "talking gravestones", the Öömrang Hüs - a museum of local history, a <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> and the Cemetery of the Homeless. Süddorf, today a district of Nebel, is the island's oldest hamlet. The Amrum Lighthouse is located there. Steenodde, also a neighbourhood of Nebel, had long been Amrum's only port until Wittdün, founded 1890, had taken over as the island's major ferry terminal. Of the three municipalities, Wittdün is most clearly influenced by tourism.|$|E

2500|$|Jews' Gate Cemetery, {{also known}} as the Windmill Hill Cemetery, is located on Windmill Hill near the {{southern}} entrance to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve on the Rock of Gibraltar. It is positioned along Queen's Road, southeast of its junction with Engineer Road. That is also the location of the Pillars of Hercules Monument which depicts [...] "The Ancient World" [...] (see below). The earliest known Jewish burials in Gibraltar are located within the cemetery and date back to 1746. The cemetery closed for burials on 6 May 1848. A letter dated 31 May 1848 from the Colonial Secretary indicated that: [...] "The Governor has given conclusive orders that no more interments shall take place at the former Burial Ground above <b>Wind</b> <b>Mill</b> Hill but that all future Hebrew dead shall be deposited in the allotted portion of the New Cemetery." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 February 1913, 10 {{new people}} were {{accepted}} {{as members of}} the club. Among them was José Amalfitani, who later would go on to be club president for 30 years. Subsequently, on 23 November, the board of directors decided to shorten the club's name, eliminating the term [...] "Argentinos" [...] and leaving the club with its current name: [...] "Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield". The board also decided that players from the different teams had to contribute an initial membership fee of $1 Argentine pesos, plus a monthly $0.50 of the same coin. In that year, Vélez rented a terrain in the neighbourhood of Mataderos known as Quinta de Figallo, located in the Tapalqué street, between Escalada and Chascomús streets. This new ground had the advantage that a <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> could provide water for the dressing rooms. The club's stay in Mataderos was short however, as they moved again in 1914, this time to the neighbourhood of Villa Luro. There, they bought a terrain between the streets of Bacacay, Víctor Hugo and Cortina, and the Maldonado Stream (parallel to what today is the Gaona avenue).|$|E
2500|$|The American windmill, or wind engine, {{was invented}} by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger {{versions}} were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain. In early California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse. During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction. [...] At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use. Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge <b>Wind</b> <b>Mill</b> and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, Eclipse, Fairbanks-Morse, Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds. [...] A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, saw mills, and agricultural machinery.|$|E

60|$|Farther on {{the party}} came to an immense <b>wind</b> <b>mill,</b> which was {{employed}} in pumping up water. This <b>wind</b> <b>mill,</b> {{like most of the}} others, was built of brick. It rose to a vast height into the air, and there its immense sails were slowly revolving. The <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> was forty or fifty feet in diameter at the base, and midway between the base and the summit was a platform built out, that extended all around it. The sails of the mill, as they revolved, only extended down to this platform, and the platform itself was above the roofs of the four-story houses that stood near.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not long}} before they came in sight of a long, high hedge. Back of it was a white house, {{surrounded}} by numerous old trees. Over the trees showed the top of an old <b>wind</b> <b>mill,</b> used for pumping water from a driven well.|$|E
60|$|At {{the foot}} of this <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> Mr. George and Rollo could see the water running in under it, through a sluice way which led from a low canal, {{and on the other}} side they could see it pouring out in a great torrent, into a higher one.|$|E
60|$|But in {{the case}} of some other kinds of work,--as for example the driving of a cotton mill, or any other great manufactory in which a large number of persons are employed,--it would be of the {{greatest}} possible consequence; for when a calm time came, and the <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> would not work, all the hands would be thrown out of employ. They might sometimes remain idle thus a number of days at a time, at a great expense to their employers, or else at a great loss to themselves. Sometimes, for example, there might be a fine breeze in the morning, and all the hands would go to the mill and begin their work. In an hour the breeze might entirely die away, and the spinners and weavers would all find their jennies and looms going slower and slower, and finally stopping altogether. And then, perhaps, two hours afterwards, when they had all given up the day's work and gone away to their respective homes, the breeze would spring up again, and the <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> would go to work more industriously than ever.|$|E

60|$|They {{might be}} worked by steam engines; but steam engines {{are much more}} {{expensive}} than wind mills. It not only costs much more to make them, but the expense of working them {{from day to day}} is very great, on account of the fuel which they require. The necessary attendance on a steam engine, too, is very expensive. There must be engineers, with high pay, to watch the engine and to keep it always in order, and firemen to feed the fires, and ashmen to carry away the ashes and cinders. Whereas a <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> takes care of itself.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side of the road, down ten feet or more below the level of it, was a range of houses, with yards, gardens, and fields about them. The way to these houses was by paths leading down from the dike on which the road was built, and across little bridges built over a small canal which {{extended}} between them and the dike. This small canal was for the draining of the land on which the houses stood. The water in this canal had a gentle flow towards the end of the street, where there was a <b>wind</b> <b>mill</b> to pump it up into the great canal on {{the other side}} of the street.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{water that}} {{collects}} in these low canals and drains, which {{run across the}} polders, cannot flow out into the large canals, which are higher than they are, and {{so they have to}} pump it out. They pump it out generally by means of <b>wind</b> <b>mills.</b> So wherever you go, throughout all Holland, you find an immense number of <b>wind</b> <b>mills.</b> These <b>wind</b> <b>mills</b> are very curious indeed. Some of them are immensely large. They look like lighthouses. The large ones are generally built of brick, {{and some of them are}} several hundred years old. The sails of the big ones are often fifty feet long, and sometimes eighty feet. This makes a wheel one hundred and sixty feet in diameter. When you stand under one of these mills, and look up, and see these immense sails revolving so high in the air that the lowest point, when the sail comes round, is higher than the tops of the four story houses, the effect is quite sublime.|$|R
