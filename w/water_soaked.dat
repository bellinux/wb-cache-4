2500|$|A {{well-known}} Dallas urban legend is {{the story}} of the Lady of White Rock Lake. [...] White Rock Lake Park is reported to be haunted by the ghost of a twenty-year-old looking girl, described as wearing a <b>water</b> <b>soaked</b> 1930s evening dress, who usually appears at night along the roadside of East Lawther Drive. Witnesses claim the phantom asks to be taken to her home on Gaston Avenue in Dallas before disappearing in the car during the ride leaving a waterlogged car seat. Legend claims the woman to be a drowning victim from a boating accident in the 1930s. Reports of the ghostly encounters were published in Dallas-area newspapers in the 1960s.|$|E

30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the durability of}} wood-based boards, a number of accelerated aging tests are used [1 – 4], most of which involve <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at various temperatures. In JIS A 5908, for example, the A test uses 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C, and the B test uses 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C [5]. For the Engineered Wood Products Association, the test uses 8  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 66  °C followed by 14.5  h drying at 82  °C [6]. Although {{the most widely used}} accelerated aging test uses <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at various temperatures and times, no optimum test has yet been decided upon.|$|R

30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been made on the {{relationships}} between cyclic boil-dry treatment and board properties [6 – 8], but very few have detailed the effects of water-soaking condition on board properties. For example, when we compare 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C (A test in JIS) and 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C (B test in JIS), obviously the latter is more severe than the former, decreasing the latter properties more than the former [4]. Comparing 6  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C with 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C, {{it is very difficult}} to predict which condition decreases the board properties. In order to develop an optimum accelerated aging test, it is paramount to determine the effects of soaking temperature and time on board properties. Thereby, the purpose of this study is to clarify the roles played by soaking temperature and time.|$|R

30|$|SEM {{analysis}} was used to investigate the microscopic structural changes occurring in THM woods. Cross sections of specimens were mounted on conductive adhesives, sputter coated with platinum, and observed under SEM (Hitachi S- 4800, Japan) at 10  kV voltages.

30|$|Given that {{boards are}} nailed when used for {{structural}} purposes, {{it is important}} to clarify the effects of <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> on the properties of these boards. However, <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> tests have been conducted not to assess nail joint property, but to assess the modulus of rupture (MOR) and internal bond strength (IB), which hereafter are defined as basic properties. Moreover, the relationships between nail joint properties and the basic properties of the board <b>soaked</b> in <b>water</b> have not been clarified.|$|R
30|$|Except for the IB of the PF board, {{as for the}} MOR of the PF board, the MOR and IB of the MDI board, {{there are}} {{differences}} between <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> and outdoor exposure. In particular, the MOR retention of <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> was higher than that of outdoor exposure. The boards <b>soaked</b> in <b>water</b> have poor mechanical properties solely because of the collapse of the bonding points, and the mechanism for the reduction of the properties is very simple. In contrast, the boards exposed outdoors have poor properties because of the collapse of the bonding points and biodegradation [10]. These factors interact, resulting in a major reduction in the properties of the boards exposed outdoors than {{in the case of the}} boards <b>soaked</b> in <b>water.</b> These differences between outdoor exposure and <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> cause different reductions in the properties of both boards.|$|R

The first, I grieve to say, was {{in a bit of}} my own brushwood, left uncared-for evidently many a year before it became mine. I had to cut my way into it through a mass of thorny ruin; black, birds-nest like, entanglement of brittle spray round twisted stems of ill-grown birches strangling each other, and changing half into roots among the rock clefts; knotted stumps of never-blossoming blackthorn, and choked stragglings of holly, all laced and twisted and tethered round with an untouchable, almost unhewable, thatch, a foot thick, of dead bramble and rose, laid over rotten ground through which the <b>water</b> <b>soaked</b> ceaselessly, undermining it into merely unctuous {120} clods and clots, knitted together by mossy sponge. It was all Nature's free doing! she had had her way with it to the uttermost; and clearly needed human help and interference in her business; and yet there was not one plant in the whole ruinous and deathful riot of the place, whose nature was not in itself wholesome and lovely; but all lost for want of discipline.|$|E

Courting or [...] "sparking" [...] his sweetheart had a painful as well as a joyous side. Many and varied were the tricks played on the fortunate lover by the gallants who had vied with him for the favor of the maid. Brave, indeed, he who won her. If he marched up to her home in the early evening he was made the object of innumerable jests, even the young lady's family indulging in and enjoying the banter. Later, when he come out of the door, it was more than likely that, if it were winter, he would be met by a volley of <b>water</b> <b>soaked</b> snowballs, or big buckets of icewater, or a mountain of snow shoved off the roof by some trickster, who had waited patiently for such an opportunity. On summer nights his horse would be stolen, led far into the woods and tied, or the wheels of his wagon would be taken off and hidden, leaving him to walk home. Usually the successful lover, and especially if he lived at a distance, would make his way only once a week and then late at night to the home of his betrothed. Silently, like a thief in the dark, he would crawl through the grass and shrubs until beneath her window. At a low signal, prearranged between them, she would slip to the door and let him in without disturbing the parents. Fearing to make a light, and perhaps welcoming that excuse to enjoy the darkness beloved by sweethearts, they would sit quietly, whispering low, until the brightening in the east betokened the break of day, and then he was off, happy and lighthearted, to his labors.|$|E

40|$|The process {{involving}} a preliminary soaking of the mushrooms {{in water for}} 20 min followed by a chill storage period followed by a further <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> for 2 hr, and known as the 3 S process, gave a considerable reduction in total shrinkage in both brown and white strain canned mushrooms compared with the control samples. Water uptake by the mushrooms in the 3 S process was greatest when the <b>soaking</b> <b>water</b> temperature was between 20 and 30 °C and had a pH of 8. Citric acid in the blanch water enhanced the colour of the canned 3 S treated mushrooms.

Prestoring mushrooms for 72 hr prior to the 3 S process had no effect on total shrinkage values but gave a less white canned product.

40|$|Identifying {{superior}} Salicaceae genotypes for afforestation {{and restoration}} activities {{in urban areas}} can greatly increase the provision of ecosystem services for long-term ecological sustainability. To address this opportunity, we collected native Populus L. (Salicaceae) and Salix L. (Salicaceae) scions from 3 sites on Staten Island, New York, and conducted a propagation study followed by greenhouse and nursery scale-up activities. Our objectives were to: 1) identify hormone treatments that enhanced root initiation and early growth of the native genotypes; 2) incorporate Salicaceae prop-agation methodology into phyto-recurrent selection; and 3) establish a population of genotypes {{that can be used}} for afforestation and restoration efforts throughout New York City. For Objective 1, we tested the response of 112 native genotypes and 11 common clones to 3 root hormone treatments (36 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus 12 -h soak in 1 % IBA + 0. 5 % NAA; 48 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus powder dip in 0. 3 % IBA; 48 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus 5 -s dip soak in 20 % IBA) and a <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> control. After 75 d of growth, the control treatment was more effective than the 0. 3 % IBA powder dip and as effective as the other treatments. Given broad clonal variation, there is a high probability of selecting genotypes for both afforestation and restoration. Although Salix exhibited greater relative propagation success than Populus, both genera should be used to in-crease overall genetic diversity. From a practical standpoint, scale-up activities led to establishment of a nursery population that will be used for ongoing afforestation and restoration activities in New York City...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adhesion {{properties}} of soy protein isolate (SPI) on fiber cardboard {{and effects of}} press conditions, pre-pressing drying time, and protein concentrations on gluing strength were investigated. Shear strength increased as press time, press pres-sure, and/or press temperature increased. The effect of tempera-ture on shear strength became more significant at high press pressure. The shear strength of the SPI adhesive on fiber card-board decreased by 12 – 25 % after <b>water</b> <b>soaking.</b> Shear strength increased as pre-pressing drying time increased and reached its maximal value at about 10 min. An SPI/water ratio of 12 : 100 (w/w) gave the highest gluing strength.
