5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys has been talking about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Finally, the big match commences and Phineas is vigorously {{beaten by}} Buford in each round. When {{the final round}} begins, Buford overpowers Phineas and pulls him up through the air. Just then, Doofenshmirtz's ice cream cone falls and lands on Phineas's head. Buford is {{satisfied}} now that Phineas is embarrassed and calls off the match. [...] The audience who was watching cleans up the mess (due to Doofenshmirtz's machine accidentally telling them to). At the parking lot a few minutes later, Phineas thanks Holyfield for his help and Holyfield walks off. Ferb makes a comment which accidentally offends Buford and {{he is about to}} be beaten up, but he knocks Buford out with a Vulcan nerve pinch, to Phineas's surprise. [...] When Phineas asks him <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> he responds, [...] "Well, he was all up in my face." ...|$|E
500|$|Motography {{included}} a {{brief review of}} the film which states, [...] "This is indeed a well presented historical subject. The action has breadth and historical perspective, with stirring scenes and large groupings, {{and at the same time}} there is a human plot threading its way through the historical background and giving the action a specific interest. The last scene, showing Santa Anna's surrender [...] "as a common soldier," [...] is rather obscure. One wonders <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> In all other scenes the action is clear and effective. It would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to the thrilling scene inside the Alamo." [...] The Moving Picture Worlds review stated that [...] " [...] is a very thrilling and altogether satisfactory reproduction of an important historical episode. The company deserves the highest commendation for the picture and the way it is produced." ...|$|E
50|$|Bart {{is serving}} {{an old woman}} at a table at a restaurant, showing manners and being educated, and asks the viewer if they'd know <b>why</b> <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> and <b>he</b> starts narrating.|$|R

500|$|Browning {{was granted}} the {{substantive}} rank of captain on 24 November 1920. He retained his post as adjutant until November 1921, {{when he was}} posted to the Guards' Depot in Caterham. In 1924 he was posted to Sandhurst as adjutant. He was the first adjutant, during the Sovereign's Parade of 1926, to ride his horse (named [...] "The Vicar") up the steps of Old College and to dismount in the Grand Entrance. There is no satisfactory explanation as to <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> After the Second World War this became an enduring tradition, but since horses have great difficulty going down steps, a ramp is now provided for the horse to return. Other members of staff at Sandhurst at the time included Richard O'Connor, Miles Dempsey, Douglas Gracey, and Eric Dorman-Smith, with whom he became close friends. Browning relinquished the appointment of adjutant at Sandhurst on 28 April 1928, and was promoted to major on 22 May 1928. Following a pattern whereby tours of duty away from the regiment alternated with those in it, he was sent for a refresher course at the Small Arms School before being posted to the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, at Pirbright.|$|E
500|$|Isaacson {{completed}} forty-five sorties with Bomber Command, {{when the}} likelihood of surviving an operational tour of thirty missions was never more than 50% and, at times, much less. Promoted to acting flight lieutenant, he was chosen in May 1943 to captain Lancaster Q-for-Queenie on a landmark flight from England to Australia across the Pacific Ocean, and then from Melbourne to New Zealand and back, non-stop in both directions. He was awarded the Air Force Cross on 27August 1943 for this mission, the citation noting that it was [...] "the first occasion on which an aircraft has flown to Australia by this route and the direct flights between Melbourne and New Zealand are the first of their kind". The Lancaster was brought to Australia {{so that it could}} serve as a template for local production of the type, but this never took place and it was instead used for exhibition flights to encourage purchase of war bonds. On 22October 1943 Isaacson flew Q-for-Queenie under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, flouting a 1931 regulation that prohibited such activity; the Lancaster remains the largest aircraft to have been flown under the bridge. Isaacson gave his crew no warning of what he was about to do and when asked later <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> replied [...] "Because it was there". It was, however, reported {{at the time that he}} undertook the stunt to support the war loan effort for which he and his crew were actively fundraising.|$|E
2500|$|Kumble {{said that}} he asked Harbhajan <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> and {{received}} the reply [...] "he hadn't, Symonds did and goaded", and insisted he made no racist comment. Kumble asked Ponting whether an apology from himself for the on-field altercation, as captain, would suffice (as Harbhajan {{was not willing to}} apologise) but, according to Kumble, Ponting was [...] "not willing to listen". Kumble believed that the offer of an apology was interpreted by Ponting as an admission of guilt, although he explained to the Australian captain that no racist remarks were made.|$|E

2500|$|On February 4, 2009, Ackerman criticized SEC Officials {{over the}} {{handling}} of tips given {{to them about the}} Bernie Madoff scandal. Ackerman believed that he was reflecting the public's opinion, saying: [...] "How are they supposed to have confidence that if somebody goes to you with a complaint—gives it to you on a silver platter with all the investigations, with all the numbers, with all of the data, telling you exactly what he did, how he did it, and <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> and how he knows that—and after a period after half a dozen or eight years, you don't know anything?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1965, Cash's camper {{caught fire}} during {{a fishing trip}} with his nephew Damon Fielder in Los Padres National Forest in California, {{triggering}} a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres and nearly caused his death. Cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper, but Fielder thinks that Cash started a fire to stay warm and in his drugged condition failed to notice the fire getting out of control. When the judge asked Cash <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> Cash said, [...] "I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Stool Pigeon" [...] was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article Darnell had read about a former Mafia boss who had been let out of jail after providing information about his former colleagues, and had now had his identity changed and protected by the FBI. Darnell said, [...] "I actually had compassion for the guy. I thought, wow, what a way to go. And I could understand <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> He sold out for the money and the comfort, I guess the very things that had brought him into the underworld." [...] The song also features Darnell's attempt at the then newly fashionable art of rapping—he later confessed, [...] "That's just me goofing at being a rapper, which was the last thing I ever wanted to do".|$|E

5000|$|The mid-tempo song is sung {{from the}} {{perspective}} of a man who, despite being at an age when most of his peers have started raising families (at least 30 years old according to the second line), still lives a hard-partying, rock-and-roll lifestyle more in tune with far younger men. The song also makes reference to his Christian faith, noting that he knows he cannot continue like this in heaven (thus <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> while <b>he</b> is still alive) and that he will eventually be forgiven, not just by Jesus, but his [...] "crazy friends" [...] as well.|$|R

2500|$|With six laps {{remaining}} in the Bojangles' Southern 500, Busch cut a tire and subsequently caused a wreck that involved not only his car but also Ryan Newman. When leaving his pit (directly in front of Newman), Busch did a burnout and sped next to where crew members and NASCAR officials where standing. Following {{the conclusion of the}} race, while entering pit road, Busch bumped Newman's car. Busch explained the incident as an accident and unrelated, caused by taking his helmet off and not seeing where he was going. Andrew Rueger, Newman's gas man, went after Busch following the race. This turned into a heated argument, accidentally knocking over a NASCAR official. Newman, giving an interview to Sports Illustrated, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's easy to say that Kurt blew a fuse again, I'm not sure <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> and tried to run over our guys and NASCAR officials. And nobody is. I think the chemical imbalance speaks for itself. Kurt drilled me in pit lane and said that he was taking his helmet off, and he didn't see where he was going. I'm pretty sure there were 42 other guys that are taking their helmets off and doing whatever for the last 10 years, and that's the first time that's happened to me." [...] On May 15, 2012, NASCAR announced that Busch had been fined $50,000 and placed on probation until July 25, 2012 for [...] "reckless driving on pit road during the race" [...] and for being [...] "involved in an altercation with another competitor after the completion of the race." ...|$|E

60|$|His {{voice had}} rather high upper notes, and very {{resonant}} middle notes. It was queer.

Satterthwaite {{suddenly}} realises that the murder was committed with the original string, and confronts quiet David Keeley in the library. He {{was the last person}} downstairs, switching off the lights as Mabelle returned for her instrument. He quickly killed her and then later in the night returned to move the body to her own room. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Laughing insanely about how no one notices him, Keeley admits the crime as Winkfield walks into the room.|$|R
6000|$|The Countess stared, {{and then}} with an inconsiderate laugh: [...] "Is that the story that Isabel tells? It isn't bad, as such things go.

60|$|La Boulaye {{remained}} a moment {{by the door}} after Cecile's departure; then he moved away towards his desk, striving to master the tumultuous throbbing of his pulses. His eye alighted on Cecile's roses, and, scarce knowing <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> he picked them up and flung them behind a bookcase. It was but done when again the door opened, and his official ushered in Mademoiselle de Bellecour.|$|E
60|$|Now Peter {{has learned}} that the wise thing to do when one has such a feeling as that is to seek safety first and {{investigate}} afterwards.
