25|$|Russia's February Revolution caught Pântea entrenched {{with his}} men {{somewhere near the}} town of Roman. The news, he later wrote, was a <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the Bessarabian Romanians in foreign lands, since it offered the {{prospect}} of self-determination at home. As the Provisional Government took hold of military matters, Pântea became President of the Ninth Army's Soviet, and also helped organize the Bessarabian soldiers into a single political body. Similar actions were being taken by other nationally minded Bessarabian officers. Some—Catelli, Anton Crihan, Constantin Osoianu, Ion Păscăluță, Andrei Scobioală—were active on Bessarabia's borders, while others addressed Bessarabian units in places such as Novorossiya (Elefterie Sinicliu) or Crimea (Grigore Turcuman).|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, the Canadian {{government}} {{funded the}} establishment of secular, government-operated {{high schools in the}} Northwest Territories (including what is now Nunavut) and Inuit areas in Quebec and Labrador along with the residential school system. The Inuit population was not large enough to support a full high school in every community, so this meant only a few schools were built, and students from across the territories were boarded there. These schools, in Aklavik, Iqaluit, Yellowknife, Inuvik and Kuujjuaq, brought together young Inuit from across the Arctic in one place for the first time, and exposed them to the rhetoric of civil and human rights that prevailed in Canada in the 1960s. This was a real <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the Inuit, and it stimulated {{the emergence of a new}} generation of young Inuit activists in the late 1960s who came forward and pushed for respect for the Inuit and their territories.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} DCC MIDAS {{approach}} to assess {{the validity of the}} <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> hypothesis <b>for</b> developed and emerging markets during the global financial crisis (GFC). We use this {{approach to}} decompose the total correlations into short- (daily) and long-run (quarterly) correlations for the period from 1999 to 2011. We then examine the transmission mechanisms by regressing the quarterly economic, financial, and behavioral variables on the quarterly DCC-MIDAS correlations. We find that country specific factors are crisis contingent transmission mechanisms for the co-movements of emerging country pairs and mixed pairs of advanced and emerging countries during the global financial crisis. However, we do not observe <b>wake-up</b> <b>calls</b> in the transmission of the crisis among advanced country pairs. The classification of the transmission mechanisms for crisis and non-crisis periods with the different country pairs has important implications for crisis management as well as for portfolio investment strategies. Thus, our findings contribute to the discussion on the role and effectiveness of the international financial architecture...|$|R
500|$|Once coded, the team's game systems did {{not work}} as intended. Prototypes of the systems and of certain {{missions}} were built {{near the beginning of}} development, which revealed some of the team's planning mistakes. For example, the early tests of the conversation system and user interface were flawed, but the team had time to revise them before the game's release. The team also found augmentations and skills to be less interesting than they had seemed in the design document. Colleagues from other companies—such as Doug Church, Rob Fermier, Marc LeBlanc, and Gabe Newell—noticed and pointed out these deficiencies in game [...] "tension" [...] when they played the prototype. In response, Harvey Smith substantially revised the augmentations and skills. Production milestones served as <b>wake-up</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the game's direction. A May 1998 milestone that <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a functional demo revealed that the size of the game's maps caused frame rate issues, {{which was one of the}} first signs that maps needed to be cut. A year later, the team reached a milestone for finished game systems that Spector nicknamed the [...] "Wow, these missions suck" [...] milestone, which led to better estimates for their future mission work and to the reduction of the 500-page design document to 270 pages.

500|$|Their {{milestones}} {{served as}} <b>wake-up</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the game's direction. A May 1998 [...] "proto-mission" [...] milestone {{was to have}} a basic but functional demo of the crucial game systems and two maps (the White House and Hong Kong) ready. The team worked on the riskiest parts of the game first such that the core game would be functioning, albeit not polished. The demo revealed that the size of their maps caused speed problems and would have to be divided into smaller maps. It also {{was one of the first}} signs that maps needed to be cut. The team forgot to prototype the non-player character artificial intelligence in this demo. A year later, in May 1999, they reached a milestone for finished game systems and the first two missions completed. While the player could start the game and character, use augmentations, acquire inventory, complete objectives, and save the game, their poor quality and comments from Newell led Spector to nickname milestone the [...] "Wow, these missions suck" [...] milestone. They felt that their first demos showed their potential, but they were not nearly close to reaching it. This milestone also helped them estimate the work required for missions and the portions that worked best, which led to a trim of their 500-page design manual to the best 270 pages. Spector recalled Smith's mantra here: [...] "less is more".|$|R

500|$|Mills left Forest {{shortly before}} the end of 1981–82 to join the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League in March 1982. He made 31 appearances, scored five goals and {{recorded}} seven assists in the 1982 North American Soccer League season as Seattle finished first in the Western Division. He started for Seattle in Soccer Bowl '82 before being substituted for Roger Davies, and the match was won 1–0 by the New York Cosmos with a 31st-minute goal scored by Giorgio Chinaglia. Less than a month later he made a temporary return to England by signing for Forest's local rivals Derby County on loan on 13 October 1982. Mills made his debut three days later in a 1–1 away draw with Grimsby Town in the Second Division, before scoring his first goal with Derby's second in a 2–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers on 3 January 1983. His loan ended in April 1983, having made 23 appearances and scored two goals for Derby in 1982–83. Early in the 1983 North American Soccer League season he had his leg broken by David Watson and was kept out of action for a year.

Amin said gas could be stored in parts of the Perth Basin depleted of gas, like Dongara, and companies could be offered tax incentives.

2500|$|By {{the time}} Constant Chaos was released, Jones had {{temporarily}} halted activity on his labels {{for almost a}} year. Still DJing as Cajmere he'd narrowed the Green Velvet persona down to live performances only, taking time out to re-group and work {{out what to do}} next. During 2000, Jones was briefly signed to Warner Bros. Records' short-lived F-111 imprint, where he released his second compilation album, the self-titled Green Velvet, which contained the double-A-sided single “Flash” backed with “Answering Machine.” During this time he gave Velvet a new hairstyle—from spiked, green foam nodules to yellow mohawk. Next, in 2001, he unleashed his second album, the dark Whatever, which was a step away from his Kraftwerk-inspired sound (although Sleepwalking had a similar style) to a darker, more political Punk-esque style. On the album he tackled such issues as racism (highlighted on the song When?), drug use (highlighted on Genedefekt and La La Land), alienation (highlighted on Sleepwalking), and being told what to wear and do by the system (highlighted on the heavily punk-inspired track Gat). The more punk-oriented songs on the album apparently came from hours spent listening to industrial bands such as Nitzer Ebb and Liaisons Dangereuses, and lots of [...] "underground American industrial stuff." [...] He released the single La La Land in 2001, originally designed as a <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> clubbers to the dangers of pill-taking it became one of his most popular tunes. This was followed by Genedefekt. His live act had now became more like a rock band also, with the Curtis playing a keytar, and two other musicians (aptly named Nazuk and Spaceboy) backing him, playing heavily distorted synths. Initially Jones, as both Cajmere and Green Velvet, was receiving more attention in Europe than he did in the USA, playing a Radio One live session on the Jo Whiley show and playing a host of festivals.|$|E
