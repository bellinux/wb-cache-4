5|$|Some critics {{made little}} or no {{distinction}} between Pussy Riot and Voina, incorrectly attributing past actions of Voina to Pussy Riot. In particular, a notorious performance by Voina in St. Petersburg, in <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> stole a chicken from a supermarket by stuffing it in her vagina, is sometimes cited by detractors of Pussy Riot. However, {{there is no evidence}} that members of Moscow-based Pussy Riot participated in this action.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1889, a range detective {{from the}} Association named George Henderson accused Ella Watson, a local rancher, of {{stealing}} cattle from a fellow rancher {{by the name}} of Albert John Bothwell. The cattlemen sent riders to arrest Ella before apprehending her husband, Jim Averell, as well. Both of them were subsequently hanged from a tree. This gruesome act was one of the rare cases in the Old West in <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> was lynched, an event that appalled many of the local residents and paved the way for future conflicts in the war. County Sheriff Frank Hadsell arrested six men for the lynching and a trial date was set. However, before the trial, threats were sent to the witnesses who would testify against the aggressors. One of those witnesses was young Gene Crowder, who mysteriously disappeared under unknown circumstances before the trial. Another, Jim's nephew and foreman Frank Buchanan, disappeared from the county as well after a shoot-out with unknown suspects, and was presumed to be hiding or murdered. Ralph Cole, another nephew of Averell's, died {{on the day of the}} trial from poisoning.|$|E

If untreated, it can also result in a stillbirth. Long term, children are at higher risk of being overweight and developing type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Fraternal {{polyandry}} (from the Latin frater—brother), {{also called}} adelphic polyandry, {{is a form}} of polyandry in <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> is married to two or more men who are one another's brothers. Fraternal polyandry was (and sometimes still is) found in certain areas of Tibet, Nepal, and Northern India, where polyandry was accepted as a social practice. The Toda people of southern India practice fraternal polyandry, but monogamy has become prevalent recently. In contemporary Hindu society, polyandrous marriages in agrarian societies in the Malwa region of Punjab seem to occur to avoid division of farming land.|$|E
25|$|A similar anointing is {{described}} in the Gospel of Luke as occurring {{at the home of}} one Simon the Pharisee in <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who had been sinful all her life, and who was crying, anointed Jesus' feet and, when her tears started to fall on his feet, she wiped them with her hair. Luke's account (as well as John's) differs from that of Matthew and Mark by relating that the anointing is to the feet rather than the head. Although it is a subject of considerable debate, many scholars hold that these actually describe two separate events.|$|E

25|$|The term tribadism {{is usually}} {{used in the}} context of lesbian sex, and {{originally}} encompassed societal beliefs about women's capability of being penetrative sexual partners. Women accused of having been penetrative during sexual activity were subject to ridicule or punishment. In modern times, the term typically refers to various forms of non-penetrative sex (or frottage) between women. It may also involve vaginal penetration by use of the fingers, a dildo or double penetration dildo, or refer to a masturbation technique in <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> rubs her vulva against an inanimate object such as a bolster to achieve orgasm.|$|E
25|$|Calendar rules may set a {{standard}} number of days, specifying that (depending on a woman's past cycle lengths) the first three to six days of each menstrual cycle are considered infertile. Or, a calendar rule may require calculation, for example holding that {{the length of the}} pre-ovulatory infertile phase is equal to the length of a woman's shortest cycle minus 21 days. Rather than being tied to cycle length, a calendar rule may be determined from the cycle day on <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> observes a thermal shift. One system has the length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase equal to a woman's earliest historical day of temperature rise minus seven days.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other works}} of bawdy and satirical English {{literature}} of the period deal with the subject. Dildoides: A Burlesque Poem (London, 1706), attributed to Samuel Butler, is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities. Examples of anonymous works include The Bauble, a tale (London, 1721) and Monsieur Thing's Origin: or Seignor D---o's Adventures in London, (London, 1722). In 1746, Henry Fielding wrote The Female Husband: or the surprising history of Mrs Mary, alias Mr. George Hamilton, in <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> posing as a man uses a dildo.
