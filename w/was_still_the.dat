5|$|As Romania faced indecision {{about its}} future, the Corps <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> subject of unionist propaganda, spread by Romanian intellectuals in the capitals of Entente nations. From his {{temporary}} home in France, Bocu reestablished România Mare as the tribune of Romanian diaspora politics and unionist aspirations.

George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir presumptive.|$|E

As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E

5|$|The Act of 1767 had {{specified}} {{points on}} the river at which tolls could be collected, but had {{made no mention of}} tolls for use of Bow Creek, Bow Back Rivers, or the section of the navigation between Bow tidal gates and Old Ford, and these had remained toll-free. An Act of Parliament obtained on 14 August 1850 allowed the trustees to build a pound lock at Bow tidal gates. To prevent opposition from the bargees, the Act had formalised the freedom from tolls on the Bow River section. Once the lock was built, however, the trustees charged a toll for using it. This was unpopular, but there <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> option of using the tidal gates at certain states of the tide, which did not incur a toll. A clause to authorise the lock toll was deleted by Parliament from a subsequent Act of 1868, and it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> case in 1977 that a charge was made for using the lock but not for using the gates.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{invasion}} of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8thcentury introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on tapial, pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply. Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11thcentury onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, {{while at the same}} time timber <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> dominant building material in north-west Europe.|$|E
5|$|After {{most of the}} Colorado River basin {{became part}} of the U.S. in 1846, the bulk of the river's course <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19thcentury – one of which, led by John Wesley Powell, was the first to run the rapids of the Grand Canyon. American explorers {{collected}} valuable information that was later used to develop the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid- to late-19thcentury, with steamboats providing transportation from the Gulf of California to landings along the river that linked to wagon roads to the interior. Lesser numbers settled in the upper basin, which was the scene of major gold strikes in the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Britain was still Australia's major trading partner, {{although}} it would be overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. The two countries still had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> largest source of immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting the communists together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.|$|E
5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals.

5|$|Des McAnuff {{replaced}} Mann as director, and filming was {{rescheduled to}} December 1994. Screenwriter Horovitz was busy playwrighting in Europe, so McAnuff and producer Marvin Worth were constantly rewriting the script in July 1994. The budget {{was estimated at}} $20 million. McAnuff stepped down as director {{and was replaced by}} Dennis Hopper. Hopper was a close friend with Dean and co-starred with the actor in both Rebel Without a Cause and Giant. Hopper met with DiCaprio for the lead role, but the director eventually dropped out of the film. By May 1995, DiCaprio <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> top candidate to portray Dean with Milčo Mančevski in discussions to direct the film.|$|E

5|$|Entering 2008, the Bulls {{sought to}} build off of their 2007 season, where {{they shared the}} MAC East {{championship}} but did {{not appear in the}} championship game due to a 31–28 loss to fellow division co-champion Miami (Ohio). Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to qualify for a bowl game, <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.|$|E

5|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century, the {{consensus}} remained that the road was most probably Roman. It was still referenced as an undoubted Roman road in a 1947 UK Government report and in 1957 Margary, the leading authority on Roman roads at the time, accepted the road as Roman and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in his list of Roman roads in Britain. In the late 1950s and early 1960s this was a definitive and unquestioned interpretation of the monument. Several works in the 1980s and 1990s stated that Roman-era road construction <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> most probable explanation of the structure.|$|E
5|$|He left in May {{and arrived}} in November of what <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> unorganized Oregon Country. At {{this time the}} region was under the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States after the settling of the Oregon boundary dispute with Great Britain the previous year. In Oregon, Chapman settled first in what was then Marysville, and is now Corvallis, in the Willamette Valley. In 1848, he relocated to Salem, where he learned of the California Gold Rush while at court at Knox Butte. Chapman went to California for a brief time and had some success in the gold fields before returning in 1849 to Oregon, which had become the Oregon Territory in 1848.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 Swillington, to the {{south-east}} of Leeds, {{was still}} a rural community, although mining was starting to assert itself as {{the driving force of}} the local economy. Woodford <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> Provincial Grand Chaplain in Durham, while completing structural work on his church in Yorkshire. It was not until 1854 that he joined Philanthropic Lodge No 382 (now 304). The next year he was appointed Provincial Grand Chaplain for West Yorkshire. He was master of Philanthropic in 1856 and 1858, and the lodge history asserts that it thrived during the years of his regular attendance. He re-wrote their ritual in a unique form, which was shared with five daughter and granddaughter lodges.|$|E
