50|$|Design {{work began}} on the Hi 21 {{at the start of}} 1942 in {{response}} to a RLM requirement for a multi-purpose training glider. It was to be capable of providing both basic and advanced flight training, including high performance flying, aerobatics and three-point landings. A retractable undercarriage and side-by-side seating to optimise the instructional process were specified. The majority of two seat gliders have had tandem seating, with the student's seat over the centre of gravity (c.g.) so that its occupation would not affect the trim. Since both occupants of the Hi 24 sat ahead of the wing leading edge for good visibility, this was not an option and it was decided to employ a variable sweep <b>wing,</b> moving its <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> to the c.g., rather than shift the c.g. with movable weights.|$|R
40|$|Marc~z, 1947 Su,mmary. [...] From syste~natic three-component {{measurements}} of wing-body combinations with swept wings {{it has been}} found that the movement of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> due to the influence of the body is greater for a swept forward than for a straight wing and less for a sweptback wing. The forward shift of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> due to the body for normal wing body combinations is about 0. 06 c for a straight wing, about 0. 12 c for a 30 degrees swept forward, but about zero for a 45 degrees sweptback wing.

50|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{static stability}} of an aircraft is significantly {{influenced by the}} distance (moment arm or lever arm) between the centre of gravity (c.g.) and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> of the airplane. The c.g. is established by {{the design of the}} airplane and influenced by its loading, as by payload, passengers, etc. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> (a.c.) of the airplane can be located approximately by taking the algebraic sum of the plan-view areas fore and aft of the c.g. multiplied by their blended moment arms and divided by their areas, in a manner analogous to the method of locating the c.g. itself. In conventional aircraft, this point is aft of, but close to, the one-quarter-chord point of the wing. In unconventional aircraft, e.g. the Quickie, it is between the two wings because the aft wing is so large. The pitching moment at the a.c. is typically negative and constant.|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{numerical}} investigation {{on the performance of}} integrally actuated two-dimensional membrane wings made with dielectric elastomers. A high-fidelity model based on the direct numerical integration of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations is coupled with a geometrically non-linear structural model. The rate-dependent constitutive law for the dielectric elastomer is based on a non-linear formulation, and it has been validated against experimental data. In addition, the implementation of the aeroelastic framework has been verified against the relevant literature for the low-Reynolds number flows investigated in this dissertation. Numerical simulations of the open-loop dynamics of the actuated membrane, in good agreement with experimental observations, show that integral actuation offers enough authority in the control of the <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> performance. Dielectric elastomers can then be used as embedded actuators, coupling the advantages of passive membranes with a simple and lightweight control mechanism. Further, this work also proposes a model-reduction methodology for the fully coupled system to aid control system design. The low-order description of the actuated system can capture the main system dynamics, and can be used for the design of the control scheme of the wing. Proportional-Integral-Derivative and Linear Quadratic Gaussian feedback controllers, designed using the reduced-order model, are finally implemented in the high-fidelity model for the rejection of flow disturbances. Results show that the <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> performance is noticeably enhanced through the actuation as the disturbances on the lift in case of gusts can be reduced up to 60...|$|R
