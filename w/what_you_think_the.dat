What {{troubles}} me much, among other troubles, is quite the reverse of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> old masters hold me here, it is true, but they no longer warm me with their influence.

6000|$|... 'Ah, but I {{do think}} so, {{whatever}} you may say, Mr. Le Breton,' Hilda went on eagerly. 'I do think so, and I {{think it was}} very good of you to fight it out so against papa for what you believe is right and proper. For my own part, you know, I don't see any particular harm in pigeon-shooting. Of course it's very dreadful that the poor dear little things should be shot and wounded and winged and so forth; but then everything, almost, gets shot, you see--rabbits, and grouse, and partridges, and everything; so that really it's hardly worth while, it seems to me, making a fuss about it. Still, that's not the real question. You think it's wrong; which is very original and nice and proper of you; and as you think it's wrong, you won't countenance it in any way. I don't care, myself, whether it's wrong or not--I'm not called upon, thank goodness, to decide the question; but I do care very much that you should suffer for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> right course of action.' And Lady Hilda in her earnestness almost laid her hand upon his arm, and looked up to him in the most unmistakable and appealing fashion.|$|E

"Barry," [...] she continued, [...] "no good {{ever came}} of my father's will."--Barry almost jumped off his chair {{as he heard}} his sister's words, so much did they startle him; but he said nothing.--"The money has done me no good, but the loss of it has {{blackened}} your heart, and turned your blood to gall against me. Yes, Barry--yes--don't speak now, let me go on;--the old man brought you up to look for it, and, alas, he taught you to look for nothing else; {{it has not been}} your fault, and I'm not blaming you--I'm not maning to blame you, my own brother, for you are my own"--and she turned round in the bed and shed tears upon his hand, and kissed it.--"But gold, and land, will never make you happy,--no, not all the gold of England, nor all the land the old kings ever had could make you happy, av the heart was bad within you. You'll have it all now, Barry, or mostly all. You'll have <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> old man wronged you of; you'll have it with no one to provide for but yourself, with no one to trouble you, no one to thwart you. But oh, Barry, av it's in your heart that that can make you happy--there's nothing before you but misery--and death--and hell." [...] Barry shook like a child in the clutches of its master--"Yes, Barry; misery and death, and all the tortures of the damned. It's to save you from this, my own brother, to try and turn your heart from that foul love of money, that your sister is now speaking to you from her grave.--Oh, Barry! try and cure it. Learn to give to others, and you'll enjoy what you have yourself.--Learn to love others, and then you'll {{know what it is to}} be loved yourself. Try, try to soften that hard heart. Marry at once, Barry, at once, before you're older and worse to cure; and you'll have children, and love them; and when you feel, as feel you must, that the money is clinging round your soul, fling it from you, and think of the last words your sister said to you." ...|$|E

I wanted Gamal, a Christian of Coptic origin who was originally from Egypt, to tell Arafat {{that this was an}} outrageous attempt to delegitimize the Israeli connection to Jerusalem.... Finally, after nearly ten minutes of increasing invective, I intervened and said 'Mr. Chairman, regardless of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> President of the United States knows that the Temple existed in Jerusalem. If he hears you denying its existence there, he will never again take you seriously. My advice to you is never again raise this issue in his presence.'" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} {{capitalism}} {{have been much}} debated (and depend partly on <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> defining features of capitalism are). The traditional account, originating in classical eighteenth-century liberal economic thought and still often articulated, is the 'commercialization model'. This sees capitalism originating in trade. Since evidence for trade is found even in palaeolithic culture, {{it can be seen}} as natural to human societies. In this reading, capitalism emerged from earlier trade once merchants had acquired sufficient wealth (referred to as 'primitive capital') to begin investing in increasingly productive technology. This account tends to see capitalism as a natural continuation of trade, arising when people's natural entrepreneurialism was freed from the constraints of feudalism, partly by urbanization. Thus it traces capitalism to early forms of merchant capitalism practiced in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. It began to develop into its modern form during the Early Modern period in the Protestant countries of North-Western Europe, especially the Netherlands (Dutch Republic) and England: traders in Amsterdam and London created the first chartered joint-stock companies driving up commerce and trade, and the first stock exchanges and banking and insurance institutions were established. Foundational thinkers for this approach include Adam Smith, Max Weber, Fernand Braudel, Henri Pirenne, and Paul Sweezy.|$|E

5000|$|A {{distinguished}} female contract {{killer in}} the world of assassins, and a former acquaintance of John. About the character of Ms. Perkins, Palicki said, [...] "Ms. Perkins is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> quintessential assassin would be. She’s cold, heartless, conniving, badass and I think that she has fun with what she does. She enjoys it. I think that she’d clearly do it for a dollar. Ultimately in the film she’s doing it for four million, so its a little different." [...] Originally the character of Perkins was envisioned as a man, but the decision was reversed during a brainstorming session and the desire to create [...] "an authentic female action character." [...] Leitch stated, [...] "You believe this woman could come in and give John Wick a run for his money," [...] so Stahelski, Leitch and Iwanyk changed it and offered the role to Palicki. Palicki spoke most highly of working with Reeves and the inclusion of stunt work on her part, to which she stated, [...] "Chad wanted to make sure I would be willing to do my own stuff in the huge fight sequence that I have with Keanu—and I was all game." [...] Palicki spent months of training learning Judo and Jujutsu. After the films release Palicki revealed background information, [...] "I also think we talked about a backstory. Its likely Perkins and Wick had a history as well, before his marriage. She may have a personal vendetta as well as the money. I think theres an enjoyment on multiple levels." [...] On what she hopes for with regard to the fan response, [...] "Its a lot of fun. Theyre going to want to see what happens next. Most importantly, I hope they’re rooting for John Wick the way that I did when I read the script." ...|$|E
