50|$|Alexis Spectral Data is a {{software}} developed for colour matching processes that calculates from available spectral data the colour numbers used by computers to display colours on screen. It displays the colour for each spectral reflectance curve and records the calculated trichromatic values and colour numbers {{along with the}} spectral curves. This eliminates the need to scan the samples separately with a Truecolour Scanner while creating the database. The spectral data can be introduced manually {{as a series of}} reflectance values at wavelengths measured in different standard illuminants with an arbitrary but fixed increment that must be kept for each spectral curve throughout the creation of the whole database. Therefore, older UV-VIS Spectrophotometers that can’t be interfaced with computers can also be used for creating the database needed for colour matching. Alexis Spectral Data determines the <b>whiteness</b> <b>degree</b> in a less time consuming method, which permits storage and easier handling of the obtained data.|$|E

It has been investigated whether enzymatic bleaching of cotton textiles could be replaced with hydrogen peroxide bleaching, which is a water and energy consuming step. In this study, fungal laccase, laccase moderator systems and also oxygen and ozone feed to these systems have been experimented.

40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{has an important}} impact in world economy and consequently on environmental quality of life. Textile processing uses huge amount of water, chemicals and energy and it is quite easy to conclude about the enormous meaning of pollution control and rationalization of energetic demands. CORONA treatment in the wet processing of cotton textile materials has a great potential concerning the improvement of all the operations included in it, namely in preparation, dyeing, printing or final finishing. Physical and chemical surface changes in cotton structure are noticed after CORONA discharge. The increase in oxidation potential {{and the creation of}} channels through cuticle are referred as responsible for the variation in cotton properties after plasmatic discharge, specially concerning absorption of water and treatment baths. Advantages as the use of less chemicals, namely alkalis, oxidants and other auxiliaries, the reduction of times and temperatures, less damages in the materials surely can have a strong impact in economical and ecological aspects of the process. Complete hidrophilization of cellulosic materials renders very easy the access of baths and consequently conditions to more efficient operations are found. Bleaching processes aim to give textile materials the adequate <b>whiteness</b> <b>degree,</b> the removal of sizing agents, the increase of hidrophility and cleaning by extraction of seeds, husks and waxes. The use of hydrogen peroxide in alkaline medium is a flexible and more ecological process when compared with methods based in chlorinated compounds.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the application of}} ozone to bleach raw cotton fabric using both laboratory scale set up and pilot plant. The quality of ozone bleached fabric was determined in terms of CIE <b>whiteness,</b> absorbency, <b>degree</b> of polymerisation (DP), copper number (CN) and tendering factor (TF) {{with regard to the}} conventionally bleached fabric (reference material). The application of ozonation process was also extended for color stripping of dyed cotton fabric at laboratory scale. The efficiency of ozone stripping process was measured in terms of lightness (L*), lightness difference (Ã„L*) and total color difference (Ã„E*) with respect to reference (conventionally stripped fabric samples). In case of laboratory scale application of ozone bleaching process, the maximum CIE whiteness (60 - 62) and best quality of bleached fabric was obtained at an ozone dose of 6 g/h, pH 5 and exposure time of 45 min. Strong acidic environment (pH 2 - 3) and exposure time longer than 45 min though marginally improved the <b>degree</b> of <b>whiteness</b> but deteriorated the quality of the fabric as indicated by higher copper number (0. 19) and TF (0. 94). Statistical analysis of experimental data confirmed that process parameters (ozone dose, pH and treatment time) significantly affected the efficiency of ozone bleaching process and pH had the greatest effect on whiteness and DP of bleached fabric followed in turn by ozone dose and treatment time. The dyeing quality of ozone bleached fabric in terms of colour difference (Ã„L*, Ã„a*, Ã„b* and Ã„E*) and wash fastness properties was almost similar to the reference. The ozone bleaching waterbath was also reused several times to bleach multiple lots of raw cotton fabric and results demonstrated that CIE whiteness (60) remained stable even at 20 th reuse of same waterbath. This approach reduced the pollution load of effluent and saved water and chemicals. Since the efficiency of ozone bleaching process at pilot scale was not in parallel with its laboratory scale performance, various additives were used to enhance process efficiency. The best results in terms of whiteness (63. 79), absorbency (10 sec) and strength of bleached fabric were achieved with an addition of 2 g/l of surfactant at optimal process conditions (ozone dose of 50 g/h, pH 5 and ozone treatment time of 45 min). However, other additives (peracetic acid and H 2 O 2) did not show promising results. Dyed ozone bleached fabric samples were a bit lighter (Æ’Â¢L* > 0. 4) than reference. The values of Æ’Â¢L*, Æ’Â¢a* and Æ’Â¢b* showed minor color difference between ozone bleached fabric and reference. However, total color difference values (Æ’Â¢E* = 0. 13. 1. 06) were within acceptable limit (Æ’Â¢E*< 1). Wash fastness properties of ozone bleached fabric were identical to the reference. The whiteness of ozone bleached fabric, however, did not stand firm with increasing storage time due to the presence of aldehyde groups and ozone residues. Among various treatments performed (hot washing at 50. C, rinsing at 80. C, reductive treatment) to avoid the decrease in <b>degree</b> of <b>whiteness</b> of ozone bleached fabric, washing with sodium borohydride was proved {{as one of the best}} treatments for color stability. Ozone color stripping efficiency was a function of pH, ozone dose and treatment time and maximum color stripping was achieved at an ozone dose of 10 g/h, pH 5 and treatment time of 45 min. The stripping efficiency decreased as the % owf of dyed fabric increased from 2 % to 4 % which implied that deceolorization of dyed fabric with higher initial dye concentration required higher ozone dose and/or longer exposure time. The color stripping efficiency of ozone for fabric samples dyed at different shades was almost similar to the reference (conventional stripping method). The ozone bleaching process was proved to be environmentally friendly because it decreases water consumption (no rinsing and neutralizing treatment), it is less energy intensive (applicable at ambient temperature), and reduces effluent load (involves no chemicals) ...|$|R

This research aimed to study the patterns of rice consumer preferences in Java to be used as one of main considerations for dissemination and new varieties breeding program. Evaluation was done by conducting sensory and physicochemical analysis on five most purchased rice brand of each province on Java. Hedonic and ranking test was assessed by 1000 panelists from all the five provinces in Java. Physicochemical analysis was carried out in the Proximate Laboratory in Indonesian Center for Rice Research (ICRR), Sukamandi. The results showed that, in general, consumer preferences in each province have a similar pattern except in DIY. Consumers in West, East, and Central Java as well as in DKI Jakarta prefer rice with intermediate amylase content, while those in DIY prefer low amylase rice. Gelatinization temperature of rice is mostly high gelatinization temperature except those in DIY that were dominated by low gelatinization temperature rice. Moreover, rice color influences consumer preferences in Java except on consumers in West Java who chose rice not based on the level of rice color. Correlation analysis between consumer preferences in general with all other variables showed that consumer preferences in general were significantly affected only by the amylose content and was not influenced by other parameters. <b>Whiteness</b> <b>degree</b> of rice significantly related to consumer preferences based on color and very significant correlation based on rice translucency and taste...|$|E
