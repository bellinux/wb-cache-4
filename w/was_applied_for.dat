Glenn on June 28, 1906 and was approved by Fulton County on June 20, 1908. The Georgia Tech Alumni Association published its first annual report in 1908, but the group was largely dormant during World War I. The organization {{played an important role}} in the 1920s Greater Georgia Tech Campaign, which consolidated all existing alumni clubs and funded a significant expansion of Georgia Tech's campus.|$|E
5|$|Gibanica {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{recognizable}} pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack. In Serbia, the dish is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. According to the Serbian media, the largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. 330kg of phyllo dough, 330kg of cheese, 3,300 eggs, 30 l. of oil, 110 l. of mineral water, 50kg of lard and 500 packets of baking powder went into its creation. In Serbia, as well as in neighboring countries, there are festivals dedicated to pies. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It first took place in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Since 1889, Wisden has {{published}} a list of Cricketers of the Year, typically selecting five cricketers that had the greatest impact during the previous English cricket season. However, in the 2000 edition, the editor Matthew Engel recognised that {{the best players in}} the world were typically no longer playing English domestic cricket, and opted to select the Cricketers of the Year based on their performances anywhere in the world. This criterion <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> the following three years, but in 2004 it reverted to being based on the English season, and a Leading Cricketer in the World was also selected. The recipient of the award is selected by the editor of Wisden, with advice from cricket experts. An Australian, Ricky Ponting was chosen as the first winner of the award, for scoring 1,503 runs in international cricket, including eleven centuries during 2003.|$|E

25|$|Russian domes {{are often}} gilded or brightly painted. A {{dangerous}} technique of chemical gilding using mercury had been applied on some occasions until the mid-19th century, {{most notably in}} the giant dome of Saint Isaac's Cathedral.

SNCF operates the TGV service between Paris and Stuttgart via Strasbourg and a daily return journey from Paris to Frankfurt via Saarbrücken, while ICE trains operate the remaining Paris to Frankfurt.|$|E
25|$|As in {{many other}} countries, water {{resources}} management in Brazil has historically relied upon heavy investment on hydraulic infrastructure. From building the first hydropower facility in 1901 until the mid-1970s, hydropower has been {{the main focus of}} water resources management. In 1934, after several modifications introduced to the first 1907 draft, the Water Code was approved. The Water Code was the first legislation for water resources management in Brazil, and <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> more than 60years.|$|E
25|$|Skiff {{racing in}} the United Kingdom {{is governed by}} the Skiff Racing Association, which was formed in 1901 {{to ensure that a}} {{standard}} set of rules <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> racing and boat construction. The Association is run by a committee elected from the affiliated clubs and regattas, and is affiliated to the British Rowing (formerly ARA). The rules of racing are based on those of British Rowing closely enough that British Rowing qualified umpires may also umpire skiff races.|$|E

The fire was later declared {{not to have been}} a case of arson.|$|E
25|$|Two gilding {{techniques}} were applied on the carved ornaments of the icon screen: burnished and matte gilding. Both methods contain about 18–60% dissolved gold. In the burnished technique {{the surface is}} polished, after the gilding is dry. This method results a glossier, more emphasized surface. Among others the stems of the plants, the veins of the leaves, the flower heads and the plane surfaces of the icon frames were gilt with burnished gilding. Matte gilding <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> {{the surface of the}} leaves and generally the deeper parts of the carved ornaments.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s there was a big interest in the mathematical approach to modeling and simulation of parallel processes. This approach may be applied to the analysis of correctness of parallel and distributed programs. The Distributed Computer Network (DCN) research group at Saint Petersburg Technical University developed such a software system for the analysis of program correctness; the new tool was named COVERS (Concurrent Verification and Simulation). This system allowed graphical modeling notation for system structure and behavior. The tool <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> the research granted by Hewlett Packard.|$|E

25|$|A {{radial arm}} saw has a {{circular}} saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|E
25|$|In an {{accident}} flight, the {{cockpit voice recorder}} (CVR) can usually record its final minutes. In the Partnair crash, however, it had recorded {{the start of the}} flight and stopped shortly before the aircraft took off. From the maintenance records investigators found that, 10 years prior to the accident flight, the cockpit voice recorder's power supply had been re-wired to connect to the aircraft's generator instead of the aircraft's battery if full power <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> takeoff. As the generator was inoperative on this flight, power to the CVR shut off as the aircraft took off.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} ways to properly muffle a marching bass drum. If the tuner uses generic weather-stripping type foam, start with medium density. If inexperienced or {{do not know how}} much foam to apply, the person should apply it to the outside of the head after he/she has put the head onto the drum. Once drum is tuned to the right pitch, make a note of how much foam <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> future head changes. At that time, apply the foam {{to the inside of the}} head before its placed on the drum. This provides a cleaner look to the drumhead and will protect the foam from falling from the player's beating and the environment.|$|E

25|$|The main {{difficulty}} in applying {{this process is}} in determining the number of knots to use and {{where they should be}} placed. de Boor suggests various strategies to address this problem. For instance, the spacing between knots is decreased in proportion to the curvature (2nd. derivative) of the data. A few applications have been published. For instance, the use of B-splines for fitting single Lorentzian and Gaussian curves has been investigated. Optimal spline functions of degrees 3-7 inclusive, based on symmetric arrangements of 5, 6, and 7 knots, have been computed and the method <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> smoothing and differentiation of spectroscopic curves. In a comparable study, the two-dimensional version of the Savitzky-Golay filtering and the spline method produced better results than moving average or Chebyshev filtering.|$|E
