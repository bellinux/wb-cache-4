5|$|Chrysler Corporation {{approved}} {{the development of}} the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe <b>would</b> <b>sell</b> 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5percent share of the executive car market.

5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin {{was not interested}} in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games <b>would</b> <b>sell</b> for the console.

Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars title.|$|E

Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was more optimistic and decided to print 12,000 copies.

5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles.

This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E
