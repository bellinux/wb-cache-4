25|$|Reswitching {{means that}} there is no simple (monotonic) {{relationship}} between the nature of the techniques of production used and the rate of profit.

It {{means that the}} young toddler may use sounds that are easier to produce instead of the proper sound in a word. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>see</b> that the child replace the 'r' sound with 'l' or 'w', the 'n' with 'd' and so on.|$|E

25|$|Buildings {{constantly}} evolve as {{a result}} of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly interacting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>see</b> a window as changing slightly over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In fact, the “dirt” we see may be evolving {{as a result}} of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.|$|E
25|$|Why {{is it that}} we {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>see</b> similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E

Though <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>see</b> evidence of his globulist understanding of organic matter (and indeed, this view has frequently been cited as evidence of his observational inadequacies), this minor preoccupation cannot detract from two firm principles that underlie his work: (a) a clear ability to construct experimental procedures which were, for their time, rational and repeatable, and (b) a willingness both to fly {{in the face of}} received opinion – for example, over the question of spontaneous generation – and to abandon a previously held belief in the light of new evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from its}} {{fund-raising}} function, {{the spectacle of}} Bethlem offered moral instruction for visiting strangers. For the [...] "educated" [...] observer Bedlam's theatre of the disturbed might operate as a cautionary tale providing a deterrent example {{of the dangers of}} immorality and vice. The mad on display functioned as a moral exemplum of what might happen if the passions and appetites were allowed to dethrone reason. As one mid-eighteenth-century correspondent commented: [...] " [...] better lesson [...] be taught us in any part of the globe than in this school of misery. Here <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>see</b> the mighty reasoners of the earth, below even the insects that crawl upon it; and from so humbling a sight we may learn to moderate our pride, and to keep those passions within bounds, which if too much indulged, would drive reason from her seat, and level us with the wretches of this unhappy mansion".|$|E
2500|$|According to folk etymology, {{the name}} [...] "Kashmir" [...] means [...] "desiccated land" [...] (from the Sanskrit: Ka = water and shimeera = desiccate). [...] In the Rajatarangini, {{a history of}} Kashmir written by Kalhana in the mid-12th century, it is stated that the valley of Kashmir was {{formerly}} a lake. According to Hindu mythology, the lake was drained by the great rishi or sage, Kashyapa, son of Marichi, son of Brahma, by cutting {{the gap in the}} hills at Baramulla (Varaha-mula). When Kashmir had been drained, Kashyapa asked Brahmins to settle there. This is still the local tradition, and in the existing physical condition of the country, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>see</b> some ground for the story which has taken this form. The name of Kashyapa is by history and tradition connected with the draining of the lake, and the chief town or collection of dwellings in the valley was called Kashyapa-pura, which has been identified with Kaspapyros of Hecataeus (apud Stephanus of Byzantium) and Kaspatyros of Herodotus (3.102, 4.44). Kashmir is also believed to be the country meant by Ptolemy's Kaspeiria. Cashmere is an archaic spelling of Kashmir, and in some countries it is still spelled this way.|$|E

2500|$|Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, {{challenged}} the film's high praise by saying [...] "there {{should be no}} need to pretend There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece just because Anderson sincerely {{tried to make it}} one." [...] Some critics were positive toward the work but less laudatory, often criticizing its ending. Roger Ebert assigned the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, [...] "There Will Be Blood is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by No Country for Old Men, and that is a great film, and a perfect one. But There Will Be Blood is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>see</b> its reach exceeding its grasp." [...] Carla Meyer of the Sacramento Bee, who gave the film the same star rating as Ebert, opined that the final confrontation between Daniel and Eli marked when the work [...] "stops being a masterpiece and becomes a really good movie. What was grand becomes petty, then overwrought." [...] In 2014, Peter Walker of The Guardian likewise argued that the scene [...] "might not be the very worst scene in the history of recent Oscar-garlanded cinema [...] but it’s perhaps the one most inflated with its own delusional self-importance." ...|$|E
