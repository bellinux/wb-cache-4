5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E

500|$|Other ticks, {{mainly the}} Argasidae, are [...] "nidicolous", finding hosts in their nests or burrows, and in caves {{in the case}} of bats. They use the same stimuli as non-nidicolous species to {{identify}} hosts, with body heat and odors often being the main factors. Many of them feed primarily on birds, though some Ornithodoros, for example, feed on mammals. Both groups feed rapidly, typically biting painfully and drinking their fill within minutes. None of the species stick to the host in the way that hard ticks do. Unlike the Ixodidae that have no fixed dwelling place except on the host, they live in sand or in crevices near animal dens or nests, or in human dwellings <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> out nightly to attack roosting birds, or emerge when they detect carbon dioxide in the breath of their hosts.|$|E

500|$|The {{story begins}} with the player imprisoned in a cell for an unknown crime.

The emperor and the Blades reveal that the player's jail cell contains a secret entrance to {{a part of the}} city's sewer that functions as an escape route. Pardoned by the emperor, the player follows the group into the sewer, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> under attack by assassins. All but one of the Blades are cut down in the fighting that ensues. Knowing he is destined to die by the hands of the assassins, Uriel Septim entrusts the player with the Amulet of Kings, worn by the Septim emperors of Tamriel, and orders the player to take it to a man named Jauffre, the grand master of the Blades, at Weynon Priory.

The stories were later collected in Le Guin's anthology The Wind's Twelve Quarters (1975). Earthsea was also used as the setting for a story Le Guin wrote in 1965 or 1966, which was never published. In 1967, Herman Schein (the publisher of Parnassus Press and the husband of Ruth Robbins, the illustrator of the book) asked Le Guin to try writing a book [...] "for older kids", giving her complete freedom over the subject and the approach. Le Guin had no previous experience specifically with the genre of young adult literature, which rose in prominence during the late 1960s. Drawing from her short stories, Le Guin began work on A Wizard of Earthsea. Le Guin {{has said that the}} book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from. Le Guin later said that she chose the medium of fantasy, and the theme of coming of age, with her intended adolescent audience in mind.|$|E
