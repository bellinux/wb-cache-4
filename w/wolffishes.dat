50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas denticulatus), or rock turbot, {{is a large}} marine fish of the Anarhichadidae family. Other {{common names}} include the bull-headed catfish, blue catfish, broad-headed catfish, jelly <b>wolffish,</b> and the Arctic <b>wolffish.</b> Inuit in the Western Arctic (Bathurst Inlet) do not distinguish between the northern <b>wolffish</b> and the Bering <b>wolffish</b> (A. orientalis), calling both by the name akoak or akoaksaluk ("old woman fish").|$|R
40|$|Field caught common <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas lupus) {{and spotted}} <b>wolffish</b> (A. minor) {{have been raised}} from fry on dry pellets. The two species have {{experienced}} annual fluctuations in temperature between 6 and 12 °C and the results indicates that both species have there best growth rates below 10 °C. With initial average wet weights of 2. 6 g (common <b>wolffish)</b> and 6. 3 g (spotted <b>wolffish),</b> and at equal experimental conditions, the spotted <b>wolffish</b> reached four times the wet weight of the common <b>wolffish</b> {{over a period of}} two years and 10 months, 3. 4 and 0. 9 kg respectively. The specific growth rate, however, were 0. 62 %d^- 1 and 0. 58 %d^- 1 respectively, indicating only small differences in growth rates in that period. Estimates based upon the fastest growing fish in the experimental groups indicated that at optimum temperature conditions (approx 6 °C) the spotted <b>wolffish</b> will probably reach a total wet weight of 6 kg in two years from start-feeding, while the common <b>wolffish</b> (below 10 °C) will reach a weight of 3 kg in that same period.

50|$|Zoarcoidei is a {{suborder}} of the Perciformes, {{the largest}} order of fish. The suborder includes the <b>wolffishes,</b> gunnels and eelpouts. The suborder includes about 400 species.|$|E
50|$|Northern {{wolffish}} {{are found}} offshore {{in cold water}} (below 5°C) at depths ranging between the surface and 1200 m, but most often below 150 m. These fish inhabit {{a wide range of}} bottom types, including silt, rocks, coarse sand, and shell hash. They use large rocks for shelter and nest building. Late in the year, females lay about 46,500 large eggs (up to 8 mm in diameter) which sink to the sea floor, where they are guarded in nests by the males until they hatch. Growth rates are slow, and they mature at five years or older. Their lifespans are at least 12 years. Unlike other <b>wolffishes,</b> northerns have been found off the bottom during both the juvenile and adult stages. The species does not form large schools or undertake long migrations.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> can {{be distinguished}} from the spotted <b>wolffish</b> (A. minor) and the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> (A. lupus) by its more uniform body colour and its soft, jelly-like musculature. Its head is also proportionally larger to its body and its upper lip is thick and covered with papillae.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> {{is protected}} under the Canadian federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). A recovery team for the northern and spotted <b>wolffish</b> has almost completed a recovery strategy and plan for both species. The strategy provides a framework for improving the status of <b>wolffish</b> through an enhanced understanding of their life history, potential sources of harm, and implementing management measures such as live release of captured <b>wolffish.</b> The plan also includes habitat stewardship and educational activities designed to involve stakeholders and inform the public.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> {{is thick}} and heavyset, {{with a large}} head and teeth {{at the front of}} the jaw that are smaller and sharper than the other two <b>wolffish</b> species found in Atlantic Canada. The shape and size of its mouth and teeth allow it to capture moving (pelagic) prey. It can grow to 145 cm in length and almost 20 kg in weight. The northern <b>wolffish</b> has a more uniform body colour than the other <b>wolffish</b> species, ranging from grey to dark chocolate, sometimes with a light violet sheen.|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} 7 995 {{individuals}} of three wolffish species {{distributed in the}} north Atlantic were analyzed: 1 016 of northern wolffish (Anarhichas denticulatus), 4 783 of Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) and 2 196 of spotted wolffish (A. minor). The individuals sampled were taken in the NAFO Area Divisions 3 NO in spring in the period 2002 - 2005, Div. 3 L in summer in the period 2003 - 2004, Div. 3 M in summer in the period 1993 - 2005, and in the ICES Area Div. IIb in autumn in the period 2004 - 2005. Feeding intensity was higher in the NAFO Area than in the northeast Atlantic (spring-summer vs. autumn), mainly in spotted wolffish in Div. 3 M. The importance of each prey taxa was evaluated using the weight percentage. Wolffish species diet showed geographical differences. Ontogenic diet changes and prey variation throughout the studied period were observed, mainly in Atlantic and spotted <b>wolffishes.</b> This two species preyed primarily on bottom (echinoderms, gastropods and bivalves) and benthopelagic (northern shrimp and redfish) organisms on Flemish Cap and Grand Bank. However fish and northern shrimp predation were more important on the Flemish Cap, mainly in spotted wolffish, showing periods with higher predation on these prey when the biomass of these prey species increased. This fact {{might have been the}} cause of diet overlap between Atlantic and spotted <b>wolffishes</b> in some periods in Div. 3 M. Less ontogenic, annual and geographical diet variations were found in northern wolffish in NAFO Area, feeding mainly on ctenophores; however in Svalbard area, this species showed to be highly piscivore.

40|$|The stomach {{contents}} of 4320 fishes comprising 14 species {{were collected from}} Flemish Cap Bank (NW Newfoundland) at depths ranging from 130 to 730 m, during summer 1993. The general feeding intensity was high in all species. Three main feeding patterns were evident: the genus Sebastes consume primarily pelagic species, although they also feed on preys which migrate vertically such as shrimps, Euphausids and mysids. The benthic group {{is made up of}} American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cygnoglossus), arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), <b>wolffishes</b> (Anarhichas lupus and Anarhichas minor) and thorny skate (Raja radiata). Lastly, the group of benthopelagic fish remains, longf in hake (Urophycis chesteri), cod (Gadus morhua), grenadiers (Nezumia bairdi and Macrourus berglax) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Pelagic and benthopelagic preys are an important food resource for all fish considered, the abundance of Hyperids, P. borealis and Sebastes sp. in summer makes them an important food resource in the diet of fish in Flemish Cap...|$|E
40|$|Since 1988 Greenland Institute of Natural Resources {{annually}} {{has conducted}} a bottom trawl survey off West Greenland.

This paper presents biomass and abundance estimates together with length frequencies of cod, Greenland halibut, redfish, <b>wolffishes,</b> American plaice and starry skate from the 2001 survey. Further, a recruitment index for Greenland halibut is presented.

40|$|Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank regions {{inhabit the}} {{southern}} edge of the species distribution. Analyses herein were limited to the stock component completely within United States waters, which excluded some historically important transboundary portions of Georges Bank. There is currently no fishery management plan for the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> in U. S. waters. Wolfish are associated with rough topography. Catchability of <b>wolffish</b> is low in NEFSC trawl surveys due to this habitat preference. Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> are long-lived (22 years), late maturing, and of low fecundity. Males guard the eggs in nests in the fall. Larger <b>wolffish</b> are caught in the spring survey compared to the fall, perhaps due to nest guarding behavior. All fishery independent survey indices show a declining trend in abundance over the time series. The commercial catch has also declined steadily since 1983. However there is no size truncation in the catch over the time series. A <b>wolffish</b> growth study from the 1980 s in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank region was done by Nelson and Ross (1992).

50|$|The Atlantic <b>wolffish's</b> {{distinguishing}} feature, {{from which}} it gets its common name, is its extensive teeth structure. Its dentition distinguishes the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> {{from all the other}} members of the Anarhichadidae family. Both the lower and upper jaws are armed with four to six fang-like, strong, conical teeth. Behind the conical teeth in the upper jaw, there are three rows of crushing teeth. The central row has four pairs of molars and the outer rows house blunted conical teeth. The lower jaw has two rows of molars behind the primary conical teeth. The <b>wolffish's</b> throat is also scattered with serrated teeth.|$|R

30|$|We {{confirmed}} the species-specific {{differences in the}} hormonal tissue distribution in teleost fish and demonstrated a unique distribution of IAPP in the Atlantic <b>wolffish.</b> The presence of this difference in the population of cells secreting IAPP deserves further investigation. Previous phylogenetic analyses have shown that pancreatic peptides are relatively well conserved among vertebrates. However, the IAPP amino acid sequence differs among teleost fish. Our study shows that the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> is devoid of amyloid in vivo and the segment 19 - 34 is non-amyloidogenic, according to the in silico secondary structure analysis. Amyloidosis of pancreatic islets would not be expected as a spontaneous disease in the Atlantic <b>wolffish.</b> The Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> thus could be a potential candidate to isolate the endocrine tissues for pancreatic xenografts. This study adds new insight in the characterization of fish pancreatic peptides whose physiological functions remain to be elucidated.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the early}} 2000 s, {{experimental}} rearing of spotted <b>wolffish,</b> Anarhichas minor, {{was started in}} Iceland. Health surveillance, carried out at regular intervals during the rearing period, revealed persistent and highly prevalent Kudoa infections of fish muscles which caused great financial losses due to post mortem myoliquefaction. In addition, during the traditional process of drying and smoking wild Atlantic lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus, the muscles from some fish almost completely disappear and the fish have to be discarded. To describe the etiological agent responsible for these conditions, spotted <b>wolffish,</b> Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> Anarhichas lupus, northern <b>wolffish</b> Anarhichas denticulatus and Atlantic lumpfish were caught off the Icelandic coast and examined {{for the presence of}} Kudoa. We describe a novel myxosporean, Kudoa islandica n. sp., using morphological and molecular data, and show with histopathology that it causes extensive myoliquefaction in three different wild fish hosts, which all are commercially valuable species in Iceland. Although some spore dimensions varied significantly between fish species, the molecular analyses showed that the same parasite was responsible for infection in all fish. The northern <b>wolffish</b> was not found to be infected. Although robustly placed in the Kudoa clade in phylogenetic analyses, K. islandica was phylogenetically distinct from other kudoids. A single myxosporean, K. islandica, is responsible for the infections in the somatic muscles of lumpfish and <b>wolffish,</b> causing extensive post mortem myoliquefaction. This myxosporean is likely to infect other fish species and it is important to study its life cycle in order to evaluate any threat to salmonid culture via the use of lumpfish as a biocontrol for sea lice...|$|R
