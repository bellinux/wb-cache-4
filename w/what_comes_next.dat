Mazzara teased the episode {{in a conference call}} with various journalists: [...] "We're proud of this finale, we've been building to it all season, and we can't wait for you to see it. [...] There's more bloodshed coming. They thought they were safe on this farm, they were wrong. [...] We're on a killing spree here. [...] There are answers {{about the nature of the}} virus in the finale. [...] I will guarantee people will watch this finale and want to know <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> <b>next.</b> People will have a lot of questions, but in a good way." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2016 Brit Awards, Lorde gave a {{performance}} of [...] "Life on Mars" [...] in tribute to the late English singer David Bowie. According to Billboard, Lorde said she'd be writing new material in December 2013. While responding to a fan on her Instagram account in August 2016, {{she said that the}} record is written and they're in production stages now. In November, she posted a note on her Facebook account stating: [...] "Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record— well, this one is about <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> <b>next.</b> ...The party is about to start. I am about to show you the new world." ...|$|E
500|$|Developers tasked both art and map design {{personnel}} {{with creating}} levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a [...] "grow as you play" [...] philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like [...] "Beat" [...] {{or the use}} of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as [...] "very good" [...] or [...] "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: [...] "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's this thing and here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula will come up to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. So now I have to hit the guy three times..." [...] Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, [...] "What am I doing?" [...] Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> <b>next</b> in the current quest or storyline.|$|E

2500|$|Characters {{that often}} appear with Death include his butler Albert; his granddaughter Susan Sto Helit; the Death of Rats, {{the part of}} Death in charge of {{gathering}} the souls of rodents; Quoth, a talking raven (a parody of Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Raven", although it flat-out refuses to say [...] "Nevermore"); and the Auditors of Reality, personifications of the orderly physical laws and the closest thing Death has to a nemesis. Death or Susan appear as the main characters in five Discworld novels. He also appears in the short stories Death and <b>What</b> <b>Comes</b> <b>Next,</b> Theatre of Cruelty and Turntables of the Night.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the fate}} of the top {{government}} officials' unknown to the public, Stone acts as leader of the police forces deployed to ensure that the riots are contained should V still be alive and make his promised public announcement. Evey appears to a crowd, dressed as V, announcing the destruction of 10 Downing Street the following day and telling the crowd they must [...] "...choose <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> <b>next.</b> Lives of your own, or a return to chains", whereupon a general insurrection begins. Evey destroys 10 Downing Street by blowing up an Underground train containing V's body, in the style of an explosive Viking funeral. She abducts Stone, apparently to train him as her successor. The book ends with Finch quietly observing the chaos raging in the city and walking down an abandoned motorway whose lights have all gone out.|$|E
2500|$|DeLillo {{published}} Point Omega, his fifteenth novel, in February 2010. According to DeLillo, {{the novel}} considers an idea from [...] "the {{writing of the}} Jesuit thinker and paleontologist [...] Teilhard de Chardin." [...] The 'Omega Point' of the title [...] " [...] the possible idea that human consciousness is reaching a point of exhaustion and that <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> <b>next</b> may be either a paroxysm or something enormously sublime and unenvisionable." [...] Point Omega is DeLillo's shortest novel to date, and he has said it could {{be considered as a}} companion piece to The Body Artist: [...] "In its reflections on time and loss, this may be a philosophical novel and maybe, considering its themes, the book shares a place in my work with The Body Artist, another novel of abbreviated length." [...] Reviews thus far have been polarised, with some saying the novel is a return to form and innovative, while others have complained about the novel's brevity and apparent lack of plot and engaging characters. Upon its initial release, Point Omega spent one week on the New York Times Bestseller List, peaking at #35 on the extended version of the list during its one-week stay on the list.|$|E

2500|$|On Drosnin's {{claim of}} Rabin's death, Drosnin {{wrote in his}} book [...] "The Bible Code" [...] (published in 1997) on page 120; [...] "Yigal Amir {{could not be found}} in advance". This is very telling in that {{dangerous}} period of Israeli politics from the Oslo Accords of 1993 to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995. Critics have noted a huge error in the [...] "code" [...] Drosnin claimed to have found: Drosnin misused the Biblical verse Deuteronomy 4:42. Scholars note; [...] "For example, citing again the passage intersecting with Rabin: that passage is from Deuteronomy 4:42, but Drosnin ignores the words immediately following [...] "a murderer who will murder." [...] <b>What</b> <b>comes</b> <b>next</b> is the phrase [...] "unwittingly" [...] (biveli da'at). This is because the verse deals with the cities of refuge where accidental killers can find asylum. In this case, then, the message would refer to an accidental killing of (or by) Rabin and it would therefore be wrong. Another message (p.71) supposedly contains a [...] "complete" [...] description of the terrorist bombing of a bus in Jerusalem on February 25, 1996. It includes the phrase [...] "fire, great noise," [...] but overlooks the fact that the letters which make up those two words are actually part of a larger phrase from Genesis 35:4 which says: [...] "under the terebinth that was near Shechem." [...] If the phrase does tell of a bus bombing, why not take it to indicate that it would be in Nablus, the site of ancient Shechem?" ...|$|E
