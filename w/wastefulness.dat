In 1928, the first five-year plan was launched, its main focus on boosting heavy industry; it was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wastefulness</b> being disrespectful, Yup'ik elders {{made use}} of every last scrap from hunts and harvests: seal guts, skins of salmon fish, dried grasses such as Leymus mollis (coarse {{seashore}} grass). Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine mammals such as seal and walrus, and land mammals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. Fish skin and marine mammal intestines (guts) were used for waterproof shells (as gut parka) and boots. Dried grass was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{subsistence}} {{activity for}} the Yup'ik is fishing, though hunting supplements {{the food supply}} and provides skins for clothing. The Yup'ik fur and skin clothing, like other Eskimo groups, is {{a key factor in}} ensuring their survival in the northernmost reaches of the globe. The raw materials of traditional Yup'ik clothing are skin (hide) and fur (pelt), intestine (gut), sinew, and grass. The raw material resources are sea and land mammals, birds, fish and plants. Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine and land animals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. Fish skin and marine mammal intestines were used for waterproof shells and boots. Grass was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread. <b>Wastefulness</b> being disrespectful, Yup'ik elders made use of every last scrap from hunts and harvests: seal guts became warm, waterproof, and breathable parkas; the skins of fish were fashioned into waterproof mittens, while their heads and entrails were stored in naturally refrigerated pits as insurance against future famine. Dried grasses became anything from insulating socks to bedding to sled rope, or even goggles to protect against snow blindness.|$|E
25|$|The Qianlong Emperor (25 September 1711– 7 February 1799) was {{the sixth}} emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, {{and the fourth}} Qing emperor to rule over China proper. Born Aisin Gioro Hongli, {{sometimes}} referred to simply as Hongli, the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, he reigned officially from 11 October 1735 to 8 February 1796. On 8 February, he abdicated in favour of his son, the Jiaqing Emperor – a filial act {{in order not to}} reign longer than his grandfather, the illustrious Kangxi Emperor. Despite his retirement, however, he retained ultimate power as the Emperor Emeritus (or Retired Emperor) until his death in 1799; he thus was the longest-reigning de facto ruler in the history of China, and dying at the age of 87, the longest-living. As a capable and cultured ruler inheriting a thriving empire, during his long reign the Qing Empire reached its most splendid and prosperous era, boasting a large population and economy. As a military leader, he led military campaigns expanding the dynastic territory to the largest extent by conquering and sometimes destroying Central Asian kingdoms. This turned around in his late years: the Qing empire began to decline with corruption and <b>wastefulness</b> in his court and a stagnating civil society.|$|E

The Cuban nationalist bibliographer Carlos Manuel Trelles later wrote that Magoon [...] "profoundly corrupted the Cuban nation, and on account of his venality was looked upon with contempt."

His experiments showed that the [...] "astonishing length" [...] of the 11inch (290mm) long nectary hanging from Angraecum sesquipedale flowers implied {{the need for an}} as yet unknown moth with a proboscis 10–11inches (250–275mm) long to pollinate these flowers in Madagascar. He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that [...] "there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the Angræcum and the proboscis of certain moths".

500|$|Edge {{praised the}} game's balance of {{challenge}} and accessibility.

Diehard GameFan Taylor wrote that there was enough gameplay innovation to make him cry and listed his favorites as the Baby Mario cape invincibility power-up, the machine gun-style seed spitting, and the snowball hill level. Nintendo Life Watts called the egg stockpiling mechanic as [...] "clever" [...] for the way it encourages experimentation with the environment as well as tempered <b>wastefulness.</b> Edge thought of Yoshi's Island as a [...] "fusion of technology and creativity, each enhancing the other".

500|$|Wallace {{wrote on}} other social and {{political}} topics including his support for women's suffrage, and repeatedly on the dangers and <b>wastefulness</b> of militarism. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: [...] "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and {{that the results of}} war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea [...] "...that this new horror is [...] "inevitable," [...] and that {{all we can do is}} to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the three}} years after the stock market crashed in 1929, 50 Philadelphia banks closed. Of those only two were large, Albert M. Greenfield's Bankers Trust Company and the Franklin Trust Company. Savings and loan {{associations}} also faced trouble, with mortgages of 19,000 properties being foreclosed in 1932 alone. By 1934, 1,600 of 3,400 savings and loan associations had shut down. [...] From 1929 to 1933, regional manufacturing fell by 45 percent; factory payrolls fell by 60 percent; retail sales fell by 40 percent. Worst hit of all was construction, where payrolls dropped 84 percent. Unemployment peaked in 1933, when 11.5 percent of whites, 16.2 percent of African Americans, and 19.1 percent of foreign-born whites were out of work. Mayor J. Hampton Moore blamed people's economic woes, not on the worldwide Great Depression, but on laziness and <b>wastefulness,</b> and claimed there was no starvation in the city. Soon after, he fired 3,500 city workers, instituted pay cuts, forced unpaid vacation, and reduced the number of contracts the city awarded. This saved Philadelphia millions of dollars, and the efforts kept the city from defaulting on its debts, but were unpopular among the unemployed. The city relied on state money to fund relief efforts. [...] Moore's successor S. Davis Wilson instituted numerous programs financed by Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal's Works Progress Administration, despite condemning the program during his mayoral campaign. At the peak of WPA-financed jobs in 1936, 40,000 Philadelphians were employed under the program.|$|E
500|$|The battle {{illustrated}} {{the power of}} concentrated artillery fire and the <b>wastefulness</b> of massed attacks by infantry against modern firepower. Hundreds of Chinese dead lay {{in front of the}} UN positions, with the valley floor [...] "almost covered with dead Chinese". Wilton later recounted that on [...] "the approaches to 2 RAR [...] the bodies literally carpeted the ground sometimes two deep". Later, it was estimated that Chinese casualties numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 killed, with the majority of them inflicted by the New Zealand gunners. At least nine Chinese battalions were believed to {{have been involved in the}} attacks. The fighting between 24–26 July had cost the Australians five killed and 24 wounded, while during the previous two weeks on The Hook 2 RAR had lost a total of 17 men killed and 31 wounded. It had been a bitter struggle to the very end and as a testimony to the ferocity of the fighting, the Royal Australian Regiment was subsequently granted the battle honour [...] "The Samichon". Many Australians were later awarded bravery decorations for their actions. The New Zealand gunners had played a crucial role in stemming the Chinese assault and during these final actions the commander of 163 Battery, 16 RNZA—Major James Spence—had positioned himself well-forward in order to effectively co-ordinate the indirect fires of his guns. Spence was subsequently awarded the Military Cross, while a member of his tactical party, Gunner Arthur Bolton, was later Mentioned in Despatches. In total over the three nights more than 23,000 rounds were fired by the Commonwealth Divisional Artillery.|$|E

This approach, which might be called the 'robber baron' interpretation of the forest industry, was first adopted by A.R.M. Lower in The North American Assault on the Canadian Forest (1938). Lower stresses the instability and transitory nature of lumbering, condemns its <b>wastefulness,</b> praises the early efforts at conservation and by calling the lumber men 'buccaneers.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{social and}} {{political}} philosophy, economics underlies much of the debate. Bernard de Mandeville's The Fable of the Bees (1714) became a centre-point of controversy regarding trade, morality, and social ethics. [...] Mandeville argued that <b>wastefulness,</b> lust, pride, {{and all the other}} [...] "private" [...] vices were good for the society at large, for each led the individual to employ others, to spend freely, and to free capital to flow through the economy. Mandeville's work is full of paradox and is meant, at least partially, to problematize what he saw as the naive philosophy of human progress and inherent virtue. [...] However, Mandeville's arguments, initially an attack on graft of the War of the Spanish Succession, would be quoted often by economists who wished to strip morality away from questions of trade.|$|E

2500|$|As a Marxist, Stalin {{believed}} in an inevitable class {{war between the}} world's working and middle classes.

He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes, and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism. The new state would then be able to ensure that all citizens had access to work, food, shelter, healthcare, and education, with the <b>wastefulness</b> of capitalism eliminated by a new, standardised economic system.

[...] However, it was also said that Emperor Wenzong, while humble and willing to open to suggestions, was indecisive, often changing his minds after initially agreeing to the chancellors' suggestions. [...] At one point, the chancellor Wei Chuhou objected and offered to resign, but Emperor Wenzong did not accept his resignation. [...] Meanwhile, Emperor Wenzong honored his mother Consort Xiao as an empress dowager, and continued to honor his grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Guo and Emperor Jingzong's mother Empress Dowager Wang as well, so there were three empresses dowager in the palace.

In the book To Save America, also published in 2010, Gingrich described PPACA as [...] "a dead end of higher taxes, bigger government, more bureaucracy and a decaying health system". With co-author Nancy Desmond, Gingrich outlined proposals for improving the American healthcare industry through a variety of means including: an overhaul of the U.S. medical research system that would reduce <b>wastefulness,</b> modernizing the FDA, eliminating Medicare fraud and abuse, and implementing a system of what they describe as [...] "personalized medicine" [...] that would improve care for individuals while reducing the costs associated with treatment.

[...] (It was written that Yang Guang did have concubines, but he pretended that he did not, and that he forced his concubines to have abortions if they became pregnant.) [...] Yang Guang further {{inflamed}} Empress Dugu by informing her that she believed that Yang Yong was determined to kill him eventually. [...] Empress Yang thus resolved to remove Yang Yong. [...] Yang Guang further had his associate Yuwen Shu persuade Yang Su's brother Yang Yue (楊約) that, because Yang Su's relationship with Yang Yong was not good, that their family would be in peril should Yang Yong succeed Emperor Wen.

[...] He also had his associate Li Bolü (麗伯律) accuse Mu Tipo's associate Wang Zichong (王子沖) of accepting bribes—knowing that if Wang were convicted, both Mu Tipo and Lady Lu would be implicated. [...] Lady Lu, however, figured out what was happening, and found ways to have Hu Junyu and Hu Junbi demoted, and further had Empress Hu deposed in late 572 and replaced with Consort Mu. [...] Zu began to suffer in his relations with Gao Wei, as the eunuchs were by now defaming him. [...] When Gao Wei consulted Lady Lu and Han, both Lady Lu and Han used the opportunity to accuse Zu of crimes. [...] Gao Wei, because he had sworn an oath to Zu earlier, spared him from death, but demoted him to the governorship of North Xu Province (北徐州, roughly modern Linyi, Shandong).
