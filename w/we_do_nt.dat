40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented for the isogeometric Boundary Element analysis of domains that contain predefine dinclusions with material properties {{that are different}} {{to the rest of}} the domain and which also may exhibit inelastic behavior. The paper is complementary to a paper published recently in this journal, which focused on plane problems. The theoretical framework and implementation are extended to three-dimensional problems here. In our approach the geometry of inclusions is described using NURBS surfaces. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization into cells is required, in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The implementation is verifie <b>do</b> <b>ntest</b> cases by comparison with either exact solutions or ones computed by the Finite Element method...|$|R

I focused on the prices of raw materials for biofuel production in connection with legislative obligations and CO 2 emissions, including the impact of indirect land use changes (ILUC) and based on searches draw conclusions from primary studies that deal with macroeconomic modeling. This thesis confirmed the hypothesis that the current agricultural policy on biofuels does not comply with the theory of comparative advantage of growing food where it is advatageous both economically and environmentally...|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity to 6 -n-propylthiouracil (PROP) tasting predicts {{sensitivity}} to food qualities {{as well as}} rejection of some strong tasting foods. Using consumer rejection threshold (CRT) method, this study aimed to assess whether systematic changes in the taste intensities of familiar foods would lead to earlier rejection of these products by PROP tasters than by PROP non-tasters. Subjects rated the intensity of PROP solution and were divided into tasters (Ts) and non-tasters (NTs). And Ts were further divided into medium-tasters (MTs) and super-tasters (STs). Difference thresholds and CRTs were then evaluated for caffeine in coffee, citric acid in orange juice, and for NaCl in beef soup. For each food, Ts were more sensitive to variations in tastants than NTs. Ts also rejected more bitter coffee, more sour orange juice, and less salty beef soup more readily than <b>did</b> <b>NTs.</b> Comparisons among NTs, MTs, and STs gave fewer clear differences...|$|R

25|$|Yorkshire {{never managed}} to score in the semi-final match at The Rose Bowl, which meant that Hampshire were set a {{relatively}} easy target of 198 to win. Michael Lumb top-scored with 43, but the late order failed to score runs quickly enough to get past 200; number ten John Blain only made six off 20 deliveries, while number nine Tim Bresnan made three off ten. Yorkshireman Deon Kruis served up some economical bowling early on to John Crawley, and bowled him for a 28-ball 8, but a 147-run partnership between Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine saw Hampshire right on track, as they won with over 10 overs to spare. Ervine made his second List A century, off 96 balls, but was caught and bowled by Richard Dawson three balls later. It <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> matter much – Hampshire only needed 20 runs to win, and Shane Watson and Nic Pothas knocked them off to book Hampshire's place in the C Trophy final.|$|R
