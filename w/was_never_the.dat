5|$|After 1907, Cooke's {{dominance}} of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced. He led the team to two more conference titles (1916–17, 1918–19), and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918–19 season, but the team <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> consistent winner {{that it was in}} the first decade under Cooke. He retired after the 1923–1924 season. His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi {{political}} organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities {{before and during the}} war. The most significant were DeVlag, Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders as well as the Catholic Rex movement in Wallonia. Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies, their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers. These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army. Unlike the German-style National Socialist agenda of DeVlag, VNV appealed directly to a Flemish separatist agenda, though this message <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> main source of their popularity. Infighting between the groups, particularly VNV and DeVlag, was considerable.|$|E

5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security {{and that they were}} allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E
5|$|Manuel made serious {{tactical}} errors, such as {{failing to}} properly scout out the route ahead. These failings {{caused him to}} lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass. The Byzantines were too dispersed, and were surrounded. The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both {{during and after the}} battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> same again.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> focal point of the Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E
