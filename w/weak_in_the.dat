5|$|Guillemin was {{selected}} for an international match between the best of London {{and the best of}} Paris, played at Stade de France on 12 March. Reichel disapproved of Guillemin's selection and suggested the Parisian front row was rather <b>weak.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event, London won 17–21 in an end-to-end contest, in which both sides scored five tries, but London managed to convert three, while Paris only one.|$|E
5|$|When {{profiling}} Kane in February 2013, Talksport {{said that}} he was best as a second striker, despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position. They wrote that he preferred to place his shots, although he could also score from distance. The report also noted that he had good pace, but was <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich. Initially a back-up to £26million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.|$|E
5|$|The men torment the {{bound and}} gagged Sally while Leatherface, now {{dressed as a}} woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the {{hitchhiker}} bring down Grandpa (John Dugan), one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer but is too <b>weak.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck when the driver stops to help; the driver knocks down Leatherface with a pipe wrench, causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck as Leatherface dances maniacally in the road with his chainsaw.|$|E

5|$|The upper molars of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} are triangular {{in overall}} shape and much broader than long, with the narrow {{end of the}} triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D.chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth, the paracone and metacone, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. D.chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone {{and in front of}} the metacone form an acute angle with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo. A cingulum (shelf) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth, but this cingulum is rather <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the paraconule and metaconule, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the protocone, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in D.chimaera. Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction. These crests end in small cusps (protoconules) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the rural}} nature of the local population, Roman control of the region {{remained}} <b>weak.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 5th century, Attila's Huns attacked the territories of today's Bulgaria and pillaged many Roman settlements. By {{the end of the}} 6th century, Avars organized regular incursions into northern Bulgaria, which were a prelude to the en masse arrival of the Slavs.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, the VFL {{expanded}} from nine teams to twelve, with Footscray, Hawthorn and North Melbourne each crossing from the VFA. North Melbourne and Hawthorn remained very <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VFL {{for a very}} long period. Although North Melbourne would become the first of the 1925 expansion sides to reach a Grand Final in 1950, initially it was Footscray that adapted to the VFL with the most ease of the three clubs, and by 1928 were well off the bottom of the ladder.|$|E

25|$|Constant {{court cases}} against Him: Swamiji {{had to face}} many court cases filed against him. The basis of these cases was the Chitrapur Math Trust deed, which was very <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense that He was the sole trustee. This meant that anybody could find any small fault in the {{execution}} of developmental programs under the trust and the blame would fall on him. Swamiji came clean in all these court cases. The fact that a guru of a community {{had to go through}} trial in court cases, resulted in a character assassination of sorts.|$|E
25|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of the fine-grained rock using optical mineralogy, X-ray crystallography, and electron microprobe has determined that the boulders consist of mud, fine silt and clay, cemented by calcite. The degree of cementation varies from being relatively <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior of a boulder to quite hard at its outside rim. The outside rims of the larger boulders consist {{of as much as}} 10 to 20% calcite because the calcite not only tightly cements the silt and clay but has also replaced it to a significant degree.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{educational}} reform tenets, polytechnic colleges were to {{give priority to}} admitting secondary vocational and technical school graduates and providing on-the-job training for qualified workers. Education reformers continued to press for the conversion of about 50 percent of upper secondary education into vocational education, which traditionally had been <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural areas. Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into vocational middle schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.|$|E

25|$|The station {{carried on}} for more than a year, {{carrying}} NBC, two newscasts a day, a typical slate of syndicated sitcom and drama reruns, and a few local productions. Advertising support was initially <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small market, and financial losses started mounting. As early as April and May 1974, the station began advertising in The Free Lance-Star that stock in Television Fredericksburg, Inc. was available to local residents. One of two non-news productions, the daily Children's World, was canceled and replaced by the then-relatively unknown The Phil Donahue Show {{at the end of the}} 1973-74 season. The station's financial losses accelerated during the summer.|$|E
25|$|The first {{trade unions}} were {{organised}} at this time, {{many of which}} were affiliated with anarchists. Instead of joining the new Marxist party as elsewhere in Europe, other workers gathered around the middle and professional classes of the Republican Party, and supported their candidates in the elections of 1899 and 1900. As a result, the party, very <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of the country, with the exception of Porto, gained increasing influence in the capital. Despite championing property rights and the free market, the Republicans promised to improve working conditions and pass social measures. However, the upper classes still lived in a society apart, unable to respond to the new political environment except with repression. The result was increasingly violent actions among the populace.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Lebanese Civil War and the 1993 {{signing of}} the Oslo Peace Agreement, as-Sai'qa has largely lost its {{usefulness}} to the Syrian government, and the state and size of the organization has deteriorated. Today, it is wholly insignificant outside Syria, although it retains a presence in Lebanon (its future is uncertain after the end in 2005 of the Syrian Army's presence in Lebanon). It is extremely <b>weak</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Bank and Gaza Strip, non-existient in the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israel within the Green Line, and has not been active during the al-Aqsa Intifada. Its importance to Syria has lessened, both because the PLO has diminished in importance compared to the Palestinian National Authority (which as-Sai'qa boycotts).|$|E
