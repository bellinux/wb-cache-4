5|$|For a while, Red and {{her pack}} are happy, feeding off the {{plentiful}} carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> upset by {{an invasion of}} large Acrocanthosaurus, huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added competition for food puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death {{of one of the}} chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red's sister. Red, torn between a prospective mate and her kin, tries to defuse the situation. Two Acrocanthosaurus watch the commotion and take the opportunity to attack the Utahraptor. Meanwhile, a Kronosaurus ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures the female Acrocanthosaurus into deep water where the larger predator is dragged under by the Kronosaurus. Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.|$|E
5|$|The present-day Mikea are not {{a remnant}} of an ancient Malagasy {{hunter-gatherer}} society, but are instead descendants of individuals who took refuge in the forest beginning in the 1800s to escape military conflict, heavy taxation and other oppressive factors. Their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> perceived by villagers and city dwellers alike as ancestral, contributing to a mystique about them that has inspired various myths and legends. They are commonly {{believed to be the}} mythical Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. While some 1,500 individuals are known to identify as Mikea, many Malagasy disbelieve that the community continues to exist in the present day.|$|E

It is determined by their religion, which involves their rejection of worldly goods and their living in the Biblical simplicity.

25|$|In Twilight, Edward meets Bella Swan, a human {{girl whose}} {{thoughts}} {{he is unable}} to read, and whose blood smells overwhelmingly sweet to him. Edward fights a growing attraction to Bella, but after saving her life on several occasions, he succumbs and eventually falls in love with her. Edward admits to Bella that he is a vampire, and that although he retains the physical body of a seventeen-year-old, he was actually born on June 20, 1901. His adoptive father, Carlisle Cullen, transformed him into a vampire in 1918 to prevent him from dying in the Spanish influenza epidemic in Chicago, Illinois by the request of Edward's mother who begged him to do whatever it took to save him. Carlisle instilled in him a sense of morality uncommon in most vampires, and central to his <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> the refusal to consider humans as food.|$|E
25|$|Homosexuality: Disease or <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life?</b> <b>is</b> a 1956 book by the {{psychoanalyst}} Edmund Bergler, {{in which}} the author argues that homosexuality is a curable illness. Bergler denies that homosexuality is caused by hormonal or other biological factors, the Oedipus complex, or having a dominant mother and a weak or absent father, instead attributing {{both male and female}} homosexuality to pre-Oedipal factors involving an unsolved masochistic conflict with the mother during the earliest period of infancy. According to Bergler, homosexuality in men reflects unconscious fear and hatred of women. Bergler argues that there are several different types of homosexuality, each with a distinct clinical profile. Bergler rejects the existence of bisexuality, maintaining that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, and criticizes the work of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. He characterizes homosexual men as sexually promiscuous, and argues that this promiscuity is a result of their unsatisfying sex lives and masochistic craving for danger. Bergler argues against immediately repealing laws against homosexuality, though he suggests that such laws could perhaps be repealed in the future if other measures against homosexuality proved effective. Bergler proposes the publicizing of his ideas as a measure against homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The Central Tibetan Administration {{also says}} that {{millions}} of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Exile groups say that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> now irrevocably changed. It is also reported that when Hu Yaobang, the {{general secretary of the}} Communist Party of China, visited Lhasa in 1980 he was unhappy when he found out the region was behind neighbouring provinces. Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms. But monks and nuns are still sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) continue to flee Tibet yearly. At the same time, many Tibetans believe projects that the PRC implement to benefit Tibet, such as the China Western Development economic plan or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans; they also believe the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being aimed at attracting foreign tourists. They also say that there is still preferential treatment awarded to Han Chinese in the labor market as opposed to Tibetans.|$|E
500|$|Ashwani K. Peetush of Wilfrid Laurier University {{wrote that}} in a liberal {{democracy}} freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from [...] "devastating and direct harm". He said that the cartoons [...] "create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> threatened. I do not see how such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless." [...] He {{said that it is}} reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity.|$|E

[...] Despite the show's support of the kampung lifestyle, it portrays aspects of modern living {{in a positive light}} as well. [...] Opah, an old woman, is depicted as a capable modern woman, proficient in driving a van and fixing televisions. [...] The city is characterized as a gateway to a range of cultures and ideas that are not found in a Malaysian rural village, as illustrated in the encounter and formation of a friendship between Mat and a Chinese boy in [...] "Naik Keretaku".|$|E

2500|$|Irreligion, in the {{specific}} forms of tempting God, sacrilege, and simony, is also considered {{a violation of the}} first commandment.

2500|$|In his Rumuz-i-Bekhudi (Hints of Selflessness), Iqbal {{seeks to}} prove the Islamic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> the best code of conduct for a nation's viability.

Also in Persian and published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community, Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he is true throughout to Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive analogous aspects of other religions. The Rumuz-i-Bekhudi complements the emphasis on the self in the Asrar-e-Khudi and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title Asrar-i-Rumuz (Hinting Secrets). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.|$|E
