25|$|In {{addition}} to specific treatment, personalised medicine can greatly aid the advancements of preventive care. For instance, {{many women are}} already being genotyped for certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene if they are predisposed because of {{a family history of}} breast cancer or ovarian cancer. As more causes of diseases are mapped out according to mutations that exist within a genome, the easier they can be identified in an individual. Measures can then be taken to prevent a disease from developing. Even if mutations were found within a genome, having the details of their DNA can reduce the impact or delay the onset of certain diseases. Having the genetic content of an individual will allow better guided decisions in determining the source of the disease and thus treating it or preventing its progression. This <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> useful for diseases like Alzheimer’s or cancers that are thought to be linked to certain mutations in our DNA.|$|E

2500|$|Some proof verifiers, such as Metamath, {{insist on}} having a {{complete}} derivation as input.

Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians: these are known as proof assistants. [...] They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic, such as type theory. Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> long for a human to write, results are often formalized {{as a series of}} lemmas, for which derivations can be constructed separately.|$|E

40|$|The {{organization}} {{of this paper}} is composed of three main sections. The first section intensively analyzes the discourses of John Locke. Thoroughly combing through Locke 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning the concept six fundamental principles of executive prerogative are derived. This provides a basis for comparison and understanding. The second section investigates Jean-Jacques Rousseau 2 ̆ 7 s works as an alternative proposal to the static principles of Locke. In order to effectively gain insight on executive prerogative, the basis and purpose of proper governments must be thoroughly addressed. Through Rousseau 2 ̆ 7 s various works three tenets for proper governance are built. The factors that position Rousseau to advocate for executive actions beyond the constraints of the general <b>will</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> noteworthy. The third section assesses and operationalizes the contemporary concept of executive prerogative that previous sections analyze. The principles and purposes of governance of executive prerogative according to Locke and Rousseau are operationalized as three maxims. These three maxims are used as the backdrop of the foundations that provide for proper governance the contemporary discussion of executive prerogative. ...|$|R
