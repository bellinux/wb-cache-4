50|$|The term {{judgment}} {{proof is}} {{most commonly used}} in tort and contract law contexts to refer to defendants or potential defendants who are financially insolvent. Even if a plaintiff were to secure a legal judgment against an insolvent defendant, the defendant's lack of funds would make the satisfaction of that judgment difficult, if not impossible, to secure. In such cases plaintiffs might move for <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment</b> based on the judgment. However, if the debtor is living on income from social security benefits, a retirement pension, or other social welfare, then {{this may not be}} possible, as such income is often subject to legal protections against garnishment by creditors, alternatively, the amount that can be recovered may be insufficient to cover ongoing legal expenses and related costs, making collection attempts uneconomical.|$|E

Australia, Austria, and Finland do not imprison persons for failure to pay child-support arrears. [...] In the U.S., in contrast, non-payment of child support may be treated as a criminal offense or a civil offense, and it can result in a prison or jail term.

These returns are required to be filed quarterly (every three months), and {{failure to do so}} may/will result in penalties and interest being assessed on any unpaid amounts due to the IRS. In addition, failure to estimate annual income within a 10% margin may result in additional penalties being assessed, and failure to meet all of the requirements could result in collection action being initiated by the IRS, which could include <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment</b> and seizure of personal assets, including vehicles, real property and bank accounts.|$|E
5000|$|Clarence Brandley, a Texas {{high school}} janitor, was wrongly convicted in 1980 of murder. After {{spending}} {{many years in}} prison and on death row, he was released in 1990 and he then sued the state of Texas for wrongful imprisonment in 1993. The state then responded with a bill for nearly $50,000 in child support that had not been paid while in prison. Dianna Thompson of The American Coalition of Fathers and Children told the Houston Chronicle that federal law makes it illegal for states to forgive child support payments regardless of circumstance.

40|$|Bankruptcy rates vary tremendously across states, {{and it is}} {{not obvious}} why. The number of {{candidate}} explanations is large relative to the number of states. To overcome this problem, we use zip-code-level data to identify the importance of demographic variables using within-state variation.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To improve federal debt collection, the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 established a framework of debt collection tools, including administrative <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment</b> (AWG). This report discusses {{the extent to which}} nine agencies use or plan to use AWG to collect delinquent nontax federal debt and provides GAO's perspective on ways to make AWG more widespread and effective. GAO found that none of the nine agencies had yet implemented AWG. Although AWG is not mandatory, by failing to use this tool [...] more than five years after the act's enactment and more than three years after the Department of the Treasury issued implementing regulations [...] agencies have missed an opportunity to maximize collection of delinquent debt. Agencies identified various reasons for not yet implementing AWG or for deciding not to do so, including the need to focus their resources on implementing the act's mandatory provisions. Although some agencies or programs may have valid reasons for not implementing <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment,</b> all of the larger programs that deal with individuals and that have a demonstrated risk of financial loss resulting from unpaid debt should have AWG as a viable debt collection option. Reliance on the Financial Management Service (FMS) to perform AWG as part of cross-servicing might be prudent for some agencies, provided the collection tool is used as early as practicable to maximize its collection potential. However, the act does not require that agencies refer debts for cross-servicing until they are more than 180 days delinquent, and FMS, which views <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment</b> as a tool of last resort, does not contemplate initiating AWG in most cases until the debt has been with FMS for at least 90 days. As a result, FMS's use of AWG could be significantly limited and delayed. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three self-contained {{essays in}} which I analyze {{the effects of}} consumer bankruptcy laws on household borrowing, interest rates, default decisions, and welfare in different institutional settings. Chapter 2 analyzes whether and how to regulate small dollar lending in the U. S. I show that lump-sum court filing fees prevent low-income households from filing for bankruptcy, causing them to become delinquent. In a policy experiment, I show that easier access to bankruptcy increases welfare of this group by 1 %. Chapter 3 evaluates the German bankruptcy system, which features relatively harsh <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment.</b> Since <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment</b> raises the effective marginal tax rate, it exhibits adverse effects on labor supply. Explicitly modeling labor supply, this paper documents the optimal garnishment regime for the German economy: garnishment rates are reduced by more than 25 %, while the duration of garnishment is increased from six to ten years. This results in an aggregate welfare increase of around 3. 3 %. Chapter 4 is joint work with Igor Livshits, James MacGee, and Michèle Tertilt. There is increased debate over whether the regulation of unsecured consumer lending products is required to protect some consumers from “over-borrowing. ” To assess the quantitative benefits of regulating the cost of declaring consumer bankruptcy, we analyze a life-cycle model where some consumers have excessively optimistic beliefs about their exposure to unforeseen expenses...|$|E
40|$|What are the {{positive}} and normative implications of eliminating bankruptcy protection for indebted individuals? Without bankruptcy protection, creditors can collect on defaulted debt to the extent permitted by <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment</b> laws. The elimination lowers the default premium on unsecured debt and permits low-net-worth individuals suffering bad earnings shocks to smooth consumption by borrowing. There is a large increase in consumer debt financed essentially by super-wealthy individuals, a modest drop in capital per worker, and a higher frequency of consumer default. Average welfare rises by 1 percent of consumption in perpetuity, with about 90 percent of households favoring the change. Default (Finance); Bankruptcy; Consumer credit...|$|E
40|$|Bankruptcy {{legislation}} has important welfare {{effects on the}} aggregate economy through effects on prices of and access to credit. Policy makers face a trade-off between insuring individuals against adverse shocks and providing incentives to repay debt. While the U. S. regime has a strong insurance component, many European systems are stricter in that they force delinquent households to repay (parts of) the outstanding debt through <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment.</b> This paper examines labor supply effects of the German garnishment regime and their effect on credit prices. I find that the income cap at 3, 200 EUR net income per month depresses high wage workers labor supply during bankruptcy by about 20 %. Three policy experiments are conducted to reduce the burden of income garnishment. In all cases, the amount of credit in the economy declines and default rates drop by 46 % to 56 %. This comes from a strong increase in credit prices since banks expect lower repayment. It is shown that removing the income cap and lowering garnishment rates significantly reduces adverse labor supply effects. When reducing the garnishment rate from 70 % to 30 %, disposable income of highly productive households with 60, 000 EUR gross labor income increases by nearly 2 / 3 under garnishment. On average, the economy would highly profit from abolishing <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment.</b> Removing garnishment would be equivalent to permanently increasing consumption by 1. 5 % each year. While these gains are quite substantial, young households suffer from restricted access to credit while households in their prime age enjoy better insurance against adverse events...|$|E

The option to discharge one’s debt under a liquidation regime helps alleviate some {{of the risk of}} investing in human capital. However, dischargeability triggers exclusion from borrowing and <b>wage</b> <b>garnishment.</b> Replacing liquidation with reorganization induces significant allocational consequences across education groups. Poor high school graduates with low levels of college preparedness are better off under liquidation, whereas high school graduates with high levels of assets and college preparedness are better off under reorganization.

One advantage of our framework is that it encompasses two standard versions of the life-cycle model: one with perfect capital markets and one with a non-negative net-worth restriction.

The Unicameral should undertake an immediate reconsideration of Nebraska exemption law with a view to possible elimination of the homestead exemption in favor of an expanded exemption in lieu of homestead to be available to all debtors without regard to marital or family status and applicable to real as well as personal property. The legislature should also consider whether any increase in the amount of the exemption in lieu of homestead is justified, whether such amount should be indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living from time to time, and whether special consideration should be given to debtors who support one or more dependents.
