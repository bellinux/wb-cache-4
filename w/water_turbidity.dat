5|$|Volcanic ash {{can have}} a {{detrimental}} {{impact on the environment}} which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted {{in the same way as}} urban water supply networks. Ash will increase <b>water</b> <b>turbidity</b> which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. Acidification will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding, with 30 families being {{isolated in the}} area. The only fatality from the storm also occurred in this community after a man was washed away while trying to rescue a family. The severity of damage in Big Woods prompted Jamaica Labour Party Area Council Four chairman to state {{that it should be}} declared a disaster area. Torrential rains during a two-hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area, isolating many homes and inundating several. In Westmoreland Parish, severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. One home sustained significant damage after a large tree fell on it. In Kingston, high winds damaged power lines and some homes. Water supply to most regions was cut due to damage to pipelines and high <b>water</b> <b>turbidity.</b> Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of <b>water</b> <b>turbidity.</b> In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E

40|$|Glacial meltwater {{discharge}} from the Greenland ice sheet and ice caps forms high <b>turbidity</b> <b>water</b> in the proglacial ocean off the Greenland coast. Although the timing and magnitude of high <b>turbidity</b> <b>water</b> export affect the coastal marine environment, for example, through impacts on biological productivity, {{little is known about}} the characteristics of this high <b>turbidity</b> <b>water.</b> In this paper, we therefore report on the spatial and temporal variations in high <b>turbidity</b> <b>water</b> off the Thule region in northwestern Greenland, based on remote sensing reflectance data at a wavelength of 555 nm (Rrs 555). The high turbidity area, identified on the basis of high reflectivity (Rrs 555 ≥ 0. 0070 sr− 1), was generally distributed near the coast, where many outlet glaciers terminate in the ocean and on land. The extent of the high turbidity area exhibited substantial seasonal and interannual variability, and its annual maximum extent was significantly correlated with summer air temperature. Assuming a linear relationship between the high turbidity area and summer temperature, annual maximum extent increases under the influence of increasing glacial meltwater discharge, as can be inferred from present and predicted future warming trends. グリーンランド氷床や周縁氷帽から海洋に流出する融解水によって氷床沿岸には高濁度海水域が形成され、海洋の生物生産等に影響を与えている。しかしながら、氷河融解の影響を反映した高濁度水の変動特性は明らかとなっていない。そこでグリーンランド氷床北西部Thule地域沿岸における高濁度海水域面積の時空間変動を波長 555 nmのリモートセンシング反射率を用いて解析した。解析の結果、高濁度海水域は氷床や氷帽から溢流する氷河前縁部に形成されることが確認された。その面積は顕著な季節変動および経年変動を示し、この時間変動は気温変化と有意な相関を示した。さらに、本研究で得られた夏期平均気温と高濁度海水域の最大面積の正の相関関係から、近年の気温上昇傾向に伴う融解水の流入増加によって、高濁度海水域の面積が増加しつつあることが予想された...|$|R
