5|$|In 1934, Rona {{was back}} in Paris {{studying}} with Joliot-Curie, who had discovered artificial radioactivity. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but {{she was able to}} return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time. Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons. In 1935 Rona consolidated some of these relationships, working on Stora Bornö, then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo, then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy, and later to Kålhuvudet, Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson. One of the projects the group had been working on for several years <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> there was any correlation between water depth and radium content, and their seawater research evaluated the concentration of elements in seawater collected from different locations.|$|E
25|$|The goal of Sher's NIH grant <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> {{improvement}} in a couple's interpersonal relationship {{would result in}} sustained changes in health behavior, {{improvement in}} the couple's quality of life, and health benefits specific to the cardiac patient. Working out of labs at both the Illinois Institute of Technology and Rush University Hospital, Sher's team recruited 160 participants (approximately 35% minorities, 30% women) in which one member suffered from a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, bypass graft surgery, angioplasty). Using a short term couples intervention strategy designed to optimize relationships and reduce interpersonal stress, the team focused on three areas of change: exercise, weight management, and compliance with lipid-lowering medication. These areas were targeted {{because of the difficulty}} many cardiac patients face in maintaining long-term commitments to change.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} for Irwin <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> transsaccadic memory {{is tied to}} spatial position. He {{performed}} experiments using dot patterns and later, performed {{the same type of}} experiment alongside McConkie in his effort to prove the saccade target hypothesis. In those experiments, the researchers used a picture instead of dot patterns. Participants in the experimental condition were given an initial eye position, followed by a saccade target position on the picture. Unlike Irwin’s first experiment, where the pattern did not change spatial location during the saccade, the picture underwent one of three shift conditions: All shift down, target object shift down, or background shift up. Detection of change ended up being much higher when only the target object moved compared to when the entire image shifted. This demonstrated the importance of the target object in detection of image displacements.|$|E

25|$|Singapore has {{traditionally}} relied on water from Malaysia. However, this reliance has made Singapore {{subject to the}} possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as a political leverage by threatening to cut off supply. In order to reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974. However, the water treatment plant was closed in 1975 due to cost and reliability issues. In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore Water Reclamation Study (NEWater Study). The aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore's needs. In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to increase water supplies for non-potable use. Using NEWater for these would help reduce the demand on the reservoirs for potable water.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Ernest was {{presented}} with a £92 university scholarship, and worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, {{the chairman of the}} physics department. The scholarship was insufficient to cover his living expenses, so he lived at home and commuted by bus and train. The project he shared with another student <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> the weak alpha particle activity of samarium was due to the electron or gamma ray components of cosmic rays. The work had to be carried out in a coal mine, [...] below the surface. Upon completion of these experiments, Titterton was awarded a Master of Science degree in 1938. As a requirement of his scholarship, Ernest was required to become a teacher for a year. This met with a lukewarm reception, but he graduated with his Diploma in Education, and was even awarded the Elizabeth Cadbury Prize for achieving top marks in the class. As part of his training, he taught at King Edward's School, Birmingham. To support himself, he also taught three nights a week at Birmingham Central Technical College. With his diploma in hand, he became a teacher at Bridgnorth Endowed School, a coeducational secondary school and sixth form located in the market town of Bridgnorth in the rural county of Shropshire.|$|E

In general, these {{were found to be}} false, and Verbeek discounted any claims of Krakatoa still erupting after mid-October as due to steaming of hot material, landslides due to heavy monsoon rains that season, and [...] "hallucinations due to electrical activity" [...] seen from a distance.|$|E

[...] The purpose <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> insurgents responded to information on [...] "casualty sensitivity."

2500|$|He held that, as in Tameside, the [...] "satisfaction" [...] {{referred}} to in regulation 12(6) {{is not a matter}} of pure judgment or opinion. It is also concerned with an inquiry as to a fact, namely, whether dutiable goods have been exported. Thus, the applicant had to produce evidence to show that the goods had been exported and this evidence had to be to the satisfaction of the DG. Justice Chan affirmed that the test to ascertain if the DG's decision was valid <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> the DG could reasonably have come to his decision based on the evidence before him, or, in other words, whether the DG had decided based on a tenable factual basis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to severe traffic congestion experienced by commuters from the Waimakariri District heading into Christchurch following the earthquakes of 2010–2011, Environment Canterbury commissioned the Greater Christchurch Northern Rail – Rapid Assessment {{to examine the}} possibility of a temporary passenger rail service between Rangiora and Christchurch. [...] Released on 17 July 2014, the aim of the report <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> existing rail facilities and equipment could be used, for low cost, to run a peak-time commuter service to relieve pressure on the road network until mitigation works could be completed to improve road capacity. [...] It concluded that, while the best option for providing such a service would be one that ran from Rangiora to Addington with stops at Kaiapoi and Papanui and had connecting bus services, given the narrow and specific scope of a temporary service, it was too risky and could not be justified.|$|E

This {{was the only way to}} remove the Alaafin because he could not be legally deposed. Once given the parrot's egg, the Bashorun would proclaim, [...] "the gods reject you, the people reject you, the earth rejects you." [...] The Alaafin, his eldest son, and the Samu, his personal counselor and a member of the Oyo Mesi, the Asamu, all had to commit suicide in order to renew the government all together.
