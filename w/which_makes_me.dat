I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E

[...] In this letter she wrote, [...] "My life is not accepted, neither availeth me, in comparison with the lives and liberty of the Truth and Servants of the living God for which in the Bowels of Love and Meekness I sought you; yet nevertheless with wicked Hands have you put two of them to Death, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> to feel that the Mercies of the Wicked is cruelty; I rather chuse to Dye than to live, as from you, as Guilty of their Innocent Blood." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E

500|$|Critics commended the {{development}} of the relationship between Maggie Green and Glenn. Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun stated that the storyline epitomized a [...] "steamy romance", while The Wall Street Journal Aaron Rutkoff called it [...] "the funniest moment of the series." [...] Goldman opined that their sexual encounter felt genuine; [...] "He's a nice guy, she seems like a cool gal, and it felt genuine when she noted she felt plenty lonely too and ready for some companionship." [...] Nick Venable of Cinema Blend asserted that the interactions between Maggie and Glenn was the highlight of the episode. [...] "I'm glad the writers are introducing this comic book plot point, as this show seriously needs a couple without closets full of skeletons. When Glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for Maggie to see, I chuckled heartily. The ensuing conversation also made me smile, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> wonder why humor is paid the least amount of attention on the show." [...] Jackson was surprised with the scene, and called it [...] "unexpected". Jen Chenay of The Washington Post compared Glenn to Little Mikey from the Life advertisements, and summated: [...] "He has assumed this role without much choice in the matter, but he has done so with a certain quiet, occasionally petrified, baseball-cap-wearing dignity that makes him admirable." ...|$|E
500|$|The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's two {{surviving}} victims, {{was originally}} offered to Christopher Reeve {{based on his}} work as a wheelchair-bound police officer in Above Suspicion (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist. The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a [...] "funny situation" [...] with Oldman wanting a prominent [...] "credit". She said: [...] "Now how can you have a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out (at first)." [...] Oldman was apparently [...] "out" [...] of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go [...] "unbilled". Oldman would become transformed and [...] "unrecognizable as himself" [...] to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist Greg Cannom said: [...] "It's really disgusting... I've been showing people pictures , and they all just say 'Oh my God,' and walk away, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> very happy." [...] Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to [...] "do it anonymously" [...] under the heavy make-up. In home-release versions of the film, Oldman's name is included in the closing credits.|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Van Gogh, {{known for}} his landscapes, seemed to find {{painting}} portraits his greatest ambition.

2500|$|Vincent van Gogh enjoyed making Paintings of Children. [...] He {{once said}} that it's {{the only thing that}} [...] "excites me to the depths of my soul, and <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel the {{infinite}} more than anything else." [...] Painting children, in particular represented rebirth and the infinite. [...] Over his career Van Gogh did not make many paintings of children, but those he completed were special to him. [...] During the ten years of Van Gogh's career as a painter, from 1881 to 1890, his work changed and grew richer, particularly in how he used color and techniques symbolically or evocatively.|$|E

Of course, Miss Rowley, you know what I mean. As I said before, you have all those things <b>which</b> not only <b>make</b> <b>me</b> love you, but <b>which</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> like you also.

2500|$|... “In the Stenhouse {{works in}} Barrhead, {{the workers were}} solid {{supporters}} of Chartism, the big movement founded [...] to get votes for working people. Here they were all solid Chartists, solid radicals, so radical even the tulips are radical, because the works manager, his pride and joy were his tulips. They were all beautiful, they all had names, all had pedigrees and his best, his beautiful, tallest, most symmetrical tulips were all named after his favourite radical politicians. So if you're having a works manager who's a convinced radical, maybe the Stenhouses who own the place are a bit radical. <b>Which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> wonder if Helen drank in her radical politics from her mother's milk.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Rachels {{writes that}} Darwin noted the moral {{implications}} of the cognitive similarities, arguing that [...] "humanity to the lower animals" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "noblest virtues with which man is endowed." [...] He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals, including setting traps. He wrote in a letter that he supported vivisection for [...] "real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> sick with horror..." [...] In 1875, he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection, lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection, and the study of physiology. Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day, such as Frances Power Cobbe, did not see Darwin as an ally.|$|E
2500|$|In 1693, Every is {{identified}} {{in a journal}} prepared by {{an agent of the}} Royal African Company, Captain Thomas Phillips of the Hannibal, then on a slaving mission on the Guinea coast, who writes: [...] "I have no where upon the coast met the negroes so shy as here, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> fancy they have had tricks play'd them by such blades as Long Ben, alias Avery, who have seiz'd them and carry'd them away." [...] (Every was known to lure potential slave traders onto his ship by flying friendly English colors, then seize the slave traders themselves and chain them in his ship's hold alongside their former captives.) Captain Phillips, who according to his own writings had come across Every on more than one occasion—and may have even known him personally—also alluded to Every as slave trading under a commission from Issac Richier, the unpopular Bermudian governor who was later removed from his post for his carousing behavior. However, Every's slave trading employment is relatively undocumented.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Off Beats tone {{is derived}} from its {{relation}} to urban culture. The fictional version of New York City that Quick has constructed is incredibly rich in detail, with attention to minuscule factors such as street addresses and subway/bus commute schedules. Often, the establishing shots of a scene will concentrate on landscape to capture in essence how a given area affects or portrays characters within that scene. Examples include shots of busy traffic and corner stores, Tory's messy room, and a dilapidated park. References are made to such problems as gang warfare, counterfeiting, illegal immigration, arms dealing, and terrorism {{in the form of}} bomb threats. Conspiracy theory and hacker subculture are also subjects that are explored. Editor Lillian Diaz-Przybyl has commented:"It features a spot-on, great depiction of New York. Everything Fake does wrong with setting, this does right. The location sets a brilliant backdrop for a really great story with a smart Walter Mitty twist, and cute guys to boot! It's truly manga with an American sensibility. The character designs are unique and appealing, the romance is sweet and understated, and it actually looks like Queens, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> really happy." ...|$|E
