At that time, America needed a lot of scientists and wanted to keep international students. Many Chinese students {{were not allowed to}} go back home. Because of this situation, she decided to work in America for some time and learn more things and use them to develop her homeland in the future. By the recommendation of her professor in University of Pennsylvania, she decided to work as a senior engineer at the Sylvania Company which mainly worked for semiconductors. At that time, the company had failed many times in making mono-crystalline silicon. Lanying found out the problems and helped the company successfully making the silicon.|$|E

500|$|The creators started {{brainstorming}} {{possibilities for}} the short film in June 2014. After early discussions about Olaf, head story artist Marc Smith [...] pitched the idea of {{what might happen if}} Elsa had a cold, which became the basis for the short's plot. The directors began working on the short in June and by August were back in the recording studio with the cast to lay down vocal tracks. The production of Frozen Fever took six months. All of the animators from Frozen <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to animate at least one shot on Frozen Fever, resulting in a large number of animator credits for a short film. They struggled to squeeze the animation phase of the short's production into a tight time slot in fall 2014 after animation wrapped on Big Hero 6 and before the studio's animators had to start working on subsequent features.|$|E

[...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
500|$|The third series {{includes}} nine main cast members. Matthew Macfadyen {{returns as}} Tom Quinn {{in the first}} two episodes. Macfadyen intended to leave the series as he felt [...] "your senses get dull doing a long-running TV show." [...] As the producers were storylining the third series, they were [...] "99 per cent sure" [...] Macfadyen would not return until they heard he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for two episodes because {{he did not want to}} leave the series so soon. Keeley Hawes also returns in the series as Zoe Reynolds. Hawes wanted to leave the series also after the first six episodes. David Oyelowo makes a return as Danny Hunter. After Tom's exit, it allowed Danny's character to develop further. Oyelowo also announced his intention to leave the series, after the finale episode. Peter Firth returns as superior Harry Pearce. After two seasons, Firth attempted to lighten Harry up [...] "a little bit" [...] after his mother suggested the character [...] "smile more," [...] despite the fact that Harry is a serious man. Nicola Walker returns as Ruth Evershed. First appearing in the second series, Walker felt more like the [...] "new girl," [...] but felt more experienced upon her return to the third. Shauna Macdonald also returns as Sam Buxton. The five-month filming gap between series two and three left Macdonald [...] "a bit de-Spookified" [...] as she was more focused on her film career. Hugh Simon and Rory MacGregor return as Malcolm Wynn-Jones and Colin Wells, respectively.|$|E

500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the team. He said [...] "When {{he picked up the phone}} again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

[...] Chibnall initially expressed his opinion that Tennant would be unable to return, due to both Tennant's heavy work schedule as well as character Alec Hardy's health problems. Attitude magazine {{went so far as to}} call Tennant's return [...] "unlikely". Nevertheless, Colman and Tennant's participation was first reported by the Daily Mirror in late October 2013. Colman confirmed her participation on 5 November 2013. Tennant denied being cast on the show in February 2014, saying [...] "I'm still waiting" [...] to hear if his character would be in the second series, but his participation was attested to in March 2014 by co-star Jodie Whittaker.

2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August.

60|$|Germans in Italy at the {{outbreak}} of the war were interned in Sardinia, and as far as one hears, they were left very free and happy, and treated very well, the Sardinians having been generous as all proud people are. But now our bright-eyed fool made a great titter through the bus: quite unaware that we understood. He said nothing offensive: but that sort of tittering exultation of common people who think they have you at a disadvantage annoyed me. However, I kept still to hear what they would say. But it was only trivialities about the Germans having nearly all gone now, their being free to travel, their coming back to Sardinia because they liked it better than Germany. Oh yes--they all <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back.</b> They all <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Sardinia. Oh yes, they knew where they were well off.
