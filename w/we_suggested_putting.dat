30|$|The {{present study}} {{has a number}} of {{limitations}} that point to future research: First, we only investigated the relations between CSE and TEDDICS. Future research may study these constructs as part of a bigger framework such as the technology acceptance model (Ong and Lai 2006), in which further measures related to ICT attitudes, use, and beliefs are included (e.g., perceived usefulness of ICT; Scherer et al. 2015). Second, we restricted our analyses to the Norwegian context, in which ICT {{plays an important role in}} school curricula (Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training 2012). It would therefore be interesting to examine the generalizability of our findings across further countries and educational contexts. In fact, taking an international perspective on the measures of and relations between CSE and TEDDICS may provide information on their differences and similarities. Finally, only a limited number of items were assigned to the three facets of TEDDICS; this design issue may have caused the considerable high correlations among the TEDDICS factors. <b>We</b> therefore <b>suggest</b> <b>putting</b> further effort into the development of items and in investigating the extent to which a broader TEDDICS assessment is able to differentiate between the three hypothesized factors.

The consultation took place simultaneously in 11 EU member states on October 25 th 2014 and involved 1035 European citizens.

40|$|Abstract Uncertainty {{is often}} present in {{environmental}} and energy economics. Tra-ditional approaches to optimization under uncertainty, e. g., stochastic programming, chance-constrained programming or stochastic dynamic programming, encounter {{the most severe}} numerical difficulties because models {{in this area are}} large and complex, already in their deterministic formulation. The goal of the present chapter is to introduce a relatively new field, known as robust optimization, as an alterna-tive to traditional methods and formulations. Through an illustrative example, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> ways of <b>putting</b> robust optimization at work in environmental and energy optimization models. 1 Robust Optimization in short Uncertainty is often present in environmental and energy economics. As models in this area are often large and complex, introducing uncertainty with traditional approaches, e. g., stochastic programming [26, 25, 18, 33], chance-constrained pro-gramming [23, 22, 34, 36] or stochastic dynamic programming [13], generally leads to numerical intractable model as soon as a relevant representation of uncertainty is sought...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{explore how}} preceptor support can assist newly {{qualified}} nurses (NQNs) to put knowledge to work across interconnected forms of knowledge when delegating {{to health care}} assistants (HCAs). BACKGROUND: Current literature on preceptorship in nursing has failed to explore how competence is underpinned by knowledge frameworks in clinical practice. DESIGN: An ethnographic case study in three hospital sites in England (2011 - 2014). METHODS: Data collection included participant observation, interviews with 33 newly qualified nurses, 10 HCAs and 12 ward managers. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. A tool to assist NQNs to delegate and supervise NQNs during the preceptorship period was developed and piloted with thirteen NQNs in the same sites. A process evaluation was undertaken. FINDINGS: Focusing on a key task for NQNS, delegation to HCAs, we argue that preceptorship can support NQNs as they put knowledge {{to work in the}} transition from qualifying student to NQN. In supportive ward cultures, limited access to formal preceptorship can be bolstered by team support. NQNs in less supportive ward cultures may have both a greater need for preceptorship and have fewer compensatory mechanisms available to them when formal preceptorship is not available. We argue that organisational learning contexts and individual learning styles (interconnected domains of learning) are key to understanding effective preceptorship. CONCLUSIONS: <b>We</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>putting</b> knowledge to work early in their careers with preceptorship support may assist NQNs to develop confidence and competence in delegation and supervision of health care assistants.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} inflation {{in the context of}} Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Cosmology. We show how, after a simple change of variables, one can quantize the problem in a way which parallels the classical discussion. The result is that two of the Einstein equations arise as exact equations of motion and one of the usual Einstein equations (suitably quantized) survives as a constraint equation to be imposed on the space of physical states. However, the Friedmann equation, which is also a constraint equation and which is the basis of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, acquires a welcome quantum correction that becomes significant for small scale factors. We discuss the extension of this result to a full quantum mechanical derivation of the anisotropy (δρ /ρ) in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the possibility that the extra term in the Friedmann equation could have observable consequences. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> interesting ways in which these techniques can be generalized to cast light on the question of chaotic or eternal inflation.

40|$|Dopamine neurons of the {{substantia nigra}} pars compacta (SNc) are uniquely {{sensitive}} to degeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and its models. Although {{a variety of}} molecular characteristics have been proposed to underlie this sensitivity, one possible contributory factor is their massive, unmyelinated, axonal arbor that is orders of magnitude larger than other neuronal types. <b>We</b> <b>suggest</b> that this <b>puts</b> them under such a high energy demand that any stressor that perturbs energy production leads to energy demand exceeding supply and subsequent cell death. One prediction of this hypothesis is that those dopamine neurons that are selectively vulnerable in PD will have a higher energy cost than those that are less vulnerable. We show here, {{through the use of}} a biology-based computational model of the axons of individual dopamine neurons, that the energy cost of axon potential propagation and recovery of the membrane potential increases with the size and complexity of the axonal arbor according to a power law. Thus SNc dopamine neurons, particularly in humans, whose axons we estimate to give rise to more than 1 million synapses and have a total length exceeding 4 metres, are at a distinct disadvantage with respect to energy balance which may be a factor in their selective vulnerability in P...|$|R

However, the Friedmann equation, which is also a constraint equation and which is the basis of the Wheeler-deWitt equation, acquires a welcome quantum correction that becomes significant for small scale factors. To clarify the general formalism and explicitly show why we choose to weaken the statement of the Wheeler-deWitt equation, we apply the general formalism to de Sitter space. After exactly solving the relevant Heisenberg equations of motion we give a detailed discussion of the subtleties associated with defining physical states and the emergence of the classical theory. This computation provides the striking result that quantum corrections to this long wavelength limit of gravity eliminate the problem of the big crunch. We also show that the same corrections lead to possibly measurable effects on the CMB radiation. For the sake of completeness, we discuss the special case, Λ= 0, and its relation to Minkowski space.
