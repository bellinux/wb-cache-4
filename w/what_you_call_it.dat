60|$|Florentia. I'm {{not at all}} {{particular}} as to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Call it {{an escape}} from the common, the prosaic, the immediate.|$|E
6000|$|Wood smiled cynically. [...] "My sister won't mind <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> {{so long as}} {{it enables}} your mother to {{designate}} the winning stocks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Assingham, more brightly again, bridled. [...] "Is that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> {{when you}} make them, for terror as you say, do as you like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well--no matter. I don't care {{a button}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it,</b> {{so long as}} Jim plays it. Why, he'd make his fortin' if he was to play that thing about the streets o' Lun'on. Listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> altogether. <b>It</b> does {{belong to}} them, and there's {{an end of}} it. What's the good of talking about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go away?" [...] echoed Mrs Butts; [...] "you {{must not}} talk of going away till you've had {{a bite of}} lunch with us. It's our dinner, you know, but lawks! what do <b>it</b> matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>calls</b> <b>it</b> so long as you've got it to eat? An' there's such a splendid apple dumplin' in the pot, miss; you see, it's Tommy's birthday, for he was born on a Christmas Day, an' he's very fond of apple dumplin', is Tommy." ...|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. No: thats <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Come, my lad! Whats {{the matter}} with you? You dont look starved; and youve a decent suit of clothes.|$|E
6000|$|The Baron, {{in a great}} {{contention}} of mind, stood irresolute, weighing the two dangers. Once his hand advanced, then dropped. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘since trust is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] .’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{have you}} been, {{and what have}} you been doing all this time?" [...] said Jane, as Trefusis came up, hurrying after Agatha. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> but I call it {{perfectly}} disgraceful!" ...|$|E
60|$|ST. HERBERT <b>It</b> {{depends upon}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> everything. <b>It</b> gives a woman {{the right to}} go to the poll--a right which, as a matter of fact, she has always possessed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Louis, {{it is not}} a {{question}} of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> steadiness. <b>It</b> is the old story of last summer, when you thought us old ones so much more romantic than yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think <b>it</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will, <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will, Cecilia Howard, I will pledge my life, that Richard Barnstable has {{to answer}} for the blood of none but the open enemies of his country." ...|$|R
60|$|Limb. This lingua, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> is {{the most}} rarest language! I {{understand}} {{it as well as}} if it were English; you shall see me answer him: Seignioro, stay a littlo, and consider wello, ten guinnio is monyo, a very considerablo summo.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the laugh}} was over, and the sparks of the cigarette, cleverly whipped {{out of the}} speaker's lips by Faquita's fan, had {{disappeared}} in the darkness, she resumed, pettishly, [...] "I know not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> when he kissed her hand and held it to his heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{come right}} somehow, my father," [...] he said airily. [...] "Who can know what happen? Perhaps Child of King drag {{us out of}} mud-hole, for after all she was very strong cow, or <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> heifer, and I think toss Joshua if he drive her into corner. Or perhaps other thing occur." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot {{evade the}} point," [...] she said. [...] "If <b>you</b> are the, <b>what</b> do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> the {{mouthpiece}} of the people, I {{do not see}} how you can be anything else than the enemy of the aristocracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It depends <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> good. <b>It's</b> half-size, and there's a seven-inch cut {{just out}} of baulk where Clarence's cue slipped. Elizabeth has mended it with pink silk. Very smart and dressy it looks, but it doesn't improve the thing as a billiard-table." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the attack}} {{as it should}} have been delivered. <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> when two people of {{opposite}} sexes are bunged together in close association in a secluded spot, meeting each other every day and seeing a lot of each other?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Damn him, look here!” says Castlewood, {{holding out}} a paper. “I {{found it in the}} book—the <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> Eikum Basilikum,—that villain Martin put it there—he said his young {{mistress}} bade him. It was directed to me, but it was meant for him I know, and I broke the seal and read it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Her strong {{impulse was}} to refuse. While she wore this ring the thought of that hateful scene and still more hateful mockery of {{marriage}} would be always with her. And yet, as the words of prompt refusal were on her lips, a feeling, an instinct, almost a superstition caused them to remain unspoken. [...] "You are very kind," [...] she said, [...] "but this is your signet-ring--is not that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it?</b> You cannot wish {{to give it to}} a chance acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> You're {{round with}} him in the gondoler, night and day, and when he's he'e, you'a settin' with him half the time on the balcony, and it's talk, talk, the whole while." [...] Clementina took in the fact with silent recognition, and Mrs. Lander went on. [...] "I ain't sayin' {{anything}} against it. He's the only one I don't believe is afta the money he thinks you'a goin' to have; but if you don't want him, you want to look what you're about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall see}} about that," [...] she muttered. [...] "There is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> circumstantial evidence. <b>It</b> has hanged people before now." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ORACLE. <b>What</b> else do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> pray? Our {{physicists}} {{deal with}} it. Our mathematicians express its measurements in algebraic equations.|$|R
60|$|THE BYSTANDER [inept at definition] It's a--well, it's a copper's nark, as <b>you</b> might say. <b>What</b> {{else would}} <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it?</b> A sort of informer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ob, rubbish! Where's {{your theory}} of a picture, then? I don't care <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> My only anxiety, {{when you got}} a plain, simple, every-day {{conundrum}} like Miss Maybough to paint, was that you would try to paint the answer instead of the conundrum, and I dare say that's the trouble. You've been trying to give something more of her character than you found in her face; is that it? Well, you deserved to fail, then. You've been trying to interpret her; to come the prophet! I don't condemn the poetry in your nature, Ludlow," [...] Wetmore went on, [...] "and if I could manage it for you, I think I could keep it from doing mischief. That is why I am so plain-spoken with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--no--go away," [...] he implored wildly. [...] "Oh, sir--oh, Mr. Marshall, {{please go}} away. I'll do {{anything}} for you if you will. I love Kilmeny. I've loved her all my life. I'd give my life for her. I can't have you coming here to steal her from me. If you do--I'll kill you! I wanted to kill you last night when I saw you kiss her. Oh, yes, I saw you. I was watching--spying, if you like. I don't care <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> I had followed her--I suspected something. She was so different--so changed. She never would wear the flowers I picked for her any more. She seemed to forget I was there. I knew something had come between us. And it was you, curse you! Oh, I'll make you sorry for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Two Américaines—a {{mother and}} a daughter. There are Americans and Americans: when you’re difficiles you’re more so than any one, and when you’ve pretensions—ah, par exemple, it’s serious. I foresee that with this little lady {{everything}} will be serious, beginning with her café au lait. She has been staying at the Pension Chamousset—my concurrente, you know, further up the street; but she’s coming away because the coffee’s bad. She holds to her coffee, it appears. I don’t know what liquid Madame Chamousset may dispense under that name, but we’ll {{do the best we}} can for her. Only I know she’ll make me des histoires about something else. She’ll demand a new lamp for the salon; vous allez voir cela. She wishes to pay but eleven francs a day for herself and her daughter, tout compris; and for their eleven francs they expect to be lodged like princesses. But she’s very ‘ladylike’—isn’t that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> in English? Oh, pour cela, she’s ladylike!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Mike, who {{was walking}} a little stiffly. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> getting off. <b>It</b> {{seems to me}} you're the chaps who got off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] cried Hadden. [...] "Well, I {{must say}} I admire you. You're a regular sage. <b>It's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> Pythagoreanism, isn't <b>it?</b> if I haven't {{forgotten}} my philosophy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Vanderbank, [...] "even {{if he is}} he won't be the man to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> might <b>call</b> 'vent' <b>it</b> on her. He'll seek compensations {{elsewhere}} and won't mind any ridicule--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{nobody to}} tell me;--I know," [...] {{continued}} Neefit. [...] "Now {{if you make}} up to her, there she is,--with twenty thousand pounds down. You are a gentleman, and I want that girl to be a lady. You can make her a lady. You can't make her no better than she is. The best man in England can't do that. But you can make her a lady. I don't know what she'll say, mind; but you can ask her,--if you please. I like you, and you can ask her,--if you please. What answer she'll make, that's her look out. But you can ask her,--if you please. Perhaps I'm a little too forrard; but I call that honest. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> But this I do know;--there ain't so sweet a girl as that within twenty miles round London." [...] Then Mr. Neefit, in his energy, dashed his hand down among the glasses on the little rustic table in the arbour.|$|E

6000|$|... . My dear child, the bromide {{of sodium}} (if that’s <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> proved {{perfectly}} useless. I don’t {{mean that it}} did me no good, but that I never had occasion to take the bottle out of my bag. It might have done wonders for me if I had needed it; but I didn’t, simply because I’ve been a wonder myself. Will you believe that I’ve spent the whole voyage on deck, in the most animated conversation and exercise? Twelve times round the deck make a mile, I believe; and by this measurement I’ve been walking twenty miles a day. And down to every meal, if you please, where I’ve displayed the appetite of a fishwife. Of course the weather has been lovely; so there’s no great merit. The wicked old Atlantic has been as blue as the sapphire in my only ring—rather a good one—and as smooth as the slippery floor of Madame Galopin’s dining-room. We’ve {{been for the last}} three hours in sight of land, and are soon to enter the Bay of New York which is said to be exquisitely beautiful. But of course you recall it, though they say everything changes so fast over here. I find I don’t remember anything, for my recollections of our voyage to Europe so many years ago are exceedingly dim; I’ve only a painful impression that mamma shut me up for an hour every day in the stateroom and made me learn by heart some religious poem. I was only five years old and I believe that as a child I was extremely timid; on the other hand mamma, as you know, had what she called a method with me. She has it to this day; only I’ve become indifferent; I’ve been so pinched and pushed—morally speaking, bien entendu. It’s true, however, that there are children of five on the vessel to-day who have been extremely conspicuous—ranging all over the ship and always under one’s feet. Of course they’re little compatriots, which means that they’re little barbarians. I don’t mean to pronounce all our compatriots barbarous; they seem to improve somehow after their first communion. I don’t know whether it’s that ceremony that improves them, especially as so few of them go in for it; but the women are certainly nicer than the little girls; I mean of course in proportion, you know. You warned me not to generalise, and you see I’ve already begun, before we’ve arrived. But I suppose there’s no harm in it so long as it’s favourable.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Covetous professor, thou that makest {{a gain of}} religion, that usest thy {{profession}} to bring grist to thy mill, look to it also. Gain is not godliness. Judas' religion lay much in the bag, but his soul is now burning in hell. All covetousness is idolatry; but what is that, or <b>what</b> will <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> when men are religious for filthy lucre's sake? (Eze 33:31) ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, producer Dave Grohl stated, [...] "They're unbelievable, the band is so good they can be tracked live; we didn't fuck with computers, we tracked live, four-part harmonies around one microphone. It's rocking. People are like, 'Oh, it's country.' 'No, it's not, it's like the Allman Brothers.' 'No, it's not, it's jam band.' I don't even know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> it's fucking great." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lo-look here, sir. Do--do {{you shoot}} foxes? Because, if you don't, your keeper does. We've seen him! I do-don't care <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> us--but <b>it's</b> an awful thing. It's {{the ruin of}} good feelin' among neighbors. A ma-man ought to say {{once and for all}} how he stands about preservin'. It's worse than murder, because there's no legal remedy." [...] McTurk was quoting confusedly from his father, while the old gentleman made noises in his throat.|$|R
