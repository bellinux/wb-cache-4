The conductivity of the CNT yarn was about 200 times lower than copper's, however, the yarn's conductivity dropped less with increasing temperature compared to Cu.

50|$|When a {{magnetic}} field higher than the ferromagnetic limit of 1.6 T is needed, superconducting electromagnets can be used. Instead of using ferromagnetic materials, these use superconducting windings cooled with liquid helium, which conduct current without electrical resistance.

Superconducting magnets are limited by the field strength at which the <b>winding</b> <b>material</b> ceases to be superconducting. Current designs are limited to 10-20 T, with the current (2009) record of 33.8 T. The necessary refrigeration equipment and cryostat make them much more expensive than ordinary electromagnets.

40|$|We develop {{equations}} {{and obtain}} {{solutions for the}} structure and evolution of a protodisc region that is initially formed with no radial motion and super-Keplerian rotation speed when <b>wind</b> <b>material</b> from a hot rotating star is channelled towards its equatorial plane by a dipole-type magnetic field. Its temperature is around $ 10 ^ 7 $K because of shock heating and the inflow of <b>wind</b> <b>material</b> causes its equatorial density to increase with time. The centrifugal force and thermal pressure increase relative to the magnetic force and material escapes at its outer edge. The protodisc region of a uniformly rotating star has almost uniform rotation and will shrink radially unless some instability intervenes. In a star with angular velocity increasing along its surface towards the equator, the angular velocity of the protodisc region decreases radially outwards and magnetorotational instability (MRI) can occur {{within a few hours}} or days. Viscosity resulting from MRI will readjust the angular velocity distribution of the protodisc material and may assist in the formation of a quasi-steady disc. Thus, the centrifugal breakout found in numerical simulations for uniformly rotating stars does not imply that quasi-steady discs with slow outflow cannot form around magnetic rotator stars with solar-type differential rotation.
