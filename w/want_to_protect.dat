25|$|In words, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> 1 {{units of}} {{inventory}} {{for the higher}} valued segment where 1 {{is equal to the}} inverse probability of demand of the revenue ratio of the lower valued segment to the higher valued segment. This equation defines the EMSRa algorithm which handles the two segment case. EMSRb is smarter and handles multiple segments by comparing the revenue of the lower segment to a demand weighted average of the revenues of the higher segments. Neither of these heuristics produces the exact right answer and increasingly implementations make use of Monte Carlo simulation to find optimal protection levels.|$|E
25|$|Cantonese {{people also}} {{have their own}} schools of kung fu. Originally disorganized, the {{fighting}} techniques of Cantonese people were grouped into different schools between 18th to 19th century. At that time, due to ineptitude of the Qing Empire's government, pirates and bandits were rampant in the empire's fringe regions such as Lingnan. This resulted in Cantonese starting to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> themselves, and thus the proliferation of martial arts learning. It was when the Cantonese people organized their fighting techniques into schools, forming the martial arts schools seen among Cantonese today. Martial arts folk heroes from that period, such as Wong Fei-hung, are now popular topics of Cantonese films.|$|E

An {{example of this}} was in January 1997, when Bakas were forced from their homes near Mambele. These actions turned the Bakas against the WWF, which they considered [...] "an organization of whites who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> animals". Every year, poachers travel up the Dja for central Nki, where elephant ivory is abundant. Strong currents on the river are a deterrent for half the year, but after that, according to freelance journalist Jemini Pandya, the fauna is easy to prey upon.|$|E

500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{was created}} by indie {{developer}} Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. [...] The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an [...] "artistic statement" [...] on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as creating something [...] "that makes you feel violated and makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> stuff that’s yours, and puts you {{in the process of}} securing what’s yours."

500|$|Having left Cold Feet, Ripley {{began to}} take on more leading roles; her first role was as {{housewife}} Deanna in the BBC thriller Green-Eyed Monster, which was broadcast in September 2001. She researched her character, a murderer, by visiting a coroner. Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote of her performance, [...] "Ripley {{did a good job}} of exorcising the ghost of Jenny Gifford [...] by coolly cranking up the insane desperation and needy malevolence to an impressive degree." [...] In 2002, she played domestic abuse victim Donna Massey in Danny Brocklehurst's The Stretford Wives. Ripley was initially not eager to play another character from around Manchester so soon after leaving Cold Feet, but she changed her mind after reading the script. She did not research spousal abuse to play her character, a woman struggling to bring up her two children in a run-down house while her husband is imprisoned, because she did not find it difficult to [...] "work out what it's like to be scared and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> your kids". Also in 2002, Ripley played Rose Bell in the ITV post-war period drama Dead Gorgeous, alongside Helen McCrory. The following year, she provided the voice of Meg in the ITV adaptation of the Meg and Mog children's books, before playing Jill in the third series of the BBC One sitcom Bedtime at the end of 2003.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "big" [...] musical number, [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] begins {{within the}} first fifteen minutes of Tangled during the film's first act when, {{on the eve of}} her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel finally summons enough courage to ask Gothel for {{permission}} to travel and see the floating lanterns in person. Gothel, whose eternal youth and beauty solely relies on the safety and protection of Rapunzel's magical hair, denies this request by sarcastically reminding her that [...] "mother knows best," [...] warning her ward that [...] "the world is full of wicked people who want to steal her hair's magic," [...] while explaining to her that it's [...] "for her own good," [...] claiming to only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> her. At one point during the scene, Gothel actually contradicts herself; Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow observed, [...] "Gothel has no intentions of letting her go. Though Mother Gothel sings, 'soon, but not yet,' but ironically later says, 'Rapunzel, don't ever ask to leave this tower...again.'" [...] Writing for the Tulsa World, Michael Smith observed that Gothel uses the song [...] "as her lie/rationale for keeping the girl safe (holding her hostage) from those who might steal her for their own hair-inspired profit schemes." [...] Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew felt that the scene is both funny and scary, citing Gothel's [...] "theatrical gestures" [...] and [...] "claustrophobia-inducing stark black backgrounds" [...] as examples of both. [...] "cementing [...] character's ruthlessness," [...] Gothel ultimately orders Rapunzel to promise never to ask permission to leave the tower again. Moviefone's William Goss cited the musical number as an example of [...] "fear-mongering," [...] which has been defined by Dictionary.com as [...] "a person who creates or spreads alarming news." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail penned, [...] "Mother Knows Best hilariously convey the fear and guilt that have kept Rapunzel in the tower of her own free will." [...] In her book Marvels & Tales, author Kendra Magnusson observed that, during the [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] musical sequence, [...] "the manipulation of Rapunzel's hair leaves the heroine's body wrenched in one moment and bound up in it the next", depicting that, while Rapunzel's hair can be used to defend herself, [...] "it is simultaneously a liability" [...] and can just as well be used to harm her.|$|E

That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town.

2500|$|Count 1 of {{the charges}} was {{conspiracy}} to commit child abduction, false imprisonment, and extortion. Janet Arvizo claimed {{she and her family}} had been held captive at Neverland as well as at a couple of hotels when traveling with Jackson. She expressed her mistrust of [...] "the Germans," [...] Dieter Weisner and Ron Konitzer. She testified that they pretended to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> her, telling her the rebuttal video [...] "would appease the killers," [...] but that [...] "Michael, Ronald, Dieter, Frank, and Vinnie...ended up being the killers." [...] At one point, Janet testified that she'd known what questions she'd be asked in the rebuttal video, that Frank [...] "went over" [...] them with her on the phone beforehand and told her to praise Michael. [...] On another day of her testimony, she claimed [...] "the Germans" [...] had scripted every word of the video, even the hand-holding, laughing, and the outtakes when they appear to think the camera isn't on, and the Germans had [...] "worked with [...] daily, numerous times" [...] to learn it all. House manager Jesus Salas testified that the accuser's mother was at no time held at Neverland against her will and that she had never complained of her children being taken advantage of at Neverland. Other staff testified that the idea that the family were prisoners of Neverland was ludicrous, that there was no fence surrounding the property and that the guards did not carry weapons. [...] During their alleged captivity, the Arvizos took shopping trips into town, billing $3,312.05 worth of purchases to Michael Jackson. They also met with their lawyer and visited a Federal building during this time, making phone calls to various people, though never the police. [...] Janet testified that she was dropping hints [...] "in code" [...] about her kidnapping during the calls, and explained that she never openly asked anyone for help because of the death threats Jackson's co-conspirators allegedly made toward her parents. Janet and Star claimed that Jackson was preventing them from knowing times or dates. When Mesereau pointed out that there were clocks visible [...] "almost everywhere" [...] in Neverland, including a giant [...] "flower clock" [...] on a prominent hill, Star admitted that he was surrounded by clocks but claimed that they had the wrong times. Janet's claims included that she was restricted to [...] "one meal per day," [...] and that Jackson's associates had threatened to make her children [...] "disappear" [...] via hot-air balloon. The Arvizos [...] "escaped" [...] Neverland three times (in Rolls-Royces and limos) but were [...] "convinced" [...] to return each time. When the prosecution presented a complicated chart of phone calls between Jackson's [...] "unindicted co-conspirators" [...] trying to show that they were scheming about the Arvizos' captivity, they accidentally proved that Jackson was not even at Neverland for several of the days during the 2 1/2-week time frame given for the alleged molestation and may have been in Miami the day the molestation and conspiracy were alleged to have started.|$|E
