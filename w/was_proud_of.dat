Six years later, Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local magistrate, Walter Buckley Jones, and moved to Jones's estate, Cefn Bryntalch, Llandyssil, near Montgomery, although the London house was retained. The youthful Philip <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his Welsh heritage and retained a lifelong interest in Celtic culture; later he would live in Wales during one of his most productive and creative phases.|$|E
5|$|A police {{investigation}} {{did not find}} a motive behind the shooting, although Gale's mother said that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that he believed the brothers had stolen his lyrics while trying to steal his identity. She {{did not know if}} her son took the medication he was given for his condition, but <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his military service following his discharge, and had given him the Beretta 92F that was used in the shooting. Major Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps spokesman at The Pentagon, was unable to comment on Gale's discharge.|$|E

5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, non-viable states, {{they were also}} applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, {{were also asked to}} sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E
5|$|George Mason {{began to}} build his home, Gunston Hall, likely {{beginning}} in 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings of that time, was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America {{for the use of}} local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the gardens which still surround the house. There were outbuildings, including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them four large plantations, forests, and the shops and other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, Chotiner {{resigned}} from his White House job {{and returned to}} the private practice of law. He represented former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who had been informally promised early parole from his jury tampering sentence. Chotiner wrote to Haldeman in November 1971, noting that no action on Hoffa's release seemed to be taking place, and President Nixon granted Hoffa clemency later that month. When Chotiner's role became public in 1973, he stated that he <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his actions on behalf of Hoffa. Chotiner also lobbied the White House on behalf of milk producers, who were seeking increased price supports and who were major contributors to the Republican Party.|$|E

Before meeting Harrison, Coulter was {{considered}} {{a role model for}} curvy girls and stated that she <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> being a size 14 woman. She has since lost over 30 kilograms, which has transformed her into a size 8. The couple announced their engagement in the 7 January 2013 issue of New Idea magazine.

Coulter appeared {{on the cover of the}} 17 August 2015 issue of New Idea in her wedding dress.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's manager Kenny Dalglish {{stated in}} the aftermath, that the victory would lead to more trophies. The club reached the 2012 FA Cup Final, but were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea. Their league form faltered after the victory and they {{finished}} the season in 8th place. Despite this, victory in the final ensured Liverpool had qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his team despite their defeat. They finished the season in 6th place in the 2011–12 Football League Championship, reaching the playoffs where they were beaten by West Ham United over two-legs.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Adams {{was born}} in Boston in the British colony of Massachusetts on September 16, 1722, an Old Style date that is {{sometimes}} converted to the New Style date of September 27. Adams was one of twelve children born to Samuel Adams, Sr., and Mary (Fifield) Adams {{in an age of}} high infant mortality; only three of these children lived past their third birthday. Adams's parents were devout Puritans and members of the Old South Congregational Church. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston. Adams <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially virtue.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, and carried the traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase. While the reverse side of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi's {{earliest}} {{education was}} of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher. Subsequently, moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years. Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents. At school, Gaddafi was bullied for being a Bedouin, but <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his identity and encouraged pride in other Bedouin children. From Sirte, {{he and his family}} moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done. Gaddafi was popular at this school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend Abdul Salam Jalloud.|$|E

5|$|Harry S. Truman became President of the United States on {{the death}} of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and won an {{unexpected}} victory in the 1948 presidential election. He was the only president who served after 1897 without a college degree. Although not highly educated, Truman was well read. When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901, he enrolled in a local business school, but only lasted a semester. He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School, but dropped out. Truman attempted to gain admission to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was rejected for his poor eyesight. He <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his military service in the artillery during World War I, and held a reserve commission as a colonel.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother died}} from {{diphtheria}} on December 7, 1892, and Elliott Jr. {{died of the}} same disease the following May. Her father, an alcoholic confined to a sanitarium, died on August 14, 1894 after jumping from a window during a fit of delirium tremens. He survived the fall but died from a seizure. Eleanor's childhood losses left her prone to depression throughout her life. Her brother Hall later suffered from alcoholism. Before her father died, he implored her {{to act as a}} mother towards Hall, and it was a request she made good upon for the rest of Hall's life. Eleanor doted on Hall, and when he enrolled at Groton School in 1907, she accompanied him as a chaperone. While he was attending Groton, she wrote him almost daily, but always felt a touch of guilt that Hall had not had a fuller childhood. She took pleasure in Hall's brilliant performance at school, and <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his many academic accomplishments, which included a master's degree in engineering from Harvard.|$|E
5|$|His {{international}} {{career was}} then put on hold, as all foreign tours were suspended during the Second World War. He {{continued to play}} first-class cricket in Australia, before enlisting in the Second Australian Imperial Force in May 1942. Barnes's time in the military was short. A man who <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his appearance, he had a uniform made to measure when the one issued did not fit. He met champion golfer Norman Von Nida early into his enlistment and the two {{were assigned to the}} 1st Armoured Division in Greta. A shortage of tanks and the military regimen led to boredom and Barnes used his hitherto ignored trade background to his advantage, seeking a release to join a tank-making company, which was granted. Von Nida and Barnes remained friends and business partners for many years afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{reached the}} Stalingrad Front in August 1942, {{soon after the}} start of the battle for the city. His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city's defense, {{mentions}} Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but {{to the end of his}} life, he <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his role. Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before Uranus was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} histories had {{on occasion}} been threatened with political interference, {{particularly with the}} change in government in 1949. Kippenberger, a person of high standing with both {{the government and the}} ordinary New Zealander, was a strong advocate for the project, and was able to convince the new government of the merits of the official histories. Kippenberger encouraged a positive atmosphere at the War History Branch, despite a tight budget and at times crowded work conditions. He <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> its rate of output, which exceeded the efforts of the better resourced official histories of Australia and Great Britain. By 1963, the War History Branch he had presided over for much of its life had produced nearly 50 major volumes.|$|E
