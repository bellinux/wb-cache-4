6000|$|Now, as in {{many other}} cases of noble history, {{apocryphal}} and other, I do not in the least care how far the literal facts are true. The conception of facts, and the idea of Jewish womanhood, are there, grand and real as a marble statue,--possession for all ages. And you will feel, after <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> this piece of history, or epic poetry, with honourable care, that there is somewhat more to be thought of and pictured in Judith, than painters have mostly found it in them to show you; that she is not merely the Jewish Delilah to the Assyrian Samson; but the mightiest, purest, brightest type of high passion in severe womanhood offered to our human memory. Sandro's picture is but slight; but it is true to her, and the only one I know that is; and after writing out these verses, you will see why he gives her that swift, peaceful motion, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> in her face, only sweet solemnity of dreaming thought. [...] "My people delivered, and by my hand; and God has been gracious to His handmaid!" [...] The triumph of Miriam over a fallen host, the fire of exulting mortal life in an immortal hour, the purity and severity of a guardian angel--all are here; and as her servant follows, carrying indeed the head, but invisible--(a mere thing to be carried--no more to be so much as thought of)--she looks only at her mistress, with intense, servile, watchful love. Faithful, not in these days of fear only, but hitherto in all her life, and afterwards forever.|$|R
40|$|What do you {{experience}} when <b>you</b> <b>read?</b> <b>You</b> are <b>reading</b> right now, so ask yourself, {{do you have}} an inner voice, visual imagery, or a perceptual experience of the words on the page. Perhaps, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> this abstract, <b>you</b> simply find your mind wandering. Philosophers and psychologist provide radically conflicting descriptions of the commonplace experience of reading, and my own introspection feels incomplete and unclear. I begin, in Chapter 1, by making the case for a healthy skepticism towards introspective reports, even those of experts describing their current experiences. In Chapter 2, I contrast the experience of reading with perceptual experiences and discuss the sources of introspective error: inference error, overgeneralization, and memory limitations. Due to these sources of error, we can not take introspective reports at face value, and I argue for the need to compare subjective and objective measures of experience using the Subjective and Objective Measures of Experience (SOME) method. Chapter 3 is an examination of the cognitive processes that underlie the act of reading, and I discuss the phonological loop, the visuospatial sketchpad, situational models of narrative comprehension, flow, and mind wandering. In Chapter 4, I describe a series of experiments on the phenomenology of reading that use SOME method. Chapter 5 is a general discussion of the results. These experiments suggest that there is extensive variability in the experience of reading. Experts have been blind to this variability because introspective error creates systematic biases in descriptions of experience. I argue that our confidence in introspective reports is always high, regardless of accuracy, so we must evaluate methods of measuring introspective reports, not the reports themselves. Further, these results suggest that coarse-grained aspects of experience, such as modal experiences while reading, are functionally isolated. They are what I call paraphenomena. When our experiences are not functionally isolated, the relationship between experience and behavior is often one of interference instead of facilitation. I finish by laying out the implications for the relationship between phenomenal and functional notions of consciousness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: I survey physics {{theories}} involving parallel universes, {{which form}} a natural four-level hierarchy of multiverses allowing progressively greater diversity. Level I: A generic prediction of inflation is an infinite ergodic universe, which contains Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions — including an identical copy of you about 10 1029 m away. Level II: In chaotic inflation, other thermalized regions {{may have different}} physical constants, dimensionality and particle content. Level III: In unitary quantum mechanics, other branches of the wavefunction add nothing qualitatively new, which is ironic given that this level has historically been the most controversial. Level IV: Other mathematical structures give different fundamental equations of physics. The key {{question is not whether}} parallel universes exist (Level I is the uncontroversial cosmological concordance model), but how many levels there are. I discuss how multiverse models can be falsified and argue that there is a severe “measure problem ” that must be solved to make testable predictions at levels II-IV.

40|$|This {{research}} study {{aimed to develop}} reading learning materials to facilitate 2 nd-semester students of International Relations Department in learning reading skills through Bahasa Inggris Hubungan Internasional II subject. This research was a research and development study. The development of the learning materials was carried out through several steps, namely needs analysis, syllabus design, product development, product validation, product revision, try-out, and final product development. The respondents were one content and instructional expert, one graphics expert, one lecturer, and 24 students of International Relations Department. The data were collected through classroom observation, survey, and interview. The instruments of data collection were expert validation sheets, questionnaires, and interview guide. The data were analyzed descriptively. This research developed four units of learning materials. In terms of target needs, the students {{expected to have a}} number of reading skills to get information from international relations-related texts. Regarding the learning needs, the students liked to learn from texts with pictures, graphs, and tables. The students also liked to have various activities, such as reading, predicting the content of the text, answering questions related to the text, discussing the information from the text, and translating the text into Indonesian. They also preferred to work in groups. The appropriate designed learning materials have the following characteristic; first, each unit has three sections, namely Before <b>You</b> <b>Read,</b> <b>While</b> <b>You</b> <b>Read,</b> and After <b>You</b> <b>Read.</b> Each section consists of two tasks. Second, authentic texts of different international relations-related topics are used. They are international law, foreign politics, international economy, and international security. Third, the length of the texts is about 250 - 500 words. Forth, the input texts are the ones that improve students’ vocabulary mastery. Some of the texts are also accompanied with pictures and diagrams. Fifth, the activities are varied to improve their reading skills and strategies, namely identifying the sequence of the events, skimming, scanning, identifying main idea, identifying topic, making conclusion from the picture, graph, or table, identifying reference words, and guessing unfamiliar words. The appropriateness of the learning materials is viewed from four aspects, namely content, activities, language, and graphic. The expert judgements and field-testing data indicate that the learning materials are appropriate as shown by the mean scores of the expert evaluation ranging from 3. 0 to 3. 72 and students’ agreement ranging from 3. 1 to 3. 7 on 4 to 1 Likert scale...|$|R

But they are crucial to plants, and help them conquer extreme environments such as acidic soil. We’re talking arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi who help plants improve their nutrient uptake. But how can these fungi themselves tolerate acidic soil? Are they "acidic soil specialists", who can thrive despite the acidity? We tested this hypothesis by collecting soil containing AM fungi along an acidity gradient in Japan. We also exposed fungi from two soils of different pH (acidic/ neutral) to changes in their soils' acidity levels in the lab, and observed their response. Surprisingly, we discovered that the fungi in the acidic soils also occurred in the less acidic and neutral soils, making them generalists! We believe that being generalists opens up many opportunities for AM fungi (and for their associated plants) to colonize new or quickly changing habitats...|$|R
