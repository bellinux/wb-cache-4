Najprej sem se moral seznaniti s celotnim postopkom čiščenja odpadnih vod v industriji in s kemijskimi procesi, ki so prisotni preden se na čistilni napravi nabere blato, ki ga je potrebno kasneje odstraniti. Ugotovil sem, da je za moj problem najbolj primerna elektronika s senzorjem, ki na podlagi sprejemnih in oddajnih diod meri debelino blata na vodi. Elektronika pa s prejetimi informacijami s senzorja prilagaja hitrost zajemanja preko frekvenčnika. Pri montaži predstavljenega kontrolerja količine blata je potrebno v začetku spremljati proces, da se nastavi optimalen odvzem blata iz vode saj gre lahko blato ostopoma proti dnu in se pomeša s čisto vodo v primeru, da je hitrost odvzema premajhna in obratno se odstrani preveč čiste vode, če je hitrost odvzema prehitra. Hitrost odvzema se pri mojem projektu regulira s pomočjo treh potenciometrov. Vsak služi nastavitvi hitrosti v odvisnosti od debeline blata. Prvi potenciometer služi za nastavitev hitrosti pri majhni količini blata, drugi potenciometer služi za nastavitev hitrosti pri večji količini blata in tretji potenciometer, ki služi za nastavitev hitrosti zajemalke pri maksimalni količini blata. In present thesis, {{the sludge}} blanket {{controller}} for clearing the <b>sludge</b> out <b>of</b> waste water is presented. My work started with gathering {{of information about}} industrial waste water treatment and with undrestanding the corresponding chemical processes that take place before the sludge is accumulated in the waste water cleaning device. For cleaning the accumulated sludge, the most appropriate electronics system {{turned out to be}} the electronics with a sensor that measures the sludge thickness on the water trough the receiving and transmission diodes. This system uses the information from the sensor to adjust the information capure spreed via the frequency converter. When installing the presented sludge blanket controller, first the process needs to be monitored to determine the optimal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sludge.</b> In the case where the sludge removal speed is too small, the sludge can gradually sink toward the bottom and is mixed with clean water, while in the case where the sludge removal speed is to fast, too much clean water is removed. In the presented electronics, the sludge removal speed is regulated with three potentiometers, each adjusted for its own sludge thickness. The first potentiometer is used to set the speed for a small amount <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> the second potentiometer is used to set the speed in larger quantities <b>of</b> <b>sludges</b> and the third potentiometer, serves to adjust the speed of the dipper in the maximum quantity <b>of</b> <b>sludge...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{versatility}} of {{batch test}} {{has been extended}} for the assessment <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> activity.

Determination of SMA is useful for estimation of initial organic loading rate during start-up period of a reactor. A regular determination of SMA in further phases provides information about development <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> A change in sludge activity determines an inhibition or accumulation of slowly degradable or even non-biodegradable organic substrate.

40|$|Predicting {{the flow}} behaviour, most notably, the {{apparent}} viscosity and yield stress <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> mixtures inside the anaerobic digester is essential {{because it helps}} optimize the mixing system in digesters. This paper investigates the rheology <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> mixtures as a function <b>of</b> digested <b>sludge</b> volume fraction. Sludge mixtures exhibited non-Newtonian, shear thinning, yield stress behaviour.

However, when a thickened primary - secondary sludge mixture was mixed with dilute digested sludge, the apparent viscosity and yield stress decreased with increasing the volume fraction <b>of</b> digested <b>sludge.</b> This was caused by the dilution effect leading to a reduction in the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic interactions when dilute digested sludge was added. Correlations were developed to predict the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the mixtures as a function <b>of</b> the digested <b>sludge</b> volume fraction and total solids concentration of the mixtures.

The aim of this work was to assess the importance of soil available P and sludge origin on the utilization <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> P by plants. First, the changes in soil P isotopically exchangeable within 1 min (E 1 min) were measured in incubated soil-sludge mixtures using two soils and four sludges. Then, the uptake <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> P by ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was measured on the same sludge-amended soils.

In both soils, the lowest utilization <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> P was observed for the two FeSO 4 flocculated and anaerobically digested sludges, while the primary sludge and the aerobically digested sludge released somewhat higher quantities of P to ryegrass. In the clayey soil, the amount <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> P taken up by the crop was significantly related both to the sludge and soil available P content, whereas no such relation was observed in the loamy soil because of its high available P content.

Moreover, the low sludge pH (2. 92) and the increasing distribution of Fe in the solid phase were another two factors responsible for the improvement <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> dewaterability during bioleaching.
