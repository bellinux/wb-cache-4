5|$|A {{surface is}} more <b>wettable</b> when γLV and θ is low. Zisman termed the {{intercept}} of these lines when cos θ = 1, as the critical surface tension (γc) of that surface. This critical surface tension {{is an important}} parameter {{because it is a}} characteristic of only the solid.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl {{naphthalene}} sulfonates (ANS) {{are used}} in many industrial applications as nondetergent wetting agents that effectively disperse colloidal systems in aqueous media. The major commercial applications are in the agricultural chemical industry, which uses ANS for <b>wettable</b> powder and <b>wettable</b> granular (dry-flowable) formulations, and the textile and fabric industry, which utilizes the wetting and defoaming properties of ANS for bleaching and dyeing operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{horizontal}} distribution of springtail species {{is affected by}} environmental factors which act at the landscape scale, such as soil acidity, moisture and light. Requirements for pH can be reconstructed experimentally. Altitudinal changes in species distribution can be at least partly explained by increased acidity at higher elevation. Moisture requirements, among other ecological and behavioural factors, explain why some species cannot live aboveground, or retreat in the soil during dry seasons, but also why some epigeal springtails are always found {{in the vicinity of}} ponds and lakes, such as the hygrophilous Isotomurus palustris. Adaptive features, such as the presence of a fan-like <b>wettable</b> mucro, allow some species to move at the surface of water (Sminthurides aquaticus, Sminthurides malmgreni). Podura aquatica, a unique representative of the family Poduridae (and one of the first springtails to have been described by Linnaeus), spends its entire life at the surface of water, its <b>wettable</b> eggs dropping in water until the non-wettable first instar hatches then surfaces.|$|E
500|$|For water, a <b>wettable</b> surface {{may also}} be termed {{hydrophilic}} and a nonwettable surface hydrophobic. Superhydrophobic surfaces have contact angles greater than 150°, showing almost no contact between the liquid drop and the surface. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Lotus effect". The table describes varying contact angles and their corresponding solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interactions. For nonwater liquids, the term lyophilic is used for low contact angle conditions and lyophobic is used when higher contact angles result. Similarly, the terms omniphobic and omniphilic apply to both polar and apolar liquids.|$|E
500|$|When {{an object}} {{is placed on}} a liquid, its weight [...] {{depresses}} the surface, and if surface tension and downward force becomes equal than [...] is balanced by the surface tension forces on either side , which are each parallel to the water's surface at the points where it contacts the object. Notice that small moment in the body may cause the object sink as the angle of contact decreases surface tension decreases the horizontal components of the two [...] arrows point in opposite directions, so they cancel each other, but the vertical components point {{in the same direction}} and therefore add up to balance [...] The object's surface must not be <b>wettable</b> for this to happen, and its weight must be low enough for the surface tension to support it.|$|E
2500|$|In one embodiment, a graphene-based {{supercapacitor}} uses curved {{graphene sheets}} {{that do not}} stack face-to-face, forming mesopores that are accessible to and <b>wettable</b> by ionic electrolytes at voltages up to 4V. A specific energy of [...] (...) is obtained at room temperature equaling that of a conventional nickel metal hydride battery, but with 100-1000 times greater specific power.|$|E
2500|$|Darters feed {{mainly on}} mid-sized fish {{but far more}} rarely, they eat other aquatic {{vertebrates}} such as frogs, toads, newts, salamanders, snakes, turtles and even baby crocodilians, and large invertebrates including crabs, crayfish, shrimps, insect and molluscs. [...] These birds are foot-propelled divers which quietly stalk and ambush their prey; then they use their sharply pointed bill to impale their prey. They do not dive deep but make use of their low buoyancy made possible by <b>wettable</b> plumage, small air sacs and denser bones. On {{the underside of the}} cervical vertebrae 5-7 is a keel, which allows for muscles to attach to form a hinge-like mechanism that can project the neck, head and bill forward like a throwing spear. After they have stabbed the prey, they return to the surface where they toss their food into the air and catch it again, so that they can swallow it head-first. Like cormorants, they have a vestigial preen gland and their plumage gets wet during diving. To dry their feathers after diving, darters move to a safe location and spread their wings.|$|E
50|$|Triazofos is {{available}} in several forms; as an emulsifiable concentrate (40%), <b>wettable</b> concentrates, <b>wettable</b> powders (30%), ultralow-volume liquids (25%, 40%) and granules (5%) at various concentrations.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wettable</b> powder is an {{insecticide}} {{or other}} pesticide formulation {{consisting of the}} active ingredient in a finely ground state combined with wetting agents and sometimes bulking agents. <b>Wettable</b> powders {{are designed to be}} applied as a dilute suspension through liquid spraying equipment. As <b>wettable</b> powders are not mixed with water until immediately before use, storing and transporting the products may be simplified as the weight and volume of the water is avoided. <b>Wettable</b> powders may be supplied in bulk or in measured sachets made from water-soluble film to simplify premixing and reduce operator exposure to the product.|$|E
