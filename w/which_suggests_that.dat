5|$|Graves of warrior-smiths {{buried with}} weapons and sets of tools were found, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{they belonged to}} the {{societal}} upper ranks and were held in high esteem.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{field study}} that used {{molecular}} techniques to survey aquatic fungal taxa {{in a small}} springbrook in Valley Spring, Southern Ontario, Canada discovered many fungal taxa with high genetic affinity to Limnoperdon incarnatum, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> a closely related species may also be common in streams.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of central}} European cattle, {{including}} Limousins, {{indicates that the}} origin {{of male and female}} DNA can be traced directly to cattle domesticated in the Near East. This is in contrast to the DNA of northern European cattle, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> wild Eurasian aurochs were at one time mated to domesticated cows, and of southern European cattle, which indicates that wild Eurasian aurochs cows were mated to domesticated bulls.|$|E
50|$|Mathews {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} that {{one aspect of}} the original film's production that interested him was the contrast between analyses <b>which</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the deleted footage constituted homophobic propaganda, and those <b>which</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it was more documentary in nature.|$|R

5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} sinking of a British warship in Chinese waters, the theft {{of one of the}} ship's cruise missiles—and the {{shooting}} down of a Chinese fighter plane. He uncovers a link to media mogul Elliot Carver <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Carver had purchased a GPS encoder on the black market.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} more {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E

5|$|His origins are unknown, {{but he was}} {{probably}} not a native Englishman. He may have been German or Norman. The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Regenbald {{was one of the}} foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|LeMessurier and Hills {{published}} {{a paper in}} 1965 on A thermodynamic approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> decompression by conventional models results in bubble formation which is then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops, which is slower than elimination while still in solution, thus indicating the importance of minimising bubble phase for efficient gas elimination.|$|E
5|$|Maurice's natural {{goodness}} never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> environment determines a person's morality, Maurice {{assumes that}} people can be innately good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws no clear distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E

5|$|Sarolt {{gave birth}} to {{at least three of}} Géza's children; Stephen, who succeeded his father on the throne, and two unnamed daughters. Sarolt survived Géza, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> she was also the mother of Géza's daughters. Based on the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle, Szabolcs de Vajay wrote that the daughters' mother was Géza's alleged second wife Adelaide (Adleta) of Poland, but this has not been widely accepted. The {{following}} family tree presents Géza's ancestry and his offspring.|$|E
5|$|Sedna's highly {{elliptical}} orbit means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that,</b> unless its discovery was a fluke, another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years. It may {{have been affected by}} the same processes as Sedna.|$|E
5|$|The archaeologists {{discovered}} several bronze {{objects that}} were excavated {{with the hand}} cannon. The excavated objects were a bronze vase, a bronze mirror, and a bronze cooking pan. All the bronze artifacts were manufactured {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin dynasty. The Jin dynasty collapsed after the Mongols besieged and captured Caizhou in 1234, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the Heilongjiang hand-gun can reasonably be dated to the 13th century at the latest.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Katharine Keats-Rohan records {{his death}} as occurring in 1157 or 1158. Robert's successor as dean, Robert Butevilain, is first securely attested as dean on 6 May 1158, {{and the last}} secure date for his holding his previous office is 13 December 1157, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Robert of Ghent died in between those dates, or shortly before the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|Three sumptuous tombs {{found at}} Apahida {{evidence}} the wealth accumulated by Gepid royals through their {{connections with the}} Eastern Roman Empire. A golden ring with crosses found {{in one of the}} graves implies its owner's Christian faith. John of Biclar refers to an Arian bishop of the Gepids <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> they adopted Christianity through their connection with the Arian Goths.|$|E
5|$|Whoever Cuthbert was {{prior to}} his {{election}} to Canterbury, he probably owed his selection as archbishop {{to the influence of}} Æthelbald, King of Mercia. A number of Mercians were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Mercian authority was expanding into Kent.|$|E

5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were {{once thought to be}} a way by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> clicks can be used to identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|As Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is terminal, Nier {{sets out}} {{to look for a}} cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, Grimoire Weiss, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease. In their search, they {{encounter}} Kainé, a hot-tempered and foul-mouthed swordswoman; and Emil, a blindfolded boy whose eyes petrify anyone they see. After journeying for a time, the village is attacked by a giant shade; the battle culminates in Yonah being carried away by a master Shade that suddenly appears—the Shadowlord—who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E
