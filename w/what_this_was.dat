5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>was,</b> but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E

The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>was.</b> Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E
