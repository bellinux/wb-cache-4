500|$|Eleven {{weeks before}} the Beatles' arrival in the U.S. President JohnF. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation was in mourning, in fear, and in disbelief. The {{assassination}} came after a fifteen-year build-up of Cold War tension. The motivation and identity of the assassin would be doubted by many Americans for decades, despite the Warren Commission's issued report in September 1964. As the United States tried to restore a sense of normality, teenagers in particular struggled to cope, as their disbelief began {{to be replaced by}} a personal reaction to what had happened: in school essays, teenagers wrote that [...] "then it became real", and [...] "I was feeling the whole <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> collapse on me", and [...] "I never felt so empty in all my life".|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} episodes {{of the season}} were [...] "linked in one {{continuous}} story arc," [...] and meant to seem like [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel. And usually in a good novel, the last pages [...] compels you forward with {{a new understanding of}} what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you can’t wait to turn that page." [...] The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed, but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] The finale was designed to establish the groundwork by [...] "open a new chapter" [...] for the new season, which included Peter having never existed. Its futuristic storyline was meant to [...] "inform the present of the show with some thematic elements," [...] establishing to viewers that [...] "our <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> break down." ...|$|E

Jews {{are not going to}} give up Jerusalem—they shouldn't—and the rest of the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> insist they give it up."

[...] Royce da 5'9" [...] appeared on MTV's RapFix, hosted by Calloway, with his group Slaughterhouse, on August 30, 2012, and talked about Eminem's album.

2500|$|Fantino {{was criticized}} by lawyer Peter Rosenthal {{during the trial}} of {{aboriginal}} activist Shawn Brant. Fantino was criticized for ordering wiretaps of Brant's phone without proper authority and for making provocative comments to Brant during negotiations to end a blockade of the rail line west of Kingston. By way of those illegal wiretaps, Fantino was recorded saying to Brant [...] "You are going to force me to do everything I can; within your community and everywhere else; to destroy your reputation" [...] and [...] "your whole <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come crashing down" [...] NDP MPP Peter Kormos called for Fantino's resignation accusing him of using [...] "pugnacious and bellicose" [...] rhetoric and for engaging in [...] "Rambo-style policing." [...] In the face of defence motions {{for the police to}} disclose more evidence about their conduct the Crown agreed to drop the most serious charges against Brant in exchange for a plea bargain resulting in a light sentence. Fantino was also criticized {{for his role in the}} Caledonia land dispute after he was accused of sending e-mails to local politicians accusing them of encouraging anti-police rallies by non-Natives.|$|E

6000|$|So that I {{think that}} even if the creeds, from the {{so-called}} [...] "Apostles'" [...] to the so-called [...] "Athanasian," [...] were swept into oblivion; and even if the human race should arrive at the conclusion that, whether a bishop washes a cup or leaves it unwashed, {{is not a matter of}} the least consequence, it will get on very well. The causes which have led to the development of morality in mankind, which have guided or {456} impelled us all the way from the savage to the civilised state, will not cease to operate because a number of ecclesiastical hypotheses turn out to be baseless. And, even if the absurd notion that morality is more the child of speculation than of practical necessity and inherited instinct, had any foundation; if all the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> thieve, murder, and otherwise misconduct itself as soon as it discovers that certain portions of ancient history are mythical; what is the relevance of such arguments to any one who holds by the Agnostic principle? ...|$|E

6000|$|On that evening, at Wharton, Emily {{still wore}} her {{mourning}} dress. No one, indeed, dared {{to speak to}} her on the subject, and Mary was even afraid lest she might appear in black on the following day. We all know in what condition is a house {{on the eve of a}} marriage,--how the bride feels that all the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be changed, and that therefore everything is for the moment disjointed; and how the rest of the household, including the servants, are led to share the feeling. Everett was of course away. He was over at Longbarns with the Fletchers, and was to be brought to Wharton Church on the following morning. Old Mrs. Fletcher was at Wharton Hall,--and the bishop, whose services had been happily secured. He was formally introduced to Mrs. Lopez, the use of the name for the occasion being absolutely necessary, and with all the smiling urbanity which as a bishop he was bound to possess, he was hardly able not to be funereal as he looked at her and remembered her story. Before the evening was over Mrs. Fletcher did venture to give a hint. [...] "We are so glad you have come, my dear." ...|$|E
60|$|First {{among these}} is the habit of {{allowing}} ourselves to be bound {{not only by the}} truths of the Christian religion but by the excesses and extravagances which the Christian movement acquired in its earlier days as a violent reaction against what it still calls paganism. By far the most dangerous of these, because it is a blasphemy against life, and, to put it in Christian terms, an accusation of indecency against God, is the notion that sex, with all its operations, is in itself absolutely an obscene thing, and that an immaculate conception is a miracle. So unwholesome an absurdity could only have gained ground under two conditions: one, a reaction against a society in which sensual luxury had been carried to revolting extremes, and, two, a belief that the world was coming to an end, and that therefore sex was no longer a necessity. Christianity, because it began under these conditions, made sexlessness and Communism the two main practical articles of its propaganda; and it has never quite lost its original bias in these directions. In spite of the putting off of the Second Coming from the lifetime of the apostles to the millennium, and of the great disappointment of the year 1000 A.D., in which multitudes of Christians seriously prepared {{for the end of the}} world, the prophet who announces that the end is at hand is still popular. Many of the people who ridicule his demonstrations that the fantastic monsters of the book of Revelation are among us in the persons of our own political contemporaries, and who proceed sanely in all their affairs on the assumption that the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> last, really do believe that there will be a Judgment Day, and that it MIGHT even be in their own time. A thunderstorm, an eclipse, or any very unusual weather will make them apprehensive and uncomfortable.|$|E
