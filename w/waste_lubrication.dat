40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to obtain diesel-like fuel from <b>waste</b> <b>lubrication</b> engine oils by {{pyrolitic}} distillation method, which can be used in diesel engines. With this aim in mind, waste engine oil is collected in a tank, and it is purified from contaminants such as dust, heavy carbon soot, metal particles, gum-type materials and other impurities by filtering in the process prepared earlier. To investigate effects of additives known as sodium carbonate (NaCO 3), zeolite and lime (CaO) on density, viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperature, the purified oil samples are blended separately with additives having mass basis of 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 %. The mixed samples are exposed to pyrolitic distillation process to produce fuels to be used in engines. Thermal and physical properties of the produced fuels such as density, flash point, viscosity, sulfur content, heating value and distillation temperatures are examined. From these results, the CaO with a ratio of 2 % has the highest effect on decreasing of sulfur content of the waste engine oil and on acquiring the most suitable distillation temperatures close to values of a diesel fuel. Diesel-like fuel (DLF) is obtained as 60 % of the <b>waste</b> <b>lubrication</b> engine oil. Waste oil Waste engine oil Pyrolitic distillation Diesel-like fuel...|$|E
40|$|Research {{has been}} {{conducted}} to convert <b>waste</b> <b>lubrication</b> oil into fuel oil. This work is {{the second part of}} a bigger work entittled “Conversion of Waste Oil into Fuel Oil”. The first part dealing with the production of catalyst and the effect of temperature, whilst this part studying the effect of catalyst ratio. This work was done with procedure similar with {{the first part of the}} work. Convertion of <b>waste</b> <b>lubrication</b> oil into fuel oil was done using hydrocracking process with catalyst of combination of chromium and activated natural zeolith (Cr/ZAA). Controlled variables used for this researh were the type of waste oil (lubrication oil), feed volume (40 ml), temperature (500 °C), and hydrogen gas rate (20 ml/sec). The weight ratio of the catalyst and waste oil feed was varied at 1 / 8, 1 / 4, 1 / 3, 1 / 2, and 2 / 3. The parameters used to analyse the results were the amount of hydrocracking product, percentage of cracking fraction (gasoline, kerosene and solar) in the product and the heating value of the product. Analytic works were carried out with GC for cracking fraction and bomb calorimeter for heating value of the produced fuel oil. Results showed that the amount of hydrocracking product decreases with the increase of catalyst ratio. Increasing catalyst ratio increases gasoline fraction lineary, decreases kerosene and solar fractions. The heating value of the product lineary increases with catalyst ratio. Best catalyst ratio for this work was 1 / 8 to get maximum amount of product (13. 16 ml for 40 ml feed), and 2 / 3 to get maximum gasoline fraction (56. 70 %), and highest heating value (44. 92 kJ/gr) ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{our main}} {{focus is on}} finding {{alternative}} fuel resources and utilizing them to eliminate their negative effects. Because {{of the limitations of}} petroleum products, the used engine oils can be used in engine as engine oil after purifying it. Production of gasoline like fuel from used engine oil is involving chemical filtrations and blending process. The GLF is produced from <b>waste</b> engine <b>lubrication</b> oil (WLO) using the pyrolitic distillation method. Firstly, the WLO collected in a tank was particulates removed by a refining process. The refined lubrication oil samples were taken into a reactor and blended with some catalysts, and purified from dust, heavy carbon soot, metal particles, gum-type materials and other impurities. A fuel production system mainly consisting of a seven main parts using are waste oil storage tank, filters, a reactor, oil pump, a product storage tank, thermostats and control panel. The characteristic such as density, viscosity, flash point, heating value, sulphur content and distillation of the GLF are deliberated. The gasoline like fuel can be used in gasoline engine without any problem and increases the engine performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} centered on obtaining the factors which effect of the quality and quantities of the used lubricating oils and additives of companies at the first organized industrial zone (OZI, industrial park) in the center of Bilecik. In accordance with the attainments taken from the literature scan, an application has been performed using the survey technique in companies which are active in manufacturing, distribution and processing sector at the first OZI, Bilecik. The data obtained from these questionnaires are recorded through a computer program and after the statistical analyses, the influence factors on decision making to choose the industrial lubricating oil have been determined in Bilecik industry. The questionnaire results presented that participants from the first OZI companies in Bilecik were preferred both of mineral and synthetic base oil stocks, as lubricating oils, 60 %in the total ratio. After applied questionnaires, the results also demonstrated that the lubricating fluids were fortified with carefully selected additives to provide optimum performance and service life while maximizing protection of the equipment and machinery and also for reducing environmental pollution, minimizing <b>waste</b> of <b>lubrication</b> oil. Different additives and their dosage were selected up to their synergic or antagonistic affectat the operating conditions and manufacturing processes in plant, by the participant of this research...|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{preliminary}} study {{for the development of}} a co-pyrolysis process of plastic wastes excavated from a landfill and used lubrication oils, with the aim to produce an alternative liquid fuel for industrial use. First, thermogravimetric experiments were carried out with pure plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS) and oils (a motor oil and a mixture of used lubrication oils) in order to highlight the interactions occurring between a plastic and an oil during their co-pyrolysis. It appears that the main decomposition event of each component takes place at higher temperatures when the components are mixed than when they are alone, possibly because the two components stabilize each other during their co-pyrolysis. These interactions depend on the nature of the plastic and the oil. In addition, co-pyrolysis experiments were led in a lab-scale reactor using a mixture of excavated plastic <b>wastes</b> and used <b>lubrication</b> oils. On the one hand, the influence of some key operating parameters on the outcome of the process was analyzed. It was possible to produce an alternative fuel for industrial use whose viscosity is lower than 1 Pa s at 90 °C, from a plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction between 40 % and 60 %, by proceeding at a maximum temperature included in the range 350 – 400 °C. On the other hand, the amount of energy required to successfully co-pyrolyze, in lab conditions, 1 kg of plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction of 60 % was estimated at about 8 MJ. That amount of energy is largely used for the thermal cracking of the molecules. It is also shown that, per kg of mixture introduced in the lab reactor, 29 MJ can be recovered from the combustion of the liquid resulting from the co-pyrolysis. Hence, this co-pyrolysis process could be economically viable, provided heat losses are addressed carefully when designing an industrial reactor. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R
