5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures Rising {{returned}} to the ABC network on July 18, 1974 after a six-month hiatus. Its new time slot, Thursday nights at 8:00 PM, had previously been occupied by Chopper One, an adventure series. The situations presented this time around included Dr. Mercy saving {{the life of a}} popular country music singer (Dick Gautier), and setting up a surveillance system so that staff <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> on their toes.|$|E
5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they {{had worked in the}} 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in this form until 1911, only to be changed a little bit in 1912 before being {{replaced}} by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E

5|$|The {{database}} {{would hold}} information on about 11 million children in England. Records <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> until {{six years after}} the child turns 18, or if they leave England and Wales with no intention of returning. The database could also apply to 18- to 25-year-olds who were care leavers or had learning disabilities (although the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child only applies to those under 18 in England and Wales), and their permission was needed.|$|E
5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|The family {{hoped that}} the ranch would be {{returned}} after the war, but it was not, and in 1970, the Army announced that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> permanently. The McDonald Ranch House was empty and deteriorating until 1982, when it was stabilized by the Army. In 1984 it was restored by the National Park Service to appear as it did on July 12, 1945. The site is now open to visitors twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and October.|$|E

5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected {{in one place and}} transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, the length of the ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> the same and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based on the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E
5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} the fourteenth century, Cambridge University owned a {{collection}} of manuscripts and some printed books. These <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in chests along with other valuables, {{rather than in a}} library building as <b>would</b> <b>be</b> recognised today.|$|R

50|$|Japan {{has rarely}} feared {{invasion}} or maintained border forts. However, {{it is not}} unlikely that various types of guardtowers or watchtowers <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>kept,</b> outside of larger castle compounds, at various times and places throughout Japan's history.|$|R
5|$|The Oslo Tramway had a {{ridership}} of 108 million {{passengers in}} 1948. On 17 January 1949, the Korsvoll Line {{became the first}} tram line to be closed. followed by the Rodeløkka Line on 6 February. The latter reopened following a new route on 2 January 1955. In 1960, with the deregulation of the sale of cars, cheap diesel and the decision to build the metro, the city council decided to close the tram and the trolleybus networks. Tracks <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> and trams would run until they would be naturally retired. However, no major investments would {{be made in the}} lines or rolling stock. Within a year, the Kampen, Rodeløkka, Vippetangen, Simensbråten and Vestbanen Lines were closed, as were trolleybus lines 18 and 24. The remaining two trolleybus routes were closed in 1968. On 24 June 1968, Vålerenga Line was closed.|$|E
5|$|Hunting with cheetahs {{became more}} {{prevalent}} toward the seventh centuryAD. In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs {{continued to be}} associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia till as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the Tang dynasty (7th to 10th centuriesAD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as caracals, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the Yuan rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the Ming Shilu, the subsequent Ming dynasty (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East. The Mughal ruler Akbar the Great (1556–1605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs. However, his son Jahangir wrote in his memoirs, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, that only one of them gave birth to cubs. Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt gameespecially blackbuck. The rampant hunting severely affected the populations of wild animals.|$|E

50|$|A DMZ can be {{established}} within an enclave to host publicly accessiblesystems. The ideal design is to build the DMZ on a separate network interfaceof the enclave perimeter firewall. All DMZ traffic <b>would</b> <b>be</b> routed through thefirewall for processing and the DMZ <b>would</b> still <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> separate from the restof the protected network.|$|R
