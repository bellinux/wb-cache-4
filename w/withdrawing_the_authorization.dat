In animal husbandry, antibiotics are used for therapeutic and preventive treatments of infectious diseases and as growth promoters. In Europe, many antibiotics used as growth promoters were of the same classes as important antibiotics used in human medicine. <b>The</b> European Union <b>withdrew</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorization</b> for <b>the</b> use of the major antimicrobial growth promoters between 1996 and 1999. In 1999 Switzerland decided to ban the use of all antimicrobials as growthpromoting feed additives. The regulations concerning antibiotic use in animal husbandry and the chronological reasons for the ban of antimicrobial growth promoters are described. This ban led to a decrease of the antibiotic volume deployed in agriculture. This measure helps {{to reduce the amount}} of antibiotic resistant bacteria in food-producing animals. However, the use of medicated feed is still a common practice to prevent and to remedy bacterial infections and thus still leads to resistant pathogens. Surveillance programs, single animal treatment, good manufacturing practices and vaccinations are additional measures to be taken to keep the level of resistances in bacteria low...|$|R

As a result, the Peace Corp minimized the incoming group of volunteers by half to ensure adequate support.

Dodd asked that Retzer rescind his cable of no confidence of Djondo or that the State Department provide a written apology to her.

40|$|Many {{workflow}} management {{systems have been}} developed to enhance the performance of workflow executions. <b>The</b> <b>authorization</b> policies deployed in the system may restrict the task executions. <b>The</b> common <b>authorization</b> constraints include role constraints, Separation of Duty (SoD), Binding of Duty (BoD) and temporal constraints.
