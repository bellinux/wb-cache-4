40|$|Abstract. The present work {{investigates the}} effect of the {{detergent}} content diluted in the washing water on the friction coefficient of bare foot sliding against marble tiles during walking. Two types of deodorizers as well as a disinfectant were used. The static friction coefficient of bare foot at <b>wet</b> and dry <b>sliding</b> conditions was measured. The tested detergent was added into water in concentration varied from 0 to 0. 5 vol. %. The water was diluted by disinfectant of 2. 0 vol. % concentration before the tested tiles were replenished by the dilution. Experiments were carried out using a test rig designed and manufactured for these tests. Loads were applied up to 700 N. The normal and friction forces were measured to determine the static friction coefficient under <b>wet</b> and dry <b>sliding</b> conditions. Based on the experimental results, it was found that friction coefficient decreased with increasing the deodorizers content, where values of friction coefficient were relatively low so that the sliding conditions could be classified as unsafe walking. After drying, friction coefficient displayed relatively higher values than that observed by <b>wet</b> <b>sliding.</b> Besides, it was observed that friction coefficient decreased with increasing detergent content. The friction values were higher than that displayed by deodorizers. After drying, friction coefficient increased up to maximum then decreased with increasing detergent content. Diluting water by detergent and deodorizers showed drastic friction decrease for deodorizer (I). Significant friction increase was observed for deodorizer (II) at <b>wet</b> <b>sliding</b> condition.

40|$|Abstract — The {{influence}} of triboelectrification of the contact surfaces on friction coefficient displayed by polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE) spheres sliding against polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and steel sheets is discussed. The effect of insulating the sliding surfaces on the friction coefficient is discussed at dry and water as well as salt water <b>wetted</b> <b>sliding</b> conditions. It was found that isolated test specimens showed relatively lower friction coefficient than that observed for the connected ones. This behaviour can be explained {{on the basis that}} sliding of PMMA sphere on PTFE surface generated positive charge on the PMMA surface and negative charge on PTFE surface. The lower surface of PTFE sheet would be charged by positive charge which, in condition of connecting the steel sheet by the grounded steel pin, would move to the steel pin and increase the positive charge generated on its surface. In that condition, the electric static charge would increase and consequently the attractive force would increase leading to an increase in friction coefficient. As for isolated test specimens, the electric static charge on the contact would be lower and consequently the attractive force would be lower causing slight decrease in friction coefficient. The same trend was observed for sliding of PE against PTFE and steel. Based on the experimental results, it is recommended to insulate the sliding surfaces in order to decrease friction coefficient...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{tribology}} of thermal sprayed WC-Co based coatings and covers the high energy air-sand erosion resistance and slurry jet impingement erosion performance, dry and <b>wet</b> <b>sliding</b> tribology of thermal spray WC-Co based coatings {{as well as the}} abrasion and abrasion-corrosion of these coatings. The tribological and tribo-corrosion performance of the coatings will be related to their mechanical and corrosion properties as well as deposition parameters, microstructure and actual composition. For example, the anisotropic microstructure of thermally sprayed WC–Co–Cr coatings, in particular the low fracture toughness in a direction parallel to the substrate, has been observed to affect the nature of crack formation under 200 ?J air-solid particle erosion conditions. Voids and occasionally other microstructural features (i. e. cobalt lakes, splat boundaries, interfacial inclusions) in the coating act as crack initiation sites. The erosion rate was dominated by cracks within 5 ?m of the surface and was relatively insensitive to total length of cracks, showing a near-surface damage front controls the erosion rate and this region is coincident with the region of maximum shear stress induced by erodent impacts. Optimisation of the deposition parameters of HVOF 86 WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr coatings show an improvement in erosion resistance of more than 50 % over the conventional D-gun applied coating of identical nominal composition. The variation in the slurry erosion performance of the thermally sprayed coatings is also linked to directional fracture toughness and crack propagation paths which are influenced by the presence of pores, inhomogeneous carbide distributions and substrate grit blast remnants. The influence of slurry jet angle is more pronounced under 0. 4 ?J energy conditions where maximum erosion occurred at 90 ° and the minimum at 30 ° in contrast to 7 ?J slurry erosion rates which were independent of jet angle. This reflects the lower levels of fluctuating stresses imparted to the coating during low energy slurry impacts leading to the impact angle having a greater effect on sub critical crack growth rate than for higher energy conditions. The abrasion resistance of these coatings was found comparable to sintered cermets of the same composition. The synergistic effects between micro and macro abrasion and corrosion for detonation gun (D-gun) sprayed WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr coatings are shown to be significant and depend on the environment. The size effect of the abradant relative to the microstructure and splat size is important as well as the propensity for the various phases to passivate to control corrosion levels. Comparisons between exposed and freshly polished coating surfaces in strong NaOH solutions (pH 11) show that significantly lower wear rates were seen for the exposed surface due to a negative wear–corrosion synergy due to selective phase removal and the effects of localised passivation. Dry and <b>wet</b> <b>sliding</b> wear resistance of these coatings is shown to be high (wear rates of 10 - 16 to 10 - 18 m 3 /Nm) with modest coefficient of friction levels between 0. 2 and 0. 5.

In this work, coconut fibers reinforced polyester (CFRP) composites were developed.

Worn surfaces were observed using optical microscope. Friction coefficient and specific wear rate were presented {{as a function of}} sliding distance (0 – 0. 6 km) at different sliding velocities (0. 1 – 0. 28 m/s). The effect of applied load and sliding velocity was evaluated. The results showed that all test parameters have significant influence on friction and wear characteristics of the composites. Moreover, friction coefficient increased as the normal load and speed increased, the values were about 0. 7 – 0. 9 under dry contact condition. Meanwhile, under wet contact condition, there was a great reduction in the friction coefficient, i. e. the values were about 0. 1 – 0. 2. Furthermore, the specific wear rates were found to be around 2 – 4 (10 - 3) mm 3 /Nm under dry contact condition and highly reduced under wet condition. In other words, the presence of water as cleaner and polisher assisted to enhance the adhesive wear performance of CFRP by about 10 %. The images from optical microscope showed evidence of adhesive wear mode with transition to abrasive wear mode at higher sliding velocities due to third body abrasion. On the other hand, optical images for wet condition showed less adhesive wear and smooth surfaces. Coconut fiber, polyester, friction, wear, sliding velocity...|$|R

40|$|N/AIn this work, {{precipitation}} hardening (PH) stainless steel was plasma nitrided at low temperatures 400 oC and 425 oC for 15 h. The wear and corrosion-wear behaviour of the untreated and nitrided specimens were investigated under both dry <b>sliding</b> and <b>wet</b> <b>sliding</b> (in 3 % NaCl solution) conditions, using both one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) reciprocating motions. The 2 D motion was realised by reciprocating the sample stage {{as the primary}} motion {{and at the same}} time reciprocating the ball (pin) holder at a high frequency and small amplitude as the secondary motion. The results show that 2 D sliding has significant effects on the wear behaviour of the test specimens. Under dry condition, 2 D sliding leads to a significant increase in wear volume by 70 % to 230 %. Nitriding is very effective in increasing dry sliding wear resistance of the steel under both 1 D and 2 D conditions, with 400 oC nitriding being the most effective. Under corrosion-wear (tribocorrosion) condition in 3 % NaCl solution, 2 D sliding leads to a more significant drop in open circuit potential (OCP) and a more significant increase in anodic current than 1 D sliding. While under 1 D sliding condition, nitriding is effective in reducing material removal by tribocorrosion, under 2 D sliding condition, the effectiveness of nitriding is dependent on nitriding temperature. Nitriding at 425 oC results in accelerated material removal during 2 D sliding in the corrosive solution. The mechanisms of material removal are discussed in terms of the structures of the nitride layers and their electrochemical response to the corrosive solution...|$|R

40|$|A {{theory of}} the sub-ambient fluid {{pressure}} phenomenon observed during the <b>wet</b> <b>sliding</b> of a disk on a polymeric pad is presented. Two-dimensional fluid pressure mapping using membrane pressure sensors reveals a large, asymmetrical sub-ambient pressure region occupying about 70 percent of the disk-pad contact area. At the same time, a small positive pressure region exists near {{the trailing edge of}} the disk. This phenomenon is believed to be present during chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and can contribute to the contact pressure, affecting the material removal rate and removal uniformity. Depending on the load and pad speed, the real contact pressure can be more than 2 times the nominal contact pressure due to the applied load. Tilt measurements of the disk carried out by a capacitive sensing technique indicate that the disk is tilted towards the leading edge and pad center when the pad is rotating. In addition, wafer bow is found to be less than 2 m and wafer tilt with respect to the wafer carrier is 5 to 7 m in the CMP configuration. A two-dimensional mixed-lubrication model based on the Reynolds equation is developed and solved using a finite differencing scheme. The pad is modeled as two layers: a top asperity layer described by the Greenwood and Williamson equation, and the bulk pad as linearly elastic. The orientation of the disk is determined by balancing the fluid and solid forces acting on it and solving using a modified Newtons method. It is found that the tilt of the disk and the pad topography play important roles in the distribution of fluid pressure through affecting the film thickness distribution. For a pad with severe topography, minimum and maximum fluid pressures of - 90 kPa and + 51 kPa respectively are detected. The model is able to recreate the experimental pressure maps. A material removal rate model based on mechanical abrasion and statistics has also been developed. Comparisons of model predictions and silicon oxide polishing results show agreement. Ph. D.

The author’s experience, gathered from decades of observations, confirms that landslide processes are strongly correlate with precipitation events in all three landscape types (hill regions of unconsolidated sediments; high bluffs along river banks and lake shores; mountains of Tertiary stratovolcanoes). Case studies for each landscape type underline that new landslides are triggered and old ones are reactivated by extreme winter precipitation events. This assertion is valid mainly for shallow and translational <b>slides.</b> <b>Wet</b> autumns favour landsliding, while the triggering influence of intense summer rainfalls is of a subordinate nature.

The data obtained in {{this study indicate that}} exposure of initially water <b>wet</b> quartz <b>slides</b> to industrially used solvents can cause a contact angle change, measured through the aqueous phase, of 100 degrees with a maximum stable contact angle of 170 degrees (indicative of strong NAPL wetting characteristics) being recorded. The work on quartz slides was complemented by the use of sandstone cores. Wettability was measured using the Amott lest. Used TCE again proved able to alter the wetting properties of sandstone to neutral wetting. The complexity of the industrially used samples precluded any realistic attempt to examine the agents causing these wetting changes. The data captured in these experiments were compared with laboratory grade TCE, and some attempts were made to synthesize known mixtures in order to replicate wetting changes. These experiments resulted in contact angle changes but did not alter the overall wettability of the quartz slides or sandstone cores. Finally the work reported here also demonstrates that increasing the duration of exposure to solvent has an important impact upon measured contact angle...|$|R
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} rural {{populations in the}} {{developing}} world rely on the handpump for access to drinking water from ground sources. The functional sustainability of handpumps is affected by the low availability of handpumps at any given period of time. The wear of the nitrile rubber piston seals contribute significantly towards this low availability accounting for a significant percentage of maintenance interventions. In this study a novel approach is used to improve the wear resistance of the nitrile rubber piston seals. Hybrid coatings of diamond-like carbon (DLC) and silicon doped diamond-like carbon (Si-DLC), with and without Si-C interlayers, were deposited onto both sample nitrile rubber substrates and actual piston seals. The deposition was done using a combination of closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering ion plating (CFUBMSIP) and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) in Ar/C 4 H 10 plasma. Film characterisation was carried out using visible (488 nm) and UV (325 nm) Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface profilometry, hardness measurements, hydrophobicity and surface energy analysis, adhesion and flexibility analysis, and tribological investigations under dry and wet conditions for normal loads of 1 N and 5 N. A piston seal wear test rig was used to test the wear resistance of the coated piston seals. Experimental results show a dense, non-columnar microstructure with a dendritic morphology. This dendritic crack-like structure promotes film flexibility. The G peak position for the coatings was centred approximately around 1580 cm- 1. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) generally tended to increase for coatings with Si-C interlayer. Full width at half maximum, FWHM(G), was observed to reduce for coatings with Si-C interlayers. Calculated hydrogen values for all of the films were between 24 % and 31 %. The internal compressive residual stress in the coatings was reduced. The contact angle of water droplets showed that the coatings were hydrophobic. The deposited coatings showed excellent adherence with an adhesion rating of 4 A for films with a Si-C interlayer. The composite micro-hardness was highest for DLC coatings at 15. 5 GPa for indentation load of 147. 1 mN using a Vickers micro-hardness tester. Nano-indentation results show that all of the coatings tested had the same order of nano-mechanical properties with hardness values of approximately 3. 6 GPa and Elastic modulus values of 35 GPa. XPS survey scans showed the contributions from C 1 s (~ 285 eV), O 1 s (~ 531 eV), Si 2 p (~ 100 eV) and Si 2 s (~ 151 eV). C-Si (C 1 s) and Si-C (Si 2 p) configurations corresponding to bonding between carbon and silicon atoms in SiC were observed. The sp 3 /sp 2 ratio increased for the Si-DLC and DLC with Si-C interlayer coating compared to the DLC coating. All of the coatings showed excellent tribological results with an over 50 % reduction in the coefficient of friction compared to uncoated nitrile rubber. There was no penetration of the coatings for normal loads of 1 N and 5 N under <b>wet</b> <b>sliding</b> and 1 N normal load under dry sliding, which is important for potential application onto piston seals...|$|R
