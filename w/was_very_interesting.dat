5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. This <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E

He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers, and Portman recalled, [...] "I thought that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself." [...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with CNN-IBN, Madhur Bhandarkar {{said that he}} was preparing to make a film about the fashion industry; he thought the lack of Indian films on this subject prompted him to do so. He said he was fascinated with the industry, the models and their lives outside the ramp walks, saying [...] "I was amazed at the overwhelming attention given to the fashion Industry by the media and the public. I thought the idea of delving deep into the fashion world <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> and intriguing." [...] He was excited about depicting the people behind the ramp because most people are unfamiliar with [...] the fashion world.|$|E

500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth it just for the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, I think they were really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a lot of these action things with people dying and never addressing them. So I thought it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to do so".|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, he {{said that}} he [...] "nearly voted" [...] for the UK Independence Party, expressing his admiration for party leader Nigel Farage and {{endorsing}} his Euroscepticism regarding the UK's membership of the European Union. In October 2016, he praised the outcome of the UK's referendum on EU membership as [...] "magnificent" [...] and said the BBC had [...] "persistently denigrated" [...] supporters of the Leave campaign. In October 2017, he stated his belief that the then recently concluded UKIP leadership election had been rigged against anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters. During a live performance on BBC 6 Music, he said: [...] "I was very surprised the other day—it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to me—to see Anne Marie Waters become the head of Ukip. Oh no, sorry she didn't—the voting was rigged. Sorry, I forgot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Collins {{adapted the}} novel for film herself, in {{collaboration}} with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt {{the only way to}} make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, [...] "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important." [...] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that [...] "I thought that it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> that there would be one generation [...] who knew that [...] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is".|$|E
