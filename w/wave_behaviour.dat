The first <b>wave,</b> <b>behaviour</b> therapy, commenced in the 1920s based on Pavlov's classical (respondent) conditioning and operant conditioning that was correlated to reinforcing consequences. The second wave emerged in the 1970s and included cognition {{in the form of}} irrational beliefs, dysfunctional attitudes or depressogenic attributions. In the late 1980s empirical limitations and philosophical misgivings of the second wave gave rise to Steven Hayes' ACT theory which modified the focus of abnormal behaviour away from the content or form towards the context in which it occurs. ACT research has suggested that many of the emotional defenses individuals use with conviction to try to solve their problems actually entangle humans into greater suffering. Rigid ideas about themselves, lack of focus on what is important in their life and struggling to change sensations, feelings or thoughts that are troublesome only serve to create greater distress.|$|E

It directly generates the rooms impulse response {{which is an}} important piece of information for acoustic quality assessment. It is efficient for broadband calculations over a short time duration. The most common room acoustics modelling method is currently based on geometrical room acoustics in the time domain. It is efficient and provides practical approximations. However, its accuracy is ultimately limited by its approximation of <b>wave</b> <b>behaviours.</b> <b>Wave</b> based models, which are more accurate but expensive, have been gaining interests due to more efficient numerical schemes. One example is the finite difference time domain method. This paper gives some examples of developments in this method for room acoustics. Another example is the time domain boundary element method. Although {{it is harder to}} implement, it has an advantage that a change in source or room does not require complete recalculation of the interaction matrix. This is useful for time variant simulation or auralisation.

The genuinely quantum nature of the photon&# 039;s behaviour is tested via a Bell inequality, which here replaces the delayed choice of the observer.

40|$|The inner {{surf zone}} is a {{critical}} component of models that are used to predict nearshore <b>wave</b> <b>behaviour</b> and beach morphodynamics. However, <b>wave</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the inner surf zone is poorly understood. Water surface elevation data from eight field deployments were combined to produce a total data set of over 105 hours. This data was analysed to accurately characterise <b>wave</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the inner surf zone. Contrary to the current hypothesis, the wave height to water depth ratio, γ, in the inner surf zone was not constant, but increased rapidly in the shoreward direction. Some data runs had γ-values that were close to one, a factor more than twice as large as the commonly quoted value. This observation was used to modify the existing conceptual model for <b>wave</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the surf zone, by defining two new sub-regions in the inner surf zone: (1) the approximately constant γ zone and (2) the rapidly increasing γ zone. As waves progressed from the constant γ zone to the increasing γ zone, they became increasingly non-linear. This suggests the increasing importance of amplitude dispersion as waves move into shallow water. It is therefore important to use theoretical models that are based on the non-linear shallow water theory and/or bore equations (or similar) in order to accurately describe the physics...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBohr's {{complementarity}} {{notion is}} at the heart of quantum physics. It suggests that quantum systems are observed as waves or particles depending on the type of measurement, i. e., the experimental arrangement, they are subjected to. For instance, sending single photons to an open or closed Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) leads to the observation of particle or <b>wave</b> <b>behaviours,</b> respectively. In 1984, Wheeler proposed a "Gedanken" delayed-choice experiment in which the interferometer configuration is chosen at will by the experimentalist only after the photon has already passed the input beam-splitter (BS_in) of the device. This experiment was realized using a single photon source and showed that Bohr's complementarity notion was still obeyed. It was recently proposed to take Wheeler's experiment one step further by employing an output "quantum beam-splitter" (QBS), i. e.,preparing BS_out in a coherent superposition of being absent and present. This allows choosing the type of measurement, i. e., wave or particle, only after having determined the state of the QBS, which can be (in principle) infinitely delayed. We realized such an experiment by exploiting the resource of entanglement, in this case pairs of polarization entangled photons. The behaviour of one of the paired photons, called the test photon, is analysed using a MZI having a QBS at its output. This QBS is enabled by entanglement and made of a polarization dependent beam-splitter. The other photon, called the corroborative photon, allows determining the state of the QBS, and consequently, which test photon <b>behaviour</b> (<b>wave,</b> particle, or both) is observed. By manipulating the corroborative photon polarization state, we demonstrate a continuous morphing of the test photon from <b>wave</b> to particle <b>behaviour.</b> This refutes simple models of single photons behaving exclusively as waves or particles. The state of the QBS is determined via the measurement of the corroborative photon only after the test photon has already been detected. The space-like separation between the two measurements invalidates local-hidden variable models associated with pre-existing information about the measurement outcomes. In other words, when the test photon is detected, no information is available about the type of measurement it underwent. These results still perfectly obey Bohr's complementarity notion and its extension...|$|R

50|$|Although the way {{in which}} sound interacts with its {{surroundings}} is often extremely complex, there are a few ideal sound <b>wave</b> <b>behaviours</b> that are fundamental to understanding acoustical design. Complex sound wave behaviors include absorption, reverberation, diffraction, and refraction. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface. Just as light waves reflect off of surfaces, sound waves also reflect off of surfaces, and every reflection results in a loss of energy. Absorption refers both to the sound that transmits through and the energy that is dissipated by a material. Reverberation is the persistence of sound that is caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces. In addition to reflecting off of surfaces, sound waves also bend around surfaces {{in the path of the}} waves. This bending is known as diffraction. Refraction is another kind of sound wave bending. This type of bending, however, is caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing and not the presence of obstacles in the path of a sound wave. Temperature gradients, for example, cause bending in sound waves. Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with complex mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to reveal the {{correlation}} between mortality rates from the tsunami of 2004 and the spatial structure of Banda Aceh’s street net. Structurally, the city is divided up in several small villages, which consists of a couple of urban blocks. The mortality rates for each of these local villages, gained from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), were correlated with space syntax analyses of Banda Aceh’s street network. As it turns out, a high number of segregated streets reduce the degree of peoples’ orientability in case of panic. However, observations of a tsunami <b>wave’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> show that a spatially broken up street can also reduce the water speed when it hits a city. Conversely, an orthogonal network styled street grid can generate high water speed through streets, but has on the other hand a high degree of orientability for its inhabitants for escaping the tsunami in case of panic. As it turns out from the interviews of tsunami survivals, people fled to the opposite direction of the tsunami and they followed the crowd. The survivors expressed that in the panic flight situation the visual orientation matters and rational thinking in way?finding reduces. Therefore the challenge in re?building cities in tsunami prone areas is to both make an orientable street network with a spatial structure that reduces a tsunami’s water speed.
