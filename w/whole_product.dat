Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, or will not suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious Blood-borne diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product is identified. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a <b>whole</b> <b>product</b> or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.|$|E

The aim of this work is to determine the respiration rate of minimally processed carrots. They were in storage at temperatures of 1 °C, 5 °C and 11 °C, and 90 % RH. The respiration rate was determined using continuous humidification airflow and measuring the CO 2 concentration using a gas chromatograph connected to a microcomputer. The respiration rates of the minimally processed carrots showed a higher respiration rate than for the <b>whole</b> <b>products.</b> The activation energy values calculated for the minimally processed carrots corresponded to 69. 82 kJmol- 1 for the <b>whole</b> <b>products.</b> The ethylene production for the carrots remained insignificant throughout the 14 days of storage...|$|R

60|$|What, for example, {{will be the}} {{absolute}} maximum to which wages in general could be forced? Conceivably and in the purest and thinnest of theory, they could include the <b>whole</b> <b>product</b> of the labor of society with just such a small fraction left over for the employers, the owners of capital and the owners of land to induce them to continue acting {{as part of the}} machine. That is to say, if all the laborers all over the world, to the last one, were united under a single control they could force the other economic classes of society to something approaching a starvation living. In practice this is nonsense. In theory it is an excellent starting point for thought.|$|E
60|$|According to {{the same}} authority, under the best {{conditions}} for organization in farming, labour can produce 20 bushels of wheat for 66 cents, or 1 bushel for 3.5 cents. This was done on a bonanza farm of 10,000 acres in California, and was {{the average cost of}} the <b>whole</b> <b>product</b> of the farm. Mr. Carroll D. Wright says that to-day 4,500,000 men, aided by machinery, turn out a product that would require the labour of 40,000,000 men if produced by hand. Professor Herzog, of Austria, says that 5,000,000 people with the machinery of to-day, employed at socially useful labour, would be able to supply a population of 20,000,000 people with all the necessaries and small luxuries of life by working 1.5 hours per day.|$|E
60|$|Labor is {{prior to}} and {{independent}} of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others nor have others working for them. In most of the Southern States {{a majority of the}} whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives, sons, and daughters,--work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the <b>whole</b> <b>product</b> to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{as to the}} {{maintenance}} of that coherency, interdependence, and systematisation of opinions and motives, which is said to make character organic, and is therefore so highly prized by some schools of thought. No doubt the loosening of this or that {{part of the fabric of}} heterogeneous origin, which constitutes the character of a man or woman, tends to loosen the whole. But do not let us feed ourselves upon phrases. This organic coherency, what does it come to? It signifies in a general way, to describe it briefly, a harmony between the intellectual, the moral, and the practical parts of human nature; an undisturbed cooperation between reason, affection, and will; the reason prescribing nothing against which the affections revolt, and proscribing nothing which they crave; and the will obeying the joint impulses of these two directing forces, without liability to capricious or extravagant disturbance of their direction. Well, if the reason were perfect in information and method, and the affections faultless in their impulse, then organic unity of character would be the final consummation of all human improvement, and it would be criminal, even if it were possible, to undermine a structure of such priceless value. But short of this there can be no value in coherency and harmonious consistency as such. So long as error is an element in it, then for so long the <b>whole</b> <b>product</b> is vitiated. Undeniably and most fortunately, social virtues are found side by side with speculative mistakes and the gravest intellectual imperfections. We may apply to humanity the idea which, as Hebrew students tell us, is imputed in the Talmud to the Supreme Being. God prays, the Talmud says; and his prayer is this,--'Be it my will that my mercy overpower my justice.' And so with men, with or without their will, their mercifulness overpowers their logic. And not their mercifulness only, but all their good impulses overpower their logic. To repeat the words which I have put into the objector's mouth, we do not always work out every vicious principle to its remotest inference. What, however, is this but to say that in such cases character is saved, not by its coherency, but by the opposite; to say not that error is useful, but what is a very different thing, that its mischievousness is sometimes capable of being averted or minimised? ...|$|E

This study was attempted to determine relationship intake of <b>whole</b> grain-based <b>products</b> in maintaining treatment target among type 2 diabetes (DM) patients. A cross-sectional study, involving type 2 DM patients (30 - 75 years old) who were attending follow-up in the Diabetic Clinic at Ipoh, Perak selected based on convenience sampling. Data was collected using questionnaires by face-to-face interview, anthropometric measurements and patient’s medical record. From that, 46 (41. 8 %) were male and 64 (51. 8 %) were female with mean age of 58. 5 (SD = 9. 5). Finding showed that three major sources of <b>whole</b> grain <b>products</b> were <b>whole</b> meal bread (21. 1 %), brown rice (8. 9 %) and oats (8. 4 %). This study significantly (p - 1), brown rice (4. 57 ± 4. 95 servings week - 1), vegetables (12. 52 ± 2. 37 servings week - 1) and fruits (10. 13 ± 3. 05 servings week - 1) were found among controlled FBG (- 1) subjects. High intake of brown rice (4. 14 ± 5. 98 servings week - 1) (p - 1). Mean intakes of oats (3. 21 ± 3. 77 servings week - 1) and fruits (7. 49 ± 4. 11 servings week - 1) were significantly higher among Total Cholesterol (TC) controlled (- 1) subjects. Meanwhile intake of cornflakes significantly higher (1. 01 ± 2. 25 servings week - 1) (p - 1). Additionally, total fruits and vegetables revealed medium relationship with FBG level (r = - 0. 415, n = 110, p = 0. 000).

A further objective is to substantiate how processing may influence the nutritional value and potential health effects of different whole grains and whole grain foods.
