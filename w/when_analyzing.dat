5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 <b>when</b> <b>analyzing</b> short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E

Students from three Chicago area colleges completing a beginning accounting course were asked if they learned intentionally, incidentally, or already knew fifty attitudes, skills, or items of information. Items were grouped in the following categories: General Objectives, Necessary Skills, Applications in Everyday Life, Interests beyond Accounting, Attitudes toward Accounting, General Skills. Students learned Objectives intentionally; knew many Necessary and General Skills already (acquired incidentally those not known); arrived at Applications and Attitudes incidentally. Interests beyond Accounting varied on the intended/incidental/already knew triad due to social and experiential factors. Chi-square testing (p <. 05) analyzed relationships between incidental learning and previous experience or training, age, sex, reason for taking course, grade, instructor/peer encouragement. Each variable was analyzed by the others as secondary variables. Analysis by secondary variables showed relationship between not having taken a previous course and incidental learning <b>when</b> <b>analyzed</b> by work experience, sex, instructor encouragement, and for those who did take a course <b>when</b> <b>analyzed</b> by age, reason, grade, peer encouragement. Analysis of subparts showed relationship between working and incidental learning <b>when</b> <b>analyzed</b> by age, and between not working and incidental learning and age, sex, reason, grade. Relationship between age and incidental learning was confirmed for those 17 - 22 and sex, reason, grade; for those 23 - 55 and age, sex, reason, grade instructor/peer encouragement. Sex and incidental learning were related for females <b>when</b> <b>analyzed</b> by age; for males <b>when</b> <b>analyzed</b> by age, reason, grade. Reasons for taking the course (Required, Curious, Purposeful) and incidental learning were related for Required and age, sex, grade, peer encouragement; for Curious and sex; for Purposeful and age. Relationship existed between grade and incidental learning for A and B students analyzed by age; for C students <b>when</b> <b>analyzed</b> by peer encouragement. Instructor encouragement and incidental learning were related for those receiving instructor encouragement and age, sex, reason, peer encouragement; for those not receiving encouragement and age.

25|$|The {{kinematic}} {{connection between}} spiral and lenticular galaxies is most clear <b>when</b> <b>analyzing</b> the Tully–Fisher relation for spiral and lenticular samples. If lenticular galaxies are an evolved stage of spiral galaxies {{then they should}} have a similar Tully–Fisher relation with spirals, but with an offset in the luminosity / absolute magnitude axis.

One can clearly see that the best-fit lines for the spiral galaxy data and the lenticular galaxy have the same slope (and thus follow the same Tully–Fisher relation), but are offset by ΔI ≈ 1.5.

25|$|The {{postural}} feeding hypothesis {{has been}} recently supported by Dr. Kevin Hunt, {{a professor at}} Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they eat. While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was used to reach up to grab for an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits {{because they were so}} convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with chimpanzee arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. <b>When</b> <b>analyzing</b> fossil anatomy, Australopithecus afarensis has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the Australopithecus hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to humans. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} relating tobacco smoking to {{mortality and}} morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In {{order to reduce}} spurious correlations <b>when</b> <b>analyzing</b> observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models {{in addition to the}} variable of primary interest. For example, suppose we have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent variable, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.|$|E

25|$|National LEB figures {{reported}} by statistical national agencies {{and international organizations}} are indeed estimates of period LEB. In the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, LEB was 26 years; the 2010 world LEB was 67.2 years. For recent years, in Swaziland LEB is about 49, and in Japan, it is about 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of 60 or 70 would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 may have few people dying at precisely 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate {{of death in the}} first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, LEB can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low LEB will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, LEB will be about 36, but about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood; in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at 5 would be another 65. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used along individual-based measures like formal life expectancy <b>when</b> <b>analyzing</b> population structure and dynamics.|$|E
