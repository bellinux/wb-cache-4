5|$|While some of {{the symbols}} are unique to Oregon, others are used by {{multiple}} states. For example, the <b>western</b> <b>meadowlark,</b> Oregon's state bird, is also an official symbol for Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming. The North American beaver is also the state animal of New York, and the Chinook salmon (sometimes known as the king salmon) is also the state fish of Alaska. The square dance and milk are commonly used state dances and state beverages, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} {{amphibians}} {{are found in}} the mounded prairie region, typically around vernal pools. The Pacific tree frog lives in large numbers on the rocks, while tadpoles of the rarer western toad can be seen between March and May. Mammals such as California voles, Heermann's kangaroo rats, raccoons, and long-tailed weasels can also be found in this region. The <b>western</b> <b>meadowlark</b> and two species of sparrows are the most common types of birds that are seen in the area.

5|$|Oregon's House {{chamber floor}} {{is covered with}} a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern {{incorporates}} a depiction of the state tree, Douglas-fir, representative of forestry. The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden oak. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 Champoeg Meetings at which the provisional government was formed, is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use black walnut for the paneling and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring Chinook salmon and wheat, representative of fishing and agriculture. The Senate's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in friezes, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On {{the second floor of the}} capitol is the Governor's suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state's chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the paneling is of black walnut. The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species. This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird (<b>western</b> <b>meadowlark).</b>|$|E

25|$|Montana {{schoolchildren}} {{played a}} significant role in selecting several state symbols. The state tree, the ponderosa pine, was selected by Montana schoolchildren as the preferred state tree by an overwhelming majority in a referendum held in 1908. However, the legislature did not designate a state tree until 1949, when the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs, with the support of the state forester, lobbied for formal recognition. Schoolchildren also chose the <b>western</b> <b>meadowlark</b> as the state bird, in a 1930 vote, and the legislature acted to endorse this decision in 1931. Similarly, the secretary of state sponsored a children's vote in 1981 to choose a state animal, and after 74 animals were nominated, the grizzly bear won over the elk by a 2–1 margin. The students of Livingston started a statewide school petition drive plus lobbied the governor and the state legislature to name the Maiasaura as the state fossil in 1985.|$|E

40|$|The {{abundance}} and habitat associations of overwintering birds in Platte River Valley of central Nebraska may influence their long-term survival. I observed {{a total of}} 51 species {{over a three-year period}} in shrub-grassland, forest, grassland, and cropland habitats during the winter. Grassland habitats had the lowest abundance of wintering birds, while abundances in shrub-grassland, forest, and cropland habitats were higher and similar. Species richness was highest in forests (x= 2. 97 species) and lowest in grasslands (x = 0. 73 species) and croplands (x = 0. 57 species). Overall, horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea), black-capped chickadees (Parus atricapillus), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), <b>western</b> <b>meadowlarks</b> (Sturnella neglects), and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most abundant wintering birds in the Platte River Valley. American tree sparrows (34 %) accounted for most of the birds in shrub-grasslands, while black-capped chickadees (18 %), dark-eyed juncos (11 %), and American tree sparrows (10 %) accounted for most of the birds in forests. Grasslands were dominated by American tree sparrows (39 %) and <b>western</b> <b>meadowlarks</b> (27 %), and croplands were dominated by horned larks (43 %), red-winged blackbirds (25 %), and <b>western</b> <b>meadowlarks</b> (16 %). The winter bird community in the Platte River Valley is dominated by woodland-associated species. Many of the woodland-associated species that overwinter in the Platte River Valley have likely benefited from the development of woodlands in the region...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{has been}} implicated {{as a major}} cause of population decline in grassland birds. We tested the hypothesis that a combination of area and shape determines the use of grassland patches by breeding birds. We compared both species richness and individual species presence in 45 wet meadow grasslands in the floodplain of the central Platte River, Nebraska. Bird data were collected through the use of belt transects and supplemented by walking and listening outside transects. Our data supported our primary hypothesis that perimeter–area ratio, which reflects both the area and shape of a patch, is the strongest predictor of both individual species presence and overall species richness. The probability of occurrence for all six common species (Grasshopper Sparrows, Bobolinks, Upland Sandpipers, <b>Western</b> <b>Meadowlarks,</b> Dickcissels, and Red-winged Blackbirds) was significantly inversely correlated with perimeter–area ratio. The probability of occurrence of Grasshopper Sparrows, Bobolinks, Upland Sandpipers, and <b>Western</b> <b>Meadowlarks</b> was also correlated with area. We conclude that species richness is maximized when patches are large (3 ̆e 50 ha) and shaped so that they provide abundant interior areas, free from the impacts of edges...|$|R
