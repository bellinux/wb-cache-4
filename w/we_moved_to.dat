The pilot episode was mostly shot at various locations in and around New York City including the Silvercup Studios, where principal photography lasted for two days. Most of the production crew were previously part of The Sopranos. After filming concluded in New York, production moved to the Los Angeles Center Studios. Abraham collaborated with an entirely different production crew from the one in New York. According to Abraham, Los Angeles contained a continuity that {{was related to the}} show.

Trey Spruance said the change in {{location}} influenced the band's style, remarking [...] " [...] Slayer and Mercyful Fate. Later it was The Specials and Fishbone. Then <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> San Francisco and got all sophisticated. Now we are improv snobs who rule the avant-garde universe by night, and poor, fucked-up hipsters by day." [...] Having established a following in Northern California, Mr. Bungle was signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1990, with the label releasing all three of their studio albums during the 1990s. It has been speculated that Patton's success as frontman of Faith No More was the primary reason Warner Bros. signed the band.

Love also stated that [...] "half the fucking songs were written in the studio." [...] According to Love, the songwriting process for the album was [...] "really easy": [...] "We started at [...] Jabberjaw. I wrote [...] "Violet" [...] there. Then <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Seattle in the middle of that. [...] "Miss World" [...] was written in Seattle, if I remember correctly... We had this great rehearsal space : It was just perfect, up on Capitol Hill, near the Urban Outfitters. Everyone got really close. There was just a great flow." [...] Love also stated that she had been listening to The Breeders, Pixies, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Joy Division while recording the album, and that their work had acted as primary influences on her at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Hal was memorialized with {{a chapter}} in the memoir written by his more famous mother, Ella Reeve Bloor, in 1940: [...] As a boy he loved the outdoors, was full of restless, eager {{vitality}} and bold curiosity. He had a startlingly vivid imagination, and an urge and talent for organizing that continued and marked his whole life. More than ordinarily shy, he forgot his shyness when engaged {{in one of his}} organizing ventures, and a flow of colorful, stirring talk would come from him so persuasive that those who heard him were completely carried away. He grew slim and tall, and when <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Arden was captain of the baseball team and a leader in tennis and other games. He missed a lot of school because of his siege of tuberculosis, but he read a lot and was always able to make up two or three years of ordinary schooling in a few months of intensive study. His interest in socialism began as early as I can remember.|$|E

After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to Montgomery, Alabama, in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: [...] "After we married, <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Montgomery, Alabama, where my husband had accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before long, we found ourselves {{in the middle of}} the Montgomery bus boycott, and Martin was elected leader of the protest movement. As the boycott continued, I had a growing sense that I was involved in something so much greater than myself, something of profound historic importance. I came to the realization that we had been thrust into the forefront of a movement to liberate oppressed people, not only in Montgomery but also throughout our country, and this movement had worldwide implications. I felt blessed to have been called to be a part of such a noble and historic cause." ...|$|E
