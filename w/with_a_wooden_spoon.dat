25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era, despite {{an influx of}} excellent new players, Richmond struggled to make the four, appearing in the finals only once, in 1947. Dyer continued on as coach for three years after his playing retirement {{at the end of}} 1949, but was asked to retire by the committee who felt the club needed a shake up. Under a succession of coaches in the 1950s, With the demands of potential players increasing with each passing year, the club refused to allocate sufficient funds to recruit and they failed to replace star players as they retired. When stalwarts such as Des Rowe and dual-Brownlow Medallist Roy Wright left, the team slumped dramatically and finished <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> in 1960.|$|E
500|$|The storm scene {{which forms}} {{the centre of}} the opera is an {{extended}} passacaglia, the theme of which uses the entire chromatic scale. In a long instrumental introduction, full rein is given to the various elements of the children's orchestra. Slung mugs struck <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> give the sound of the first raindrops. Trills in the recorders represent the wind, strings impersonate waves, while [...] piano chords outline the flood leitmotiv. The sound builds to a peak with thunder and lightning from the percussion. When [...] "Eternal Father" [...] is sung at the climax of the storm, the passacaglia theme provides the bass line for the hymn. After the hymn, the minor-key fury of the passacaglia gradually subsides, resolving into what Roseberry describes as [...] "a dewy, pastoral F major" [...] akin to that of the finale of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony. Noye's reappearance is followed by the brief waltzes for the Raven, accompanied by solo cello, and the Dove, the latter a flutter-tongued recorder solo the melody of which is reversed when the Dove returns.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} 18 months of her {{association}} with Britten, Imogen kept a diary which, Grogan says, forms {{a record of}} her [...] "unconditional belief in Britten's achievement and status, and her absolute devotion to his work". The first of Britten's works to which she made a significant contribution was the opera Gloriana, scheduled to form part of the 1953 Coronation celebrations. The short timescale for {{the writing of the}} opera placed considerable pressure on the composer and his new assistant, [...] strains that were dramatised 60 years later in a radio play, Imo and Ben. Imogen's main task with Gloriana was to copy Britten's pencil sketches and prepare the vocal and piano scores which the singers needed for rehearsals by February 1953. Later she assisted him with the writing of the full orchestral score, and performed similar services with his next opera, The Turn of the Screw (1954). When Britten was under pressure during the composition of his ballet The Prince of the Pagodas (1956), Imogen accompanied him to Switzerland, to remain by his side as he completed the work. [...] Imogen took great pleasure in her association with Britten's [...] opera for children, Noye's Fludde (1957), for which she showed Britten how to achieve a unique raindrop effect by hitting a row of china mugs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon.</b> She and Britten combined to collect and publish music for the recorder, in a series published by Boosey and Hawkes (1954–59), and jointly wrote a popular introductory book, The Story of Music (1958).|$|E

60|$|At last I got to {{the truth}} of the matter. It {{appeared}} that Alphonse habitually cooked Umslopogaas's porridge, which the latter ate for breakfast {{in the corner of the}} courtyard, just as he would have done at home in Zululand, from a gourd, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon.</b> Now Umslopogaas had, like many Zulus, a great horror of fish, which he considered a species of water-snake; so Alphonse, who was as fond of playing tricks as a monkey, and who was also a consummate cook, determined to make him eat some. Accordingly he grated up a quantity of white fish very finely, and mixed it with the Zulu's porridge, who swallowed it nearly all down in ignorance of what he was eating. But, unfortunately for Alphonse, he could not restrain his joy at this sight, and came capering and peering round, till at last Umslopogaas, who was very clever in his way, suspected something, and, after a careful examination of the remains of his porridge, discovered 'the buffalo heifer's trick', and, in revenge, served him as I have said. Indeed, the little man was fortunate not to get a broken neck for his pains; for, as one would have thought, he might have learnt from the episode of his display of axemanship that 'le Monsieur noir' was an ill person to play practical jokes upon.|$|E

50|$|Weidemenn’s {{replacement}} was former Hawthorn (AFL) premiership {{player from}} 1991 Andrew Collins. Unfortunately Collins couldn’t improve {{the results in}} 2008 and the club finished <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unwanted fourth <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> in <b>a</b> row, an ignominy suffered previously by Sturt (1989 to 1996), Woodville (1980 to 1985), South Adelaide (1926 to 1929), Glenelg (1937 to 1940 and 1921 to 1925) and Norwood (1913 to 1919), but never despite several bleak eras by the Bloods. Strong recruiting helped the team improve to sixth in 2009 while James Ezard, nephew of 1984 and 1985 Essendon premiership player Alan Ezard, jointly won the Magarey Medal with North Adelaide’s Rhys Archard, becoming the fourteenth West Adelaide player to win the award.|$|R

50|$|The {{utensils}} of the Grass-fields {{were used}} by the entire fabric of society from the Kings (Fons) to the commoners. However there were distinctions to what was meant for the Fons and the common man or peasants. It was customary in the Grass-fields for the Fons {{to have the best}} in terms of quality, beauty, aesthetics, and symbolism. Twins for instance in the Nso’ and Wimbum tribes had special containers in which palm oil meant for their food was preserved. In Nso’ <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of polygamous homes, the family head (father) of the household kept the container in which palm oil was stored. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> specially fashioned <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> he dished out palm oil which he sent through his little children who came into his living quarter with small clay pots from their mothers when it was cooking time.|$|R
60|$|She {{moved quickly}} {{away to the}} fire, and {{presently}} returned <b>with</b> <b>an</b> earthenware dish of roasted pumpkin and sweet potatoes and, kneeling at my side, fed me deftly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon.</b> I did not feel grieved at the absence of meat and the stinging condiments the Indians love, nor did I even remark {{that there was no}} salt in the vegetables, so much was I taken up with watching her beautiful delicate face while she ministered to me. The exquisite fragrance of her breath was more to me than the most delicious viands could have been; and it was a delight each time she raised the spoon to my mouth to catch a momentary glimpse of her eyes, which now looked dark as wine when we lift the glass to see the ruby gleam of light within the purple. But she never for a moment laid aside the silent, meek, constrained manner; and when I remembered her bursting out in her brilliant wrath on me, pouring forth that torrent of stinging invective in her mysterious language, I was lost in wonder and admiration at the change in her, and at her double personality. Having satisfied my wants, she moved quietly away and, raising a straw mat, disappeared behind it into her own sleeping-apartment, which was divided off by a partition from the room I was in.|$|R
2500|$|According to Anna Marie West, {{both she}} and Charmaine were {{frequently}} subjected to criticism, beatings, {{and other forms of}} punishment throughout the time they lived under Rose's care at Midland Road, but although she (Anna Marie) was generally submissive and prone to display emotion in relation to the physical and mental hardships she and her sister endured, Charmaine repeatedly infuriated Rose by her stoic refusal to either cry or display any sign of grief or servitude no matter how severely she was beaten or to what punishment she was subjected. Despite the years of neglect and abuse she had endured, Charmaine's spirit had not been broken, and she would talk wistfully to Anna Marie of the belief she held her [...] "mummy will come and save me". Anna Marie would later recollect her sister would repeatedly antagonise Rose by making statements such as: [...] "My real mummy wouldn't swear or shout at us" [...] in response to Rose's scathing profanities. A childhood friend of Charmaine's who had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road named Tracey Giles would later recollect an incident in which she had entered the Wests' flat, unannounced, only to see Charmaine, naked and standing upon a chair, gagged and with her hands bound behind her back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> belt, as Rose stood alongside the child <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> in her hand.

500|$|For {{the first}} time in any of his works {{involving}} amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as [...] "the professional stiffening" [...] of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led {{by a member of the}} professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper ("two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together"), and [...] "Slung Mugs", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spoon, but having failed to make this work, he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that [...] "by great good fortune I had once had to teach Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into my kitchen and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon.</b>|$|R
