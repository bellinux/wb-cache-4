5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} {{over whether the}} object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{supported}} The New York Times in its 1971 {{suit against}} the government, requesting permission to publish the Pentagon papers. The court upheld the Times and ACLU in the New York Times Co. v. United States ruling, which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information and had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> it was published to take action.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
50|$|US Season 3, {{filmed in}} New York, took a looser {{documentary}} format. Stilwell sometimes implements a technique {{as soon as}} she sees a behavior rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the Confrontation.|$|R
5000|$|Young Victor fell in {{love with}} and became {{secretly}} engaged to his childhood friend [...] (1803-1868), against his mother's wishes. Because of his close relationship with his mother, Hugo <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> her death (in 1821) to marry [...] in 1822.|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} survey {{research}} {{to capture the}} attitudes of 25 Midwestern university students on <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> college graduation to get married. Results indicate that participants feel that <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> college graduation to get married {{would lead to a}} more successful marriage. Results also indicated that students believe a higher education can lead to increased employment opportunities and financial stability and that the older a person marries the less likely they will get divorced. It is hoped that this information is utilized to help educate young adults on the benefits of <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> later in life to get married. This study enhances the knowledge base on the attitudes of young adults and marriage. The next step in research could be to compare the sexes to ascertain any gender differences...|$|R
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield, {{commander}} of the Department of Washington, argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied {{as soon as possible}} in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> Virginia voted for or against secession.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1970, Stewart {{suggested}} to Wilson {{that they should}} formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the Privy Council. Wilson resolved to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the British general election the following month. This decision proved decisive for Beadle as, {{to the surprise of}} many, the Conservatives won the election, and Edward Heath replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. Heath's government decided against removing Beadle from the Privy Council, surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith. Beadle remained a Privy Counsellor {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
50|$|De Caro {{was arrested}} soon after {{investigations}} began in 2012. Investigations showed that vehicle-loads of books {{had been removed}} and sold by the now-convicted criminals, who had <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> normal working hours, turned off the rudimentary CCTV system, and then proceeded with their looting.|$|R
5000|$|During a 2008 show in Boston, Burnham {{joked that}} the song [...] "Sunday School"—wherein he adopts the persona of an [...] "overly exuberant" [...] Sunday school teacher—was {{the reason he}} <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> graduating from the all-boys Catholic high school, St. John's Preparatory, before {{releasing}} his EP.|$|R
60|$|He <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> dark, {{and then}} he crawled, with utmost difficulty, from the deep pit. He had heard nothing of the natives since the night before, and now, in the open, there came to him but the faint sounds of the village life across the clearing.|$|R
5|$|The couple put {{extra effort}} into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he could spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E
5|$|The {{interviews}} helped improve Nixon's financial position—at {{one point}} in early 1975 he had only $500 in the bank—as did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such as Bebe Rebozo. In February 1976, Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao. Nixon had wanted to return to China, but chose to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> Ford's own visit in 1975. Nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan. Ford won, but was defeated by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in the general election. The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia, causing the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to withhold its official invitation.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E

Willie doesn't hesitate a moment, he draws his throwing knife and throws it.|$|R
5|$|Given that merger {{involved}} the breach of guarantees personally given by Mountbatten, initially Patel and Nehru intended to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> his term as Governor-General ended. An adivasi uprising in Orissa in late 1947, however, forced their hand. In December 1947, princes from the Eastern India Agency and Chhattisgarh Agency were summoned to an all-night meeting with Menon, {{where they were}} persuaded to sign Merger Agreements integrating their states into Orissa, the Central Provinces and Bihar with effect from 1 January 1948. Later that year, 66 states in Gujarat and the Deccan were merged into Bombay, including the large states of Kolhapur and Baroda. Other small states were merged into Madras, East Punjab, West Bengal, the United Provinces and Assam. Not all states that signed Merger Agreements were integrated into provinces, however. Thirty states of the former Punjab Hill States Agency which lay near the international border and had signed Merger Agreements were integrated into Himachal Pradesh, a distinct entity which was administered directly by the centre as a Chief Commissioner's Province, for reasons of security.|$|E
5|$|Speedie {{was drafted}} by the National Football League's Detroit Lions in the late rounds of the 1942 draft. Fred Mandel, {{the owner of the}} Lions, visited him at Fort Warren and offered a {{contract}} worth $2,800 a year. Speedie wanted to sign immediately, but Mandel preferred to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the war. By the time the war drew to a close in 1945, however, Speedie was considering signing with the Chicago Rockets, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He was pursued by the Rockets after playing well against a team at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro from which many of the Rockets' players were drawn. Speedie was also spotted by Paul Brown, who had been the head coach of a military team at Great Lakes Naval Station that played against the Broncos. Brown, who was starting a new AAFC team called the Cleveland Browns, sent a friend named Jackie Ranen to sign Speedie for $7,000 in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The ACC Championship Game {{traditionally}} {{matches the}} winner of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Prior to 2005, no championship game existed. The idea for a championship game originated with the league's 2004expansion, which added former Big East members Miami, Virginia Tech, and (in 2005) Boston College. A request to the National Collegiate Athletic Association by conference officials to hold a championship game following the 2004 season was rejected because the ACC lacked the requisite 12teams, and so the league's first championship game had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> Boston College's addition, which had been delayed at the school's request. With the addition of Boston College, the ACC consisted of 12 teams, allowing it to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules. Before the start of the 2005 season, both Virginia Tech and Florida State were picked as pre-season favorites to play in the championship game in an annual poll conducted by members of the media who cover the ACC.|$|E

50|$|In April 2005 he tore his {{anterior}} cruciate ligament in his knee. Unlike in tennis or basketball, cycling doesn't require lateral stability because the athlete doesn't {{need to be able}} to stop or launch himself sideways.

A small number of post-operative transgender women take low doses of testosterone to boost their libido. Many pre-operative transgender women <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> reassignment surgery to begin an active sex life. Raising the dosage of estrogen or adding a progestogen raises the libido of some transgender women.|$|E
50|$|After Yugoslavia {{normalized}} {{relations with}} the Soviet Union, Goli otok prison passed to the provincial jurisdiction of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (as opposed to the Yugoslav federal authorities). Regardless, the prison remained a taboo topic in Yugoslavia. Antonije Isaković wrote the novel Tren (Moment) about the prison in 1979, <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> Josip Broz's death in 1980 to release it. The book became an instant bestseller.|$|R

In Åstorp, Kommunens framtid was formed in January 2002 {{as a replacement for}} the Progress Party for the 2002 elections. By 1997 the Progress Party had likely no more than 300 members.|$|R
50|$|Although each {{situation}} will vary, {{one of the}} primary reasons for seeking the appointment of an interim examiner is to facilitate him commencing his work immediately rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the full hearing.
