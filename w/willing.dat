5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens.

When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were <b>willing</b> to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although <b>willing</b> to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not <b>willing</b> to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
