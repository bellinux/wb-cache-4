5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia <b>was</b> <b>spectacular,</b> they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} a shootout and Eli Manning <b>was</b> <b>spectacular,</b> {{completing}} 29 of 34 passes, 4 of them touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|Monty Panesar also {{demonstrated}} his promising talent, taking 3 wickets {{in the second}} innings {{to follow up on}} 3 wickets in the first, on a pitch not typically associated with assisting spinners. His dismissal of Younis Khan during the afternoon session <b>was</b> <b>spectacular,</b> with a wonderfully flighted delivery that just clipped the bail of the off stump.|$|E

25|$|The landing {{approach}} using runway 13 at Kai Tak <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> and world-famous. To land on runway 13, {{an aircraft}} first took a descent heading northeast. The aircraft would {{pass over the}} crowded harbour, and then the very densely populated areas of Western Kowloon. This leg of the approach was guided by an IGS (Instrument Guidance System, a modified ILS) after 1974.|$|E
25|$|The 1936 race <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> for the crashes that it produced, {{because for}} the first time riders were {{required}} to negotiate everyday winding streets rather than the smooth bends of a motor-racing course. Stallard finished 17th and inspired by what he had ridden. There were more races on car circuits and airfields – Stallard won the last race at Brooklands, in 1939 – but to Stallard they were just a shadow of the real thing.|$|E
25|$|The Whalers {{went on to}} {{face the}} Boston Bruins {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. In Game 4, the Whalers were in front of their home crowd with a two games to one series lead and a 5–2 lead in the game {{entering}} the third period. Bruins starting goaltender Reggie Lemelin was struggling throughout the series and was replaced by backup Andy Moog in the third period. At the same time, Peter Sidorkiewicz began struggling in goal for the Whalers, and the Bruins scored four unanswered goals in the third period, winning the game 6–5. Sidorkiewicz struggled for the rest of the series and Moog <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> for the Bruins. Without Liut, the Whalers had to either stick with Sidorkiewicz, which they did, or use the unproven rookie, Kay Whitmore, in goal. Goaltending turned out to be one of the big differences in this series and the Bruins won it in seven games. The Bruins went on to dispose of the Canadiens in five games, then sweep the Capitals in the Wales Conference Finals before losing in the Stanley Cup finals to the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E

25|$|With the {{deterioration}} of the yellow Northerner stock, cars to replace these had to be found by sourcing {{from the rest of the}} NZR 56-foot carriage fleet. The change in service was marked, with a refurbished modular Mitsubishi FM van turned power-luggage van with handbrake end-mounted 11kW petrol generator, and three carriages, one from the Endeavour Express and later Southerner Express converted into a servery car seating 31 in reupholstered Addington Workshops-produced seats, in bays of four with two pairs of seats each facing into a table, arranged alcove-style, with windows over double the size of the old ones, enabling better views of the alpine scenery, reupholstered seats and carpet, and a buffet counter service, to replace refreshment stops at railway station cafeterias at Springfield and Otira. The original intention had been to replace each pair of windows with one larger window, but the final solution was to cut out the side of the cars and to insert a steel ladder frame to which sheets of strengthened glass were glued. The effect, of a continuous sheet of glass the length of the carriage, <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> and undoubtedly was a major factor in the success of the new service. The other two cars were red Picton - Greymouth cars that were refitted and repainted to the same standard but retained their smaller windows and seated 50, same seating arrangement and type as the servery car.|$|E
500|$|In Australia The King's Speech {{made more}} than A$6,281,686 (£4million) {{in the first two}} weeks, {{according}} to figures collected by the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia. The executive director of Palace Cinemas, Benjamin Zeccola, said customer feedback on the film <b>was</b> <b>spectacular.</b> [...] "It's our No.1 for all the period, all throughout the country.... I think this is more successful than Slumdog Millionaire and a more uplifting film. It's a good example of a film that started out in the independent cinemas and then spread to the mainstream cinemas." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the American {{broadcast}} of Jesus: The Complete Story were also mixed. While some reviewers described {{the show as}} fascinating and reverent, others were more negative. Writing for The Orlando Sentinel, Hal Boedeker agreed that the computer imaging <b>was</b> <b>spectacular,</b> but {{that the rest of}} the show was a [...] "hodgepodge" [...] that [...] " [...] off on some strange tangents". Eric Mink of The Daily News stated that the show relied too heavily on exaggeration and that it was [...] "sloppy with facts", while Ann Rodgers-Melnick of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described it as [...] "uneven but vivid".|$|E

500|$|In {{the hopes}} of running the {{railroad}} {{through the rest of}} the Black Canyon, Palmer sent his top engineer Bryan Bryant on an inner canyon exploration. Bryant set off with a 12-man crew in December 1882 expecting to complete the survey in 20 days; he returned in 68. [...] "Eight of the twelve-man crew left after a few days, terrified of the task in front of them. What the rest of the men saw <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> and had never been seen by another human." [...] Bryant reported that the Black Canyon was impenetrable, and that it was impossible to build anything in its depths.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé discussed how excited she was about the collaboration stating, [...] "I loved working with Alejandro on 'Amor Gitano.' When I was asked to record with him, I immediately said 'yes.' He is extremely talented." [...] Alejandro Fernández stated that as the production [...] and recording of his album was nearly over, {{he was told that}} Beyoncé wanted to record a duet with a Latino male for her next album. He stated: [...] "So when they suggested it, I liked the idea. I thought it <b>was</b> <b>spectacular.</b> So we went, I gave her the song and she liked it [...] We recorded it in one day. She seemed like a fine lady to me, very humble, with a great voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Among the deputies, Saint-Just was watchful but interacted {{little at}} first. He joined the Parisian Jacobin Club but he {{remained}} aloof from Girondins and Montagnards alike. He waited until 13 November 1792 {{to give his}} first speech to the Convention, but when he did the effect <b>was</b> <b>spectacular.</b> What {{brought him to the}} lectern was the discussion over how to treat the king after Varennes. In dramatic contrast to the earlier speakers, Saint-Just delivered a blazing condemnation of the king. He demanded that [...] "Louis Capet" [...] should be judged not as a king or even a citizen, but as a traitor, an enemy who deserves death. [...] "As for me," [...] he declared, [...] "I see no middle ground: this man must reign or die! He oppressed a free nation; he declared himself its enemy; he abused the laws: he must die to assure the repose of the people, since it was in his mind to crush the people to assure his own.” ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years the Chicago Marathon was held in August. [...] It has from its {{inception}} with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers {{been one of the}} nation's largest marathons. [...] The 2000 running was second only to New York. [...] The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. [...] The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer. [...] By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons. [...] In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's). [...] The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. [...] The 1985 race <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> with Steve Jones breaking his own course record (2 seconds short of the world record) and Joan Benoit Samuelson the 1984 Olympic Champion, two-time defending Chicago Marathon Champion and Olympic Bronze Medalist, Rosa Mota and the fourth place Olympic finisher and world record setting Ingrid Kristiansen. [...] Benoit set a record that stood nearly a generation. [...] At that time, it was considered the premier marathon in the United States, if not the world. [...] Although 1986 had 40 world-class runners among the 8,000 participants the times paled in comparison. Beatrice dropped out as a sponsor in 1987. Because of this only a half-marathon race was held that year and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988 and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon. [...] The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions. [...] In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned. [...] In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank. In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon. [...] In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty. In 1998, the race began using transponder timing. [...] In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women's world record marathon time, both the men's and women's then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon. [...] For 2008, the race was sponsored by Bank of America following the purchase of LaSalle Bank from ABN Amro to Bank of America, and the new title will be in use.|$|E
2500|$|The game most {{prominently}} featured a duel between star German centers. The Michigan Alumnus wrote: [...] "'Germany' Schulz was {{far and away}} the star of the game. [...] In his usual style he was in every play, tackling runners for loss, falling on the ball in fumbles, and opening wide holes in the line for Michigan gains[...] [...] [...] e showed conclusively that he has no equal in the keystone position." [...] A Nashville source wrote [...] "In the duel of centers, Stone of Vanderbilt, had the best of [...] "Germany" [...] Schulz. Michigan's massive center. Stone's play <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> all the way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allmenröder {{transferred}} to the air service on 16 March 1916, {{at the same time}} as his brother Wilhelm. Karl Allmenröder trained at Halberstadt. He flew two-seaters as an artillery spotter in Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie): [...] 227 before joining Jagdstaffel 11 in November 1916. After Manfred von Richthofen assumed command in January, 1917, Jasta 11 became one of the premier squadrons of the German Flying Service. Allmenröder rose in the pantheon of Jasta 11 stars. His career as a fighter ace <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> but short, lasting from 16 February to 26 June 1917. He achieved his victories flying a scarlet Albatros D.III with white nose and elevators.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of winning a Student Academy Award at USC for his film, A Field of Honor, Zemeckis came to the {{attention}} of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg said, [...] "He barged right past my secretary and sat me down and showed me this student film...and I thought it <b>was</b> <b>spectacular,</b> with police cars and a riot, all dubbed to Elmer Bernstein's score for The Great Escape." [...] Spielberg became Zemeckis's mentor and executive produced his first two films, both of which Zemeckis co-wrote with Gale. He later executive produced other Zemeckis films, including the Back to the Future trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.|$|E
2500|$|One {{newspaper}} noted: [...] "Michigan, {{with the}} exception of one or two double passes, relied almost altogether on straight football, line bucking and runs around the end. Chicago, on the contrary, used trick plays throughout but the team work was of a high order, as shown by both teams." [...] After the game, Michigan's team captain, J.W.F. Bennett, told reporters: [...] "Widman's sensational run was the feature of the game, but every player deserves the victory. [...] We must thank Keene Fitzpatrick for our splendid condition." [...] Chicago coach Amos Alonzo Stagg said: [...] "It was perhaps the finest game of football ever played in the West. [...] It certainly <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> and full of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Boxing Day Faugheen {{returned}} to winning {{ways in the}} Christmas Hurdle after his first run of the season where a hard prep work with only few days prior of Morgiana Hurdle and the waiting tactics behind a sedate pace, later emerged as causes for the defeat with Willie Mullins claiming that Faugheen [...] "gallop before Punchestown <b>was</b> <b>spectacular</b> so I won't let him do that again". He became the fifth horse since 1969 to win back-to-back renewals of the Christmas Hurdle and faced four adversaries that included the best British hurdler The New One and Old Guard who {{was looking for a}} fourth consecutive victory after taking the Greatwood Hurdle and Bula Hurdle in his previous starts. Faugheen led all the way and approaching the last hurdle he pulled clear of the rest and won by seven lengths without being extended by Ruby Walsh who was relieved of the outcome: [...] "Yes, that was old Faugheen. I caught hold of him going to the second last, he pinged it and then he quickened really, really well." ...|$|E
