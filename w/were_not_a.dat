5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was secular {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> {{practical}} necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two secular cathedrals {{range from the}} processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E

5|$|In May 1943 Albert Speer, the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production, {{informed}} Adolf Hitler of {{work that}} was being carried out to produce a supergun capable of firing hundreds of shells an hour over long distances. The newly designed gun, codenamed the Hochdruckpumpe ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short) and later designated as the V-3, {{was one of the}} V-weapons– Vergeltungswaffen ("retaliation weapons")– developed by Nazi Germany in the later stages of the war to attack Allied targets. Long-range guns <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> new development, but the high-pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous such weapons, including the Paris gun, rapidly wore out their barrels.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E

5|$|Lucas {{eventually}} {{negotiated a}} deal to produce Radioland Murders for Universal shortly after the successful release of American Graffiti in late 1973. Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz prepared a rough draft based on Lucas's 1974 film treatment, and Universal was confident enough to announce pre-production soon after. Lucas was set to direct with Gary Kurtz producing. In the original Huyck/Katz script, Roger and Penny <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> married couple seeking divorce, but were boyfriend and girlfriend with a love-hate relationship.

5|$|Mulla Sadra (c. 1571/2 – 1640) was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher who was {{influenced}} by earlier Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna and Suhrawardi, {{as well as the}} Sufi metaphysician Ibn 'Arabi. Sadra discussed Avicenna's arguments for the existence of God, claiming that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> priori. He rejected the argument on the basis that existence precedes essence, or that the existence of human beings is more fundamental than their essence.|$|E

He was still under contract, and Fuchs refused to release him. So Manager Stengel resigned, which President Stengel accepted, and the president then released Stengel {{as a player and}} resigned. Fuchs was outraged, and went to Judge Landis, who advised him to let the matter go.|$|E

5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that her helmet was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the helmet, and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in the helmet <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> separate piece affixed to the helmet, expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} the helmet, which made the helmet legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E

5|$|The {{published}} work was criticised {{on the grounds}} that the unmodified potatoes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same. In an interview, Pickett later said that Lancet editor Richard Horton must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.|$|E
