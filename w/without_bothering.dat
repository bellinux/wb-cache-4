5|$|The 1974 Portuguese Carnation Revolution {{against the}} authoritarian Estado Novo {{returned}} Portugal to a multi-party system and facilitated {{the independence of}} the Portuguese colonies Angola and East Timor. In Africa, where Angolan rebels had waged a multi-faction independence war against Portuguese rule since 1961, a two-decade civil war replaced the anti-colonial struggle as fighting erupted between the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by the Cubans and the Soviets, and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), backed by the United States, the People's Republic of China, and Mobutu's government in Zaire. The United States, the apartheid government of South Africa, and several other African governments also supported a third faction, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). <b>Without</b> <b>bothering</b> to consult the Soviets in advance, the Cuban government sent a number of combat troops to fight alongside the MPLA. Foreign mercenaries and a South African armoured column were deployed to support UNITA, but the MPLA, bolstered by Cuban personnel and Soviet assistance, eventually gained the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|The regime did {{not limit}} {{itself to a}} purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled {{prominent}} Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech; they disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests {{that he could not}} be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.|$|E
5|$|From Ancyra, the Abbasid army {{turned to}} Amorium, {{to which they}} laid siege on 1 August. Al-Afshin, Itakh, and Ashinas all took turns assaulting the city with their troops, but the siege was {{fiercely}} contested, even after the Abbasids, informed by a defector, effected a breach in a weak spot of the wall. After two weeks, however, {{taking advantage of a}} short truce for negotiations requested by one of the Byzantine commanders of the breach, the Abbasid army stormed the city. The city was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed, while the populace, numbering into the tens of thousands, was carried off to be sold into slavery. According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when the conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was uncovered. Al-Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> with Theophilos and his forces, encamped in nearby Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E

25|$|Ribbentrop {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} on his own, for example {{when he visited}} France and met Foreign Minister Louis Barthou. During their meeting, Ribbentrop suggested that Barthou meet Hitler at once to sign a Franco-German non-aggression pact. Ribbentrop wanted to buy time to complete German rearmament by removing preventive war as a French policy option. The Barthou-Ribbentrop meeting infuriated Neurath because the two had met <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to inform the Foreign Office beforehand.|$|E

25|$|On 29 October, Hill {{received}} Wellington's positive {{order to}} abandon Madrid and march to join him. After a clash with Soult's advance guard at Perales de Tajuña on the 30th, Hill broke contact and withdrew {{in the direction}} of Alba de Tormes. Joseph re-entered his capital on 2 November. Anxious to destroy the British, Joseph rushed after them <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to leave a garrison in Madrid. The Allied retreat continued until Wellington and Hill joined forces on 8 November near Alba de Tormes. On 15 November, Soult's 80,000 Frenchmen faced Wellington's 65,000 Allies on the old Salamanca battlefield. To the disappointment of many French soldiers and generals, Soult declined to attack. Wellington began retiring west that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|From the 1902 season, Johnson began {{appearing}} in County Championship matches for Somerset. His qualification {{for the county}} would {{appear to have been}} fairly flimsy: there is a story, which is also told of a later Somerset cricketer, Tom Lowry, that the county put his birthplace down as Wellington, which was true, <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to volunteer that it was not, in fact, the town of that name in Somerset. Employed as a stockbroker, he had time for fairly regular appearances in 1902 and 1903, fewer in 1904 and 1905, and then more again in 1906. From then until the First World War, Johnson appeared in only a handful of matches in each season, but for five seasons from 1921 to 1925 he was nearly always in the Somerset side, finally retiring after a few unsuccessful matches in 1927.|$|E

25|$|In January 1855 Wagner {{proceeded}} to compose the full score <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> {{to write an}} intermediate instrumentation draft {{as he had done}} for Das Rheingold. This was a decision he was soon to regret, as numerous interruptions made the task of orchestrating the Gesamtentwurf an exceedingly difficult one. If he allowed too much time to elapse between the initial drafting of a passage and its later elaboration, he found that he could not remember how he had intended to orchestrate the draft. Consequently, some passages had to be composed again from scratch. Wagner, nevertheless, persevered with the task and the full score was finally completed on 20 March 1856. The fair copy was begun on 14 July 1855 in the Swiss resort of Seelisberg, where Wagner and his wife spent a month. It was completed in Zürich on 23 March 1856, just three days after the completion of the full score.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Wellesley {{landed with}} a British army at Figueira da Foz {{near the end}} of July and pressed south. On 21 August 1808, Junot {{attacked}} Wellesley's numerically superior army in the Battle of Vimeiro. Loison's division included three battalions of Jean-Baptiste Solignac's brigade and two battalions of Hugues Charlot's brigade, a total of 4,140 bayonets. The French commander planned to hurl Loison's division and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières' brigade of Henri François Delaborde's division at Vimeiro village while sending Delaborde's second brigade under Antoine François Brenier to envelop the British left flank. After reconsidering, Junot detached Solignac's men from Loison and also sent them against the British left, <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to inform Brenier. The French attacks were defeated one after another. Junot even committed his grenadier reserve and saw it repulsed as well. In the subsequent Convention of Sintra, the French agreed to evacuate Portugal if the British transported them back to France.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, the Bundestag {{passed a}} Misdemeanors Bill dealing with traffic misdemeanors, into which a {{high-ranking}} civil servant named Dr. Eduard Dreher {{who had been}} drafting the bill inserted a prefatory section to the bill under a very misleading heading that declared that henceforth there was a statute of limitations of 15 years {{from the time of}} the offense for the crime of being an accomplices to murder which was to apply retroactively, which made it impossible to prosecute war criminals even for being accomplices to murder since the statute of limitations as now defined for the last of the suspects had expired by 1960. The Bundestag passed the Misdemeanors Bill <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to read the bill in its entirety so its members missed Dreher's amendment. It was estimated in 1969 that thanks to Dreher's amendment to the Misdemeanors Bill that 90% of all Nazi war criminals now enjoyed total immunity from prosecution. The prosecutor Adalbert Rückerl who headed the Central Bureau for the Prosecution of National Socialist Crimes told an interviewer in 1969 that this amendment had done immense harm to the ability of the Bureau to prosecute those suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E

25|$|On October 1, {{the insurgents}} started to battle in Rancagua {{in an attempt}} to prevent the expeditionaries from taking Santiago, Chile. Maroto, manifesting a disdain for his opponents typical of {{officials}} recently arrived in the Americas, ordered his troops to attack the enemy fortifications <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to send in either scouts or guerrillas. The result was that Maroto's Talaveras, bombarded by the volley of shots, were forced to retreat with heavy losses. On the next day, Bernardo O'Higgins managed to make his way past the royal troops and retreat to the capital, where his opponents entered without resistance a few days later. Whether due to a belief that Maroto had conducted himself clumsily in battle or due to other, unknown reasons, although the list of officials who ought to be promoted after the latest victories sent by Osorio to viceroy Abascal included Maroto's name, the messenger who delivered the list nonetheless had confidential instructions to let Abascal know that Osorio believed that Maroto should not be promoted. When Maroto received word several months later that the list that had been sent to Madrid did not include his name, he lodged the appropriate complaint with Abascal, who had not liked the confusing way of proceeding and ended up finding in Maroto's favor on May 10, 1815, granting him the grade of brigadier, backdated to 8 November 1814.|$|E

[...] "She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius", said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that [...] "Anastasia was nasty {{to the point of}} being evil", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.|$|E

500|$|The cabinet {{responsible}} for enacting the law abolishing slavery suffered {{a vote of}} no confidence on 3 May 1889 {{and was forced to}} resign. Pedro II called José Antônio Saraiva to form a new cabinet. Saraiva, a highly pragmatic politician, cared neither for monarchy nor republic, so long as he held power. He frankly warned the Emperor that Isabel had little chance of reigning as empress and that the government itself should {{take an active role in}} facilitating a peaceful transition to a republic. The Emperor accepted this proposal, <b>without</b> <b>bothering</b> to inform his daughter and heiress. Pedro II's behavior in this meeting revealed how little commitment he had to the monarchy. He gave little consideration to his daughter's opinion, or that of the Brazilian people who overwhelmingly supported the imperial system. The reason, unknown to but a very few, was that Pedro II was very sympathetic towards the idea of a republican system. Through action and inaction, consciously and unconsciously, he had been sabotaging both the monarchy and the prospects of his daughter's future reign for nearly a decade. A quite astonished historian Heitor Lyra remarked: [...] "Was he not the head of the Brazilian monarchy, it would be said that he had been allied with the Republic's advertisers!" [...] Saraiva, however, changed his mind and declined the office. Pedro II instead appointed Afonso Celso de Assis Figuereido, viscount of Ouro Preto, in his place.|$|E
