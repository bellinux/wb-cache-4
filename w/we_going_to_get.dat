500|$|Movement by {{the astronauts}} was {{detected}} by the spacecraft's inertial measurement unit and the astronaut's biomedical sensors, and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow, and sounds from Grissom's stuck-open microphone. There was no evidence to identify the movement, {{or whether it was}} related to the fire. [...] The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: [...] "How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" [...] The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion {{of all the people who}} worked so hard for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Local villagers, {{the report}} said, {{appeared}} to be unconcerned with the smog, saying it was [...] "normal". [...] "If we do not burn the forest, where are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our food from?" [...] a villager said.|$|E
5000|$|... "We weren't {{quite sure}} if <b>we</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Eliza, {{because there were}} rumors that there was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a Buffy spinoff for her." ...|$|R

2500|$|With Hustle greenlit for filming, the {{production}} team began searching for actors to play both {{the main characters}} and the marks for each episode. The process was initially quite difficult; Crawford described his [...] "immediate thought [...] 'this is so good, how the hell are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a cast {{to live up to}} these characters?' ... Tony had created incredibly strong characters, each with their own particular style and panache, but they also had to form a believable, if unusual, 'family' unit". Robert Vaughn, the Academy Award-nominated star of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., was soon suggested as a natural choice to play Albert Stroller, the elderly 'roper' responsible for ensnaring potential marks. After meeting Vaughn over lunch, Crawford [...] " [...] straight away that he could bring a whole new dimension to the part of Albert". Vaughn was immediately offered the role, and asked to begin filming the following day.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the Yom Kippur War on October 6, 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his {{assigned}} reserve armored division. On his farm, before he left for the front line, the Reserve Commander, Zeev Amit, said to him, [...] "How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of this?" [...] Sharon replied, [...] "You don't know? We will cross the Suez Canal and the war will end over there." [...] Sharon arrived at the front, to participate in his fourth war, in a civilian car. His forces did not engage the Egyptian Army immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness, Sharon's forces moved to a point on the Suez Canal that had been prepared before the war. In a move that again thwarted the commands of his superiors, Sharon's division crossed the Suez, effectively winning the war for Israel. He then headed north towards Ismailia, intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the Fresh Water Canal.|$|E
2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans over to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more," [...] cried Roger, {{the fever}} of the hunter taking {{possession}} of him. [...] "Just wait till we strike an elk, or a bear!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too bad, Tom, {{that you}} are not coming back next Fall," [...] went on Songbird, seriously. [...] "I don't know how <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't {{know how}} <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Lodge, {{unless we can}} find {{somebody}} to drive us over," [...] said Pepper. [...] "Could you do it, if we paid you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Then {{where are}} <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{something}} to eat?” demanded Buster. “I’m not going without my supper just because I can’t get back.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll never {{carry that}} much, will we?" [...] he queried. [...] "Why, how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{all that stuff}} over the pass you mentioned?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Hall?" [...] came in ugly tones from Reff Ritter. He, {{with six}} other boys, was {{standing}} beside the carryall.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you will, Abe. I'm real glad to meet you, and I am sure <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along first-rate together," [...] said Roger, {{and then}} the pair shook hands once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{watch out}} that {{nothing like that}} happens to us," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "We won't go down into any hollow until we know something about how <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up that," [...] was Shep's comment, after looking the ground over. [...] "If we try it we may bring all {{the dirt and}} rocks down on our heads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{on without}} you, I {{should like to}} know?" [...] she asked, indignantly, [...] "especially {{if you are going}} to take Albert away too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is," [...] {{came from}} the man named Tate, [...] "how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at it? Do you think you'll {{be able to see}} the documents this man Rover must carry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Soa," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "we have {{travelled}} here {{to please}} you; now give us the benefit of your suggestions. How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your mistress out of that camp?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I don't think <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> lost. What place do {{you call}} this?" [...] the eldest Rover continued, {{thinking}} to ask some questions himself, and thus keep the fellow from becoming too inquisitive.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I understand. I {{am proud}} to know that my old friends think so much of me," [...] and the master of Colby Hall smiled broadly. [...] "I am sure <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along famously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, you see, here {{is where}} <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> mixed up," [...] {{announced}} Sam, as they moved {{in the direction of}} Brill. [...] "Did the fellow go straight to Ashton, or did he turn off to one of the other places?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{have escaped}} the big woman, to be sure," [...] remarked the Green Monkey, [...] "but we still wear the awful forms the cruel yookoohoo gave us. How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of these shapes, and become {{ourselves}} again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{on earth}} are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through?" [...] asked Augusta, {{and at that moment}} Mr. John Short caught hold of an {{attendant}} who was struggling about in the skirts of the crowd like a fly in a cup of tea, and asked him the same question, explaining that their presence was necessary to the show.|$|E
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head vigorously, and saying, [...] "No more! no more!" [...] threw myself over the wall, and seized the rope, Rectus holding the grapnel in its place as I did so. As I let myself down from knot to knot, a thought crossed my mind: [...] "How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that grapnel after we both are down?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Steve Asheim said of Legion, [...] "For Legion, I was {{too busy}} {{worrying}} about how <b>we</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a second album out to really {{think about what it}} meant, I was just trying to stay in the music business and stay brutal." ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the meeting}} Congressman Rush said [...] "Government is {{supposed}} to protect its people, It is almost unheard of. It is atrocious. It is shameful.

6000|$|... "So far, so good, my dear," [...] said Mary Louise. [...] "We {{can trust}} dear old Peter Conant to be generous and patriotic. But {{what good is}} a store without stock, and how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a stock to sell--and sell it at a profit {{that will allow us}} to do all the things we long to do for the soldiers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{about an}} hour they arrived at a dense thicket, and {{it was evident that}} this was the lair of the bears until they took up their {{permanent}} winter quarters in a hollow tree. The dogs were urged to attack them, but could not be persuaded to enter far, confining themselves to barking fiercely. [...] "How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at them?" [...] Godfrey asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "we can talk and rage against the men all day if we like. They {{are not trying}} to prevent us. But that will do no good. Here's Mrs. Cotterell invited, and all the {{neighbouring}} auxiliaries notified--and the men won't let us have the church. The point is, how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the scrape?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's exactly our route," [...] he said, [...] "but I reckon {{we still}} must be two {{days from the}} Mongars, and how <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there ourselves, much more get the women there, without camels, I don't know. There are no wells, and I don't believe those fellows have left us a single tin of water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Art, this is {{different}}. We broke {{house at}} Carfax, {{but we had}} night and a walled park to protect us.

5000|$|... "I {{have so much}} to learn," [...] Aarons said then. [...] "I {{learn from}} the young, my students. ... I love the young. I love to hear them to hear what they are doing just to have them around. The young are experimenting. I think <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a lot from their work.
