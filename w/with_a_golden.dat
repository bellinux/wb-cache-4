5|$|The Hunyadi {{family was}} one of the most {{powerful}} noble families in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 15thcentury. A member of the family, Matthias Corvinus, was King of Hungary from 1458 until 1490, King of Bohemia (ruling in Moravia, Lower Lusatia, Upper Lusatia, and Silesia) from 1469 until 1490, and Duke of Austria from 1487 until 1490. His illegitimate son, John Corvinus, ruled the Duchy of Troppau from 1485 until 1501, and five further Silesian duchies, including Bytom, Głubczyce, Loslau, Racibórz, and Tost, from 1485 until 1490. The Hunyadi coat-of-arms depicted a raven <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> ring in its beak.|$|E
5|$|The spores are smooth, {{narrowly}} fusiform (fuse-shaped), {{and measure}} 7–12 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 20–28 by 6–8µm and are hyaline (translucent), four-spored, and narrowly club-shaped, with many internal oil droplets. Cystidia are fusiform, sometimes with a rounded tip, and have dimensions of 30–50 by 9–12µm. Some {{are more or}} less hyaline, while others are encrusted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> pigment. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium, an arrangement in which the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 10–17µm wide and have elliptical to cylindrical cells at their ends that are not gelatinous. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

He left his estate split equally between his eight children, valued at £13,000 each (worth about £1.1 million in 2013).|$|E
5|$|Athamas {{ruled in}} Boeotia {{and had a}} {{complicated}} family life, several details of which {{are known to have}} played part in the Catalogue. His first children were Phrixus and Helle, whose mother was Nephele. In what was the first episode of the Argonautic saga, she gave her children a ram <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> fleece upon which they fled the intrigues of their stepmother Ino according to other sources. Athamas was driven mad by the gods, perhaps because he took the young Dionysus into his household, and slaughtered his and Ino's son Learchus; Ino herself jumped into the sea with their son Melicertes and became the sea-goddess Leucothea. At some point before his marriage to Ino, Athamas had sired Leucon and Schoeneus by Themisto, and Leucon's daughters Peisidice, Euippe and Hyperippe were given extended group treatment in the Catalogue.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} he has an ally who is also working {{undercover}} at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up bugs in Scaramanga's meeting room. However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, {{with the help of}} Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> derringer hidden in his palm.

5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E

5|$|When {{displayed}} alongside other flags, {{the national}} flag takes {{the position of}} honour; it is raised first and lowered last. Other national flags should be arranged in alphabetical order. Where two (or more than three) flags appear together, the national flag should be placed to the right (left of the observer); in a display of three flags in line, the national flag occupies the central position. The European flag is also flown from government buildings on a daily basis. In {{the presence of a}} foreign visitor belonging to a member state, this takes precedence over the Italian flag. As a sign of mourning, flags flown externally shall be lowered to half-mast; two black ribbons may be attached to those otherwise displayed. Traditionally, the flag may be decorated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> fringe surrounding the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|During {{the longest}} season in Iraqi football, the 1992–93 season, when every club played 69 matches, Al-Talaba had Yahya Alwan as their {{manager in the}} first stage of the league, in which they won 14 matches, drawn seven and lost two, 1–0 against Kirkuk and the same score against Samarra.

In the third stage, the team won 18 matches, drew four and lost only once against Al-Khutoot. After 69 matches, Al-Talaba finished top of the league with 110 points, having scored 130 goals and conceded 34. In the 1992 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup which was organised by the Iraq FA, Al-Talaba finished the group stage as the Group Two leaders with four points. In the semi-finals, they had to face Al-Zawra'a in a match which was considered a replay of the 1991 semi-final which Al-Zawra'a won 1–0. In this match, Al-Talaba won 3–2 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> goal in the 100th minute during extra time. In the final against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, the match ended in a 0–0 draw which led to extra time when Alaa Kadhim scored the winning goal in the 104th minute. In the 1992–93 Iraq FA Cup, Al-Talaba reached the final after defeating Haifa, Salahaddin, Salam and Samarra. In the final, they lost to Al-Zawra'a 2–1.|$|E
