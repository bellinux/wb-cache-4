5000|$|Patients {{with cold}} {{agglutinin}} disease should include good sources of folic acid, such as {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables, in their diet. Activities for these individuals should be less strenuous than those for healthy people, particularly for patients with anemia. Jogging in the cold could be very hazardous because of the added <b>windchill</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rain season {{starts in}} December and lasts {{all the way}} into May, however, {{precipitation}} throughout the winter months generally falls in the form of light snow, {{and the rest of the}} precipitation throughout the rain season is generally very light to moderate. During some winters, moisture-abundant blizzards make their way down from the Alborz mountains from the north of the city and dump several centimeters of snow in a single twenty-four-hour period. These blizzards force the closure of the airport, schools, small streets, and alleyways. As a result of the city's position in a semi-arid plain, many winter days are dominated by a cold and gusty wind that often produces a potent <b>windchill</b> <b>factor</b> which makes the city feel much colder than the actual air temperature. According to Iranian Meteorology reports, Semnan experiences around 48 days in which the temperature falls below freezing each year.|$|E
40|$|NASA {{astronaut}} Stan Love {{shared his}} {{experiences with the}} Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET), an annual expedition to the southern continent to collect valuable samples for research in planetary science. ANSMET teams operate from isolated, remote field camps on the polar plateau, where <b>windchill</b> <b>factors</b> often reach - 40 F. Several astronaut participants have noted ANSMET's similarity to a space mission. Some of the operational concepts, tools, and equipment employed by ANSMET teams may offer valuable insights to designers of future planetary surface exploration hardware...|$|R
40|$|The {{microclimate}} of an aboriginal winter campsite, set in an incised, south-facing meander {{of a small}} creek, {{is compared}} to the conditions on the adjacent open prairie at Wanuskewin Heritage Park, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speeds were measured daily, on the prairie and in the valley, along with temperatures in a modern canvas tipi erected in the valley. Maximum temperatures tended to be about 1 °C higher in the valley, and 2 °C higher in the tipi, than on the prairie, while minima were 1 - 2 °C lower. Wind speeds were reduced to about 50 % in the valley. <b>Windchill</b> <b>factors,</b> derived from these data, were reduced between 200 and 250 W m- 2, suggesting that the valley site afforded considerable benefit as a winter habitation site...|$|R
