5|$|Medstead {{contains}} {{a total of}} six Grade II listed buildings. Southdown Old Farmhouse is a small manor which dates from the 18th century and has undergone 20th century restorations and extensions; the manor was designated as a listed building on 31 May 1985. Another Grade II listed building is a Victorian <b>wheelhouse</b> with a donkey wheel which lies immediately southwest of Southdown Old Farmhouse. The <b>wheelhouse</b> was built in the early 19th century and consists of weatherboarded timber frames on brick plinths. The donkey wheel is in working order and is made of a large timber axle with a rope hanging over a well.|$|E
5|$|The crane {{fell into}} disuse in 1980s, {{and in the}} {{intervening}} period of neglect, the crane suffered vandalism to the <b>wheelhouse</b> and corrosion to the structure. In 1988 the crane was recognised as a Category A Listed historical structure.|$|E
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and <b>wheelhouse</b> were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
50|$|Larger RIBs {{can have}} hard-tops or <b>wheelhouses</b> made of GRP or aluminium. <b>Wheelhouses</b> offer {{protection}} from the elements to both the crew and passengers - and can also protect equipment such as suspension seats and navigation equipment. Some RIB manufacturers, particularly those popular in Ireland and the West Coast of Scotland provide optional canopies which form fabric and perspex <b>wheelhouses</b> but can be easily removed in good weather. Increasingly, RIBs are becoming available with small cabins (usually with accommodation for two people {{and in some cases}} sea toilets or chemical toilets), widening the application of RIBs as cruising craft.|$|R

50|$|It was {{followed}} in 1970 by Lady Woodward and Lady McKell. These two differed from Lady Cutler in having reverse sloped <b>wheelhouses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the <b>wheelhouse</b> {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} {{settlement in the}} village comes from two Tumuli burial grounds which date from 1000 BC. Roman pottery and coins have also {{been found in the}} area. A chapel in the village was first mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 and was soon replaced by a Norman church. Medstead was one one of the first villages in the United Kingdom to receive broadband. The village has six Grade II listed buildings, including the 12th century St Andrew's Church and its war memorial, a farmhouse and a Victorian <b>wheelhouse</b> with a working donkey wheel.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} cottages on the estate, {{the first of}} which, The Beeches, was built for the Fox family. Swiss Cottage, which was built in 1819, was {{originally}} known as Carysfoot Cottage, when the Earl of Carysfort was a patient there. Lanesborough Cottage was built as accommodation for Lord Lanesborough. The lodge house was originally called the <b>wheelhouse</b> as it contained the mechanism used to open and close the iron gates to the asylum. A garden alcove dating from around 1820 is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the <b>wheelhouse</b> and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey {{had returned to the}} island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E
5|$|Gale-force winds lashed the tidewater {{region of}} Virginia {{in what was}} {{considered}} the worst storm on the lower Chesapeake Bay since the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane. A ship called the Osceola lost its <b>wheelhouse</b> to the winds, while onshore, the storm razed crops and a few small structures such as barns and outhouses. Affecting {{many of the same}} areas as the July hurricane, the cyclone downed trees in and around Baltimore and caused street flooding in Washington, D.C., where a railroad bridge was swept away. The storm began to influence the weather at Philadelphia on the night of August 24. Strong winds out of the north and northeast at Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, suggest the center moved off the New Jersey coast and reemerged into the Atlantic. In addition to the gales, more than 3 in (75mm) of rain fell on Newark on August 25.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{guided the}} party into the Mohave Canyon, {{indicating}} {{the location of}} rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached {{the entrance to the}} Black Canyon of the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging the <b>wheelhouse.</b> Using their skiff, the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.|$|E
50|$|Alongside her sister, {{the vessel}} was {{withdrawn}} from service for extensive refurbishment in 1989. The six-month {{absence from the}} river {{was the result of}} a major rebuild and life extension programme. During this, her bridge wings and <b>wheelhouses</b> were plated over to form one single bridge. Curiously she retained all her original navigation equipment. She returned to service in July 1990.|$|R
50|$|They are {{powered by}} two Daihatsu model 8DSMB-32 {{turbo-charged}} diesel engines which each develop 2238 kW at 600rpm, and have hand-controllable pitch propellers. The hull and lower cabin area are of welded steel construction {{and the upper}} cabin and two <b>wheelhouses</b> are aluminium. The newest vessel, Collaroy, is fitted with Sperry Gyrofin stabilisers and additional catering facilities for ocean cruising.|$|R
50|$|The North Head {{was built}} by Mort's Dock, Woolwich for the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company. Launched in 1913, it was the fifth of six Binngarra type vessels and nearly {{identical}} to the Balgowlah and Bellubera. It was named after Barrenjoey at {{the northern tip of}} Pittwater. In 1930, received its first refit which saw much of the upper deck enclosed and the <b>wheelhouses</b> extended.|$|R
5|$|These {{ships were}} based on the {{preceding}} B class, but were enlarged to increase their endurance and to allow for the inclusion of a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun. This class introduced a director control tower for British destroyers. The 'C' class were unique in having a split bridge, with the compass platform and <b>wheelhouse</b> separated from the chartroom and director tower. This unusual layout was not repeated. As per Admiralty policy in alternating Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear and ASDIC (sonar) capability between destroyer flotillas, the C class lacked ASDIC and were designed to carry only six depth charges. The D class were repeats of the C's, except that the TSDS was replaced by storage for up to 30 depth charges and ASDIC.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{part of the}} <b>wheelhouse</b> complex {{has been}} dated to 200 BC, although other parts were built later, post-dating the 1st century BC–2nd century AD profusion of these structures in the Western Isles by several centuries. Construction used the stones of the broch itself {{and two of the}} four main structures are amongst the best examples of their type. Three successive periods of construction were undertaken, and the best preserved retains a significant proportion of the stone part of its roof and displays a series of corbelled bays. One structure was built as a circular building and the radial piers were inserted afterwards. This may have been an earlier, less stable design. In one case the piers are alternately rectangular and V-shaped, in another all are to the latter design, again suggesting a developing style. Unlike many wheelhouses elsewhere in Scotland that are built into the earth, the Jarlshof structures seem to have been built from ground level upwards.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the five}} spans {{of the current}} bridge are far wider than the {{nineteen}} spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge's location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the MV Delta jammed under the bridge, and its master Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms {{and needed to be}} rescued from the smashed <b>wheelhouse.</b> On 23 March 1950, the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, so when the bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005, when the James Prior, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the James Prior, was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008, when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2009 the Klickitat and {{the other}} three Steel Electric ferries were sold to Eco Planet Recycling, Inc. of Chula Vista, California. All four ferries were {{scrapped}} in Ensenada, Mexico in the fall of 2009. One of the original 1927 <b>wheelhouses</b> (removed in the 1981 rebuild) of the Klickitat was salvaged and converted into a small house currently located just outside Arlington, Washington.|$|R

This includes a smithy, a cluster of <b>wheelhouses</b> and a later broch. The site has provided evidence of habitation during various phases right up until Viking times. Heel-shaped cairns, are a style of chambered cairn unique to Shetland, with a particularly large example on Vementry.|$|R
50|$|South Steyne is a double-ended, double-screw {{steamship}} {{constructed to}} ocean-going standards. The hull is riveted steel, with a bar keel, 8 watertight bulkheads and a double bottom under the engine only. At 70 metres long {{she was the}} world's largest operational steam ferry. The steel superstructure rises to sun deck level, with teak decks and <b>wheelhouses.</b> One of her two funnels is a dummy, containing a water tank.|$|R
5|$|Just before dawn, Howard summoned his platoon {{commanders to}} a meeting. With their senior {{officers}} dead or wounded, numbers One, Two and Three Platoons were now commanded by corporals. Howard's second in command, Captain Priday and number Four Platoon were missing. Only Lieutenants Fox and Sweeney in Five and Six Platoons {{had a full}} complement of officers and NCOs. The landings at Sword began at 07:00, preceded by a heavy naval bombardment. At the bridges, daylight allowed German snipers to identify targets and anyone moving in the open was in danger of being shot. The men of number One Platoon who had taken over the 75mm anti-tank gun on the east bank of the canal used it to engage possible sniper positions in Bénouville, the Château de Bénouville and the surrounding area. At 09:00, two German gunboats approached the canal bridge from Ouistreham. The lead boat fired its 20mm gun and number Two Platoon returned fire with a PIAT, hitting the <b>wheelhouse</b> of the leading boat, which crashed into the canal bank. The second boat retreated to Ouistreham. A lone German aircraft bombed the canal bridge at 10:00, dropping one bomb. The bomb struck the bridge but failed to detonate.|$|E
25|$|The hull {{was divided}} into five {{watertight}} compartments and spaces were filled with buoyant materials which combined with a watertight GRP <b>wheelhouse</b> {{to give it a}} self-righting capability. A survivors' cabin was sited forward of the <b>wheelhouse</b> with eight seats and a stretcher could be carried in the <b>wheelhouse</b> which had seats for the four crew members.|$|E

50|$|Saltwater {{fishing boats}} vary widely {{in length and}} are once again {{specialized}} for various species of fish. Flats boats, for example, are used in protected, shallow waters, and have shallow draft. Sportfishing boats range from 25 to 80 ft or more, and can be powered by large outboard engines or inboard diesels. Fishing boats in colder climates may have more space dedicated to cuddy cabins and <b>wheelhouses,</b> while boats in warmer climates {{are likely to be}} entirely open.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} first {{unearthed}} during construction work for airport {{improvements in the}} late 1970s. An arc of the broch wall was exposed in {{one side of a}} green mound during the building of the perimeter road at the airport at Sumburgh Head. Since 1995, University of Bradford staff and students, professional archaeologists and local volunteers have been excavating the site and cataloging the finds. Excavations have uncovered a multi-period settlement with broch, <b>wheelhouses</b> and later dwellings.|$|R
50|$|Containerships have {{typically}} {{had a single}} bridge and accommodation unit towards the rear, but to reconcile demand for larger container capacity with SOLAS visibility requirements, several new designs have been developed. , some large containerships are being developed with the bridge further forward, separate from the exhaust stack. Some smaller containerships working in European ports and rivers have liftable <b>wheelhouses,</b> which can be lowered to pass under low bridges. HHI has developed the Skybench movable bridge to allow more capacity on large containerships.|$|R

25|$|In 1953 the Västan was rebuilt, {{receiving}} a new <b>wheelhouse.</b> and was converted from steam power to diesel power. Further rebuilds {{have taken place}} in 1966, 1969, 1990, 2002 and 2012. During the 2012 rebuild, a new diesel-electric power system was installed.|$|E
50|$|The Fisheries Legacy Trust Company's (FLTC) main {{function}} is to help keep fishermen safe in UK waters. It does this by building a trust fund (based on payments from oil and gas producers) {{which can be used}} to maintain comprehensive, up-to-date information on all seabed hazards related to oil and gas activities {{for as long as they}} remain, and to make this data available for use by fishing vessel plotters found on board in <b>wheelhouses</b> all around the UK coastline.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the last}} 90 years, 19 painted pebbles {{have been found}} in sites in the Northern Isles and in Caithness. Most have come from broch sites which have been shown to have had an {{extensive}} post-broch occupation. An ogham-inscribed spindle-whorl was associated with one find at Buckquoy in Orkney (see Buckquoy spindle whorl). Several have been associate with <b>wheelhouses</b> or their outbuildings. An example was found at a Pictish site at Buckquoy in Orkney as reported in 1976. It had the [...] "small ring" [...] type decoration.|$|R
500|$|Elsewhere in Scotland <b>wheelhouses</b> were constructed, {{probably}} for ritualistic purposes, {{in the west}} and north. Their geographical locations are highly restricted, which suggests that they may have been contained within a political or cultural frontier of some kind and the co-incidence of their arrival and departure being associated with the period of Roman influence in Scotland is a matter of ongoing debate. It is not known whether the culture that constructed them was [...] "Pictish" [...] as such although they would certainly have been known to the Picts.|$|R
