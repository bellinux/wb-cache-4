5000|$|A {{dielectric}} <b>withstand</b> <b>test</b> or [...] "high potential" [...] or [...] "hipot" [...] test is {{an electrical}} test performed on a component or product {{to determine the}} effectiveness of its insulation. The test may be between mutually insulated sections of a part or energized parts and electrical ground. The test is a means to qualify a device's ability to operate safely during rated electrical conditions. If current through a device under test {{is less than a}} specified limit at the required test potential and time duration, the device meets the dielectric withstand requirement. A dielectric <b>withstand</b> <b>test</b> may be done as a factory test on new equipment, or may be done on apparatus in service as a routine maintenance test.|$|E
50|$|Dielectric <b>Withstand</b> <b>Test.</b> A {{standard}} test voltage is applied (below the established Breakdown Voltage) {{and the resulting}} leakage current is monitored. The leakage current must be below a preset limit or the test is considered to have failed. This test is non-destructive providing {{that it does not}} fail and is usually required by safety agencies to be performed as a 100% production line test on all products before they leave the factory.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to over-stressing the insulation, the test {{can also be}} performed to detect material and workmanship defects, most importantly small gap spacings between current-carrying conductors and earth ground. When a product is operated under normal conditions, environmental factors such as humidity, dirt, vibration, shock and contaminants can close these small gaps and allow current to flow. This condition can create a shock hazard if the defects are not corrected at the factory. No other test can uncover this type of defect {{as well as the}} Dielectric <b>Withstand</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

High voltage <b>withstand</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used}} within {{manufacturing}} plants {{to ensure the}} quality of completed cable system components from MV to EHV. Thus, it is quite natural for utilities to also use <b>withstand</b> <b>tests</b> as commissioning and maintenance tests for cable systems in the field. The goal of these tests is the same as in the factory test, namely to have any weak components of the cable system fail in a controlled manner, such that the minimum number of customers are affected. In fact a recent study has shown that <b>withstand</b> <b>tests</b> are among the most routinely employed diagnostic tests in the USA; this study has also shown that the most preferred <b>withstand</b> <b>tests</b> use Very Low Frequency (VLF: 0. 02 to 0. 1 Hz) AC methods...|$|R

5000|$|Apply VLF to XLPE cables in a {{monitored}} withstand approach where {{a diagnostic}} measurement is made {{before and during}} the course of the <b>withstand</b> <b>test.</b> Monitoring a diagnostic enables some additional decision making before the final test voltage is reached. Some cables are not good candidates for withstand testing and a diagnostic indication obtained at a lower voltage can negate the need to perform withstand testing. During the test measurement of a diagnostic parameter can be used to optimise test times. Test times can be shortened for cables with good diagnostic indications or lengthened for cables that show deteriorating diagnostic measurements during the test.|$|E
5000|$|High voltage {{withstand}} tests {{are used in}} conjunction with partial discharge measurements on solid dielectric cable and accessories within manufacturing plants to ensure the quality of completed cable system components from MV to EHV. Thus, it is quite natural for utilities to also use withstand and partial discharge tests as commissioning and maintenance tests for cable systems in the field. The goal of these tests is the same as in the factory test, namely to detect any defective components of the cable system before failure. Withstand tests can be conducted using a variety of voltage sources from DC to 300 Hz and are simple to operate and the equipment may be inexpensive.

State {{assessment}} method of cables with extruded insulation and their accessories, DAC <b>withstand</b> <b>test</b> {{combined with a}} diagnostic test (such as PD measurement) has two shortcomings, the output voltage is not high enough for EHV cables, it cannot detect and locate PD effectively when defects are far away from signal acquisition point.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an experimental program to determine the aging and loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) behavior of electrical connections in order to obtain an initial scoping of their performance. Ten types of connections commonly used in nuclear power plants were tested. These included 3 types of conduit seals, 2 types of cable-to-device connectors, 3 types of cable-to-cable connectors, and 2 types of in-line splices. The connections were aged for 6 months under simultaneous thermal (99 C) and radiation (46 Gy/hr) conditions. A simulated LOCA consisting of sequential high dose-rate irradiation (3 kGy/hr) and high-temperature steam exposures followed the aging. Connection functionality was monitored using insulation resistance measurements during the aging and LOCA exposures. Because only 5 of the 10 connection types passed a post-LOCA, submerged dielectric <b>withstand</b> <b>test,</b> further detailed investigation of electrical connections and the effects of cable jacket integrity on the cable-connection system is warranted...|$|E

40|$|During normal lifetime, {{transformers}} are {{submitted to}} a variety of electrical, mechanical and thermal stresses. One of the most critical situations is that caused by external short circuits, which produces high currents in the transformer windings and hence high internal forces in the windings. These forces are potential sources for damaging transformers. In this paper the different parameters for short circuit withstand capability of a transformer is calculated considering a 1500 KVA, 22 KV/ 415 V, Dyn 11 Distribution Transformer. The short circuit <b>withstand</b> <b>test</b> of a Transformer cannot be performed in the Test Laboratory of any manufacturer. There is a need for a high test field power, especially for large units with ratings of 100 MVA and above. The tests can only be performed at a few powerful test stations, such as those operated in KEMA (Netherlands), EDF (France), CESI (Italy) or IREQ (Canada) [1]. Short circuit tests are expensive. The cost of the test itself is high. The cost also increases due to activities such as, transporting the transformer under test from the factory, local installation at the test laboratory and again at the factory, untanking and inspection, repetition of dielectric tests etc. For this reason the IEC standards also permits demonstration of the short circuit ability using calculation and design considerations...|$|E
40|$|The {{character}} state {{data obtained}} for clusters defined {{in a previous}} phenetic classification were used to construct two probabilistic matrices for Streptomyces species. These superseded an original published identification matrix by exclusion of other genera and the inclusion of more Streptomyces species. Separate matrices were constructed for major and minor clusters. The minimum number of diagnostic characters for each matrix was selected by computer programs for determination of character separation indices (CHARSEP) and a selection of group diagnostic properties (DIACHAR). The resulting matrices consisted of 26 phena x 50 characters (major clusters) and 28 phena x 39 characters (minor clusters). Cluster overlap (OVERMAT program) was small in both matrices. Identification scores were used to evaluate both matrices. The theoretically best scores for the most typical example of each cluster (MOSTTYP program) were all satisfactory. Input of test data for randomly selected cluster representatives resulted in correct identification with high scores. The major cluster matrix was shown to be practically sound by its application to 35 unknown soil isolates, 77 % of which were clearly identified. The minor cluster matrix provides tentative probabilistic identifications as {{the small number of}} strains in each cluster reduces its ability to <b>withstand</b> <b>test</b> variation. A diagnostic table for single-membered clusters, constructed using the CHARSEP and DIACHAR programs, was also produced...|$|E
