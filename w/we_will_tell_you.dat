5000|$|With this {{declaration}} of war, radio {{became part of}} the propaganda campaign. Throughout the war, the attack on Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda. Direct wartime programming began shortly after the United States entry into the war. The first live broadcast to Germany, called Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") took place on Feb 1, 1942. It was introduced by [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" [...] and included the pledge: [...] "Today, and every day from now on, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be with you from America to talk about the war.... The news may be good or bad for us - <b>We</b> <b>will</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the truth." ...|$|R

The fishermen of the cove were in a state of wild excitement, for an enormous shoal of pilchards had been enclosed in the seine-nets, and Maggot with his men, as well as the people employed by Mr Donnithorne, were as much over head and ears in fishing as Oliver was in love.

[...] [Footnote: It {{was one of the few}} reminiscences of Old Parr, or Henry Jenkins, I forget which, that, at some convent in the veteran's neighbourhood, the community, before the dissolution, used to dole out roast-beef in the measure of feet and yards.] ...|$|R
5000|$|Donovan's primary {{interests}} were military intelligence and covert operations. Sherwood handled {{the dissemination of}} domestic information and foreign propaganda. He recruited the noted radio producer John Houseman, who because of his Romanian birth {{at the time was}} technically an enemy alien, to develop an overseas radio program for broadcast to the Axis powers and the populations of the territories they had conquered, which became known as the Voice of America. The first broadcast, called in German Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") aired on Feb. 1, 1942, and included the pledge: [...] "Today, and every day from now on, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be with you from America to talk about the war[...] [...] [...] The news may be good or bad for us -- <b>We</b> <b>will</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the truth." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{was popular}} at school, as boys of spirit always are, and {{impressed}} his companions {{with a sense}} of his power. They thought he would one day be a famous soldier. This may have been owing to the stories he told them of the heroic uncle, whose deeds, we may be sure, were properly famoused by the boy Homer, and whom they probably took for an admiral at the least, as it would have been well for Keats's literary prosperity if he had been. At any rate, they thought John would be a great man, which is the main thing, for the public opinion of the playground is truer and more discerning than that of the world, and if you tell us what the boy was, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what the man longs to be, however he may be repressed by necessity or fear of the police reports.|$|E

The cottage is the home of a powerful Yookoohoo, named Reera the Red, who assumes all sorts of forms, sometimes changing her form several times in a day, according to her fancy. What her real form may be we do not know. This strange creature cannot be bribed with treasure, or coaxed through friendship, or won by pity. She has never assisted anyone, or done wrong to anyone, that we know of. All her wonderful powers are used for her own selfish amusement. She will order you out of the house but you must refuse to go. Remain and watch Reera closely and try to see what she uses to accomplish her transformations. If you can discover the secret whisper it to us and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> then <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what to do next." ...|$|R

40|$|This site seminar {{will take}} you to the Larsen Design Studio where Jack Lenor Larsen has guided his company for the past 45 years. Mr. Larsen is {{currently}} retired and acts as a consultant, but the design process continues. This presentation will show the many processes and people involved in the creation of textiles for the interior design industry today. Each fabric is a combination of available technology, personal inspiration, and market demand. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> track the story of some significant Larsen classics from the creation of the original artwork through development decisions including materials, structure, color direction, price consideration, and technical setbacks. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> also <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> if the 2 ̆ 2 best designed 2 ̆ 2 fabrics ever sold in the market. The roles of different individuals and how decisions are made will be examined. Creating a textile for industry is far removed from the lone artist in the garret studio. From the designer / technician at the mill informing what yams or structures are possible, a freelance designer selling artwork, a design director creating, maintaining, and expanding on a 2 ̆ 2 house style 2 ̆ 2, to the input from sales staff and end users (architects and interior designers), there are many players on the team. You will be introduced to people at many of these steps...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{we count}} that good advice, and {{strongly}} recommend {{it to all}} and sundry. Had we been {{at the side of}} Dick Varley on the night after his taming of the wild horse, we would have strongly urged that advice upon him. Whether he would have listened to it or not is quite another question--we rather think not. Reader, if you wish to know why, go and do what he did, and if you feel no curious sensations about the region of the loins after it, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> why Dick Varley wouldn't have listened to that advice. Can a man feel as if his joints were wrenched out of their sockets, and listen to advice--be that advice good or bad? Can he feel as though these joints were trying to re-set and re-dislocate themselves perpetually--and listen to advice? Can he feel as if he were sitting down on red-hot iron, when he's not sitting down at all--and listen to advice? Can he--but no! why pursue the subject? Poor Dick spent that night in misery, and the greater part of the following day in sleep, to make up for it.|$|E
6000|$|No {{sooner had}} {{he walked to}} the city wall than the monkeys pulled him back, telling him {{that he did not know}} how happy he was, and {{pinching}} him to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone reservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined summer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for queens dead a hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the queens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it shone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black velvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he was to wish to leave them. [...] "We are great. We are free. We are wonderful. We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and so it must be true," [...] they shouted. [...] "Now as you are a new listener and can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us in future, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all about our most excellent selves." [...] Mowgli made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would all shout together: [...] "This is true; we all say so." [...] Mowgli nodded and blinked, and said [...] "Yes" [...] when they asked him a question, and his head spun with the noise. [...] "Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these people," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and now they have madness. Certainly this is dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might try to run away in the darkness. But I am tired." ...|$|E
