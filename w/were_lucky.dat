5|$|United (nicknamed the Blades) {{entered the}} FA Cup once more but <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> {{to reach the}} first round proper, losing to Burton Swifts during {{qualifying}} only to see the Staffordshire club disqualified.

5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a whaling vessel 80miles (130km) out at sea, {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They <b>were</b> <b>lucky,</b> and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they <b>were</b> <b>lucky.</b> Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to racial}} discrimination, {{minorities}} fared very poorly in gaining housing.

25|$|The Patriots were a Cinderella team {{during the}} 1985 season because many sports writers and fans thought they <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> {{to make the}} playoffs at all. New England began the season losing three of their first five games, but won six {{consecutive}} games to finish with an 11–5 record. However, the 11–5 mark only earned them third place in the AFC East behind the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets.|$|E
25|$|After 50 years Santos {{began to}} be seen as {{the best team in the}} world. When Pelé made his debut in the Campeonato Paulista in 1957, the team was already twice state {{champion}} (1955/56). The King had as fellow players Zito, Pagão, Formiga, Hélvio, Jair da Rosa Pinto, Urubatão, Tite and Pepe. Therefore, it is true that Santos <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to have Pelé. He was also fortunately only just beginning his career at Santos.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{had just}} lost to New Zealand 2-1 at home during the 1985-86 season and <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to draw 0-0 against India.

However they had just finished the home summer on a high note, having defeated India and New Zealand in the 1985-86 triangular one-day series. Allan Border was confident the team would win the one day series and bring back the Trans-Tasman Trophy.|$|E

25|$|England <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> {{to win the}} toss and get {{a chance}} to bowl under cloudy skies at Headingley, as they beat Australia by nine wickets to take their second victory in five ODIs so far. Putting Australia in to bat, they didn't get {{immediate}} reward – as especially Darren Gough was smashed about by Adam Gilchrist, but the run rate at least stayed around four an over. And with Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff removing the openers in successive overs, things looked brighter for the English. Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn added 39 for the next wicket, but in 11 overs, all while the English captain Michael Vaughan set attacking fields according to the new power play rules.|$|E

25|$|At Vimeiro, Junot {{sent the}} 3rd Dragoons {{with one of}} his {{flanking}} brigades, leaving Margaron with three cavalry regiments. After his first three frontal attacks failed, Junot sent Kellermann with his grenadier reserve to strike at Vimeiro village. After a hand-to-hand struggle, the grenadiers were beaten and Margaron sent one regiment to cover their retreat. At this moment, 240 troopers of the British 20th Light Dragoons charged, broke through the French cavalry and began cutting down the grenadiers. Excited by their success, the British horsemen got out of control and pressed their charge too far. When Margaron unleashed his last two regiments, the light dragoons <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to get away with only 21 killed, including Colonel Taylor, 24 wounded and 11 captured.|$|E
25|$|Sailors might hope to {{supplement}} their meager diets with fish if they <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to catch them. The islands frequented were plentiful with potential foods, such as turtle, seafowl, shellfish, and fish. Sea turtle was considered {{some of the best}} meat possible. While at sea, when supplies were low, fresh fish such like snapper, shark, catfish, grouper, albacore were caught and often barbecued, though one would have to be certain not to let the deck on fire. When food was scarce, a rationing system may be put in place similar to legal sailors. In some cases, the only items there were requested of the looted victim from pirates was food and drink. When gold or silver was found, food was a popular item to barter for when bartering was easier than fighting.|$|E
25|$|Of the 10 {{first-class}} matches, 6 were won, 3 {{lost and}} 1 drawn. Overall 11 matches were won, 3 lost and 6 drawn. The first matches {{of the tour}} were in Jamaica rather than Barbados as had happened on previous tours. The tourists <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to draw the first match against Jamaica but the next week won heavily by an innings and 169 runs. The tourists lost the second match against Barbados and then twice to Trinidad. Both match against the combined XI were won. A number of the minor matches were drawn but the tourists did win by an innings in all their matches in St. Lucia with the home team never scoring more than 102 in any innings. St. Vincent took the first innings lead in both their games but both matches were drawn.|$|E

25|$|The club's European {{campaign}} {{concluded with}} a 4–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur; a result that meant that Rovers failed to pick up any points during the group stage. In what was only their second competitive fixture {{since the end of}} the domestic season, Rovers had the better of the opening minutes and should have taken the lead after only 2 minutes, but James Paterson's effort was wrongly ruled out for offside. Steven Pienaar's first goal for Tottenham was the first goal of the match. Andros Townsend and Jermain Defoe scored Tottenham's second and third goals respectively. Although Tottenham did score a fourth goal through Harry Kane, it was Rovers who had the best of the second half, while both Jake Livermore and Carlo Cudicini <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to avoid red cards after bringing down Rovers players when they were through on goal. This was Michael O'Neill's final match in charge of the club.|$|E
25|$|Though some {{television}} series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the single-camera format familiar from movies, {{with a laugh}} track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Arnaz and I Love Lucy creator Jess Oppenheimer decided, however, that Lucy needed to work {{in front of an}} audience to create the kind of comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire safety regulations made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to find the financially struggling General Service Studios located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.|$|E
25|$|England {{got off to}} a {{good start}} in the ODI series, winning the first match by 114 runs. Kevin Pietersen hit an unbeaten 110 while Paul Collingwood took figures of 4-15. England <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to avoid defeat in the second match. After being bowled out for 162, New Zealand reached 127/2 of 19 overs. However, they did not win as 20 overs were needed to {{constitute}} the game. Although England bowled New Zealand out for 182 in the third ODI, they could only manage 160, meaning New Zealand won by 22 runs and levelled the series 1-1. The fourth match was another close encounter, with New Zealand winning by just one wicket after hitting the winning runs off the final ball of the match. New Zealand won the final match by 51 runs, securing a 3-1 series win for them, the same scoreline when the two sides had met in New Zealand earlier in the year.|$|E
