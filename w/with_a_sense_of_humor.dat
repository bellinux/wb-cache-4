5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E

However, psychological evaluations conclude that Kim Jong-il's antisocial features, such as his fearlessness in the face of sanctions and punishment, served to make negotiations extraordinarily difficult.|$|E

The film chronicles the amusing misadventures of a young girl whose older brother sports an {{incredibly}} tangled mess of hair which she detests.

[...] The magazine twice listed Brisco as a family-friendly TV program: [...] "Back when some of us grew up, Westerns were synonymous with great family entertainment, but– let's be honest– some of them were dull as dust.

Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner."

500|$|Deeming Azazel to be [...] "an angry soul", actor Fredric Lehne {{believed}} that the character having been [...] "denied Heaven and everything else that's good in the universe" [...] has [...] " [...] into anger and vengeance". A demon <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> Azazel takes pleasure in seeing people suffer. [...] "The more painmostly psychological painhe causes, the happier he is ... He gets off {{on the power of}} turning people to his will", Lehne explained. This quality suggests to the actor why the demon favored Sam as the potential leader of his army. Being the [...] "most ripe for picking" [...] because he had the [...] "sweetest" [...] heart, Sam was [...] "most desirable for corrupting" [...] of all the children; Lehne described Azazel's thought process as, [...] "If I could turn him, then I had truly won." [...] The character's ultimate motivation, however, is to free Lucifer from his imprisonment in Hell. On this, Supernatural co-executive producer Ben Edlund mentioned his view of Azazel as one of [...] "a little cult of demonic true believers" [...] that encompasses many of the important demon characters in the series.|$|E

[...] The magazine concluded, [...] "Carter's dialogue is fresh without being self-conscious and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV." [...] Entertainment Weekly said that Scully [...] "was set up as a scoffing skeptic" [...] in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of four episodes, the magazine called The X-Files [...] "the most paranoid, subversive show on TV", noting the [...] "marvelous tension between Anderson—who is dubious about these events—and Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer".

500|$|In {{addition}} to stylistic touches, the episode established several narrative motifs that stayed with Homicide: Life on the Street throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among them was the white board where detectives kept the names of their open cases in red and their closed cases in black. The names of NBC employees and friends of the Homicide crew were used on the white board. The episode was noted for its deliberate lack of gunplay and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. Levinson and Fontana also allowed humor to be incorporated into the show, particularly through the interactions between the detectives; Levinson said of the first episode, [...] "We have to inform the audience, {{but at the same time}} you want to do it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> so you don't seem too pretentious, in a way." [...] Several long-standing character traits were established in [...] "Gone for Goode", including Kay Howard's extraordinary streak of solved cases and the antagonism between Felton and Pembleton, which is demonstrated when the two argue loudly after being assigned to a case together. The animosity between Felton and Pembleton is based on the real-life Detective Donald Kincaid, who was the inspiration behind Felton, and the strong dislike Kincaid had for Harry Edgerton, as chronicled in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Howard's perfect streak is based on a similar (although shorter) lucky streak experienced by the real-life Detective Rich Garvey, who is also featured in David Simon's book.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as we were hoping, and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because no one wants to see the next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> and I love the idea of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E

He felt that the episode's premise worked well to [...] "set a template" [...] for future episodes, and noted that the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson was [...] "already there" [...] from the outset. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode positively, praising the chemistry between the lead roles {{and the quality of}} the script. In 2012, SFX named it the tenth best TV pilot in the science fiction and fantasy genre, saying that it [...] "brought us everything we came to expect from the show". The plot for [...] "Pilot" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1995 by Les Martin, under the title X Marks the Spot.|$|E
