More than half the people surveyed during a 2005–2006 poll declared themselves satisfied (62.3%) or very satisfied (3.3%) with the activity of the county police department. The study found the highest satisfaction with car traffic supervision, the presence of officers in the street, and road education; on the negative side, corruption and public transport safety remain concerns.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house.

The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961.

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning.

5|$|Beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} {{have noticed}} that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime {{is closely related to}} two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hendon, London, Philip Stuart was {{the second}} of six {{children}} to a schoolteacher, Edward Leopold Milner-Barry, who died in 1917, and his wife, Edith Mary. A talented chess player, he won the first British Boys' Championship in 1923. He was a pupil at Cheltenham College, and won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained firsts in classics and moral sciences. He represented Cambridge in chess. At Cambridge, he befriended another chess player, C.H.O'D. (Hugh) Alexander, and composed a number of chess puzzles. Between 1929 and 1938 he was a city stockbroker, although he was unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> From 1938, he was the chess correspondent for The Times, succeeded in 1945 by Harry Golombek.|$|E
5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E

5|$|Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (Take My Song; 1952), was {{a musical}} about an old, impoverished {{musician}} who sells his saxophone {{to help his}} former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, {{when he returned to}} Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely. This was followed by Harimau Tjampa (Tiger from Tjampa) in 1953, a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father's death. Set amidst Minang culture, the film featured some of the first nudity in a domestic production and was a considerable critical success.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Charles G.

5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{the sixteenth}} century marked the {{beginning}} of the English Renaissance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of writers William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Sir Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Sir Philip Sidney, as well as great artists, architects (such as Inigo Jones who introduced Italianate architecture to England), and composers such as Thomas Tallis, John Taverner, and William Byrd.|$|E
5|$|In India simple {{artificial}} plant classification {{systems of}} the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Parashara (c. 400 – c. 500 AD), the author of Vṛksayurveda (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: Samiganiya (Fabaceae), Puplikagalniya (Rutaceae), Svastikaganiya (Cruciferae), Tripuspaganiya (Cucurbitaceae), Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae), and Kurcapuspaganiya (Asteraceae). Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the Prthviniraparyam of Udayana, Nyayavindutika of Dharmottara, Saddarsana-samuccaya of Gunaratna, and Upaskara of Sankaramisra.|$|E
