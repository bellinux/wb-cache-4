50|$|Flamethrower fuel {{passed through}} an <b>armoured</b> <b>hose</b> to a {{projector}} mounted {{instead of the}} hull machine gun, meaning that the gunner could use the same sight for either weapon. A key requirement was that the normal operation of the tank was not restricted. In the event the original tank design required only very minor changes and it retained its original main armament. The tank's manoeuvrability was inevitably hampered by having a trailer, though this could be detached by a quick-release mechanism triggered by a Bowden cable.|$|R
50|$|Steel <b>wire</b> <b>armoured</b> cable, {{commonly}} abbreviated as SWA, is a hard-wearing {{power cable}} {{designed for the}} supply of mains electricity. It {{is one of a}} number of armoured electrical cables - which include 11 kV Cable and 33 kV Cable - and is found in underground systems, power networks and cable ducting.|$|R
5000|$|The Harvey {{flamethrower}} {{was introduced}} in August 1940, it was made mostly made from readily available parts such as wheels from agricultural equipment manufacturers and commercially available compressed air cylinders. It comprised a welded steel cylinder containing 22 gallons (100 l) of creosote and a standard bottle of compressed nitrogen at [...] mounted on a sack truck of the type that a railway station porter might use. 25 ft of <b>armoured</b> <b>hose</b> provided the connection to a 4 ft lance with a nozzle and some paraffin soaked cotton waste that was set alight to provide a source of ignition. In operation, the pressure in the fuel container was raised to about [...] causing a cork in the nozzle to be ejected followed by a jet of fuel lasting about 10 seconds at a range of up to 60 ft. Like the Home Guard Flame Thrower, it was intended as an ambush weapon, {{but in this case}} the operator was able to direct the flames by moving the lance which would be pushed through a hole in otherwise bullet proof cover such as a brick wall.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the static flame traps, mobile units were created. The main design used an otherwise redundant 200 - 300 imp gal tank mounted {{on the back of}} a 30 cwt lorry, just behind the cabin. In the middle of the remaining space was a petrol-driven pump and either side of this was stored 75 ft of <b>armoured</b> rubber <b>hose.</b> Two nozzles were provided with a primitive sight and with spikes for pushing into the ground. Gas tubes for chlorine and acetylene gas were provided for ignition. The resulting jets of flame had a range of 60 - 70 ft.|$|R
50|$|In 1853, Horsfall had {{patented}} a {{heat treatment}} process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and umbrella frames. The firm made the <b>armoured</b> <b>wire</b> for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1,600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months. The strengthened wire also {{made possible the}} construction of aeroplanes and automobiles. The company today also makes springs.|$|R
500|$|Following the {{downfall}} of the Ngô family, the White House came under pressure from the South Vietnamese public to take a hard line against Cẩn. Mass graves containing 200 bodies were found on his land. The US consul in Huế, John Helble, confirmed the existence of rows of 18th-century style dungeons with filthy, dark cells in an old French arsenal. Although junta member General Trần Văn Đôn asserted that the compound predated the Diệm era, the town's citizens saw Cẩn as a mass murderer. On 4 November, two days after the coup ended, thousands of irate townspeople walked three kilometres to Cẩn's house on the city's southern outskirts — where he lived with his aged mother — demanding vengeance. The junta had ringed the home with barbed <b>wire</b> and <b>armoured</b> cars, sensing that the populace would riot and attack Cẩn. By this time, Cẩn had escaped to a Catholic seminary, but was considering applying to the Americans for political asylum. The U.S. State Department was faced with a dilemma: sheltering Cẩn would associate them with the protection of a corrupt and authoritarian regime that had killed and tortured hundreds of thousands of its own people. Allowing Cẩn to be attacked by angry mobs would damage the reputation of the new American-backed junta. The State Department instructed: ...|$|R
25|$|Once the Allied {{troops had}} taken the passes, they gained control of the heights {{overlooking}} Gondar and reached the town on 23 November. The garrison of Gondar was seriously depleted, since many Askari, having gone unpaid by the Italians, had deserted. The final assault on Gondar, where Nasi had his headquarters, started at 5:30 a.m. on 27 November. The Azozo airfield was the initial objective; it was captured by midday of 27 November and shortly afterwards, Commonwealth troops reached the Fasilides Castle. At 4:30 p.m., while the Kenya Armoured Car Regiment penetrated {{the outskirts of the}} town, Nasi sent his last message to Italy, explaining that the reserve brigade had been deployed on the southern front but had been unable to stop the attack, that enemy troops had passed the barbed <b>wire</b> and enemy <b>armoured</b> vehicles had entered the town. Nasi surrendered soon after. Some Italian outposts fought on until 30 November, marking the end of the battle.|$|R
25|$|James Horsfall was a {{wire drawer}} from Digbeth who invented {{high tensile steel}} wire. He moved to Hay Mill, a disused blade and sword factory at a water mill on the River Cole, {{rebuilding}} it as a steam-driven mill. The mill originally belonged to Hay Hall in Tyseley. In 1855 his company merged with Joseph Webster's of Penn Mill, Sutton Coldfield. He was a major manufacturer and exporter of the piano wire to Europe in 1824. In 1853 Horsfall had patented a heat treatment process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and umbrella frames.

5000|$|Sparked by {{the killings}} in Huế on Vesak, the Buddhists {{organised}} nationwide mass {{protests against the}} religious bias of the Diệm regime throughout the summer of 1963, demanding religious equality. The protests were met with brutal crackdowns, including ARVN Special Forces attacks on Buddhist pagodas which left hundreds missing, presumed dead. As public discontent heightened, a group of ARVN officers planned and carried out a US-backed coup in November. This came about after Cẩn's protégé Tôn Thất Đính, a 37-year-old who became the youngest ever general in the ARVN due to his loyalty to the Diệm regime, switched sides and helped the coup when his corps was expected to remain loyal. Diệm and Nhu were executed {{at the conclusion of}} the coup. [...] Following the downfall of the Ngô family, the White House came under pressure from the South Vietnamese public to take a hard line against Cẩn.

The State Department instructed: [...] asylum should be granted to Ngô Đình Cẩn if he is in physical danger from any source. If asylum granted explain to Huế authorities further violence would harm international reputation new regime. Also recall to them that U.S. took similar action to protect Thích Trí Quang from the Diệm government and can do no less in Can case.|$|R
