2500|$|On June 19, 1942 O'Hare assumed {{command of}} VF-3, {{relieving}} Lieutenant Commander Thach. He was relocated to Maui, Hawaii, to instruct other pilots in combat tactics. U.S. Navy policy {{was to use}} its best combat pilots to train newer pilots, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese practice of keeping their best pilots flying combat missions. Ensign Edward L. [...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's going to do is a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the time you go into it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll come right around, and when he bottoms out of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever you take off and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered. If you want to survive this War, you have to look behind you every chance you get. Even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> the trigger, be sure to look behind because there's gonna be someone back there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! yes, I {{know all}} that. But you can't help people, Jon; they're hopeless. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> them out they only get into another hole. Look at them, still {{fighting}} and plotting and struggling, though they're dying in heaps all the time. Idiots!" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> {{out three}} balls in 1973, {{what was going}} through people's minds was, 'I saw a {{deformed}} midget do that once.' But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> out three balls in the '80s, it was, 'a guy in my dorm room used to do that.' Penn Jillette ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You might if {{you threw}} the pistol at the bear <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> the trigger," [...] laughed Jerry. [...] "Sure {{as you are}} born, Blumpo, that pistol will go to pieces {{if you try to}} fire it." ...|$|R
6000|$|UNDERSHAFT Vote! Bah! <b>When</b> <b>you</b> vote, {{you only}} change {{the names of}} the cabinet. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> shoot, <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> down governments, inaugurate new epochs, abolish old orders and set up new. Is that {{historically}} true, Mr Learned Man, or is it not? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon we'll go north," [...] said Deering thoughtfully. [...] "They {{talk about}} new railroads, {{but so far}} the only line of {{communication}} between the Rockies and the sea is the C. P. R. track. The settlements follow the line, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> out of the narrow belt you're in the wilderness. The police will, no doubt, reckon on your trying to make Vancouver. We'll stop in the wilds and let them watch the railroad until they get tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let them throw another rope," [...] the {{smuggler}} said, [...] "and you can haul him on board too. It won't make much matter whether I slip the noose round his body or his neck. The last {{will be the}} easiest plan perhaps, for then, if he happens not to be alive <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> him out, {{it would be an}} accident; and even if anyone chooses to peach, they can't swear that it was purposely done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Jill,--It's {{too bad you}} can't {{come over}} to see me. I am pretty well, but awful tired of keeping still. I {{want to see you}} ever so much. Frank has fixed us a telegraph, so we can write and send things. Won't it be jolly! I can't look out to see him do it; but, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> your string, my little bell rings, and I know a message is coming. I send you an orange. Do you like gorver jelly? People send in lots of goodies, and we will go halves. Good-by.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dollars and cents," [...] said Harvey, {{delighted to}} think that he was making an impression. [...] "Cold dollars and cents." [...] He thrust a hand into a pocket, and threw out his stomach a little, which was his way of being grand. [...] "You've done the best day's work you ever did in your life <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> me in. I'm all the son Harvey Cheyne has." ...|$|R
50|$|But heck, the pay wasn't bad. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> {{were called}} to the bridge to help get the system back online, you noticed {{for the first time}} a stack of 62 CD-ROMs jammed behind the computer. Your heart sank <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> them out and {{realized}} they were the install disks for a stolen beta copy of the Klingon version of Windows 95 (the 2395 version, build #12564). You never realized the ship was in such a sad shape.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what it is, sir,' she said; 'bogies is all kinds and sorts of things--except bogies! Rats and mice, and beetles; and creaky doors, and loose slates, and broken panes, and stiff drawer handles, that stay out <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> them and then fall {{down in the middle of}} the night. Look at the {{wainscot}} of the room! It is old--hundreds of years old! Do you think there's no rats and beetles there! And do you imagine, sir, that you won't see none of them? Rats is bogies, I tell you, and bogies is rats; and don't you get to think anything else!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 13. The next point is, {{what shape}} are the petals of? And that is easier asked than answered; for <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> them off, you find they won't lie flat, by any means, but are {{each of them}} cups, or rather shells, themselves; and that it {{requires}} as much conchology as would describe a cockle, before you can properly give account of a single poppy leaf. Or of a single any leaf--for all leaves are either shells, or boats, (or solid, if not hollow, masses,) and cannot be represented in flat outline. But, laying these as flat as they will lie {{on a sheet of}} paper, you will find the piece they hide of the paper they lie on can be drawn; giving approximately the shape of the outer leaf as at A, that of the inner as at B, Fig. 4; which you will find very difficult lines to draw, for they are each composed of two curves, joined, as in Fig. 5; all above the line a b being {{the outer edge of the}} leaf, but joined so subtly to the side that the least break in drawing the line spoils the form.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the way," [...] {{said the}} boy who had studied mechanics. [...] "You take a saw, and then, about two feet from the ground, you begin and saw down diagonally, for {{a foot and a}} half, to the centre of the trunk. Then you go on the other side, and saw down in the same way, the two outs meeting each other. Now you have {{the upper part of the}} trunk ending in a wedge, which fits into a cleft in the lower part of the trunk. Then, about nine inches below the place where you first began to saw, you bore a hole {{straight}} through both sides of the cleft and the wedge between them. Then you put an iron bolt through this hole, and you have your tree on a hinge, only she wont be apt to move because she fits in so snug and tight. Then you get a long rope, and put one end in a slipknot loosely around the trunk. Then you get a lot of poles, and tie them end to end, and push this slip-knot up until it is somewhere near the top, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> it tight. Then you take another rope with a slip-knot, and push this a little more than half-way up the trunk. By having two ropes, that way, you prevent too much strain coming on any one part of the trunk. Then, after that, you take a mallet and chisel and round off the lower corners of the wedge, so that it will turn easily in the cleft. Then we take hold of the ropes, let her down gently, pick off the fruit, and haul her up again. That will all be easy enough." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{the first}} doll created by Shindana Toys was named [...] "Baby Nancy," [...] many later Shindana Toys dolls {{featured}} ethnically correct names, including names that were Swahili in origin. Operation Bootstrap contracted with Mattel Toymakers {{to create a}} talking voice unit, {{just like the one}} invented for Chatty Cathy in 1960, for their doll Tamu in 1971. The popular Talking Tamu (Swahili for [...] "sweet") doll was designed to say the following 11 phrases <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> her [...] "talking ring": ...|$|R
5000|$|Dungeon - A foreboding {{wooden door}} {{around the back}} of Cinderellas castle had a wooden {{shuttered}} window with a hand-letterd sign next to a lever stating [...] "Look if <b>you</b> dare". <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> the lever to open the shutter and looked in through the barred window, you observed a creepy, blacklight illuminated dungeon filled with cobwebs, and other creepy things, many of which became animated <b>when</b> <b>you</b> activated the lever. A pair of severed heads rotated on pillars, a spider rose and fell just in front of you. An creepy shrouded ghoul {{at the back of the}} dungeon suddenly lurched forward toward you. It took courage for a young child to peek in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, if {{you make}} a howling mistake," [...] Collins told them, [...] "that's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> all <b>pull</b> the wires like mad and poke the leader and whirl him around.

25|$|Aiki is to <b>pull</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are pushed, and to push <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>pulled.</b> It is {{the spirit}} of {{slowness}} and speed, of harmonizing your movement with your opponent's ki. Its opposite, kiai, is to push to the limit, while aiki never resists. The term aiki has been used since ancient times and {{is not unique to}} Daito-ryu. The ki in aiki is go no sen, meaning to respond to an attack.|$|R
5000|$|... "Prutyk" [...] (may also be spelled [...] "prutik") is {{the bunch}} (switch or stick) that is created <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> {{together}} each bunch of three threads together using hem-stitch. In Ukrainian, [...] "prutyk" [...] is simply {{another name for}} 'simple hemstitch' (i.e.: [...] "merezhka-prutyk"), or it can mean each tiny 'bunch' in the hemstitching.|$|E

We see why it makes sense for a cows bell to ring <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pull</b> its tail, how Mickey stretches and squishes when going up in an elevator, and other examples.|$|E

5000|$|Blaze was a rocking-horse toy {{produced}} by Mattel toymakers and introduced in 1961. Blaze was featured prominently during children's television advertising (Mattel {{was the very}} first toymaker to advertise year around with television commercials). Unlike other rocking-horses of the time, Blaze was mounted on a stand that {{was said to be}} [...] "untippable" [...] and had no springs. The apparatus prevented pinched fingers, and was fitted out with a mechanism that moved the horses legs in [...] "real life action." [...] Another Mattel feature allowed Blaze to talk <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> his [...] "Magic Ring." [...] His talking voice unit was the very same one {{produced by}} Mattel and unveiled in 1960 in its talking Chatty Cathy doll, and later toys like the Talking Mister Ed puppet. Blaze could say 11 different things like, [...] "How about some hay?"; he could also whinny and neigh. A toy like this, that could gallop and move realistically when the horse was rocked forward and backward, was something special.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you really}} must know, she is an old nurse of my wife's, Rose Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary. We brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13 Firbank Villas--mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes--and had her {{carefully}} tended, as Christian folk should. On the third day she died--certificate says senile decay--but that's only the doctor's opinion, {{and of course you}} know better. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o'clock to-morrow morning. Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You've made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to it. I'd give something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pulled</b> aside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only found a poor old woman of ninety." ...|$|R
