500|$|The main talking {{point after}} the race was Hamilton's {{assertion}} {{that he would have}} preferred to go on a different strategy compared to his teammate to have a chance of passing him, an option denied by his team.

[...] Meanwhile, the Daily Mails Jonathan McEvoy agreed with Mercedes' call, saying that it was [...] "a no-brainer for Mercedes to keep their drivers comfortably first and second by the safest means".|$|E
