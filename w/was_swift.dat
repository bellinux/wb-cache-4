5|$|On 18 March, the Cambodian National Assembly deposed Sihanouk {{and named}} Lon Nol as {{provisional}} head of state. This led Sihanouk to immediately establish a government-in-exile in Beijing and to ally himself with North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge, the NLF, and the Laotian Pathet Lao. In doing so, Sihanouk lent {{his name and}} popularity {{in the rural areas}} of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. The North Vietnamese response to the coup <b>was</b> <b>swift.</b> PAVN began directly supplying large amounts of weapons and advisors to the Khmer Rouge, and Cambodia plunged into civil war.|$|E
5|$|Reaction <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Nintendo's shares {{went down}} 400 yen (almost 5%) the {{following}} morning to 12,200 yen as news of the incident spread. Nintendo produces the game upon which the Pokémon anime series is based. Then-president of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi, said {{at a press conference}} the day after the episode had aired that the video game company was not responsible since the original Pokémon game for its Game Boy product was presented in black and white.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 10 February, about 50 Vietnamese {{soldiers}} (Tirailleurs indochinois) of the 4th Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles within the Yen Bay garrison turned on their French officers with assistance from about sixty civilian VNQDDĐ members who invaded the camp from the outside. The mutiny failed within 24 hours when {{the majority of}} the Vietnamese soldiers in the garrison refused to participate and remained loyal to the colonial army. Further sporadic attacks occurred across the Delta region, with little impact. French retribution to the attack <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and decisive. The main leaders of the VNQDD were arrested, tried and put to death, effectively ending the military threat of what was previously the leading Vietnamese nationalist revolutionary organisation.|$|E

5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors <b>was</b> <b>swift.</b> If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E
5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E
5|$|The genre {{entered a}} new level {{following}} the release of Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition. The backlash against gangster films <b>was</b> <b>swift.</b> In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E

25|$|The {{response}} <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and multifaceted. Boer commandos mobilised under Piet Retief and inflicted {{a defeat}} on the Xhosa in the Winterberg Mountains in the north. Burgher and Khoi commandos also mobilised, and British Imperial troops arrived via Algoa Bay.|$|E
25|$|In a March 6, 1889 {{obituary}} Franklin B.

25|$|Construction {{not only}} progressed south from the Christchurch end and north from Dunedin, {{but also from}} the {{intermediate}} ports of Timaru and Oamaru in both directions. Construction <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> through the 1870s, and on 4 February 1876, Christchurch was linked with Timaru. Just under a year later, on 1 February 1877, the line was complete all the way from Christchurch to Oamaru in north Otago.|$|E

Bill Dukes of Taste of Country wrote: [...] "It <b>was</b> clear <b>Swift</b> <b>was</b> just the voice for Maya Thompson..."

50|$|Mantis Caves: The {{water in}} these caves <b>are</b> <b>swift,</b> {{so you have}} to <b>be</b> <b>swift</b> to fight their current. Stalagmites can be picked up and thrown to impale the opponents, and some statues found here are not as stable as they might appear. Be warned, though; the maze-like layout of the caves can be a bit disorienting to the inexperienced.|$|R
25|$|At the Invercargill end, {{construction}} <b>was</b> <b>swift,</b> and Gore {{was reached}} on 30 August 1875. From here, undulating countryside necessitated heavier earthworks to Balclutha, completing the route from Dunedin to Invercargill, and construction was completed on 22 January 1879. As {{the line from}} Dunedin to Christchurch had been finished on 7 September 1878, this created a rail link {{all the way from}} Invercargill to Christchurch and completed the Main South Line.|$|E
25|$|Recognition of Pfeiffer's {{early work}} on Callimachus <b>was</b> <b>swift,</b> and in 1923, with Wilamowitz's endorsement, he was {{appointed}} to the professorship at Humboldt University of Berlin that had been vacated by Eduard Fraenkel when he moved on to the University of Kiel. Later in the very same year Pfeiffer took over the position at Frankfurt that Karl Reinhardt had vacated at Hamburg, only to move on again in 1927 to Freiburg. Finally, in 1929 he returned to his alma mater as a professor alongside Schwartz at Munich.|$|E
25|$|Reaction to Obama's speech <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and {{widespread}} in the United States. Politicians, news media, members of the political punditry, academics, and other groups and individuals quickly weighed in on its significance and effectiveness. In the days following the speech, commentators debated (among other questions) its possible importance to American history, {{the extent to which}} Obama did or did not succeed in pushing questions about his association with Jeremiah Wright to the side, and the overall effect the speech would have on Obama's campaign and the contest with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.|$|E

25|$|Twice slave rebellions {{broke out}} in Virginia: Gabriel's Rebellion in 1800, and Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. White {{reaction}} <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and harsh, and militias killed many innocent free blacks and black slaves {{as well as those}} directly involved in the rebellions. After the second rebellion, the legislature passed laws restricting the rights of free people of color: they were excluded from bearing arms, serving in the militia, gaining education, and assembling in groups. As bearing arms and serving in the militia were considered obligations of free citizens, free blacks came under severe constraints after Nat Turner's rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Some of the world's {{foremost}} HIV experts {{had written}} to courts and the Libyan government on the medics' behalf, blaming the epidemic on poor hygiene practices in the hospital. The epidemic is the largest documented outbreak of HIV within a hospital in history, {{and it was the}} first time HIV/AIDS became a public issue in Libya. Two of the world's foremost HIV experts, Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi, supported the medics' case, and reaction to their convictions <b>was</b> <b>swift,</b> with a number of appeals from scientific and human rights organizations, and various official condemnations of the verdict along with diplomatic initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to reinvigorate}} the Venetian cause, Morosini himself {{returned}} to the Morea in 1693. His advanced age denied him the chance to prove his abilities again, however, and on 16 January 1694, he died at Nafplion. His successor Zeno, {{against the advice of}} his officers, led an expedition against the rich island of Chios, off the coast of Asia Minor. The island was taken easily, but the Turkish response <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and massive. A double naval battle near the Oinousses Islands in February 1695 resulted in a Venetian defeat, and forced a humiliating Venetian withdrawal from Chios.|$|E

25|$|Meade was {{hampered}} {{during the}} retreat and pursuit {{not only by}} his alleged timidity and his willingness to defer to the cautious judgment of his subordinate commanders, but because his army was exhausted. The advance to Gettysburg <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and tiring, followed by the largest battle of the war. The pursuit of Lee was physically demanding, through inclement weather and over difficult roads much longer than his opponent's. Enlistments expired, causing depletion of his ranks, as did the New York Draft Riots, which occupied thousands of men that could have reinforced the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
25|$|However, {{while the}} Christian {{states did not}} make any attempt to exploit the victory, the Turks' {{reaction}} <b>was</b> <b>swift.</b> In 1388 a 30,000 strong army commanded by Ali Pasha passed through the eastern Balkan Mountains and struck deep into Bulgaria's north. The Bulgarians were completely surprised and the invaders seized Ovech, Shumen, Madara and other towns. Due to the surprise campaign at first the towns and the castles were unable to organize proper defence but after the initial shock the Bulgarians took precautions. When the army of Ali Pasha besieged Varna, the defenders stiffly resisted and the Turks were forced to abandon the siege and march northwards.|$|E
25|$|German {{reaction}} to the landing <b>was</b> <b>swift</b> and their reconnaissance patrols were in the area within 20 minutes and the British base located and attacked within 24 hours. Avoiding a pitched battle the three patrols split up {{and for the next}} seven days disrupted German convoys and demolition parties. In response to the British presence a German brigade was detailed to locate the force and a division, held back in reserve instead of moving to reinforce the front line. During their search for the parachutists amongst other casualties, the Germans captured the detachments signallers and radio contact with the New Zealand division was lost when the detachments sole remaining radio was damaged.|$|E
