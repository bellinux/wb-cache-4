5|$|Cloud cover {{over the}} target and bad radio {{communication}} meant the B-24 formation broke up. The smaller B-24 formation lost their way and crossed into the Netherlands near Woensdrecht. After wandering over North Netherlands they turned north towards the North Sea where they ditched their bombs. II. and IV./JG 1 took off from Woensdrecht and München-Gladbach to intercept while 5. and 6./JG 1 refuelled at Schiphol. 4./JG 1 made one pass at the bombers and two Liberators were claimed but not confirmed. 12./JG 1 intercepted over Terschelling, downing two Liberators. Of these, one <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> collision with a downed Fw-190 that cut the bomber's tail, 12./JG 1's only loss.|$|E

DNA testing by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century. These distinct horses were separated from the other horses and the BLM placed two groups in separate areas of Steens Mountain to preserve the breed. Seven horses were placed in the Riddle Mountain Herd Management Area (HMA) and twenty in the Kiger HMA.|$|E

Later that day, the system passed near the northern Leeward Islands; however, the depression was poorly organized.

5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate.

5|$|The Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–48 was waged between Venetian and Ottoman forces {{against the}} Albanians under George Kastrioti Skanderbeg.

Skanderbeg, then ally of the Dukagjini family, moved against several Venetian held towns along the Albanian coastline, in order to pressure the Venetians into restoring Dagnum. In response, the Republic sent a local force to relieve the besieged fortress of Dagnum, and urged the Ottoman Empire to send an expeditionary force into Albania. At that time the Ottomans were already besieging the fortress of Svetigrad, stretching Skanderbeg's efforts thin.|$|E
