500|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 Premier League season, Barton was {{not given}} a squad number by QPR. Towards {{the end of the}} season, however, {{chairman}} Tony Fernandes identified the loss of Barton as a factor in the club's poor performance and relegation from the Premier League, saying: [...] "We missed Joey. [...] We needed a workhorse midfielder and <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Scott Parker. We missed a real leader." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} time Oxford had won five {{consecutive}} races since 1913 and was the [...] "closest finish since at least the turn of the century." [...] Laurie recalls his attempts to emulate his father's rowing career as [...] "feeble". Rankov, rowing in the third of his six Boat Races, recalls the race as one of his most memorable. [...] He continued: [...] "It was unbelievable. [...] They kept coming at us and every time <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away nothing happened." [...] Woodhouse lamented: [...] "All I can say is that we shouldn't have lost by so much." ...|$|E
500|$|One cut Goldenberg had to make, {{which he}} [...] "hated" [...] to do, was {{the absence of}} Quidditch, the Wizarding sport. [...] "The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had {{included}} the Quidditch subplot {{would have been a}} lesser film", he said. In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. [...] "Ron facing challenges and coming into his own {{in the same way that}} Harry is, <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. So, you feel like, if not the details of that story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film". The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been [...] "quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff".|$|E
25|$|Elicitation {{of point}} {{estimates}} – Here, <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an estimate (in a single value) of something. For example, estimating {{the weight of}} an object, or the release date of a product or probability of success of a project etc. as are seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome. Essentially, <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the average value of the estimates provided by the members in the crowd.|$|R

6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that we {{had better}} watch the race from these railings. Your gown will be spoilt in the crowd if <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the paddock, and you {{probably}} wouldn't get anywhere {{in time to see}} it." ...|$|R
500|$|During the mid 1960s, {{pop music}} made {{repeated}} forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word [...] "progressive" [...] was frequently used, {{and it was}} thought that every song and single was to be a [...] "progression" [...] from the last. The Beatles' Paul McCartney intimated in 1967: [...] "we [...] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into something else. Then came [...] Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys.... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing." [...] Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers.|$|E
500|$|In 1966, {{the level}} of social and artistic {{correspondence}} among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the vernacular traditions of rock. Progressive rock was predicated on the [...] "progressive" [...] pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. The Beatles' Paul McCartney said in 1967: [...] "we [...] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into something else. Then came Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys. ... We're all trying to do vaguely {{the same kind of}} thing." [...] Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signalling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the [...] "underground" [...] and the [...] "establishment" [...] for listening publics.|$|E
2500|$|Actor Shia LaBeouf was unimpressed {{with the}} film, stating [...] "We got lost. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> bigger. It's {{what happens to}} sequels. It's like, how do you top the first one? You've got to go bigger. Michael Bay went so big that it became too big, and I think you lost the anchor of the movie...You lost {{a bit of the}} relationships. Unless you have those relationships, then the movie doesn't matter. Then it's just a bunch of robots {{fighting}} each other." [...] Bay has admitted his disappointment with the film and has apologized, saying the film was [...] "crap" [...] and blaming the 2007–2008 Writers' Strike, saying [...] "It was very hard to put (the sequel) together that quickly after the writers' strike (of 2007–08)".|$|E
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{a handle}} on whether {{capacity}} expansion timing patterns in oligopoly among incumbents are followed. We study the United Kingdom ´s petroleum refining industry between 1948 and 1998. Using fixed-effects logit models, we find that U. K. ´s refiners have not followed any definite capacity expansion-timing pattern. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down <b>to</b> {{our camp}} now we'll be soaked," [...] said Snap, as they {{gathered}} under the semi-protection {{of a large}} hemlock tree. [...] "The underbrush is loaded with water, {{and if there is}} anything I hate it is to have a wet bough slash me in the face or breast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} best thing we can do," [...] said Snap, [...] "is to stay around here somewhere and start a good big camp-fire. If <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> our camp we may get lost and also take our death of cold. The quicker we start a fire the better it will be for us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tony La Russa {{while with}} the Oakland A's is {{frequently}} named as the innovator of the position, making Dennis Eckersley {{the first player}} to be used almost exclusively in ninth inning situations. La Russa explained that [...] " [...] be ahead a large number of games every week ... That's a lot of work for somebody throwing more than one inning ... Also, there was the added advantage of [...] not getting overexposed. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> [...] to only face three or four batters an outing." [...] Baseball teams often copy one another, following a strategy based on one team's success. In 1990, Bobby Thigpen set a record with 57saves while breaking Franco's one-inning saves record with 41. Francisco Rodríguez set the current record with 54 one-inning saves in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{documentary}} short that profiled Hank, his mother related how doctors {{had told her}} that Hank's liver was damaged, and that she didn't know how long he had to live, and that she [...] "didn't know what to do." [...] Hank had been in rehab before, as well as court-mandated detox, and it had never worked. [...] Once Hank was even kicked out of Alcoholics Anonymous because he brought into the meeting a bottle of Mad Dog 20-20 and started drinking it five seconds after the meeting started. [...] Regarding trying to get Hank help for his alcoholism, Howard Stern explained, [...] "People always asked me if <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him to stop drinking, and I said all the time we did..." [...] Stern also related that there were employees of the show who tried to get Hank into programs.|$|E
2500|$|The news {{asserted}} that both tour plans with Blink-182 in August 2009 and new album production [...] "will continue as previously announced," [...] and the announcement {{ended with the}} teaser for a [...] "surprise" [...] soon to come. The following day, Alternative Press broke the news that [...] "New Perspective", the first song recorded without Ross and Walker, debuted the following month on radio and {{as a part of}} the soundtrack to the film Jennifer's Body. [...] "New Perspective" [...] was recorded in spring 2009, when the band had just moved out to Topanga. Smith explained the song was inspired by the band's new experiences when there: [...] "We're living near the ocean and going surfing every day, which we've never done before. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that out in the song, I guess." [...] The band reinserted the exclamation mark into its name a few days after the departure of Ross and Walker.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} in the end we know nothing is just a logical {{consequence}} of Cimrman's externism. The example with the chalk showed that in the learning process, when <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> nearer <b>to</b> an object, we always reach a place where the object is not. Therefore, in the end of the process, we know nothing but we know it exactly.|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{is to be}} done?" [...] Ben asked. [...] "If <b>we</b> were <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up sail {{again we}} should drift away so far to leeward we should {{never be able to}} beat back." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The Sir Charles Grandison {{business}} {{is done and}} gone. That's what you mean, I suppose? Don't {{you think we should}} find it very heavy if <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it back again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently {{the yacht}} came in sight, and <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{him to put}} us on board; {{but he was too}} weak, and just before Bob saw us he breathed his last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, Jerry," [...] Harry {{shouted to}} the other boat, which was some twenty yards ahead. [...] "The chief thinks they have gone to cut us off {{at the head of}} the cañon, which is likely enough.

If <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across, <b>we</b> might make a splash. If we go the other side, we'll pass close under the steamer's rail. She's a pretty big boat; they'll have a Sereno on board, and keep harbor watch. If somebody hailed us, it might bring the port-guard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know how}} she is," [...] {{explained}} Deborah. [...] "She's worked so long she don't know how to rest. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her to lie down for an hour but she wouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{something}} of a sentimentalist; I don't know if you are right or not. When I built Dryholm <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the feeling Langrigg gives one, {{as far as it}} could be expressed by line. But do you like Whitelees?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Car broke down; <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across," [...] Jake replied. [...] "Saw the Langrigg hill when {{we started}} and then the fog came on.

6000|$|... "There's {{something}} that doesn't mind us," [...] he resumed presently. [...] "It isn't what <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that <b>we</b> get, it isn't the good {{we think we}} do is good. What makes us happy isn't our trying, what makes others happy isn't our trying. There's a sort of character people like and stand up for and a sort they won't. You got {{to work it out}} and take the consequences.... Miriam was always trying." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since {{approximately}} 20 years {{process management}} {{is regarded as}} in-novative technology both for the description of complex applications and for supporting their execution. Soon after {{the beginning of this}} process era, an in-flation of process management systems started to flood the market. However, many users were very frustrated when they had to experience that these process management systems did not support their applications properly. One of the main causes for failing process applications was that process management was totally underestimated. In this contribution <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of proc-ess management, i. e. we reconstruct the real requirements of process manage-ment which are the basis for the construction of working process solutions...|$|R
