500|$|Presley's {{physical}} attractiveness {{and sexual}} appeal were widely acknowledged. [...] "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", {{in the words}} of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, [...] "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> presence." [...] His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as [...] "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl." [...] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as [...] "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America." [...] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.|$|E
2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait {{to get back in the}} dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you." ...|$|E

If I was a drunken, desp'rate character, without shame or hope, I'd follow it. If I <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> place and you was in mine I'd say: 'Marshal, I'm willin' to swear if you'll give me the chance I'll quit the racket. I'll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play, and won't play hoss no more. I'll be a good citizen and go to work and quit my foolishness. So help me God!' That's what I'd say to you if you was marshal and I <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> place." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{relative}} clause puzzle concerns a systematic {{and not yet}} understood difference between finite and infinitival relatives in English. Earlier work on the topic (see, for example, Chomsky and Lasnik 1977, Rizzi 1990, Déprez 1995 for discussion) has not yet provided a satisfactory account of the pattern illustrated here. In infinitival subject (1) and non-subject (2) -(3) {{relative clause}}s an overt relative pronoun is excluded. Only the empty operator is possible. (1) a. The man [Op [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The man [who [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (2) a. The book [Op [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The book [which [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (3) a. A linguist [Op [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *A linguist [whom [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. This restriction does not hold for finite relative clauses. As shown in the (b) -examples below, an overt wh-element can <b>be</b> used <b>in</b> all corresponding finite relative sentences: (4) a. *The man [Op [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. The man [who [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office...|$|R
