5000|$|Orange, {{like other}} mobile networks, offered an [...] "Internet Everywhere" [...] tariff on pay as you go, pay monthly and {{business}} plans. The tariffs names for pay monthly were {{aligned with the}} animals theme in May 2010 and Orange offered both Dolphin and Racoon plans for internet use available on both 1 month and 12 month contracts. In August 2011, the price plans were revised, and names changed to Small, Medium, and Large. Similar to with home broadband, Orange mobile customers received a £5 discount on their mobile broadband plan. The business plans remained as [...] "Business Everywhere". The 12 month plans came with a USB modem (or dongle) for free. The customer was required to pay a small price for the dongle on the 1 month plans. A portable <b>WiFi</b> <b>dongle</b> could also be purchased, dubbed [...] "Mobile WiFi". The service operated across the network's EDGE, 3G, HSDPA and HSUPA network and offered speeds of up to 3.6 Mbit/s. Orange announced in June 2008 that this speed would be increased to 7.2Mbit/s in the top 30 UK cities and 14.4 Mbit/s in the top 5 cities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the Suprima has remained largely unchanged {{when compared to the}} Prevé's. Nonetheless, several improvements were made which contributed to an overall increase in the Suprima's visual and ergonomic appeal. The new Proton Infotainment System, equipped standard in all Suprimas is an advanced Android OS-powered 7" [...] LCD touchscreen head unit which doubles as a GPS/SatNav system, DVD player and in-car web browser. The system also has Bluetooth, USB, iPod and WiFi compatibility. However, the user can only browse the internet, access YouTube, watch DVDs and play Android-based games when the handbrake is engaged, as a safety precaution. Audio output is channelled to four speakers in the Executive trim, but the Premium trim offers an additional two A-pillar mounted tweeters, bringing the grand total up to six speakers. The whole system is connected to the internet over a WiMAX network under an agreement between Proton and the Malaysian ISP, Yes 4G. A <b>WiFi</b> <b>dongle</b> provided with the Suprima is used to set up a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) within the car itself, thus offering on-the-go broadband with coverage in all major Malaysian cities and towns as well as across the Malaysian Expressway System, with download speeds of up to 20Mbit/s. However, the broadband services may cease if the car is driven into areas without Yes 4G coverage, or into neighbouring Singapore or Thailand. Nonetheless, Proton has made up for this with the ability to divert or bridge an internet connection using a smartphone or another portable hotspot instead. Furthermore, the built-in GPS system does not require an internet connection to function, as it operates independently over Telekom Malaysia's Lokatoo service. The Suprima is the third Proton car to offer internet based services, the first being a limited edition of the Proton Inspira, and the second being its sister car, the Prevé.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} low-layer attacks against WiFi can be {{implemented}} using user-modifiable firmware. Hence cheap off-the-shelf <b>WiFi</b> <b>dongles</b> can be used carry out advanced attacks. We demonstrate this by implementing five low-layer attacks using open source Atheros firmware. The first attack consists of unfair channel usage, giving the user a higher throughput while reducing that of others. The second attack defeats countermeasures designed to prevent unfair channel usage. The third attack performs continuous jamming, making the channel unusable for other devices. For the fourth attack we implemented a selective jammer, allowing one to jam specific frames already in the air. The fifth is a novel channel-based Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, enabling reliable manipulation of encrypted traffic. These low-layer attacks facilitate novel attacks against higher-layer protocols. To demonstrate this we show how our MitM attack facilitates attacks against the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) when used as a group cipher. Since {{a substantial number of}} networks still use TKIP as their group cipher, this shows that weaknesses in TKIP have a higher impact than previously thought. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} the Intelligent Shopping Mall based on the Cellular Automata model we need to concretize the concept of cell. A cell can be implemented by using a low-cost micro-computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi 2 single-board computer 1) that can be equipped with a sensor to detect the presence of shoppers and receive their wishlists, an actuator to send recommendations to the shoppers, and a wireless mechanism to communicate with its neighbors. Such a micro-computer is installed at each zone of the mall. The sensor device can be realized by using a Bluetooth or other alternatives (low-energy Bluetooth, ZigBee [32]). The {{idea is that the}} sensor over the micro-computer detects the smartphone of the shopper that is in the zone and, thanks to a specific, but simple App running on the phone, it is able to ense the presence of the shopper, identify her and read her wishlist. Sensing the presence and identifying a shopper in a zone are task known as localization. Localization methods in Indoor Navigation Systems can be grouped into four different techniques [8]: (1) dead-reckoning, (2) direct-sensing, (3) triangulation, and (4) pattern-recognition. The proposed approach is based on a direct-sensing localization task. The Bluetooth is used also as an actuator when the cell (micro-computer) has to send recommendation to the shopper in the zone. In the proposed Cellular Automata model, each cell has eight neighbors, thus each micro-computer has to be connected to eight micro-computers. Hardware like Raspberry Pi 2 can be equipped with <b>WiFi</b> <b>dongles</b> enabling networking among them. The cells can be easily programmed by using Java, Python or any other programming language compatible with the Linux-based Operating System installed on the Raspberry Pi 2.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} age, {{we are in}} need of fully {{automated}} attendance logging system. The design of Remote Attendance Logging System and its control is a challenging part.   RFID reader reads the RFID tag, and the details of the tag is logged in the embedded system. The Web based distributed measurement and control is slowly replacing parallel architectures due to its non-crate architecture which reduces complexities. A new kind  of expandable, distributed large attendance logging system based on ARM Cortex M 3   boards has been investigated and developed in this paper, whose hardware boards use 32 -bit RISC processor with <b>wifi</b> <b>dongle</b> attached to its USB port, and software platform use Keil MDK-ARM for firmware and   HTML for man machine interface.   This system can display date and time of log in and log out of a person.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop the {{architecture}} to use the Car 2 X for observation the local traffic sign and displays it on the OpenStreetMap to provide more information of the road side to the driver. The proposed architecture of this thesis is to convert the traffic sign into the barcode and to be scanned by the barcode scanner and then wirelessly transfers the data to the web server to store the data and displays the traffic sign on the OpenStreetMap in the web browser. It uses two Raspberry Pi boards with CAN-Bus shields for transmitting the data on the CAN-Bus system in the car, a barcode scanner to scan the barcode, a GPS module to get its location, and a <b>WiFi</b> <b>dongle</b> to wirelessly send the data. The thesis also includes the camera to detect the traffic light using OpenCV and sends the GO or STOP command to the car. The results provide the OpenStreetMap with the traffic sign which helps the driver to realize the traffic sign on the road of the desired destination. However, the accuracy of GPS is not satisfied {{as well as the}} distance of the barcode scanning, therefore, this thesis suggests that includes the gps position in the barcode and uses the camera to detect the barcode for the improvement in the future...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I present my {{work on the}} {{modeling}} and control of a motor system using the Lego EV 3 robot. The overall goal is to apply introductory systems and controls engineering techniques for estimation and design to a real-world system. First I detail the setup of materials used in this research: the hardware used was the Lego EV 3 robot; the software used was the Student 2014 version of Simulink; a wireless network was used to communicate between them using a Netgear WNA 1100 <b>wifi</b> <b>dongle.</b> Next I explain the approaches used to model the robot’s motor system: from {{a description of the}} basic system components, to data collection through experimentation with a proportionally controlled feedback loop, to parameter estimation (through time-domain specification relationships, Matlab’s curve-fitting toolbox, and a formal least-squares parameter estimation), to the discovery of the effects of frictional disturbance and saturation, and finally to the selection and verification of the final model through comparisons of simulated step responses of the estimated models to the actual time response of the motor system. Next I explore three different types of controllers for use within the motor system: a proportional controller, a lead compensator, and a PID controller. I catalogue the design and performance results – both in simulation and on the real system – of each controller. One controller is then selected to be used within two Controls Systems Engineering final course projects, both involving the robot traveling along a predetermined route. The controller’s performance is analyzed to determine whether it improves upon the accumulation of error in the robot’s position when the projects are executed without control...|$|E
