40|$|I {{invite you}} to join me in a meditation. The {{questions}} below are not requests for informa-tion; they are invitations to experience the sense of human connectedness and shared responsibility that comes from allowing ourselves to wonder, to not understand, to partic-ipate in the repersonalization of the generalized and objectified, to open up space for the future, now-being-realized world, {{the world that we}} create together. Perhaps, too, the questions are answers in themselves, pointing beyond themselves. Think of the “I ” voice as yourself as you read and reflect. Sometimes I am in a conversation, or an argument, or perhaps even a shouting match that goes nowhere, an encounter that produces nothing but heat. Sometimes I feel certain that I know exactly what someone else is about to say and I anticipate, with great conviction, just how wrong-headed it is going to be. Sometimes I feel hopeless about ever being heard, understood, or adequately listened to by a particular person or in some particular conversation or on a particular subject. And sometimes I just get tired of trying to make myself understood. I don’t want to try to explain myself again, or I feel dismissive, or perhaps violent. Sometimes I want to run right over what others say. At times like these, How can I keep from being taken over by hurt, hopelessness, anger, or disrespect? How can I keep from being taken over by the belief that the other person — or group — is really the problem? How can I keep myself from just shutting down? But then, on the other hand, <b>What</b> <b>do</b> I <b>do</b> <b>that</b> shuts others down? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> I <b>do</b> <b>that</b> leaves others feeling insignificant, blank, out of place, silenced, walled off, unwilling to be open when they are with me? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> I <b>do</b> <b>that</b> prompts others to try to convince me of their rightness, of my wrongness, to will their assertions on me, to not speak directly to me — or to ignore my presence or even my very existence...|$|R

Perhaps I was relieved, for I should not have known what to do; yet I feared that he would think me unkind and ungrateful, and I would have begged my mother and Eustace to thank him and make my excuses, but I was too shy, and I felt it very hard to be blamed for indifference and rudeness.|$|R
