In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E

To record what each team did, Russian hired unpaid trainee cameramen. Once the teams were assembled, they were given their challenge: in a year, they had to make £1million. Their first task was to find accommodation for themselves for free for a week. The contestants slowly realised that, despite what their contracts had claimed, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their own food and accommodation, and would essentially be making their own prize money. Some contestants demanded to meet with Russian, who eventually revealed to them that no television channel had actually commissioned his show. Teams 1 and 3 disbanded within two days.|$|E

25|$|Due to an {{expansion}} of the local railway lines, the club was told that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new ground for the 1899–1900 season. After a difficult search the club finally bought some land in the village of Owlerton, which at the time was several miles outside the Sheffield city boundaries. Construction of a new stadium (now known as Hillsborough Stadium) was completed within months and the club was secured for the next century. In a strong decade, Wednesday won the League in the 1902–03 and 1903–04 seasons and the FA Cup again in 1907, beating Everton 2–1, again at Crystal Palace. When competitive football was suspended in 1915 because of the outbreak of World War One, the club participated in several regionalised war leagues, until 1919, when normal service was resumed.|$|E
25|$|A person {{accused of}} a crime could deny the charge by denying it on oath and finding {{a certain number of}} persons {{prepared}} to go on oath that they believed his or her own oath, a system known as compurgation.

25|$|The 1980–81 {{season was}} {{probably}} {{the worst in the}} club's history. Rovers won just five league games during the season, and only four home wins in all competitions. The team was relegated {{at the end of the}} season, finishing in last place, seven points below the other relegated team, Bristol City. The club had also failed to agree an extension to the lease on their stadium, which had had its capacity reduced from 30,000 to 12,500 due to new safety laws, causing fears that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new home. On 17 August 1980, a fire started in the South Grandstand in Eastville Stadium, destroying the administrative offices and changing rooms. As a result, Rovers were forced to play five games at Ashton Gate, three in the league and two in the League Cup. This location was not popular with the fans however, who considered this to be enemy territory, and all five games were poorly attended.|$|E

He moved ship to HMS Niger in April 1940, during the Phoney war period both flotillas were kept busy minesweeping in the North Sea and the only action seen was on 15 May 1940, when HMS Hussar was holed by a German bomber. On 29 May 1940, Hichens was informed that the British Expeditionary Force were being evacuated from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo and that Niger would be leaving to assist. Arriving off Dunkirk on 31 May, Hichens organised the small boats and yachts used to evacuate the army from the Dunkirk jetty. When Niger was ordered home with a full complement of soldiers, Hichens asked to be left [...] behind to continue with the evacuation.

During February 1975, after winning the leadership election, Margaret Thatcher refused to offer Powell a Shadow Cabinet place because [...] "he turned his back on his own people" [...] by leaving the Conservative Party exactly 12 months earlier and telling the electorate to vote Labour. Powell replied she was correct to exclude him: [...] "In the first place I am not a member of the Conservative Party and secondly, until the Conservative Party has worked its passage a very long way it will not be rejoining me".

According to Hartog, the grid was: [...] "... the antithesis of a utopian or futuristic plan." [...] It extolled ordinary everyday life, and emphasized that [...] "government ought not to act {{in such a way}} as to create inequality of special privilege." [...] The Plan's [...] "hidden agenda" [...] was [...] "he reconstruction of the natural environment to fit the requirements of republican authority." [...] Even though [...] "he Commissioners wrote as if all they cared about was protecting the investments of land developers and maintaining government-on-the-cheap ... the plan ... however, served to transform space into an expression of public philosophy," [...] which emphasized equality and uniformity.

2500|$|Afterwards La Hermandad started feuding with La Sociedad, a superstable {{consisting}} of invaders from Los Perros del Mal {{and members of}} Los Maniacos, La Legión Extrangera and La Milicia, El Zorro and Hernandez in particular. La Hermandad received their rematch for the AAA World Tag Team Championship from Los Maniacos (Silver King and Último Gladiador) on September 19, 2010, but Lider was forced to enter the match without Nicho, who was taken out by El Zorro, Hernandez and La Legión the previous week, {{and was unable to}} regain the championship. At Héroes Inmortales IV Nicho and Lider gained a measure of revenge on Konnan by defeating him and Perros del Mal members Damián 666 and Halloween in a three–on–two handicap hardcore match. On October 30, 2010, El Zorro defeated Nicho in a Lucha de Apuesta to take his hair. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes Nicho and Líder received a shot at the AAA World Tag Team Championship, but were unable to dethrone Los Maniacos in a three–way ladder match, which also included Hernandez and El Ilegal. During the first half of 2011, La Hermandad 187 started feuding with La Maniarquía (Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador), during which the rudo trio injured Nicho, forcing him out of Triplemanía XIX on June 18. At the event Nicho tried to interfere in the match between Líder, Electroshock and Heavy Metal and La Maniarquía, but was stopped by AAA president Joaquín Roldan, who suspended him from AAA for his interference and had him removed the arena. Prior to the start of his three-month-long suspension, Nicho appeared at the June 30 tapings, voicing his displeasure over the suspension, claiming that he had been there for the company from the beginning even though they had given his name (Psicosis) to another performer [...] "not even close to his level", before noting that he had a son and that if he was suspended without pay, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> work from another promotion. Nicho returned to AAA on July 16, threatening Roldan, which led to Joe Líder trying to calm his partner down. This in turn led to Nicho declaring that if Líder was with Roldan, they were no longer friends. Later in the event, Nicho interfered in Líder's match and turned on him, effectively ending La Hermandad 187. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Nicho attacked Líder during a Monster's Ball match and put him through a flaming table, costing him the match in the process. On August 19, 2011, Nicho attacked Líder again before putting on a Perros del Mal T-shirt, which led to the group's leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo officially welcoming him to the group, turning rudo in the process. On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year-long rivalry, when Nicho, Damián 666 and Halloween were defeated in a Mask vs. Hair steel cage match, following interference from Joe Líder, and were all shaved bald.|$|E
2500|$|At Triplemanía XIX, Nicho el Millonario {{interfered}} in a six-man tag team match, {{where his}} tag team partner Joe Líder, Electroshock and Heavy Metal faced Los Maniacos and was, as a result, suspended {{for three months}} by AAA following the event in accordance to a deal made between Konnan and Joaquín Roldán. Prior {{to the start of}} his suspension, Nicho appeared at the June 30 tapings, voicing his displeasure over the suspension, claiming that he had been there for the company from the beginning even though they had given his name (Psicosis) to another performer [...] "not even close to his level", before noting that he had a son and that if he was suspended without pay, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> work from another promotion.

Later in the event, Nicho interfered in Líder's match and turned on him, effectively ending La Hermandad 187. After another attack at Verano de Escándalo, Nicho attacked Líder for the third time on August 19, before putting on a Perros del Mal shirt, which led to El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, making his first AAA appearance in two months, officially welcoming him to the group. On September 16, Konnan rewarded Chessman by moving him back to La Legión Extrangera and naming him the group's new general, taking over the spot formerly held by El Zorro. In the process, Decnnis was also moved from La Milicia to Los Maniacos. Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year-long rivalry on October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, where Damián 666, Halloween and Nicho el Millonario were defeated in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match and were all shaved bald. At the same event, Abyss and Chessman defeated Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans to bring the AAA World Tag Team Championship back to La Sociedad, while El Hijo del Perro Aguayo failed to capture the AAA Latin American Championship from Dr. Wagner Jr. After the match between Wagner and Aguayo, Octagón shocked AAA by turning on the promotion and attacking Wagner. La Parka then entered the ring to seemingly confront his longtime partner, before also turning on Wagner and attacking him along with Octagón, Aguayo, Konan Big and Silver King. On November 5, Konnan named Octagón the new leader of La Milicia, replacing Super Fly. Octagón then showed that he had not forgotten what Super Fly had done to him fourteen months earlier by ordering {{the rest of the group}} to attack him, kicking him out of La Milicia. At the November 14 tapings, Héctor Garza jumped from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to AAA, aligning himself with Los Perros del Mal. On December 16 at Guerra de Titanes, L.A. Park defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship. Following the match, a new group named El Consejo ("The Council"), consisting of former CMLL workers El Texano Jr., Toscano and Máscara Año 2000 Jr., made its debut, declaring war on both AAA and La Sociedad. On March 11, 2012, La Sociedads title domination ended, when Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly lost the AAA World Trios Championship to Los Psycho Circus. The following day, the three announced that they had quit Los Perros del Mal. On March 18 at Rey de Reyes, the short-lived alliance between La Sociedad and La Parka came to an end, when Octagón and La Milicia turned on him, after he had lost his rivalry against Los Bizarros. Rey de Reyes also continued the rivalry between La Sociedad stablemates, Jeff Jarrett and L.A. Park. After Jarrett's interference caused Park to get eliminated from the Rey de Reyes tournament, Park came back during the main event and cost Jarrett the AAA Mega Championship in his match against El Mesías. On August 5 at Triplemanía XX, Jarrett and the debuting Kurt Angle represented Dorian Roldán in a match, where they faced Park and Electroshock, representing Joaquín Roldán, with the Roldáns' hairs on the line. Electroshock won the match for his team by pinning Angle, but Joaquín announced that he did not want his son shaved after he had agreed to disband La Sociedad. However, Dorian ended up once again betraying his father by attaking him and shaving him instead. The event also featured Psicosis defeating longtime rival Joe Líder in another Hair vs. Hair match and El Hijo del Perro Aguayo unsuccessfully challenging El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. The following November, El Consejo joined La Sociedad. On December 2 at Guerra de Titanes, El Consejo member El Texano Jr. defeated El Mesías to bring the AAA Mega Championship back to La Sociedad.|$|E
