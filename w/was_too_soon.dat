5|$|Yao was {{nominated}} {{by a member}} of the Chinese media for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor to the game. He would have been eligible for induction as early as 2012, but Yao felt it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> and requested that the Hall of Fame delay consideration of the nomination. The Hall granted Yao's request, and said it was Yao's decision when the process would be restarted.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September, the day Lae fell, MacArthur {{ordered that}} Finschhafen be {{captured}} {{as soon as}} possible. The following day he held a conference at Port Moresby. He and Blamey selected the second contingency, a landing by a brigade of the 9th Division. Brigadier Victor Windeyer's 20th Infantry Brigade was chosen as it was still relatively fresh, and had experience with amphibious operations from the landing at Lae. The 6th Division's movement to New Guinea was postponed. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, {{the commander of the}} VII Amphibious Force, had originally counted on four weeks break between the fall of Lae and the Finschhafen operation. On 9 September, he had told Herring that it would require a minimum of ten days. Under pressure from MacArthur, Barbey cut that to three days. This <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for Herring to get the troops together, and 21 September was selected as the target date. Herring briefed Windeyer on the operation on 18 September. Windeyer felt that the schedule was still too tight, and it was postponed one more day to 22 September.|$|E

5|$|The predominate storyline {{heading into}} the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance group. On the February14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle {{separated}} in the storyline on the March13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May15 episode of Impact!. Karen refused Angle's request on the May22 episode of Impact!, leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. On the May29 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced Angle versus Styles for the event. Angle sustained a severe neck injury in early May with several TNA officials believing Angle would not recover in time to perform at the show. Angle was still in pain a few days prior to Slammiversary but was expected to perform normally despite some officials feeling it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to compete.|$|E
5|$|The timing {{could not}} have been better for the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding {{could not have}} been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.|$|E

Competition was not for the usual Henley trophies but for different cups and some events were restricted to ‘armed services’ crews.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Ehud Olmert {{said the}} {{fighting}} in Lebanon would end when Hezbollah guerrillas freed two captured soldiers, rocket attacks on Israel stopped and the Lebanese army deployed along the border. On the same day, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and British Prime Minister Tony Blair called for an international force {{to be sent to}} Lebanon to stop Hezbollah from attacking Israel. But Israel said it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to talk about deploying an international force.|$|E
25|$|After Wetton's death, Downes {{stated that}} the duo {{had been working on}} another Asia album after his death, and stated that it might {{eventually}} be completed and released. It is unclear if Wetton had recorded any parts, or if the album had only been in the songwriting process. In August, Palmer {{stated that the}} future of Asia was unclear, as it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to make any decisions and the band members would be busy on other projects in the meantime.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} session of 6 July, Israeli {{witnesses}} and representatives testified {{in front of}} the committee, describing years of living under rocket attack. The last to take the floor during the session was Noam Shalit, father of the Israeli captive soldier Gilad Shalit who at that time had been imprisoned in Gaza for three years, with no visit by the Red Cross permitted. Later that day, pro-Palestinian witnesses and experts from Israel and the West Bank testified. The next day, a military expert testified on weapons use by Hamas and Israel and an international law expert testified at Goldstone's Gaza hearings. Following the two-day session, Goldstone said that the investigation entered its final phase, but that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to conclude that war crimes were committed.|$|E

25|$|The other {{officers}} in Danyang {{were well aware}} that Gai Lan and Dai Yuan were the masterminds behind Sun Yi's murder but were unable {{to take action against}} the two men because their powers were limited. Gai Lan took over Sun Yi's residence and seized Sun's concubines and servants for himself. When he wanted to take Lady Xu (Sun Yi's widow), she declined, said that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> after her husband's death to remarry, and told him to wait for a month. During the intervening period, Lady Xu secretly contacted Sun Gao (孫高), Fu Ying (傅嬰) and other former subordinates of Sun Yi, informed them of the circumstances, and plotted with them to avenge her husband. On the appointed day, Lady Xu changed out of her mourning garments and invited Gai Lan to her personal quarters, where Sun Gao and Fu Ying, in disguise as maids, ambushed and killed Gai while the others slew Dai Yuan. Gai Lan and Dai Yuan's heads were cut off and offered as propitiation at Sun Yi's altar. This incident shocked everyone in Danyang. Shortly thereafter, Sun Quan came to Danyang to reward those who remained loyal to Sun Yi and punish those who conspired with Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|E
25|$|On {{the death}} of the Conqueror in 1087 Lanfranc secured the {{succession}} for William Rufus, in spite of the discontent of the Anglo-Norman baronage; and in 1088 his exhortations induced the English militia to fight {{on the side of the}} new sovereign against Odo of Bayeux and the other partisans of Duke Robert. He exacted promises of just government from Rufus, and was not afraid to remonstrate when the promises were disregarded. So long as he lived he was a check upon the worst propensities of the king’s administration. But his restraining hand <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> removed. In 1089 he was stricken with fever and he died on 24 May amidst universal lamentations. Notwithstanding some obvious moral and intellectual defects, he was the most eminent and the most disinterested of those who had co-operated with William I in riveting Norman rule upon the English Church and people. As a statesman he did something to uphold the traditional ideal of his office; as a primate he elevated the standards of clerical discipline and education. Conceived in the spirit of popes such as Pope Leo IX, his reforms led by a natural sequence to strained relations between Church and State; the equilibrium which he established was unstable, and depended too much upon his personal influence with the Conqueror.|$|E

500|$|The pair become engaged after Darren proposes, {{although}} {{the proposal is}} accidental rather than planned. Dawson felt that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for Darren to consider marrying Nancy. Shortly after their engagement, Suzanne returns and announces she is expecting Darren's babies. Regarding Darren being the father of twin babies and if his relationship with Nancy would survive, Dawson felt the situation was too difficult for Nancy but for Darren it was fine. He felt that the story was [...] "interesting" [...] and hoped the pairing would survive as they have [...] "something special". Darren and Nancy split up when he moves Suzanne and the babies into Nancy's flat. They resume their romance after Suzanne leaves and takes the children with her.|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber of the New York-based Daily News {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "It suffers from a {{similarly}} meandering melody and ponderous progression. The grandeur of its arrangement easily upstages the tune", but [...] "even so, the luster of Adele's tone, and the bravura arc of her vocal, makes it enjoyable enough. And, fifty years down the line, isn't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but felt that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", {{but at the same}} time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E
500|$|Cast {{members have}} commented on their {{performances}} in the episode. Robert Beltran, who played Commander Chakotay, said he felt uncomfortable acting in the facial mask worn for his character's Vidiian disguise. He described the prosthetics as [...] "that raw, wounded face, which made me feel very vulnerable as a person", and viewed it as an acting challenge. Garrett Wang, who portrayed Ensign Harry Kim, said that {{his role in the}} episode was restricted to technobabble. Robert Picardo, who played the Doctor, appreciated the interactions between Torres and his character as they represented how he was originally [...] "just a functionary doing his job." [...] Picardo added that his scenes showed that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for his character to understand the importance of his operation on Torres, or to develop any sort of relationship with her.|$|E

500|$|Critics also commented {{positively}} on {{the development}} of Will and Emma's relationship, with Abrams noting that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Goldman deeming their coming together [...] "very hard to not feel good about". Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, questioning whether it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> {{for the two of them}} to begin a relationship. The end of Quinn's pregnancy secret was also well received. Poniewozik wrote that the pregnancy storyline had felt as though [...] "the early Glee wasn't confident that people would be interested in it without these over-the-top soap opera twists." [...] He noted that in concluding the pregnancy deception in [...] "Sectionals", Glee: [...] "seemed to clear the decks for a second half of the season as the confident show it now is." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Sonic 2 {{began in}} November 1991, {{two months later}} than Cerny had {{intended}} because Sega of America initially felt it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for a sequel. Both American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development; art director Tim Skelly designed {{the appearance of the}} game's pseudo-3D special stages, based on a tech demo created by Naka. The special stages were created out of pre-rendered 3D polygons, video of which was compressed and halved, both vertically and horizontally, to fit in the game cartridge. Sonic 2 also introduced Sonic's sidekick, a two-tailed fox that could fly named Tails, inspired by Japanese folklore about the kitsune and created by level artist Yasushi Yamaguchi. Sega of America objected to the character's name, Miles Prower (a pun on [...] "miles per hour"), so he was given the nickname Tails as a compromise. Masaharu Yoshii served as the game's director. The staff increased the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 compared to the first game.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Thatcher was {{defeated}} when she sought selection {{to be the}} Conservative party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years stating: [...] "I really just felt the twins were... only two, I really felt that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon.</b> I couldn't do that." [...] Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and {{was selected as the}} candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher's maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member's bill (the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.|$|E
