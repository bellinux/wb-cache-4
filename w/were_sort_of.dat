[...] Green's influence extended overseas to cartoonists such as the Dutch Peter Pontiac, who drew inspiration from Binky Brown and Maus to produce Kraut (2000), about his father who collaborated with the Nazis during World WarII.|$|E
500|$|Starr's {{idiosyncratic}} {{turns of}} phrase, or Ringoisms as they became known, {{such as a}} hard day's night and tomorrow never knows, were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: [...] "Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> magic". As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line [...] "darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there" [...] from [...] "Eleanor Rigby".|$|E

500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> magic even though he was just getting it wrong.

500|$|Rundgren {{also made}} musical {{contributions}} of his own, including the marimba on [...] "Love My Way" [...] and the saxophone on [...] "No Easy Street". But his primary goal as producer was [...] "helping the band focus their potential". His more unorthodox methods included {{an instance of}} climbing {{to the roof of}} the studio and dropping lit firecrackers near the unsuspecting band when [...] "we <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> playing a little sluggishly," [...] as Tim Butler recalled. By his various means, Rundgren motivated the players to create, and by his well-known personal style of power pop-inflected [...] "wall of sound" [...] production, he restored the band's sonic richness – the signature Furs characteristic described approvingly in Rolling Stone as [...] "the thick, viscous smear of guitars, drums and vocals".|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{had trouble}} {{deciding}} how to resolve the episode and bring the zombie characters back to life. Although they ultimately settled on having Kyle kill the [...] "main zombie" [...] {{to bring back the}} others, Parker did not feel the resolution made sense and described it as a deus ex machina. Parker said of the ending, [...] "This was another big one of those episodes where we <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> (like), 'How do we get out of this one?'" [...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving.

500|$|Released in July, the Beatles' second film, Help!, {{was again}} {{directed}} by Lester. Described as [...] "mainly a relentless spoof of Bond", it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band. McCartney said: [...] "Help! was great but it wasn't our film – we <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> guest stars. It was fun, but basically, {{as an idea}} for a film, it was a bit wrong." [...] The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: [...] "Help!" [...] and [...] "Ticket to Ride". The accompanying album, the group's fifth studio LP, contained all original material save for two covers, [...] "Act Naturally" [...] and [...] "Dizzy Miss Lizzy"; they were the last covers the band would include on an album, with the exception of Let It Be brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song [...] "Maggie Mae". The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on Help! and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements, including a string quartet on the pop ballad [...] "Yesterday". Composed by McCartney, [...] "Yesterday" [...] would inspire the most recorded cover versions of any song ever written.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{helped to}} solidify the {{different}} personalities of The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained, [...] "Up , they <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> interchangeable {{in the information}} they delivered. But then Vince, who loved the characters and really wanted a chance to dig more deeply into them, created a back story and they became a lot more interesting." [...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought {{we were all in}} a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But I felt like the lead because it was my story about falling in love with this woman and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where you take a character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E

500|$|On January 11, 1967, the Experience {{worked on}} their second A-side, [...] "The Wind Cries Mary", {{a song that}} marked their first use of overdubbing in lieu of retakes {{as a method of}} {{achieving}} a satisfactory track. Chandler explained: [...] "There were five guitar overdubs all linking in together to sound like one guitar." [...] The song, which Redding and Mitchell had not yet heard before that day, was completed during the session. Chandler had decided that they should discard the rough version of [...] "Third Stone from the Sun" [...] from December 13 and re-record the song; they completed a basic track for the piece, but were unable to achieve a finished master. The group managed to produce an acceptable live recording of the basic track for [...] "Fire" [...] after seven takes. Next, they attempted Hendrix's newly written ballad, [...] "The Wind Cries Mary". Without the benefit of rehearsals, the band recorded the song in one take, to which Hendrix added several guitar overdubs; Chandler estimated that they spent approximately 20 minutes on the completed rhythm track. According to Chandler, by this time Redding and Mitchell had begun to complain about their limited input. Chandler explained that financial considerations influenced the creative dynamic: [...] " [...] <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> fighting {{the fact that they had}} no say during recording sessions... they were starting to come up with suggestions, but... We didn't need to be arguing with Noel for ten minutes and Mitch for five... We just couldn't afford the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> teenage like. I wanted to make a change for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would still look at me as a little girl and I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes. Marlon Jackson also produced the single and provided backing vocals along with his brothers Michael, Tito, and Jackie. Although it was slated for a mid-July release, [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was released on August 13, 1984.|$|E
500|$|On June 8, 2010, {{the singer}} sang the track {{with four other}} songs, [...] "Bionic", [...] "Not Myself Tonight", [...] "Beautiful" [...] and [...] "You Lost Me" [...] on The Today Show.

Later that year, on June 13, she performed all of her biggest hits on VH1 Storytellers, including [...] "Fighter". Before performing the song, Aguilera revealed to the crowd, [...] "When I was younger {{there were a lot}} of people, as I mentioned before, that <b>were</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> around me for the wrong reasons. There's always a positive to those negative times because throughout it you come out so much stronger and wiser". During the Justin Timberlake & Friends benefit showheld by Justin Timberlake on October 24, 2010 in Las Vegas, NevadaAguilera was invited to perform several of her hits, including [...] "Beautiful", [...] "Fighter" [...] and [...] "Ain't No Other Man". On April 16, 2012, Aguilera performed [...] "Fighter" [...] again on the second season of US reality show The Voice, on which she is one of the judges and coaches, with her [...] "Team Xtina" [...] and Crenshaw High School choir.
