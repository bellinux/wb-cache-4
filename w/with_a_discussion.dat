5|$|The chapter ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> {{of animals}} that can change colour, {{including}} fish like the sole, the chameleon, the horned lizards and the tree frogs including the European species Hyla arborea. He cites Poulton's suggestion that the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) and aggressive (facilitating the hunting of insects).|$|E
5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages starts <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> {{about how}} people attempt to see the future through various superstitious means. Then the narrator tries to {{convince}} the reader that resignation about death is necessary. However, such resignation {{should be viewed as}} pushing the self towards redemption and the eternal life in the next world. By acting properly, one would be able to overcome life and move towards the next world.|$|E

5|$|The text opens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of {{virtues and}} {{lifestyle}} of a yogi, with 70 verses {{in the first}} chapter dedicated primarily to Yamas and 19 in second dedicated to Niyamas. The yoga postures with breathing and cleansing exercises are described in 149 verses of the third through seventh chapters, wherein the text asserts that these yoga exercises help the yogi master his senses and achieve awareness of his body.|$|E
5|$|Bodyguard of Lies {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to Ultra, the codename for decrypted signals intelligence. It goes on to document {{the origins of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories of deception, the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of how the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the Double-Cross System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first book}} starts {{on the topic}} of Greek {{philosophy}}. Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.|$|E

5|$|What is {{considered}} the first scholarly discussion of the Leges appeared in 1827 by George Philips, who did not reproduce the entire text in his Englische Reichsund Rechtsgeschichte, but did provide a couple of extracts along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> {{of the sources of}} the work and a description of the work. In 1840, the Record Commission published an edition of the text that had been edited by Richard Price and Benjamin Thorpe. The next major production of the Leges was Felix Liebermann who produced three volumes of Gesetze der Angelsachsen between 1903 and 1916, with the Leges being one of the legal treatises being reproduced in the Gesetze. A modern translation, with the original Latin text on pages facing the translation, was published in 1972 by the Clarendon Press and edited by L. J. Downer, and includes updated commentary and manuscript information.|$|E

25|$|Cantor's {{article is}} short, not even {{four and a}} half pages. It begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of the real {{algebraic}} numbers and a statement of his first theorem: The set of real algebraic numbers can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the set of positive integers. Cantor restates this theorem in terms more familiar to mathematicians of his time: The set of real algebraic numbers can be written as an infinite sequence in which each number appears only once.|$|E
25|$|Set {{membership}}: Tarski {{ended his}} lecture <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> {{of whether the}} set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, {{the question of whether}} most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of type theory, but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.|$|E

A controversy over Foner's work and scholarship practices arose in academic circles in 2003, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of plagiarism and sloppy scholarship. The New York Labor History Association had awarded Foner a lifetime achievement award in 1994. It reiterated its support in 2003 that the value of his work exceeded his shortcomings.|$|E

25|$|Wilding {{is a young}} {{law student}} who gives up his studies to seek pleasure. He is a rake who uses people and wishes to marry Bellaria simply for money. Unlike Love in Several Masques, Fielding cares more about {{revealing}} hypocrisy than <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of love and lovers, but he portrays the hypocrites {{in a manner that}} emphasises a comedic response instead of censure. Other characters want to have Bellaria, including the virtuous man Veromil and his foil Valentine who is unable to control his desires for Bellaria. Valentine eventually pairs with Clarissa, a character of little substance within the play, Veromil marries Bellaria, and Wilding does not marry.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{believed}} that Aristotle's Poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.|$|E
25|$|Chapter 3. The Lost City of Francisco Grande. Developed {{at a cost}} of $4.5 {{million by}} San Francisco Giants owner Horace Stoneham, Francisco Grande was built {{adjacent}} to Casa Grande, Arizona as the spring training home for the Giants. The facility, opened in 1961, boasted a private airstrip, an 18-hole golf course, and five baseball fields as well as player rooms, training and administrative offices for the team. Rushin notes that many of Francisco Grande's buildings were decorated with baseball memorabilia such as bats, balls, and gloves and he then continues the chapter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of the development of baseball gloves. The chapter concludes with an overview of how the catcher's position changed over time and how the development and use of the hinged catcher's glove revolutionized the sport by allowing catchers such as Johnny Bench to catch one-handed.|$|E

25|$|Portal {{had been}} under {{development}} for about a year, at a state where there were only test chambers that the player moved between. Valve found from playtesting that while players had fun with the game's concept, they were left asking of where these puzzles were leading towards. The team worked {{to come up with}} some type of narrative, coming down to creating an antagonist that would guide the player in early part of the game but become the goal that the player would strive for by the end. The creation of GLaDOS to serve this purpose began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with. When they were designing the game, they found that they did not have enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved.|$|E
25|$|The session began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of {{procedures}} and regulations, {{then moved on}} to the material and system of constitution. However, the most important debate in this session was that on the basis of state. There were three proposals. Firstly, a state based on Pancasila, the philosophical basis for the state as formulated by Sukarno in a speech on 1 June 1945. This was seen as a forum for all the different groups and beliefs in society that would be to the detriment of nobody. The second proposal was for a state based on Islam, and the third was for a socio-economic structure based on the family as set out in Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution. As none of the factions supporting these respective ideologies was able to command the necessary 2/3 of votes needed, this resulted in deadlock. Islamic parties accused the PKI of hypocrisy for supporting Pancasila with its commitment to belief in God rather than the socio-economic philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Renpō Niwa, {{a former}} abbot of Eihei-ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first {{part is the}} preface in which Dōgen {{emphasizes}} the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of the Three Minds (Sanshin, 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.|$|E
