The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the type of gene actions involved in the inheritance of the most important quantitative traits in commercial <b>white</b> <b>pea</b> bean cultivars. Forty nine entries (7 parents and 42 F 2 diallel crosses) were grown in a simple lattice design with two replications at Jimma Agricultural Research Center, South Western Ethiopia. The results revealed significant mean squares in all of the characters. There were significant mean squares due to general combining ability, specific combining ability, reciprocal effects, maternal effects, and non-maternal effects in almost all of the characters. The relative contribution of specific combining ability was higher than general combining ability for all of the studied traits pod length and seed thickness. This indicating that the non-additive gene actions are influential in the expression of these traits which poses some difficulty as the non-additive gene actions are non-fixable. Thus, selfing should continue for more generation to fix the non-additive gene actions before undertaking selection.

40|$|Animal {{and plant}} {{proteins}} are major proteins {{sources in the}} human diet. After their enzymatic degradation in the upper gastro-intestinal tract, the undigested fraction of these proteins is available for fermentation by the microbiota of the large intestine leading {{to the production of}} short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), ammonia, biogenic amines, sulphur metabolites, phenols and indoles. As some of these compounds have genotoxic and cytotoxic effects, protein fermentation is considered as detrimental to the host’s epithelial health. BCFA are usually used as a marker of intestinal protein fermentation. We studied in vivo the impact of proteins from animal and plant origin, raw or after a cooking procedure, on the composition of gut microbiota and on fermentation end-products. Weanling rats were used as models of the human gut microbiota. Eight experimental diets were formulated with beef meat (Longissimus dorsi), chicken meat (Pectoralis major), <b>white</b> <b>pea</b> beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), soybeans (Glycine max), used raw and cooked, as sole source of protein in the diet. One casein diet was used as control. All diets, formulated to contain 15 % of raw protein, were given to seven rats for four weeks. After euthanasia, caecal contents were collected. Pyrosequencing analyses (Roche 454 GS Junior Genome Sequencer) were performed to study the microbial composition. SCFA and BCFA were measured using HPLC (Waters 2690). Microbial composition in the caecum is associated to the type of dietary protein and to the cooking procedure applied. The proportion of BCFA in the caecal content is mainly affected by the type of protein. So BCFA represent respectively 04 - 06 % and 35 - 44 % of total SCFA with diets based on plant and on animal proteins. In conclusion, both the type of protein and the cooking procedure could impact the gut microbiota in terms of composition and of fermentative capacity. Peer reviewe...|$|E

60|$|I shall only {{trouble you}} with a few {{particulars}} relative to the wretched state of this country. Our markets are exceedingly high; oatmeal 17d. and 18d. per peck, {{and not to be}} got even at that price. We have indeed been pretty well supplied with quantities of <b>white</b> <b>peas</b> from England and elsewhere, but that resource is likely to fail us, and what will become of us then, particularly the very poorest sort, Heaven only knows. This country, till of late, was flourishing incredibly in the manufacture of silk, lawn, and carpet-weaving; and we are still carrying on a good deal in that way, but much reduced from what it was. We had also a fine trade in the shoe way, but now entirely ruined, and hundreds driven to a starving condition on account of it. Farming is also at a very low ebb with us. Our lands, generally speaking, are mountainous and barren; and our land-holders, full of ideas of farming gathered from the English and the Lothians, and other rich soils in Scotland, make no allowance for the odds of the quality of land, and consequently stretch us much beyond what in the event we will be found able to pay. We are also much at a loss for want of proper methods in our improvements of farming. Necessity compels us to leave our old schemes, and few of us have opportunities of being well informed in new ones. In short, my dear Sir, since the unfortunate beginning of this American war, and its as unfortunate conclusion, this country has been, and still is, decaying very fast. Even in higher life, a couple of Ayrshire noblemen, and the major part of our knights and squires, are all insolvent. A miserable job of a Douglas, Heron & Co.'s bank, which no doubt you have heard of, has undone numbers of them; and imitating English and French, and other foreign luxuries and fopperies, has ruined as many more. There is a great trade of smuggling carried on along our coasts, which, however destructive to the interests of the kingdom at large, certainly enriches this corner of it, but too often at the expense of our morals. However, it enables individuals to make, at least for a time, a splendid appearance; but Fortune, as is usual with her when she is uncommonly lavish of her favours, is generally even with them at last; and happy were it for numbers of them if she would leave them no worse than when she found them.|$|R

The experimental design was a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement of treatments which evaluated two basal wheat-soy diets (with or without meat meal) and legume grains (no legume grain, or faba beans, <b>white</b> lupins and <b>peas</b> at 200 g/kg inclusion). All diets were formulated to contain similar levels of metabolizable energy and digestible amino acids. A 3 -phase feeding programme (starter, grower and finisher) was employed. The starter, grower and finisher diets were offered from day 1 - 7, 8 - 21 and 22 - 35, respectively. During the starter period, legume x meat meal interaction was significant (p 0. 05) on the performance and carcass recovery of broilers and the litter score. Weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were better (p< 0. 05) than those with meat meal. The main effect of legumes was significant (p< 0. 01 to 0. 05) for the relative weight of liver and gizzard and the relative digesta weight of the crop and proventriculus. Birds fed meat meal diets had lower (p< 0. 05) relative weights of liver, pancreas and small intestine and relative digesta weight of small intestine than those fed diets with no meat meal diets.

40|$|Competition {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} biotic factors determining the structure of ecological communities. In this study, we show that there is variation in competitive ability between two clones of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, both of which out-compete a clone of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae, in the laboratory. We tested whether this variation in competitive ability would alter the outcome of interspecific competition in the field. <b>White</b> one <b>pea</b> aphid clone followed the pattern set in the laboratory, out-competing the Megoura viciae clone, another showed the reverse effect with Megoura viciae dominating. These differences appear to be the result of variation in early population growth rate between the pea aphid clones, rather than predation, although predation did lead to the eventual extinction of colonies. We also questioned whether intra- and interspecific differences in predator escape behaviour could affect the outcome of competition in the field. All three clones responded similarly to the presence of foraging hoverfly larvae (Episyrphus balteatus), but the Megoura viciae clone dropped from the plant significantly less often in response to the presence of a foraging two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata). This work provides evidence that intraspecific variation in competitive ability can alter the outcome of interspecific competitive interactions in nature and suggests that species-specific behavioural. traits may have the potential to modify the outcome of these interactions.

Nitrogen benefits and recovery of crop residue-N, root-N and residual fertilizer-N by three succeeding winter wheat crops were studied. Each crop residue was subjected to four different residue management treatments (ploughed, rotary hoed, mulched or burned) before the first sequential wheat crop (1994 / 95) was sown, followed by the second (1995 / 96) and third wheat crops (1996 / 97), in each of which residues of the previous wheat crop were removed and all plots were ploughed uniformly before sowing. Grain yields of the first sequential wheat crop followed the order: <b>white</b> clover > <b>peas</b> > ryegrass > wheat. The mulched treatment produced significantly lower grain yield than those of other treatments. In the first sequential wheat crop, leguminous and non-leguminous residues supplied between 29 – 57 % and 6 – 10 % of wheat N accumulated respectively and these decreased with successive sequential crops. Rotary hoed treatment reduced N benefits of white clover residue-N while {{no significant differences in}} N benefits occurred between residue management treatments in non-leguminous residues.

The rotation was managed under four different farming systems: two conventional: {{with and without}} mineral fertilizers and two organic, both with winter cover crops (later ploughed and used as green manure) and one where cattle manure was added yearly. The measurements conducted were penetration resistance, soil water content, porosity, water permeability, and organic carbon. Yearly variations were linked {{to the number of}} tillage operations, and a cumulative effect of soil organic carbon in the soil {{as a result of the}} different fertilization amendments, organic or mineral. All the systems showed similar tendencies along the three years of study and differences were only found between the control and the other systems. Mineral fertilizers enhanced the overall physical soil conditions due to the higher yield in the system. In the organic systems, cover crops and cattle manure did not have a significant effect on soil physical properties in comparison with the conventional ones, which were kept bare during the winter period. The extra organic matter boosted the positive effect of crop rotation, but the higher number of tillage operations in both organic systems counteracted this effect to a greater or lesser extent...|$|R
