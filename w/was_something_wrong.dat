5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough {{to give him a}} second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that {{everyone}} around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Edward Gibbon had {{observed}} that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> {{with the numbers}} and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who {{was meant to be}} writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve {{at least some of the}} six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favor of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the Augustan History and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae) proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).|$|E
25|$|It is {{precisely}} because he fathered a healthy son with Elizabeth that Henry was convinced his wife's inability to bear him a son was Catherine's fault. She gave birth to at least three boys, yet only the first lived as long as seven weeks. These facts led Henry to believe there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with his marriage to Catherine, and {{that he needed to}} annul his marriage.|$|E
50|$|From a neurobiological perspective, {{there are}} three reasons that could cause a person to have hearing loss: either there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the {{mechanical}} portion of the process, meaning the conductive portions of the ear (external and middle ear), or there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the sensory portion of the process (inner ear or cochlea and related structures) or there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the neural portion of the process, meaning the nerves or brain.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Bolton {{scowled at}} them, feeling {{certain that they}} were godless persons;--in which she was right. The old banker, drawing his son Daniel out of the room, whispered an inquiry; but Daniel Bolton knew nothing.

25|$|Despite {{or perhaps}} because of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a {{campaign}} had been started to build a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin. It was felt by at least some Germans that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> about the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters. In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built. Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b> [...] The whole first week I wasn't really {{interested}} in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] {{wanted to make a}} record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Dale Launer, who was {{a friend}} of the Rodger family, stated that he had counseled Rodger on {{approaching}} and befriending women, but that Rodger did not follow the advice. He said in an interview, [...] "I first met [...] when he was aged eight or nine and I could see then that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with him. I'm not a psychologist, but looking back now he strikes me as someone who was broken from the moment of conception." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing: [...] "It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for {{plunging}} into drama with a charged-up visual style. And {{it is well}} acted." [...] However, he was not entirely complimentary: [...] "Always {{at the back of}} my mind was the troubled thought that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action. ... In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it." [...] The New York Times Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The Professional is much too sentimental to sound shockingly amoral in the least. Even in a finale of extravagant violence, it manages to be maudlin … Mr. Oldman expresses most of the film's sadism as well as many of its misguidedly poetic sentiments." ...|$|E

It was the second highest grossing event of 1988, earning $17.7million. In February 1989, Faith won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 31st Grammy Awards. At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September in Los Angeles, Michael received the Video Vanguard Award. According to Michael in his film, A Different Story, success did not make him happy {{and he started to}} think there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> in being an idol for millions of teenage girls. The whole Faith process (promotion, videos, tour, awards) left him exhausted, lonely and frustrated, and far from his friends and family. In 1990, he told his record company Sony that, for his second album, {{he did not want to}} do promotions like the one for Faith.|$|E
