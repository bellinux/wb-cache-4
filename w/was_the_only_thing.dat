5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the price of}} kelp, {{as a result of the}} Napoleonic Wars, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> keeping Rùm's economy afloat. Inevitably, when the Napoleonic Wars ended, the kelp price collapsed, causing severe financial hardship. The laird himself was in additional difficulties as a result of having purchased the Isle of Muck during the peak of demand for kelp. He decided to evict the tenants, and lease the whole island to a relative, Dr Lachlan Maclean.|$|E
5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history {{did not need to be}} recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter had {{intended}} Richard Dreyfuss as Andy McGee, but when The Thing was a financial disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester. Ironically, Carpenter's next film, Christine, was the 1983 {{adaptation of the}} Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury {{which turns out to}} have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. Christine did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted as saying he directed the film because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> offered to him at the time.|$|E

Williams and his troops fought a harrowing retreat back to Camp Wright, defending themselves for about fifteen hours before they reached safety. All along the way Indians fired from concealed positions. At one point, they even set a brush fire in the soldiers path {{to prevent them from}} escaping. Despite their continuous attacks, the Indians only wounded two soldiers. In his report, Williams stated that his long-range rifles killed fifteen Indians. He also stated that his superior weaponry <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that prevented his party from being overrun.|$|E
25|$|While in the Soviet Union, Svetlana {{had written}} a memoir in Russian in 1963. The {{manuscript}} was carried safely {{out of the country}} by Ambassador T. N. Kaul, who returned it to her in New Delhi. Svetlana handed her memoir over to the CIA agent Robert Rayle {{at the time of her}} own defection. Rayle made a copy of it. The book was titled Twenty Letters to a Friend (Dvadtsat' pisem k drugu). It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> other than a few items of clothing taken by Svetlana on a secret passenger flight out of India. Nevertheless, as noted by Raymond Pearson (Russia and Eastern Europe), her book turned out to be quite disappointing. It featured Svetlana's naïve attempt to shift the blame for Stalinist crimes onto Beria, and whitewash her own father.|$|E
25|$|He then {{acted as}} a {{minister}} at Ware, Stowmarket and Beaconsfield. At Ware {{the teachings of the}} French philosophers were brought before him by a friend, Joseph Fawcett, who held strong republican opinions. Godwin came to London in 1782, still nominally as a minister, to regenerate society with his pen – a real enthusiast, who shrank theoretically from no conclusions from the premises which he laid down. He adopted the principles of the Encyclopédistes, and his own aim was the complete overthrow of all existing political, social and religious institutions. He believed, however, that calm discussion <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> needful to carry every change, and from the beginning {{to the end of his}} career he deprecated every approach to violence. He was a philosophic radical in the strictest sense of the term.|$|E

25|$|The British {{loans to}} China greatly {{offended}} the Japanese, {{who believed that}} if the British would cease their financial support of China, they would finally win the war. Konroe thought that the British effort to stabilize China's currency and thereby prevent the complete economic collapse of China <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> standing {{between them and the}} total victory required for his program. Since the loans to China were guaranteed by the British government, the Chinese silver as collateral was not strictly necessary from economic point of view, but it was felt that for public relations, it was necessary for the Chinese to put up collateral, as the British people might otherwise disapprove of their government guaranteeing loans to a country with chaotic finances like China. At the same, both the United States and the Soviet Union also made loans to the Kuomintang government, again to keep Japan embroiled in China. The Americans lent China some $45 million starting in December 1938 while the Soviet Union lent a sum of rubles equivalent to $250 million. To persuade the Soviets not to support China, the Japanese began a border war with the Soviet Union in 1938–1939 ended with the Japanese being badly defeated by the Soviets in August 1939 in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol.|$|E
