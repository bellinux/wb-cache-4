50|$|Rena Wing {{has been}} {{actively}} researching behavioral treatments of obesity for about forty years. She has examined {{many aspects of}} weight loss. Wing has completed research on four different questions examining {{the health benefits of}} modest weight loss, how behavioral treatment of obesity can be improved, whether it is possible to prevent weight gain and subsequent obesity, and the characteristics of successful weight loss maintainers. Wing is currently studying successful weight losers comparing those with normal <b>weight</b> <b>controls</b> versus obese <b>weight</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R

25|$|Regular, brisk {{exercise}} {{of any kind}} can improve confidence, stamina, energy, <b>weight</b> <b>control</b> and life expectancy and reduce stress. It can also {{reduce the risk of}} coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis. Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration and abstract reasoning, as well as ameliorating spirits. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure. Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the scales}} {{reviewed}} by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as obesity (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight Locus of Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health Locus of Control Scale or the Depression Locus of Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking locus of control to the management of diabetes mellitus. Empirical data on health locus of control {{in a number of}} fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as jogging) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as breast self-examination, <b>weight</b> <b>control</b> and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.|$|E

500|$|One {{important}} use of American kestrels is in falconry. It {{is often}} considered a beginner's bird, though the careful <b>weight</b> <b>control</b> {{needed to maintain}} the kestrel's desire to aggressively hunt takes skill. Falconers experienced in extracting the best performance the species is capable of report they are highly reliable on the normal game of sparrows and starlings. More aggressive individuals are sometimes capable of capturing prey up to approximately twice their own body weight, allowing the occasional capture of true game birds such as quail and dove. However, most falconers interested in the reliable taking of such game do prefer larger falcons or hawks. The advantage the American kestrel offers the experienced falconer is its suitability to simple and urban falconry not requiring large tracts of land {{or the use of}} hunting dogs. This form of falconry is sometimes referred to as [...] "micro-falconry" [...] or [...] "micro-hawking." [...] The other small raptor species commonly used in micro-falconry are the Merlin, the Sharp-shinned hawk (the smallest accipiter), and the European kestrel (a true kestrel).|$|E

Reasonable exercise stimulates cartilage growth and reduces degeneration (though excessive exercise can do harm too), and also regular long walks in early or mild dysplasia can help prevent loss of muscle mass to the hips. Medication can reduce pain and discomfort, and also reduce damaging inflammation.|$|E

40|$|Obesity {{may be a}} {{risk factor}} for {{increased}} hospitalization and deaths from infections due to respiratory pathogens. Additionally, obese patients appear to have impaired immunity after some vaccinations. To evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of an inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in overweight and obese children, 28 overweight/obese pediatric patients and 23 healthy normal <b>weight</b> <b>controls</b> aged 3 - 14 years received a dose of TIV. Four weeks after vaccine administration, significantly higher seroprotection rates against the A/H 1 N 1 strain were observed among overweight/obese children compared with normal <b>weight</b> <b>controls</b> (p< 0. 05). Four months after vaccination, similar or slightly higher seroconversion and seroprotection rates against the A/H 1 N 1 and A/H 3 N 2 strains were detected in overweight/obese than in normal weight children, whereas significantly higher rates of seroconversion and seroprotection against the B strain were found in overweight/obese patients than in normal <b>weight</b> <b>controls</b> (p< 0. 05 for seroconversion and seroprotection). Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and fold increase against B strains were significantly higher in overweight/obese patients than in normal <b>weight</b> <b>controls</b> 4 months after vaccine administration (p< 0. 01 for GMT values and p< 0. 05 for fold increase). The frequency of local and systemic reactions was similar between the groups, and there were no serious adverse events.

2500|$|Gastrointestinal diseases: {{people with}} {{gastrointestinal}} disorders {{may be more}} risk of developing disorders eating practices than the general population, principally restrictive eating disturbances. An association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found. The role that gastrointestinal symptoms play {{in the development of}} eating disorders seems rather complex. Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons, causing alterations to their eating patterns. Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk. It has been documented that some people with celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease who are not conscious about the importance of strictly following their diet, choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss. On the other hand, individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety, food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods. Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder, especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom (such as [...] decreased appetite, abdominal pain, bloating, distension, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation), weight loss, or growth failure; and also routinely ask celiac patients about [...] weight or body shape concerns, dieting or vomiting for <b>weight</b> <b>control,</b> to evaluate the possible presence of eating disorders, especially in women.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, admissions of {{anorexia}} nervosa patients to the Mayo Clinic from 1917 to 1929 were compiled. Fifty-five to sixty-five {{percent of these}} patients were reported to be voluntarily vomiting in order to relieve weight anxiety. Records show that purging for <b>weight</b> <b>control</b> continued throughout the mid-1900s. Several case studies from this era reveal patients suffering from the modern description of bulimia nervosa. In 1939, Rahman and Richardson reported that out of their six anorexic patients, one had periods of overeating and another practiced self-induced vomiting. Wulff, in 1932, treated [...] "Patient D," [...] who would have periods of intense cravings for food and overeat for weeks, which often resulted in frequent vomiting. Patient D, {{who grew up with}} a tyrannical father, was repulsed by her weight and would fast for a few days, rapidly losing weight. Ellen West, a patient described by Ludwig Binswanger in 1958, was teased by friends for being fat and excessively took thyroid pills to lose weight, later using laxatives and vomiting. She reportedly consumed dozens of oranges and several pounds of tomatoes each day, yet would skip meals. After being admitted to a psychiatric facility for depression, Ellen ate ravenously yet lost weight, presumably due to self-induced vomiting. [...] However, while these patients may have met modern criteria for bulimia nervosa, they cannot technically be diagnosed with the disorder, as it had not yet appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders {{at the time of their}} treatment.|$|E
