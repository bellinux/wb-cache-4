40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{international}} trade in goods and capital movement on the productivity distribution and industry-wide productivity when countries are heterogeneous {{in the quality of}} their financial institutions. In autarky, firm heterogeneity in their productivities arises in countries <b>with</b> poor <b>financial</b> institutions, while all firms adopt a high-productivity technology in countries <b>with</b> better <b>financial</b> institutions. Trade in goods will not change the productivity distribution (nor the industry-wide productivity as a result) in any country, although it lowers equilibrium interest rates in countries <b>with</b> poor <b>financial</b> institutions while it raises them in countries <b>with</b> better <b>financial</b> institutions. Allowing international capital movement in addition to the trade, however, makes a large impact on the industry. Capital flight from countries <b>with</b> poor <b>financial</b> institutions occurs, which may lead to global convergence in which all firms in the world adopt the high-productivity technology under a relatively high interest rate. But if the worldwide average of quality of financial institution is low, international capital movement will reduce worldwide production efficiency such that low-productivity firms re-emerge even in northern countries as well as in southern countries...|$|R
