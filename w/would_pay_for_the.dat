5|$|The {{city and}} state then had to provide a location, {{and one of the}} {{promises}} the city made was to erect a fitting memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. Work began in 1921. The {{city and state}} reached an agreement whereby the city <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> site and maintenance costs, while the State of Indiana <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> memorial's construction. The Plaza was dedicated by the Legion in November 1921 with the laying of a cornerstone from the bridge over the River Marne at Château-Thierry.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} turned off at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again {{during the winter of}} 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1993, the {{municipal}} council {{voted in favor}} of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball in 1990. At the time, team president Larry Schmittou tried to convince the city to approve a new ballpark, but was unsuccessful. Throughout the 2000s, the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new ballpark to replace Greer. At one point, a new stadium, First Tennessee Field, was planned for construction {{on the west bank}} of the Cumberland River in downtown. Disagreements over who <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ballpark repeatedly pushed back opening day at the stadium, and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs, including over $2.5million worth of improvements from 2008 to 2009, were made to Greer in order to preserve its functionality until a new stadium could be built. A deal for such a new ballpark was achieved in late 2013. The Sounds played their final game at Greer on August 27, 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact nature}} of Fitnas release was {{uncertain}} up until its official launch. This was due to concerns of the legality of its content and anticipated acts of terrorism.

By September 2006, the bugs were worked out and the Go-To Cards became operational.|$|E
25|$|The {{rail system}} and its {{planning}} was estimated to cost $7–$8 billion. The Florida HSRA and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) reached an agreement with a consortium that included the Fluor Corporation and Bombardier Transportation. The consortium agreed to invest $300 million and utilize the DBOM functionality. The state of Florida would float state bonds, and FDOT would commit $70 million annually (increasing three percent yearly to account for inflation) to service the bonds for the next thirty years. Federal monies <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interest on the bonds, and the state monies would satisfy the principal.

25|$|Lawmakers did {{not approve}} another {{initiative}} of Blagojevich's, FamilyCare (which would provide healthcare for families of four making up to $82,000), but Blagojevich attempted to implement the plan unilaterally by executive order. In rejecting Blagojevich's executive order, a legislative committee questioned how the state <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> program. Blagojevich's decision has been called unconstitutional by two courts, which nullified the plan. However, during October 2008, pharmacies which had followed Blagojevich's directive to dispense drugs under the plan were informed by his administration {{that they would not}} be reimbursed and would have payments given under the system deducted from future Medicaid payments. One state lawmaker, Republican Ron Stephens, suggested that Blagojevich should pay the difference out of his own personal account. The Pantagraph agreed with Stephens in an editorial.|$|E
25|$|On September 3, 1902, the {{contract}} {{between the city}} administration and the horsecar company expired and the entire horsecar street rail system, including track, carriages, horses, maintenance buildings and other equipment, became property {{of the city of}} Saint Petersburg - on the condition that the city <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> takeover over the period of 12 years. Immediately following this, Saint Petersburg began planning out the future electric tramway network, which was due to replace the ageing horsecar one. A number of issues had to be resolved; in particular, the narrow-gauge horsecar tracks were to be replaced by the heavy rail-grade ones; the network had to be electrified, and new depots suitable for electric trams had to be constructed. The project was delegated to the American Westinghouse Electric Corporation. On September 29, 1907, the electric tramway network opened in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|Producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week {{contract}} {{to perform in}} The Streets of Paris on Broadway after seeing her perform in 1939 at Rio’s Cassino da Urca. Although {{she was interested in}} performing in New York, she refused to accept the deal unless Shubert agreed to also hire her band, the Bando da Lua. He refused, saying that there were many capable musicians in New York who could back her. Miranda remained steadfast, feeling that North American musicians {{would not be able to}} authenticate the sounds of Brazil. Shubert compromised, agreeing to hire the six band members but not paying for their transport to New York. President Getúlio Vargas, recognizing the value to Brazil of Miranda's tour, announced that the Brazilian government <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band's transportation on the Moore-McCormack Lines between Rio and New York. Vargas believed that Miranda would foster ties between the northern and southern hemispheres and act as a goodwill ambassador in the United States, increasing Brazil's share of the American coffee market. Miranda took the official sanction of her trip and her duty to represent Brazil to the outside world seriously. She left for New York on the SS Uruguay on May 4, 1939, a few months before World War II.|$|E

25|$|Ramos {{personally}} {{pushed for}} the speedy approval {{of some of the}} most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent power producers (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to the former president. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were insurance contracts in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of government guarantee or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the power crisis had been considered solved by the end of 1993. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates may rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts that would mean excess power. The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities' IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors create considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions, would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public. It was said that, presidents since Corazon Aquino catered mostly to the needs of big business for power and allowed the private sector to profit from this lucrative industry rather than craft an energy plan that would meet the needs of the Filipinos.|$|E

Although there was little development in the area before the late 18th century, as Bristol became more prosperous, Clifton became fashionable and more wealthy merchants moved to the area. In 1793 William Bridges published plans for a stone arch with abutments containing factories, which <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> upkeep of the bridge. The French Revolutionary Wars broke out soon after the design was published, affecting trade and commerce, so the plans were shelved.
