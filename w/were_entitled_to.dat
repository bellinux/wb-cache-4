5|$|Justice Harlan is {{credited}} for the establishing that the First Amendment protects {{the freedom of}} association. In NAACP v. Alabama, Justice Harlan delivered {{the opinion of the}} court, invalidating an Alabama law that required the NAACP to disclose membership lists. However he did not believe that individuals <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> exercise their First Amendment rights wherever they pleased. He joined in Adderley v. Florida, which controversially upheld a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from Brown v. Louisiana, in which the Court held that protesters <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> engage in a sit-in at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with Tinker v. Des Moines, in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands (as a form of protest) in public schools.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} pre-Reform {{electorate}} {{is difficult}} to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English subjects <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%.|$|E

Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.|$|E

5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|The story survives {{through the}} Hundred Rolls, the great {{survey of the}} English {{hundreds}} made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical as it might seem, was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes. But the complaints of the local community {{were based on the}} fact that Southchurch had taken all the supplies home to his own manor of Southchurch, received 200 marks from the exchequer, yet never paid out any of what the owners of the goods <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E

5|$|As title holders, Manchester City <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> {{defend the}} Cup Winners' Cup in the 1970–71 season. Had they not won the trophy, {{they would still}} have been {{qualified}} for European competition, as City's victory in the 1970 League Cup granted {{a place in the}} Fairs Cup. As a UEFA-organised competition, the Cup Winners' Cup took precedence over the Fairs Cup, and so the club took a place in the former. In the first round Manchester City almost suffered an upset at the hands of Linfield, from Belfast. City held a one-goal lead after the first leg, but Linfield twice took the lead in the second leg. The match finished 2–1 to Linfield, and Manchester City progressed on the away goals rule. Honvéd were the opposition in the second round. Manchester City won both legs, the score 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization {{from that of the}} state in the previous primary cases. However, in United States v. Classic (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were {{an essential part of the}} electoral process, undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in Smith v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E
5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai and the State of Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese thought that they <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics with support from the Belgian government and private interests such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> wear the mitre, {{including}} abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also {{appeared as a}} crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{broke into}} the NHL in 1989, playing for the St. Louis Blues. In the {{off-season}} following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils. Shanahan was a restricted free agent, and thus the Devils <b>were</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> compensation. The teams could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens. Joseph {{seemed to be the}} answer the Devils were looking for in goal, however the case went to arbitration, and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991.|$|E

Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers.

An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E
