Hot-worked <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steels</b> can be used from the air-cooled state. If controlled cooling is used, the material can produce mechanical properties similar to Q&T steels. Machinability is better than Q&T steels because of their more uniform hardness and their ferrite-pearlite microstructure.|$|R

40|$|Two commercially {{available}} medium carbon and low carbon <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> were evaluated in this study. The steels were cold strained in tension 5 % and were aged at 100 - 450 ºC for 1 hour. Strained and aged specimens were then retested to fracture and mechanical properties of steels were measured. Changes in mechanical properties such as {{ultimate tensile strength}} and yield strength were observed at ageing temperatures. This ageing is assºCiated with interaction between interstitial solutes and dislºCations which are preferential sites for solute atom diffusion.

40|$|The {{characterisation}} of the compositional condition (particle dissolution/precipitation level),and the microstructural condition (austenite {{grain size}} and deformation state) are ofvital {{importance for the}} subsequent phase transformations which occur during continuous cooling after thermomechanical processes of <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steels.</b> Thermoelectric power (TEP) measurement has been revealed as powerful method to analyse dissolution/precipitation processes together with recovery and recrystallisation phenomena. In this sense, this paper deals with characterising the austenitising condition by two fundamental parameters such as the prior austenite grain size (PAGS) and TEP. Likewise, to validate this hypothesis, the austenitising condition after a forging process in a medium carbon <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> has been simulated by a simple heat treatment which reproduce the same PAGS and TEP values.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we have {{discussed}} the selected problems of microstructure development during the whole manufacturing process, i. e. continuous casting, thermomechanical processing, and cold metal forming of the <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steels</b> wires. In the investigated steels, the microstructure development was controlled by the history of deformation and by the effects of microalloying elements, mostly Nb, Ti, and B. It has been concluded that obtained in the ultrafine grained <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steel</b> wires mechanical properties were first of all resulting from specific structural composition and grain refinement. Additionally, it has been proven that austenite grain refinement, that increases nucleation rate during the austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation, {{as a result of}} the thermomechanical processing, are very beneficial from point of view of the final mechanical properties.

50|$|Niobium carbide is a {{frequent}} intentional product in <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steels</b> due to its extremely low solubility product in austenite, the lowest of all the refractory metal carbides. This means that micrometre-sized precipitates of NbC are virtually insoluble in steels at all processing temperatures and their location at grain boundaries helps prevent excessive grain growth in these steels. This is of enormous benefit, and the cornerstone of <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steels,</b> because it is their uniform, very fine grain size that ensures both toughness and strength.The only commonly occurring compound with a lower solubility and hence, greater potential for restricting the grain growth of steels is titanium nitride.|$|R

The scope of this review will include the historical background on quenched and tempered vanadium steels, precipitation during isothermal aging, conventional controlled rolling and during thin slab direct charging and the development of strength and toughness in vanadium <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steels.</b> The characterisation of microstructure, in particular the methods for the analysis of the chemical composition of precipitates, has progressed since the availability of X-ray energy dispersive analysis in the 1970 s, and the role played by electron energy loss spectroscopy in providing quantitative analysis of carbon and nitrogen in vanadium <b>microalloyed</b> <b>steels</b> will be presented.
