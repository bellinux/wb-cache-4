500|$|The third {{ball was}} revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a {{computerized}} lighting system with 180 halogen bulbs and 144 strobe lights, and over 12,000 rhinestones. Lighting designer Barry Arnold {{stated that the}} changes were [...] "something [...] {{had to be done}} to make this event more spectacular as <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> millennium." ...|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{video for}} the tour was {{released}} in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, [...] "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" [...] The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had [...] "no idea what [...] {{has to do with}} the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> tour's launch." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Pax Domini (Lat. [...] "Peace of the Lord") is {{the same}} {{greeting}} spoken by the risen Christ to His disciples on Easter evening. It is the final blessing before <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> altar to receive the gift of Christ's body and blood." ...|$|E

60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> tents, {{chanting}} weird {{songs of}} victory, the surveyor met us, and {{in answer to}} his questions Johnston laughed.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> garden gate, I saw {{a servant}} {{from the house}} waiting there. He carried a message from my mother--a message for me.|$|R
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review: [...] "It's deals and betrayal on Once Upon a Time as <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> final two weeks of Season 5. So it's fitting, naturally, that we pick up with Emma (and everyone else) asking WHAT?" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{more than}} a century of {{electric}} technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned. Rapidly, <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> final phase of the extensions of manâ€”the technological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society. (3-4) ...|$|E
2500|$|Paradoxically, {{dimensional}} analysis {{can be a}} useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the Ising model {{can be used to}} study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. As <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, [...] ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on [...] "dimensional grounds" [...] that the non-analytical part of the free energy per lattice site should be [...] where [...] is the dimension of the lattice.|$|E
60|$|The doctrines {{announced}} by the noble Marquess opposite, and by my noble friend, are the standpoint from which <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> situation and framed our proposals.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> harbor at Folkestone, Romayne's {{agitation}} {{appeared to}} subside. His head drooped; his eyes half closed--he {{looked like a}} weary man quietly falling asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be not downhearted, dearest Dus," [...] I whispered, as <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> storehouse; [...] "after all, these wretches {{will not}} dare to transgress against the law, very far." ...|$|R
60|$|At last to calm incandescence, Burned clean by remorseless hate, Now, at the day's renascence <b>We</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "You surely {{understand}} {{the reason why}} it grows warmer as <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> equator, and colder as we go from it, whether we go north or south?" ...|$|E
60|$|More {{and more}} {{beautiful}} grows {{the scene as}} <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> Rhone--the river broader, hills more commanding, and architecture tinged with the Italian. Bradshaw says it equals the Rhine.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> island <b>we</b> saw {{hundreds}} of pelicans, some flying about, some sitting on trunks and branches of dead trees, and some waddling {{about on the}} shore.|$|R
60|$|She {{supposed}} {{that we were}} following her, {{but as soon as}} the space was left clear, <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill.|$|R
60|$|We {{said no more}} as <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> light, {{but made}} softly for the door. I laid my hand upon the latch; and {{whispering}} Steerforth to keep close to me, went in.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, sir," [...] he said, [...] "we {{may fall}} in with peasants, or be {{challenged}} by sentries, as <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> battery, and {{my ability to}} speak Spanish might be an advantage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{be careful}} how <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> shore, lads," [...] cautioned Jerry. [...] "If we strike the rocks, it may cost us our lives. Perhaps we had better hold off until daylight." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> hopeless {{sprawling}} {{of modern}} Rome--over the yellow Tiber, past the famous pyramid tomb, skirting {{the walls of}} the city, till at last we plunge in, into the well-known station, out of all the chaos.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> Jed of Zodanga {{no sign of}} {{greeting}} or recognition crossed his face; not even to Carthoris did he vouchsafe a friendly word. His attitude was cold, haughty, and uncompromising.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> vessels, {{their huge}} black hulls loomed {{up out of}} the dark surroundings, and were pictured against the sky, which, dark though it was, had not the intense {{blackness}} of the vessels themselves.|$|R
6000|$|Reverend Finch was {{suffering}} under a second suspension of speech. All {{he could say}} as <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> door of the silent and solitary building--and he said that with extreme difficulty--was, [...] "Pray let us be careful!" ...|$|R
60|$|Thus far of {{the general}} idea of M. Comte's ethics and religion. We must now say {{something}} of the details. Here <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> ludicrous side of the subject: but we shall unfortunately have to relate other things far more really ridiculous.|$|E
60|$|And now <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> {{last and}} chief series of {{morphological}} phenomena {{which must be}} ascribed to the direct action of environing matters and forces. These are presented to us when we study the early stages {{in the development of}} the embryos of the Metazoa in general.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Jonas, {{we must be}} careful," [...] John said, [...] "how <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> house. It {{would give}} them a terrible shock, if I came upon them suddenly. I think you had better go up alone, and see Isaac, and bring him to me; then we can talk over {{the best way of}} {{breaking}} it to the others." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> {{fringe of}} rushes which marked its border, a foul, dank smell rose {{up from the}} {{stagnant}} wilderness, as from impure water and decaying vegetation--an earthy, noisome smell which poisoned the fresh upland air.|$|R
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> Mission, {{groups of}} Mexican children, {{many of them}} in their bare feet, thronged about us with funny little offerings, {{composed}} of flowers whose astonishing tones were often a mad blending of orange and deep pink.|$|R
50|$|Continued {{growth in}} demand for student places at the College has meant that an {{additional}} English teaching block containing six classrooms, new Special Needs Accommodation, an additional Laboratory and a new Art and Design room were opened as <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> millennium.|$|R
60|$|But as <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> present age {{we still}} find {{wonderful}} narrations about archers. Robin Hood, for instance, {{was a great}} fellow with the bow. It is said that on one occasion he shot an arrow so that it fell a mile {{from where he was}} standing! A long shot, and hard to be equalled by the crack rifles of the present day.|$|E
6000|$|Suppose {{the various}} kinds of land to be {{represented}} by the [...] alphabet; that those below O pay no agricultural rent, and that [...] all lands increase in fertility and situation as <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> [...] beginning of the alphabet, but which, as far up as K, are used in [...] agriculture; that higher than K all are more profitably used for [...] building purposes, viz.: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine is {{of little}} moment; it is already sold to my king, and is a prize to be seized by any enemy who may possess the power. I have no father to expect me, and but few friends to lament a fate which I have courted with the insatiable longings of youth after distinction. But hush! <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> Indian. Magua, the lady with whom you wish to speak is here." ...|$|E
60|$|I am free {{to confess}} that my heart beat much {{more rapidly than}} it should have done when <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> guard {{stationed}} here and there at intervals along the entire line of entrenchments on which soldiers were working with pick and shovel.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> door; but {{suddenly}} a woman {{appeared out of}} the shadow {{and stood in the}} golden track of the lamp-light. I could not see her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in an attitude of entreaty.|$|R
60|$|It {{can well}} be {{supposed}} that we held our peace as <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> point {{and heard the}} cries of the sentinels on the shore, and I believed of a verity that we could not put the skiff aground without being halted.|$|R
