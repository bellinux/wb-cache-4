500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you down. I think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 2015, Andrew Shaw of Nerdist {{felt that}} Post [...] "chose to ignore expectation, market restrictions, and {{contemporary}} trends", and that [...] "the singer pushed her vocal performances into new places, where no other vocalists could dare to sing". He compared the album's impact on audiences {{to that of}} Jimi Hendrix's 1967 album, Are You Experienced, writing it [...] "set the benchmark for what was possible <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> tradition {{and set it on}} fire". Shaw also argued further that the album was a classic and, as a whole, [...] "simply genius"; considering [...] "the masterstroke of the collection is in the thread that ties each disparate view into one singular perspective". David Longstreth of Dirty Projectors is an admirer of the record, stating he was influenced by Björk's deconstruction of classic melodies. American singer-songwriter Amy Lee has said Post is [...] "one of the biggest records in [...] life".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepiwall for HitFix {{wrote that}} the finale had [...] "funny throwaway lines and moments" [...] but that overall [...] "it was another largely flat episode, and one that leaned too heavily on the guest stars." [...] Callie Carmichael of CNN was less positive, writing that [...] "I Do Do" [...] fell [...] "a bit flat", and concluded [...] "As a rule of thumb, sitcoms usually fall short <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the characters out of their element, and this one definitely did with three weddings in three separate places." [...] Eleanor Barkhorn from The Atlantic had issues with the plot twists, citing {{that they would not}} [...] "bode well {{for the future of the}} series." [...] She explained that Jack and Avery having a child was [...] "problematic", observing that it puts a [...] "relatively definite end" [...] to the sexual tension between Liz and Jack that occurred in the show's first season. In addition, Barkhorn noted that Damon's character was a [...] "great match" [...] for Tina Fey's Liz, but believed that the relationship between the two would not last.|$|E

500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E
500|$|Some criticised {{the visual}} allure of the character, up to {{allegations}} of sexual objectification. Mentioning [...] "the subject of unlockable gym slips for Ayane" [...] in 2002, Edge magazine stated that while it [...] "remains opposed to videogame censorship, the Dead or Alive franchise has certainly challenged the boundaries of taste in games." [...] In 2009, Joe Newman of GamesRadar ranked the series of Team Ninja's controversial Sigma 2 commercials, designed {{to draw attention to}} the fact that the [...] "notoriously big-breasted" [...] Ayane was a playable character (one of which was called by Destructoid [...] "the best and worst thing to have ever been created"), as the fourth most blatantly sexist game advertisement ever, adding: [...] "God forbid a moment goes by where any part of her body might be covered up." [...] Team Ninja's post-Itagaki head Yosuke Hayashi dismissed the criticism, stating in 2012: [...] "With the representation of female characters in the Dead or Alive franchise, we've always wanted to make the girls look as attractive as possible, and that's something that's not going to change for us at all." [...] Hayashi explained: [...] "We are a Japanese developer, and we're making the female characters with our common sense and our creative sense. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> that to countries outside of Japan, it tends to be very misinterpreted in some cases, people considering it sexist or derogatory, etc." [...] The issue was also dismissed in 2015 by Team Ninja creative director Tom Lee, who said they as well as most of their [...] "fans around the world don’t share the same sentiments" [...] as their critics.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Eric Neigher {{scored the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 {{versions}} 3 out of 5, writing [...] "the setting, characterization, and run-and-gun shooterificness get watered down by linear level design, been-done set pieces, and too-heavy {{a reliance on}} the western films of yore." [...] He criticized the game for bringing nothing new to the first-person shooter genre, and although he praised the storyline and the differentiation between the gameplay styles of Ray and Thomas, he was critical {{of the lack of}} a split-screen or online co-op mode; [...] "The lack of co-op is made all the more astounding <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> into account how great Bound in Bloods other multiplayer modes are."

2500|$|In {{his junior}} season, Douglas {{continued}} his transition to point guard, creating offensive opportunities for {{others on the}} team in addition to scoring by himself. Although Douglas still needed to work on polishing the distribution aspect of his game, coach Hamilton said in January 2008 that [...] "he's done an exceptional job <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> into consideration this hasn't been his role prior to coming to Florida State." [...] Douglas' defense improved considerably; he accumulated 2.6 steals per game as a junior (compared to 1.2 steals in the previous season), the highest rate in the ACC. His total of 48 steals in 16 games against ACC teams is the third-highest in league history. In {{a game against the}} University of Virginia, Douglas' steal in the final minute (his sixth of the game) and subsequent free throws carried Florida State to a win that helped their chances of being selected to the 2008 NCAA tournament.|$|E
