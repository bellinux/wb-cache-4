50|$|Ecoregions can be {{categorized}} using an algorithmic approach or a holistic, “weight-of-evidence” approach where the importance of various factors may vary. An example of the algorithmic approach is Robert Bailey’s work for the U.S. Forest Service, which uses a hierarchical classification that first divides land areas into very large regions based on climatic factors, and subdivides these regions, based first on dominant potential vegetation, and then by geomorphology and soil characteristics. The <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach is exemplified by James Omernik’s work for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, subsequently adopted (with modification) for North America by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation.|$|E

However, they do encourage the voluntary submission of well-documented, quality genomics data. Both agencies are considering the use of submitted data {{on a case-by-case basis}} for assessment purposes (e.g., to help elucidate mechanism of action or contribute to a <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach) or for populating relevant comparative databases by encouraging parallel submissions of genomics data and traditional toxicologic test results.|$|E
5000|$|Two reviews {{have been}} {{published}} on the toxicity of POEA to humans. The earlier, published in 2000, evaluated studies that were performed for regulatory purposes as well as published research reports. It found that [...] "no significant toxicity occurred in acute, subchronic, and chronic studies. Direct ocular exposure to the concentrated Roundup formulation can result in transient irritation, while normal spray dilutions cause, at most, only minimal effects. The genotoxicity data for glyphosate and Roundup were assessed using a <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach and standard evaluation criteria. There was no convincing evidence for direct DNA damage in vitro or in vivo, and {{it was concluded that}} Roundup and its components do not pose a risk for the production of heritable/somatic mutations in humans. ...Glyphosate, AMPA, and POEA were not teratogenic or developmentally toxic....Likewise there were no adverse effects in reproductive tissues from animals treated with glyphosate, AMPA, or POEA in chronic and/or subchronic studies. Results from standard studies with these materials also failed to show any effects indicative of endocrine modulation. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of Roundup herbicide does not result in adverse effects on development, reproduction, or endocrine systems in humans and other mammals. ...

In an attempt to assist the Science Advisory Board Carcinogen Identification Committee (CIC) in its consideration of DINP, OEHHA staff prepared a Hazard Identification Document (HID) on DINP. OEHHA failed in that attempt as the HID shockingly does not provide a balanced and complete summary by which the CIC may make a <b>weight-of-evidence</b> determination. It consistently fails to recognize the breadth and depth of available scientific literature that exhaustively shows the lack of human relevance and/or biological significance of the rodent observations. The HID also engages in speculation about possible alternative mechanisms of action in rodents. These hypotheses are irrelevant to the <b>weight-of-evidence</b> evaluation before the CIC.

40|$|Information on polymorphisms, mutations, and {{epigenetic}} events {{has become}} increasingly important {{in our understanding of}} molecular mechanisms associated with exposures-disease outcomes. Molecular landscapes can be developed to illustrate the molecular characteristics for environmental carcinogens as well as associated disease outcomes, although comparison of these molecular landscapes can often be difficult to navigate. We developed a method to organize these molecular data that uses a <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach to rank overlapping molecular events by relative importance for susceptibility to an exposure-disease paradigm. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach, we discuss the example of benzene as an environmental carcinogen and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as a causative disease endpoint. Using this <b>weight-of-evidence</b> method, we found overlapping polymorphisms in the genes for the metabolic enzymes GST and NQO 1, both of which may infer risk of benzene-induced MDS. Polymorphisms in the tumor suppressor gene, TP 53, and the inflammatory cytokine gene, TNF-α, were also noted, albeit inferring opposing outcomes. The alleles identified in the DNA repair gene RAD 51 indicated an increased risk for MDS in MDS patients and low blood cell counts in benzene-exposed workers.

40|$|AbstractRomosozumab is a humanized {{immunoglobulin}} G 2 {{monoclonal antibody}} that binds and blocks {{the action of}} sclerostin, a protein secreted by the osteocyte and an extracellular inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. Blockade of sclerostin binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP 5 and LRP 6) allows Wnt ligands to activate canonical Wnt signaling in bone, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption, making sclerostin an attractive target for osteoporosis therapy. Because romosozumab is a bone-forming agent and an activator of canonical Wnt signaling, questions have arisen regarding a potential carcinogenic risk. <b>Weight-of-evidence</b> factors used {{in the assessment of}} human carcinogenic risk of romosozumab included features of canonical Wnt signaling, expression pattern of sclerostin, phenotype of loss-of-function mutations in humans and mice, mode and mechanism of action of romosozumab, and findings from romosozumab chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. Although the <b>weight-of-evidence</b> factors supported that romosozumab would pose a low carcinogenic risk to humans, the carcinogenic potential of romosozumab was assessed in a rat lifetime study. There were no romosozumab-related effects on tumor incidence in rats. The findings of the lifetime study and the <b>weight-of-evidence</b> factors collectively indicate that romosozumab administration would not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans...|$|E

40|$|International {{regulatory}} and pharmaceutical industry scientists are discussing {{revision of the}} International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S 1 guidance on rodent carcinogenicity assessment of small molecule pharmaceuticals. A <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach is proposed to determine the need for rodent carcinogenicity studies. For compounds with high human cancer risk, the product may be labeled appropriately without conducting rodent carcinogenicity studies. For compounds with minimal cancer risk, only a 6 -month transgenic mouse study (rasH 2 mouse or p 53 þ/ mouse) or a 2 -year mouse study would be needed. If rodent carcino-genicity testing may add significant value to cancer risk assessment, a 2 -year rat study and either a 6 -month transgenic mouse or a 2 -year mouse study is appropriate. In many cases, therefore, one rodent carcinogenicity study could be sufficient. The rasH 2 model predicts neoplastic findings relevant to human cancer risk assessment as well as 2 -year rodent models, produces fewer irrelevant neoplastic outcomes, and often will be preferable to a 2 -year rodent study. Before revising ICH S 1 guidance, a prospective evaluation will be conducted to test the proposed <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach. This evaluation offers {{an opportunity for a}} secondary analysis comparing the value of alternative mouse models and 2 -year rodent studies in the proposed ICH S 1 <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach for human cancer risk assessment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractProfound {{immunosuppression}} (e. g., AIDS, transplant therapy) is epidemiologically {{associated with}} an increased cancer risk, and often with oncogenic viruses. It is currently unclear how broadly this association translates to therapeutics that modulate immunity. A workshop co-sponsored by the FDA and HESI examined how perturbing the immune system may contribute to carcinogenesis, and highlighted priorities for improving non-clinical risk assessment of targeted immunomodulatory therapies. Conclusions from the workshop were as follows. 1) While profound altered immunity can promote tumorigenesis, not all components of the immune system are equally important in defense against or promotion of cancer and a similar cancer risk for all immunomodulatory molecules should not be assumed. 2) Rodent carcinogenicity studies have limitations and are generally not reliable predictors of cancer risk associated with immunosuppression. 3) Cancer risk needs to be evaluated based on mechanism-based <b>weight-of-evidence,</b> including data from immune function tests most relevant to tumor immunosurveillance or promotion. 4) Information from nonclinical experiments, clinical epidemiology and immunomodulatory therapeutics show that immunosurveillance involves a complex network of cells and mediators. To support a <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach, an increased focus on understanding the quantitative relationship between changes in relevant immune function tests and cancer risk is needed...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the performance of}} models to interpret complex DNA profiles is best undertaken using real DNA profiles. Here we used a data set to reflect the variety typically encountered in real casework.

Two kinds of analyses were performed, namely tests on whether a person of interest is a contributor based on <b>weight-of-evidence</b> (likelihood ratio) calculations, and deconvolution test to estimate the profile of unknown constituent parts. The <b>weight-of-evidence</b> analyses compared LRmix Studio with EuroForMix including exploration of the effect of applying an ad hoc stutter-filter. For the deconvolution analysis we compared EuroForMix with LoCIM-tool. When we classified persons of interests into being true contributors or non-contributors, we found that EuroForMix, overall, returned a higher true positive rate for the same false positive levels compared to LRmix. In particular, in cases with an unknown major component, EuroForMix was more discriminating for mixtures where the person of interest was a minor contributor. Comparing deconvolution of major contributors we found that EuroForMix overall performed better than LoCIM-tool...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} assess the {{potential}} mine subsidence impact undoubtedly can be valuable for subsidence management plans and any decision-making process carried out prior to mining. The paper describes a quantitative spatial methodology for the mapping of potential mine subsidence impacts on cliff-lines using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The approach is developed using a GIS-based <b>weight-of-evidence</b> methodology with the following characteristics: • A data driven technique for impact assessment during the preliminary stages of mine design when the field data is limited. • Identification of pertinent controlling factors in rockfall occurrence phenomena. • The analysis {{of the level of}} influence for each controlling factor, weighting and combining evidential factors using the <b>weight-of-evidence</b> method. • The mapping of the probability of a rockfall occurrence within the area of interest. A mining area in Australia was used as a case study; two models were developed based on different mine layouts for a proposed longwall mining area. In the first layout, longwall panels were planned to extend beneath the steep sided areas of the nearby river, and a second layout in which the mine layout was modified so that mining does not occur directly beneath or within 50 m of the steep slopes. The results from the case study show a significant reduction in probabilities of rockfall occurrence when mining is avoided within 50 m of the nearby river cliffs...|$|E

40|$|The Bayesian {{probability}} model, {{using the}} <b>weight-of-evidence</b> method, {{was applied to}} the task of evaluating landslide susceptibility using GIS data (Arc Spatial Data Modeller). The location chosen for the study was the Itajaí Valley, SC in Brazil, which suffered substantial landslide damage following heavy rain in 2008. Landslide locations were identified in the study area from the interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images, and a spatial database was extracted from ASTER GDEM (Global Digital Elevation Model), geological map and LANDSAT imagery. The factors that influence landslide occurrence, such as slope, aspect, curvature plan and profile, direction flow, topographic wetness index and stream power index of topography, were calculated from ASTER imagery. Lithology and NDVI were extracted from a geological database (CPRM) and LANDSAT imagery. The spatial association between the factors and the landslides was calculated as the contrast values, W+ and W- using the weights-of-evidence model. Tests of conditional independence were performed for the selection of the factors, allowing the large number of combinations of factors to be analyzed. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for all landslide susceptibility models were calculated. Landslide locations were used to validate results of the landslide susceptibility map generated using the <b>weight-of-evidence</b> approach and the verification results showed a 74, 56 % accuracy.
