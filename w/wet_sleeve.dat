25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the <b>wet</b> <b>sleeve,</b> water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E

60|$|He {{had some}} reason to be gruff, for if he had passed the day in a waterfall, he could {{scarcely}} have been wetter than he was. He was wrapped up to the eyes in a rough blue sailor's coat, and had an oil-skin hat on, from the capacious brim of which the rain fell trickling down upon his breast, and back, and shoulders. Judging from a certain liveliness of chin--he had so pulled down his hat, and pulled up his collar, to defend himself from the weather, that she could only see his chin, and even across that he drew the <b>wet</b> <b>sleeve</b> of his shaggy coat, {{as she looked at}} him--Mrs Lupin set him down for a good-natured fellow, too.|$|E

Istra fell asleep, and her head drooped on his shoulder. He straightened to bear its weight, though his back twinged with stiffness, and there he sat unmoving, through an hour of pain and happiness and confused meditation, studying the curious background--the dark roof of broken thatch, the age-corroded walls, the littered earthen floor. His hand pressed lightly the clammy smoothness of the wet khaki of her shoulder; his <b>wet</b> <b>sleeve</b> stuck to his arm, and he wanted to pull it free. His eyes stung. But he sat tight, while his mind ran round in circles, considering that he loved Istra, and {{that he would not be}} entirely sorry when he was no longer the slave to her moods; that this adventure was the strangest and most romantic, also the most idiotic and useless, in history.|$|E

5000|$|The Mazda B-Series {{pickup truck}} was {{introduced}} in Japan in August 1961 as the B1500 (BUA61). This model was the only Japanese market model to be badged under the B-Series naming scheme, i.e. B1500. The BUD61 (second generation) that followed was the first model of the long-running [...] "Proceed" [...] series sold in Japan. It had a 1,484 cc OHV water-cooled engine with <b>wet</b> <b>sleeve</b> cylinders which produced , and a one-ton payload. This model also had a torsion bar front/leaf spring rear suspension, which was advanced for its time, giving it a relatively smooth ride. The B1500 was remodeled between late 1962 and September 1963; it received a new chassis code, BUB61. The BUB61 was more spacious; its cabin was extended by 80 mm {{and it had a}} stretched body and wheelbase. The BUB61 had a new, upside-down, trapezoidal grille instead of the earlier full-width unit, with thirteen bars rather than nine, turn signals on the fenders, and more chrome trim—including a decor strip on the side.|$|E
50|$|Temperature: If the {{relative}} humidity is kept constant, {{the higher the}} temperature, the higher the drying rate. Temperature influences the drying rate by increasing the moisture holding capacity of the air, {{as well as by}} accelerating the diffusion rate of moisture through the wood.The actual temperature in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), which is the temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb.

The aluminium 90-degree SOHC V6 engine was roughly based on the 2.0 L Merak engine, itself based on earlier V8 Formula One Maserati engines, designed by Giulio Alfieri (1924-2002).

40|$|Wet snow accumulating and {{shedding}} from overhead {{transmission lines}} {{can lead to}} a number of serviceability, safety and mechanical reliability issues. An innovative and inexpensive method to reproduce wet snow accretions on a cable in a controlled environment is explained. <b>Wet</b> snow <b>sleeves</b> were experimentally reproduced by using this technique to study their shedding mechanism. A numerical modeling technique using nonlinear finite element analysis is proposed to evaluate the dynamic response of an overhead cable subjected to any snow-shedding scenario. A time function is associated to the mass and weight of each snow element, which enables its virtual removal from the model at the time prescribed by the user. The response of a single span of overhead ground wire subjected to total and partial snow shedding scenarios is evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Wet snow {{can create}} serious {{electrical}} and mechanical problems to power transmission networks {{due to its}} high adherence to materials. In this study, both adherence of wet snow to cables and wet snow shedding following the application of periodic loads were investigated in small-scale experiments. Wet snow was obtained from fresh dry snow collected from {{the top layer of}} snow accumulated outdoors. The collected dry snow was exposed to warm air for periods of time long enough to obtain the desired liquid water content (LWC) values. <b>Wet</b> snow <b>sleeves</b> were manually prepared after being compressed around the cable. The room temperature, snow sleeve length, cable diameter, and cable length were kept constant for each experiment. Dynamic load on the cable was simulated by a periodic excitation applied {{at one end of the}} cable, while the other end was fixed. Since fading adhesion is a condition for snow shedding, and since LWC is a critical factor influencing adhesion, the effects of excitation frequency and amplitude were investigated for different LWC values. LWC was examined for values from 10 to 40 %. When free water began to increase, snow at this stage was wet and it adhered stronger to the cable than low LWC, where there is no enough water to stick on the cable or high LWC where snow is transparent. The LWC range was found experimentally between 20 to 30 % (Hefny R. et al., 2009). Different snow shedding scenarios were studied, for which the shedding sequence and acceleration were observed at the excitation point, also cable tension at the fixed end and vertical displacement at the mid-point of the span were measured...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly he lay down, {{but would}} not permit himself to doze, as, worn out as he was from want of rest, if he did so he might sleep far into the day. He soon found that, lying down, it would be {{impossible}} for him to keep awake, and accordingly sat down by a large rock in the position to which he had become accustomed. The hours passed slowly, but he had now no difficulty in keeping awake. He was filled with exultation at his escape and at the prospect of turning the tables upon the pirate. As soon as day broke he struck inland, for he knew that a road ran east and west, by which the various products of the land were taken to the town. In half an hour he came upon it, and after following it for a mile came upon the plantation fence. Arriving at the gate, he entered and made his way up to the house. There was already movement there. A group of native labourers were receiving orders from an overseer, who looked in astonishment at the appearance of an officer, haggard, and blistered by the sun, and whose uniform was still <b>wet,</b> and one <b>sleeve</b> altogether missing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wet liner}} {{cylinder}} block features cylinder walls that are entirely removable, which {{fit into the}} block by means of special gaskets. They {{are referred to as}} [...] "wet liners" [...] because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a <b>sleeve.</b> <b>Wet</b> liner designs are popular with European manufacturers, most notably Renault and Peugeot, who continue to use them to the present. Dry liner designs use either the block's material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain [...] "dry" [...] on their outside, surrounded by the block's material. With either wet or dry liner designs, the liners (or sleeves) can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself; but in reality, they are difficult to remove and install, and for many applications (such as most late-model cars and trucks), an engine will never undergo such a procedure in its working lifespan. It is likelier to be scrapped, with new equipment—engine or entire vehicle—replacing it. This is sometimes rightfully disparaged as a symptom of a throw-away society, but on the other hand, it is actually sometimes more cost-efficient and even environmentally protective to recycle machinery and build new instances with efficient manufacturing processes (and superior machine performance and emission control) than it is to overvalue old machinery and craft production.|$|R
