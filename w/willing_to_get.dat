Many people are also <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved in community and activist organizations to promote their well-being. In contrast, perceptions of old age by writers 80+ years old ("old age in the real meaning of the term) tend to be negative.|$|E
25|$|The Chamber of Commerce {{agreed to}} fund the new Dallas Alliance, and both the {{leadership}} and minorities in the Alliance looked to Lowe for assurance. In 1975, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans remanded U.S. District Judge William M. Taylor’s desegregation order and a new plan was called for. Taylor challenged the city {{to come up with}} solutions and to help make them work. He offered amicus curiae, or “friend of the court,” status to any group <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved in the effort, and in the fall of 1975, he approached Lowe with the idea of getting the city’s three largest ethnic groups to talk together in some semblance of equality and reach an agreement that would satisfy the great majority of the people. The Dallas Alliance Task Force was formed.|$|E
25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could tell he was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E

500|$|On 15 November 1941, German tank armies {{began their}} {{offensive}} towards Klin, where no Soviet reserves were available because of Stalin's wish {{to attempt a}} counteroffensive at Volokolamsk, which had forced the relocation of all available reserve forces further south. Initial German attacks split the front in two, separating the 16th Army from the 30th. Several days of intense combat followed. Zhukov recalled in his memoirs that [...] "The enemy, ignoring the casualties, was making frontal assaults, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Moscow by any means necessary." [...] Despite the Wehrmacht's efforts, the multi-layered defense reduced Soviet casualties as the Soviet 16th Army slowly retreated and constantly harassed the German divisions trying {{to make their way}} through the fortifications.|$|E
500|$|Although Knowles had {{previously}} {{worked with a}} wide range of high-profile producers and songwriters on earlier projects, she struggled to convince her wishlisted musicians to contribute to Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, production-wise. This was due to no producer signing on to the project before hearing any material for the album. [...] "I don't think it was offensive," [...] Knowles admitted. [...] "I understand that these are people that want to take on credible passionate projects. So before I would work with them I would schedule a meeting and play them the record. And then they were more convinced and <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on board." [...] Cee-Lo Green and Mark Ronson were not consulted until late into the production of the album, both having been persuaded by Knowles at the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony: [...] "I had to party with Cee-Lo too to get him to work on the record [...] but once he did [...] he signed on immediately." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dutch States' troops {{quartered}} in {{the village}} of Borgerhout numbered 25 or 40 infantry companies which comprised from 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers, plus 100 additional mounted troops. They were the backbone of the rebel army and William of Orange referred to them as [...] "his braves". Moreover, they were led by officers of renown such as François de la Noue and John Norreys. To confront the Spanish Army, they were detached along the village of Borgerhout, which they had fortified by digging a moat and building an earth rampart around the village, from the bridge of Deurne over the Groot Schijn stream, which flowed into the Scheldt, to the road of Voetweg, which ran parallel to the canal of Herentals. Orange deployed four additional French infantry regiments and Walloon troops from the nearby garrisons of Ath and Termonde behind Borgerhout and under the protection of Antwerp's citadel and moat. The city's civic guard, numbering 80 flags of armed and trained burghers, was ready to defend the city if necessary, but not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out to join the battle nor to allow the regular troops to come within Antwerp. The Spanish soldier and chronicler Alonso Vázquez claimed that Orange's army had, in all, 25,000 men.|$|E

500|$|Four years later, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] {{was added}} to the set list of the 2008-09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, where it was used as a video interlude. It {{featured}} Madonna as a boxer on screen, while two of her dancers performed a faux boxing match. The video also showed Madonna in a technical knockout match, spraying her blood across the screen. Madonna's DJ Enferno remixed the song and the performance ended with the singer falling down {{on the ground in the}} video, as she emerged from beneath the stage while jump-roping. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine felt that the video emphasized the singer's [...] "already-muscular arms", adding that [...] "nlike your run-of-the-mill diva, Madonna is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dirty for her art, and she sometimes gets lost in her backup dancers' routine, though she's quick to remind the audience, 'I'm still the one in control'". Ben Kaplan from Canada.com noted that [...] "Die Another Day", along with the performances of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] are re-imagined as [...] "parts of larger medleys, with Madonna giving shout-outs to techno, flamenco and old-school R influences". This performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Birt {{was made}} unpaid Strategy Adviser to Blair in 2001, {{appointed}} {{for what was}} termed [...] "Blue skies thinking" [...] and claimed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to be [...] "worth every penny"; Blair wanted advice from outside the traditional Whitehall mindset – he had known Birt since the 1980s and approved of his analytical approach. Jeremy Heywood, Blair’s principal private secretary, said: “He liked the way that John was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right down into the data and understand the evidence, {{and come up with}} [...] a real sense that you could do things in a totally different way.” [...] Birt supervised the development of long-term strategy on drugs, health, crime reduction, education, transport and London.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1916 Xavier got {{engaged in the}} {{so-called}} Sixtus Affair, a secret Austrian attempt to conclude a separatist peace. The new kaiser Karl I decided to exploit his family ties and friendship with the Bourbon-Parma brothers, trusting especially in the skills and intelligence of Sixte. As loyal French citizens, both agreed to undertake the mission only having first obtained consent of the French government. The role of Xavier is generally considered secondary to this of Sixte, though he was present during some crucial meetings, be it with the French authorities in Paris or with the Austro-Hungarian envoys in Switzerland and in Vienna; however, some scholars refer to [...] "mediation des princes Sixte et Xavier". Negotiations broke down in early 1917 and the issue seemed closed; leaked by Clemenceau in May 1918, {{it turned into a}} political crisis and a scandal, which wrecked the prestige of the young emperor. Xavier and Sixte, at that time in Vienna, were considered endangered, menaced either by the Austrian foreign minister Czernin, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of witnesses, or as victims of popular wrath. The incident is considered [...] "perhaps the ultimate example of amateurish aristocratic diplomacy gone awry during the First World War", though none of the sources consulted tends to blame Xavier for the final failure. It is not clear whether he returned to military service afterwards. At the moment of the armistice he was in the rank of a major of the Belgian army, awarded the French Croix de Guerre, the Belgian Croix de Guerre, and the Belgian Ordré de Léopold.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Mark LeVine {{noted that}} the events in Tunisia could spiral {{into the rest of}} the Arab world as the {{movement}} was [...] "inspiring people...to take to the streets and warn their own sclerotic and autocratic leaders that they could soon face a similar fate." [...] He then cited solidarity protests in Egypt where protesters chanted [...] "Kefaya" [...] and [...] "We are next, we are next, Ben Ali tell Mubarak he is next;" [...] and that Arab bloggers were supporting the movement in Tunisia as [...] "the African revolution commencing...the global anti-capitalist revolution." [...] He pointed to an article in al-Nahar that talked of an [...] "inhuman globalisation" [...] that had been imposed on the Arab world, however a [...] "human" [...] nationalism had not taken place. LeVine then accused the Obama administration in the United States of double standards when Clinton was in the region meeting with political and civil society leaders; however, she responded to a question about the protests, saying [...] "We can't take sides", which was read as a failure to seize the [...] "reins of history" [...] and [...] "usher in a new era" [...] to [...] "defeat the forces of extremism" [...] without the violent conflict in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area. Pointing out Clinton's remarks about regimes whose [...] "foundations are sinking into the sand" [...] and needed [...] "reform", LeVine argued that US foreign policy in the Middle East and the Muslim world was [...] "equally in danger of sinking into the sands if the President and his senior officials are not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ahead of history's suddenly accelerating curve." [...] He added, [...] "It is the US and Europe, as much as the leaders of the region, who in Clinton's words are in need of 'a real vision for that future.'" [...] Finally he said there were two scenarios that could play out: [...] "a greater democratic opening across the Arab world," [...] or a similar situation to Algeria in the early 1990s when the democratic election was annulled and the Algeria went into a civil war.|$|E
