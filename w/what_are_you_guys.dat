5000|$|Ueda {{has made}} all their manzai dialogues. In manzai, Ueda is {{characterized}} as a sloppy, fickle and silly one while Iwasaki as a reasonable one.

How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys!?)</b> followed by his totally meaningless line such as [...] "Do you twirl pasta lately?", [...] "Do you zip lately?", [...] "Do you close curtains lately?", etc. Then, usually Iwasaki warns him [...] "Too friendly (to the audience)! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> saying..." [...] {{and moved on to}} a main dialogue, saying [...] "Listen, I am thinking I would like to...(i.e. travel abroad, buy a pet, ride a motorcycle, etc.)."
