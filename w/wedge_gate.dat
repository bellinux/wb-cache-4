50|$|The main {{armament}} of the SU-152G was the D-50/D-1 152-mm howitzer. It {{was completely}} unified for ballistic characteristics, internal devices and ammunition with the D-1 152 mm towed howitzer. The barrel {{was connected to}} the breech, and a muzzle brake was fixed to the barrel. A vertical <b>wedge</b> <b>gate</b> was installed in the breech, along with a semi-automatic, free-floating ejector. To ease the loading process, a mechanical loader was placed as well. A ZIS-3 panoramic sight along with an OP1-7 direct-fire sight were needed for firing from closed positions to sighted targets. The ammo rack of the SU-152G was capable of holding 42 shells.|$|E
