40|$|In recent years, lots of {{research}} effort {{was spent on}} the integration of process planning and job-shop scheduling. Various integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) models and solution approaches have been proposed. The previous and existing research approaches are able to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing IPPS. However, most of them assumed that setup time is negligible or {{only part of the}} processing time. For machined parts, the setup for each operation includes <b>workpiece</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading, tool change, etc. For setup that depends only on the operation to be processed (sequence-independent), it is applicable to adopt the assumption of not considering setup in IPPS. For setup that depends on both the operation to be processed and the immediately preceding operation (sequence-dependent), it is an oversimplification to adopt such assumption. In such cases, the setup time varies with the sequence of the operations. The process plans and schedules constructed under such assumption are not realistic or not even feasible. In actual practice, therefore, the setup time should be separated from the process time in performing the IPPS functions. In this thesis, a new approach is proposed for IPPS problems with setup time consideration for machined parts. Inseparable and sequence-dependent setup requirements are added into the IPPS problems. The setup times are separated from the process times and they vary with the sequence of the operations. IPPS is regarded as NP-hard problem. With the separated consideration of setup times, it becomes even more complicated. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach is proposed to handle this complicated problem. The system is constructed under a multi-agent system (MAS). AND/OR graph is used to record the set of feasible production procedures and sequences. The ACO algorithm computes results by an autocatalytic process with the objective to minimize the makespan. Software agents called “artificial ants” traverse through the feasible routes in the graph and finally construct a schedule. A setup time parameter is added into the algorithm to influence the ants to select the process with less setup time. The approach is able to construct a feasible solution with less setup time. Experimental studies have been performed to evaluate the performance of MAS-ACO approach in solving IPPS problems with separated consideration of setup times. The experimental results show that the MAS-ACO approach can effectively handle the problem. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDry cutting {{operations}} offer {{economic and}} ecologic advantages over conventional machining. When machining conditions are pushed towards {{the regime of}} high performance cutting, the applicability of dry cutting is limited among others by the achievable geometric accuracy. In order to comply with increasing demands in machining precision and the necessity to expand the utilisation of dry cutting, a novel hybrid model has been developed exemplary for a face milling process. It enables a predictive minimisation of size and shape deviations in machining. The model takes into account deviations due to thermal expansion during the cutting operation and due to machining induced residual stresses which are especially important in the manufacturing of thin-walled high precision components. It is therefore based on two initially separated finite element sub-models. Sub-model 1 calculates the mechanic response of the <b>workpiece</b> <b>loaded</b> with a near surface residual stress field (source stresses) resulting from plastic deformations generated during the chip formation process. Sub-model 2 calculates the local thermal expansion of the workpiece during a three-dimensional simulation of a moving heat source.

40|$|Due to {{intensive}} {{friction between}} grinding particles and workpiece material, a substantial quantity of thermal energy develops during grinding. Efficient determination of real heat loading {{in the surface}} layer of the workpiece material in grinding largely depends on the reliability of basic principles of distribution of heat sources and {{the character of the}} temperature field within the cutting zone. Therefore, this paper takes a different approach towards the identification of the thermal state of the creep-feed grinding process by using the inverse problem to approximate heat conduction.

In order to solve the inverse heat conduction problem, a numerical method using finite differences in implicit form was used. When the inverse heat conduction problem is transformed into an extreme case, the optimization of heat flux leads to an allowed heat loading in the surface layer of workpiece material during grinding.

40|$|AbstractResidual {{stress is}} one of the most {{critical}} parameters in surface integrity, which has a great impact on fatigue life of the machined components. While the flank milling of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V has been widely applied to the manufacture of jet engine for its high productivity in aerospace industry, prediction of residual stress induced by this process is seldom reported. In this paper, an analytical model of residual stress is proposed, based on comprehensive analysis of the mechanical loading during flank milling. For the first time, the sequential discontinuous variable loading feature of flank milling is taken into consideration. An incremental elasto-plastic method followed by a relaxation procedure is used to get the stress-strain history of an arbitrary point in the subsurface so as to predict the residual stress retained in the <b>workpiece</b> after several <b>loading</b> cycles. We find that during the last phase in which the machined surface is generated, the main load comes from the plough effect of cutting edge as the uncut depth approaches zero.

40|$|Confronted with {{substantial}} environmental burden induced by ever-rising consumption {{of energy and}} resources, the manufacturing sector has been urged to shift its production towards a more environmentally conscious paradigm. Hence, sustainable manufacturing has drawn significant attention in recent years. To accomplish this aim, reducing production energy has been acknowledged {{as one of the}} essential tasks. As the key element in manufacturing, machine tools dominate the energy consumption during production. Accordingly, reducing the energy consumption of machine tools can effectively mitigate the adverse environmental impact of manufacturing. This research aims to develop energy-efficient approaches to diminish the energy footprint of machining processes (e. g. turning, milling, and grinding) at machine tool level. Several research subjects have been investigated to address this issue, which mainly involve energy modelling of machine tools, optimization approaches for energy-efficient machining strategies, simulation of energy consumption in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems, and enhancement of the energy conservation of process planning. Firstly, the energy characteristics of machine tools are investigated. The results indicate that the machine energy is significantly influenced by the process parameters. Based on the analysis, the energy model of the machine tool is then developed as a function of process parameters. Two modelling methods, the black-box approach (BBA) and the bottom-up approach (BUA), are developed to establish the energy model of machine tools. The black-box approach considers the machine tool as an opaque object, and the energy characteristic is established empirically by correlating the input machining parameters and their corresponding output energy. In the bottom-up approach, the energy consumption of a machine tool is decomposed into different elements based on either machine state (e. g. startup, standby, cutting) or machine component (e. g. spindle, axis drives). By accumulating the energy of all elements, the total machine energy can be obtained. A modelling accuracy of 95 % can be realized by applying the developed energy models. To develop energy-efficient machining strategies, a surface roughness based approach is proposed to optimize the parameter of the finishing turning process. In this approach, process parameters which can satisfy the surface roughness requirement are firstly selected based on the surface roughness model; then the machining parameters that would lead to minimum energy consumption are determined by applying the established energy model. In addition, the machine energy can also be dramatically affected by different toolpath strategies and non-cutting movement. For selection of toolpath patterns, the investigation for the milling process shows that process time plays a critical role in the energy consumption. A longer toolpath prolongs the machining time and thus requires more energy. The mass of the activated axis also influences the energy, showing that heavier moving axes will result in more energy consumption. For settings in the non-cutting movement, a higher feed rate will increase the energy consumption of axis drives and decrease the energy of auxiliary parts; thus it demonstrates that machine energy presents a U-shape over feed rate, and an optimum feed rate can be selected for non-cutting movement. Moreover, the investigated machining case shows that an overall 50. 6 % of the total machine energy can be reduced through changing process settings (parameters, toolpath pattern, and non-cutting movement). At process chain level, in order to quantitatively allocate the machining stock, a systematic energy-efficient approach, which is based on minimizing the production energy while complying with the required surface roughness, is developed to optimize the grinding stock for the turning-grinding process sequence. The validation results present that, compared to the conventional method (Halevi method), the developed approach reduces 16. 6 % of energy consumption for the turning-grinding process sequence. Furthermore, using the developed energy models, an operation-mode based simulation approach, which incorporates material removal simulation to precisely track the energy of removing material, is developed and validated to predict the energy consumption of machining processes. It is shown from the validation result that by applying the developed approach, the energy consumption of machining one product with a sequence of operations can be simulated accurately within a deviation of 10 %. By merging the developed approach into current CAM systems, energy-efficient computer-aided manufacturing can be achieved, and the process settings can be optimized before the <b>workpiece</b> is <b>loaded</b> onto the machine for execution. The investigated case shows that an overall energy-saving potential of 80 % can be identified by adjusting process settings. Therefore, applying the developed simulation approach will help to facilitate process planning, enhance the energy conservation of machine tools as well as cut down the production cost. Finally, to foster the energy conservation of process planning, a comparative analysis is carried out to investigate how the manufacturing energy footprint is affected by the decision-making at each stage of process planning (selection of blank shape and selection of process settings). Process chains, consisting of primary shaping and machining processes for manufacturing conventional shape and near-net-shape products, are analyzed. At the stage of blank shape selection, the process chain for near-net-shape consumes much less energy in contrast with the process chain of conventional shape, showing that for the studied cases more than 50 % of energy can be mitigated for the whole manufacturing chain. As for the selection of process settings, energy saving of up to 20 % can be realized. It shows that using process chain of near-net-shape saves more energy than modifying process settings. In addition to saving energy consumption, manufacturing of near-net-shape products can also reduce the material usage. About 60 % less material is utilized by manufacturing of near-net-shape products. Therefore, applying near-net-shape is able to achieve both energy- and resource- efficient manufacturing. Besides, it also implies that early decision-makings in process planning would help to save more energy consumption in manufacturing. status: publishe...|$|R

The proposed converter topology decreases the switching losses by decreasing the DC link voltage to half its DC rail voltage value {{with the aid of}} operation under soft switching mode condition. Depending on the modified LLC optimum design being introduced, it shares the advantage features of both voltage fed and current fed inverters with the capability to absorb the undesired parasitic components in the design. The new design involves adding new circuit parameter that helps in controlling the power transfer from the MNPCI to the resonant load tank. All the analytical analysis made and the corresponding experimental work verifies the prototype configuration. This contribution was presented by the author and published in: {B. M. Flayyih; M. Z. Ahmed; M. Ambroze, ''A Novel Hybrid Voltage-Current Fed Induction Heating Power Supply System Using Multilevel Neutral Point Clamped Inverter '', Energycon 2014 IEEE International Energy Conference, Dubrovnik-Croatia. From 13 th - 16 th May 2014 }. 2 -An optimum power control of induction heating system by reducing harmonic distortion content: The development of IH system has become a pressing need to improve the power transfer from power supply to the IH load of the application required, and due to variable characteristic of IH <b>load</b> <b>workpiece</b> during the heating cycle, it is necessary to develop an IH system that operates using resonant inverters with switching frequency that changes according to changing load conditions during the IH application process, in order to keep tuning with natural resonant frequency of the system and keep working under optimal operational point. A novel super frequency induction heating power supply using MNPCI with optimum control algorithm is introduced. The control strategy is to keep phase shift angle between voltage and current approximately zero at all load conditions to ensure maximum power transfer whatever the load parameters changes, that is necessary to reduce the switching losses and increase the efficiency. The load topology being used consists of variable LLC resonant tank with values chosen carefully to coincide with the design. Afterword, an Optimum Harmonic Control of a proposed induction heating power supply with MNPCI is also introduced in this research. The proposed system achieves the soft switching mode for both current and voltage with low harmonic distortion and the capability to maximize the heating power by controlling the harmonics. The modulation strategy depends on changing the ON switching time of the prototype to an optimized value that achieves natural switching with lowest possible harmonic distortion and thus, gaining highest heating power efficiency.

Ambroze, ''An Optimum Harmonic Control of Induction Heating Power Supply System Using Multilevel Neutral Point Clamped Inverter'', The IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo Asia-Pacific (ITEC 2016), Busan, Korea on 1 st - 4 th June, 2016 }. This thesis investigates a novel DC/AC resonant inverter of Induction Heating (IH) system presenting a Multilevel Neutral Point Clamped (MNPCI) topology, as a new part of power supply design. The main function of the prototype is to provide a maximum and steady state power transfer from converter to the resonant load tank, by achieving zero current switching (ZCS) with selecting the best design of load tank topology, and utilizing the advantage aspects of both the Voltage Fed Inverter (VFI) and Current Fed Inverter (CFI) kinds, therefore it can considered as a hybrid-inverter (HVCFI) category. The new design benefits from series resonant inverter design through using two bulk voltage source capacitors to feed a constant voltage delivery to the MNPCI inverter with half the DC rail voltage to decrease the switching losses and mitigate the over voltage surge occurred in inverter switches during operation which may cause damage when dealing with high power systems. Besides, the design profits from the resonant load topology of parallel resonant inverter, through using the LLC resonant load tank. The design gives the advantage of having an output current gain value of about Quality Factor (Q) times the inverter current and absorbs the parasitic components. On the contrary, decreasing inverter current means decreasing the switching frequency and thus, decreasing the switching losses of the system. This aspect increases the output power, which increases the heating efficiency. In order for the proposed system to be more reliable and matches the characteristics of IH process, the prototype is modelled with a variable LLC topology instead of fixed load parameters with achieving soft switching mode of ZCS and zero voltage switching (ZVS) at all load conditions and a tiny phase shift angle between output current and voltage, which might be neglected. To achieve the goal of reducing harmonic distortion, a new harmonic control modulation is introduced, by controlling the ON switching time to obtain minimum Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) content accompanied with optimum power for heating energy.
