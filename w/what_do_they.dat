His idea {{was based on a}} film treatment detailing the colony planet of Llarof where capital punishment is handed down as a sentence for any offense except against those who are immune from the law. In the treatment, a security officer is killed by a local law enforcement officer, who is then killed himself by his partner for unjustly killing the Enterprise crewman. The planet would have had a rebel faction who wanted to overthrow the laws, which Picard refused to back initially whilst citing the Prime Directive. A second draft featured a rebel leader executed for treason. Black explained the premise of a society that developed laws to prevent terrorism and chaos: [...] "Let's say that what we do is kill everybody who is a terrorist or suspected of being a terrorist.

2500|$|The satirist in Tsvetaeva plays second fiddle {{only to the}} poet-lyricist. Several satirical poems, moreover, {{are among}} Tsvetaeva's best-known works: [...] "The Train of Life" [...] ("Poezd zhizni") and [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song" [...] ("Poloterskaya"), both {{included}} in After Russia, and The Rat-catcher (Krysolov, 1925–1926), a long, folkloric narrative. The target of Tsvetaeva's satire is everything petty and petty bourgeois. Unleashed against such dull creature comforts is the vengeful, unearthly energy of workers both manual and creative. In her notebook, Tsvetaeva writes of [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song": [...] "Overall movement: the floorcleaners ferret out a house's hidden things, they scrub a fire into the door... <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> flush out? Coziness, warmth, tidiness, order... Smells: incense, piety. Bygones. Yesterday... The growing force of their threat is far stronger than the climax." [...] The poem which Tsvetaeva describes as liricheskaia satira, The Rat-Catcher, is loosely based on {{the legend of the}} Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Rat-Catcher, which is also known as The Pied Piper, is considered by some to be the finest of Tsvetaeva's work. It was also partially an act of homage to Heinrich Heine's poem Die Wanderratten. The Rat-Catcher appeared initially, in serial format, in the émigré journal Volia Rossii in 1925-1926 whilst still being written. It was not to appear in the Soviet Union until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1956. Its hero is the Pied Piper of Hamelin who saves a town from hordes of rats and then leads the town's children away too, in retribution for the citizens' ingratitude. As in the other folkloric narratives, The Ratcatcher's story line emerges indirectly through numerous speaking voices which shift from invective, to extended lyrical flights, to pathos.|$|E
