5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> <b>the</b> surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant {{that much of the}} preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May.

5|$|The {{design of}} the keep has {{attracted}} much historical interest. Traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that the castle was a transitional military design, combining both the circular features of later castles with the square angled buttresses of earlier Norman fortifications. More recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation. The {{design of the}} Orford keep is hard to justify in military terms, as the buttresses created additional blind spots for the defenders, whilst the chambers and staircase in the corners weakened the walls against attack. Square Norman keeps continued to be built after Orford, whilst Henry II was aware of fully circular castle designs before building the keep. A round keep was constructed at New Buckenham, Norfolk, in 1146, for example. Historians have therefore questioned to <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> <b>the</b> design {{can be seen as}} legitimately transitional. Instead, historians now believe that the design of Orford Castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism. Heslop argues that the plain, simple elegance of the architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur, who was then widely believed to have had Roman or Greek links. The banded, angular features of the keep resembled the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power, and the keep as a whole, including the roof, may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in Constantinople by John II Komnenos.|$|E

To <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> do <b>the</b> reading questions in “Headlight” refer to comprehension level? (3).

To <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> do <b>the</b> reading questions in “Headlight” refer to synthesis level? (6). To <b>what</b> <b>extent</b> do <b>the</b> reading questions in “Headlight” refer to evaluation level? To get the answers of the research problem, the writer follows this procedure: (1). She interpreted the questions in order to find the level of the questions based on Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive domain. (2). She made a table that shows the number of question and percentage of each level of cognitive domain in every passage. (3). She used the formula to find the proportion of each level of cognitive domain in every passage. (4). She numbered all questions from 18 passages which belong to each level of cognitive domain (5). She used the formula to find out the proportion of each level of cognitive domain from the 18 passages. (6). She made a pie chart that shows the proportion of each level of cognitive domain from the whole passages. In this study, it is found that: (1). There were 222 questions in the knowledge level which is equivalent to 37. 25...|$|R
