5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, {{he could not have}} prevented the launch of the American attack.|$|E
5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground}} before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the market at that time.|$|E
5|$|This caused Blamey to {{despatch}} {{a medical}} mission headed by Fairley to the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1942 {{to present the}} Army's case for a more adequate and equitable share of anti-malarial supplies. The mission was successful. Fairley was able to secure supplies and expedite the delivery of those that <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> order but held up for lack of shipping or priority. In bringing the problem {{to the attention of}} the highest allied military and civil authorities overseas, he lifted the global profile and priority of malaria control measures.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} about 30 people and was the first game at Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine, although team veterans preferred to have used 2D graphics instead. At first, director Hifumi Kono was not interested in working on a sequel to the first Clock Tower, but after seeing the technical possibilities with newly released hardware of the time, he agreed. For Kono, {{one of the most difficult}} parts of developing Clock Tower was choosing the platform. At the time, the PlayStation and Sega Saturn <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the market. The Saturn was seen as an icon of next-generation gaming with games like Virtua Fighter (1994). The PlayStation was new to the industry, and despite having a preliminary lead in popularity over the Saturn, its future was uncertain. Meanwhile, the Nintendo 64 was scheduled to arrive on the market soon, coming off the success of the Super Nintendo. Kono eventually settled on the PlayStation, and in retrospect considers it the best choice he could have made since the console's future success helped Clock Tower sell better than expected.|$|E
5|$|Rugby {{union was}} not {{played at the}} 1904 games in St. Louis, nor at the 1906 Intercalated Games, but was {{included}} in 1908, when the Olympics were held in the sport's native country. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) {{was involved in the}} organization of the sport at this edition of the Olympics. Like the 1900 games, three teams entered: Australasia (representing Australia and New Zealand), France, and hosts Great Britain (which included the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). France pulled out prior to the commencement of the tournament, being unable to field a representative team. Australasia was represented by the Wallabies, who <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> tour in Britain. As the best English and Welsh players were on tour in New Zealand at the time, Great Britain was represented by the Cornwall county team, who were chosen by the RFU as an appropriate side after they defeated Durham in the 1907 English county championship. The choice of Cornwall was controversial, as only three of their players had ever represented England and the Wallabies had defeated them 18 points to five.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} Orient Express {{came from}} two sources: Fleming had {{returned}} from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed. He also knew {{of the story of}} Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in Live and Let Die, Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E

5|$|Trained {{research}} teams <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground on}} Java responding to the May earthquake and began a {{survey of more than}} one hundred Muslim farmers, plantation laborers, and fishermen (or those with fishing-related occupations) that were affected by the tsunami. Almost two thirds of the group reported that they lived in permanent structures made of wood, brick, or cement, while the remainder lived in semi-permanent facilities made from earth or stone. The government was cited as the first responder for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that the government should be responsible for relief. Most of those requiring aid stated that they were given effective assistance within 48 hours and that they were satisfied with the help.|$|E
5|$|Gold was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall's British XXX Corps, with the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division–commanded by Major General Douglas Graham–allotted as the assault division. The 50th was a highly-experienced division that had already seen combat in France, North Africa, and Sicily. The men underwent extensive training in amphibious landings, including Exercise Fabius, a major training exercise at Hayling Island in May 1944. Demolition teams responsible for disabling underwater beach obstacles trained in swimming pools in the United Kingdom. Briefings were undertaken using detailed maps that used fictitious place names, {{and most of the}} men did not find out their destination until they <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> their way to Normandy. The amphibious landing was to be preceded by extensive air bombardment as well as naval bombardment by Bombarding Force K, a task force of eighteen ships, primarily cruisers and destroyers. Amphibious tanks of the 8th Armoured Brigade were to arrive at 07:20, followed by infantry at 07:25. The 231st Infantry Brigade {{was assigned}} to land at Jig, and the 69th Infantry Brigade at King. The 231st was to head west to capture Arromanches and establish contact with the American forces at Omaha, while the 69th was to move east and link up with the Canadian forces at Juno. The 47th Royal Marine Commando {{was assigned to}} land at Gold, infiltrate inland, and capture the small port at Port-en-Bessin from the landward side.|$|E
