5|$|On June 13, 1781, Nicola and the Invalid Corps {{was given}} the order by Congress to move to West Point, New York. This, however, was {{difficult}} to accomplish. On June 26, Nicola {{wrote a letter to}} George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them. Another reason hindering the move was pay; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months. A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War that six months pay would be given to the Invalid Corps. After their leave to Pennsylvania, John David Woelper, a captain of the Invalid Corps, sent a letter to Washington on July 20, 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly. In the note, Woelper requested Nicola's arrest. Nicola sent letters about the situation to <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> wanted to have it settled as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point. <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> did not show any favoritism to either, sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter.|$|E

5|$|Britain {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781. In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.|$|E

Soldiers tore up land, dug trenches, and used gardens for latrines. Roach's mansion on Prospect Hill was vandalized by Union forces during the construction of Fort Runyon, but survived the war and was demolished in 1965. Other land for Fort Runyon and Fort Jackson came from the demolition of Jackson City, a collection of gambling establishments, saloons, and a racetrack that were located {{at the southern end}} of the Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{ultrasonography}} {{in medicine}} soon followed in different {{locations around the}} world. In the mid-1950s more research was undertaken by Professor Ian Donald et al., in Glasgow, which advanced the practical technology and applications of ultrasound. In 1963, in France, Léandre Pourcelot started on his thesis, which was presented in 1964, and used pulsed Doppler for blood flow calculation as its subject. This was followed up by Peronneau in 1969. Dr. Gene Strandness and the bio-engineering group at the University of <b>Washington</b> <b>who</b> conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease, published their first work in 1967. The first report published about the venous system appeared around 1967–1968.|$|E

Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29. They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals. During the offseason, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of {{the first game of the}} 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand. Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds, entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face. Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries which prematurely ended his playing career. <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers. The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle. During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Despite Arnold's successes, he {{was passed}} over for {{promotion}} by the Continental Congress, while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments. Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts and concluded that he was indebted to Congress (he also {{had spent much of}} his own money on the war effort). Arnold was frustrated and bitter at this, {{as well as with the}} alliance with France and the failure of Congress to accept Britain's 1778 proposal to grant full self-governance in the colonies. He decided to change sides, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he was awarded command of West Point. His scheme was to surrender the fort to the British, but it was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers which revealed the plot. Upon learning of André's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> had been alerted to the plot.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the Bourbon Restoration, Lafayette lent his support to a number of conspiracies in France and other European countries, all of which came to nothing. He was {{involved}} in the various Charbonnier plots, and agreed to go to the city of Belfort, where there was a garrison of French troops, and assume a major role in the revolutionary government. Warned that the royal government had found out about the conspiracy, he turned back on the road to Belfort, avoiding overt involvement. More successfully, he supported the Greek Revolution beginning in 1821, and by letter attempted to persuade American officials to ally with the Greeks. Louis' government considered arresting both Lafayette and Georges <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> was also involved in the Greek efforts, but were wary of the political ramifications if they did. Lafayette remained a member of the restored Chamber of Deputies until 1823, when new plural voting rules helped defeat his bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their own state. The individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the presidential election of 1789, finishing in second place behind George <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became the its first vice president.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette, when captured, {{had tried}} to use the American {{citizenship}} he had been granted to secure his release, and contacted William Short, United States minister in The Hague. Although Short and other U.S. envoys very much wanted to succor Lafayette for his services to their country, they knew that {{his status as a}} French officer took precedence over any claim to American citizenship. <b>Washington,</b> <b>who</b> was by then president, had instructed the envoys to avoid actions that entangled the country in European affairs, and the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with either Prussia or Austria. They did send money for the use of Lafayette, and for his wife, whom the French had imprisoned. Secretary of State Jefferson found a loophole allowing Lafayette to be paid, with interest, for his services as a major general from 1777 to 1783. An act was rushed through Congress and signed by President Washington. These funds allowed both Lafayettes privileges in their captivity.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing to}} the New England Patriots in the American Football Conference Championship Game and losing Marcus <b>Washington</b> <b>who</b> joined the Washington Redskins, the Colts shuffled their linebacker lineup and June was listed as a starter when the Colts arrived at mini-camp. At the 2004 Colts {{training}} camp, June competed with Keyon Whiteside for the starting weakside linebacker position. By the end of training camp, June was the starter, and 2004 rookie Gilbert Gardner was the backup. June made his debut as a starter in the opening game against the 2004 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. That season, the Colts used a 4-3 defense with a fourth linebacker on passing downs. In week 5, June had a team-high ten tackles and his first interception in a 3514 victory over the Oakland Raiders. In week 15, June returned an interception 71yards to the four-yard-line where {{he stepped out of}} bounds with 59seconds remaining in the game at the RCA Dome, the Colts' home stadium. This prompted the fans to chant for Peyton Manning to enter the game to attempt to tie Dan Marino's single-season touchdown pass record. Since the Colts led the game 2010 and had clinched the AFC South division, Manning took a knee instead. Coach Dungy's scheme is designed so that the weakside linebacker is supposed to make the most tackles, and June was the Colts' leading tackler by a wide margin that season. June started every game that season.|$|E
