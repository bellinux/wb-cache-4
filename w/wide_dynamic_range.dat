2500|$|C fibers synapse to second-order {{projection}} neurons in {{the spinal}} cord at the upper laminae of the dorsal horn in the substantia gelatinosa. The second-order projection neurons are of the <b>wide</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> (WDR) type, which receive input from both nociceptive terminals as well as myelinated A-type fibers. There are three types of second order projection neurons in the spinothalamic tract: <b>wide</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> (WDR), high threshold (HT), and low threshold (LT). These classifications are based on their responses to mechanical stimuli. [...] The second-order neurons ascend to the brain stem and thalamus in the ventrolateral, or anterolateral, quadrant of the contralateral half of {{the spinal cord}}, forming the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract is the main pathway associated with pain and temperature perception, which immediately crosses the spinal cord laterally. This crossover feature is clinically important because it allows for identification of the location of injury.|$|E
2500|$|Yamaguchi {{attempted}} {{to keep working}} on the song after submitting it for the commercial, but suffered from writer's block, and instead worked on the songs [...] "Eureka" [...] and [...] "Good-Bye". The song was revisited when the band was contacted to write a song for the film Close Range Love (2014), called [...] "Hasu no Hana". The band discussed releasing [...] "Hasu no Hana" [...] and [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] as a single with their management at Victor Entertainment, who agreed to the idea. The song was entirely rearranged and re-recorded for its 2014 release, based around only the initial version's chorus, with the original verses removed in favor of new ones. Instead of the synth sounds present in the band's other music and the commercial version of the song, Yamaguchi wanted [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] to have a live rock band sound. Yamaguchi felt that by recording the song in this manner, it had lost its summer music festival-like vibe. During the recording process, Yamaguchi incorporated a <b>wide</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> having felt influenced by listening to jazz and neo soul musicians Robert Glasper and Taylor McFerrin.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} an ultrasonic image enhancement method using a logarithmic amplifier. At the present time, ultrasonic imaging instruments equipped with linear amplifiers are popular {{for use in the}} industrial market. Such instruments can display the target echo with a good signal to noise ratio because their <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> on a screen is around 26 dB. On the other hand, ultrasonic imaging instruments equipped with logarithmic amplifiers can display signals with a <b>wider</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> (e. g. 80 dB) on a screen. The <b>wider</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of a logarithmic amplifier allows the imaging instrument to collect broader information than a liner amplifier. Suitable information for flaw analysis can be extracted from the collected data by combining the signal gain level filtering and sectional image display of the data. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic image enhancement using a logarithmic amplifier is experimentally verified through the examination of intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) in the weld joint of austenitic stainless steel piping. With this method, the IGSCC echo and geometry echoes from the inner surface, weld root, and base metal to weld interface are successfully displayed as an extracted sectional image...|$|R
