5000|$|There {{are several}} things {{to look at}} when buying a pair of {{lacrosse}} gloves. The size of the glove {{is an important factor}} to consider, as well as protective features, what material it is made out of, ventilation, and dexterity. Many gloves now offer a wrist cuff which can be adjusted by various means to fit securely to your wrist and provide you with maximum comfort and protection. Lacrosse is a high paced game. Running up and down the field can be an intense work out, and having gloves that are well ventilated, allowing air to circulate in and around your fingers is crucial. All gloves take a little while to break in, though some take longer than others. The materials gloves are made out of differ. A glove with a mesh palm may be easier to play with, and provide great feel as well as ventilation. When buying lacrosse gloves you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> protection, ventilation, weight and flexibility.|$|E
50|$|The {{indicators}} {{that have been}} identified are allocated percentages and in a detailed cost breakdown analysis these indicators should add up closely to 100%. This process requires an in-depth analysis of the business's expenses.For simplicity's sake, these random percentages have been assigned to the six cost drivers of transportation this example entails. After this step, the cost drivers are being analyzed while the analyzing party (be it the business itself or an external agency) tries to examine possibilities to cut current expenses. The business might find 42% of total costs {{to be too much}} for motor fuel and might either <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> an alternative supplier or change to more fuel efficient trucks. The cost breakdown analysis is even more effective when repeated constantly, so that changes in the respective shares in total costs of the various cost drivers can be tracked down. Over a five-year period, the share of expenses for tires might have risen from 5% to 8%, accompanied by a decrease of expenses for personnel from 35% to 32%, which featured the dismissal of workforce. The business might want to consider contracting a cheaper supplier of tires and reemploy its former employees.|$|E
