5|$|Although Carnivàle {{is set in}} the mid-1930s, Ben and Brother Justin have {{visions and}} dreams {{suggesting}} the story began much earlier. Samson summarizes the backstory in a monologue at the beginning of season 2, without mentioning names.

5|$|In mid-May 1695 García again marched southwards from Campeche, with 115 Spanish {{soldiers}} and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers. The expedition {{was joined by}} two companies of Maya musketeers. García ordered {{the construction of a}} fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65miles or 105km) north of Lake Petén Itzá, <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> the main military base for the Camino Real ("Royal Road") project.|$|E

5|$|Old Pine Church {{reportedly}} {{housed a}} school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship. A small one-room addition to the church was constructed to the north façade of the building, <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> the boarding room for the school's teacher.

Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Quran and the biography of the Muhammad (sira) and states that the Quran fully reflects various stages between the Quran and the career of Muhammad. He also emphasizes that both the angels and the jinn are spoken in the Quran not for their own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{is one of}} the world's oldest {{prepared}} beverages, possibly {{dating back}} to the early Neolithic or 9500 BC , when cereal was first farmed, and is recorded in the written history of ancient Iraq and ancient Egypt. Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations. Approximately 5000 years ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer. During the building of the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer, <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and an 160 Mbyte flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (Dead or Alive 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{most of the}} {{differences}} between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> the basis of the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, was seen as the Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.|$|E
5|$|By May, the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258, on {{the front}} lines between the 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. They {{conducted}} frequent patrols along an outpost network, often encountering and engaging Chinese troops. They fortified the hill and surrounding areas, <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> an advance outpost to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations. Allen, Pryor, and Freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men, leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted men on the hill.|$|E

5|$|Cheadle Hulme {{is served}} by a fire station on Turves Road which opened in October 1960. Before this the area made use of a service in Cheadle. An {{ambulance}} station is near the fire station, and the closest public hospital is Stepping Hill Hospital in Hazel Grove. Until the early 2000s the area had a police station <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> the headquarters for the west Stockport area. The building, which opened in 1912, was sold in 2006 and converted into flats.|$|E
5|$|Dekum {{involved}} {{himself in}} many building projects in downtown Portland. One of his structures, the Dekum Building, <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> {{headquarters for the}} city's government in the 1890s, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Portland and Vancouver Railway, financed partly by Dekum, ran along {{the east side of}} the Willamette River from East Portland to the Columbia River. Dekum Street in northeast Portland is named after him.|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large or small script survive to this day.

Only a single manuscript text in the Khitan large script is known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, <b>which</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> the core guide to the administration of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E
