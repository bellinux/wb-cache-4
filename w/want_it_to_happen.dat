500|$|Fearing that {{introducing}} the character as an [...] " [...] to the boys" [...] would hinder {{their chances of}} successfully integrating her into the series, the writers intended that Ruby should be [...] "a character in [...] own right" [...] and deemed her an antagonist [...] "with [...] own interests and [...] own motives" [...] rather than a love interest to Sam or Dean, which they felt had been their mistake in their introduction of the widely disliked Jo Harvelle in the second season. While they were not planning on a romance between Ruby and either of the Winchesters in the third season, however, they were open to the possibility in the future, with Kripke saying, [...] "If the chemistry is there, {{and we see the}} sparks, and we <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> and the fans <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> it'll happen." [...] Due to [...] "protective and occasionally nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant to introduce Ruby in [...] "small doses". Wanting fans to know the show would always be about Sam and Dean, and nothing else, he stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor is it about the four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine relationship, {{sometimes}} referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Klaine" [...] by Glee fans and the media, developed slowly. As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> It's funny how many people want to see these boys hook up. We'll see." [...] Based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy decided to have Blaine become Kurt's love interest. Criss noted: [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the [...] "initial dynamic changes because [...] has to learn to trust him again". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels [...] "unloved", [...] "isolated" [...] and [...] "like she's lost her best friend". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson {{felt it was important}} to resolve any mistrust between the pair {{by the end of the}} Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> but at the same time you don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate when that happens [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would [...] "confirm to the world" [...] that he was going to [...] "say it back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Romance novelist Jaid Black (pseudonym for Tina Engler) {{said that}} [...] "many of my female readers enjoy rape fantasies, key word being fantasies. They {{certainly}} wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in real life, but enjoy the escapism and {{total lack of}} control provided by 'forced seduction' scenes in erotic romance novels". According to one reader of romance, women readers are quite capable of separating fantasy from reality: [...] "In real life {{there is no such}} thing as forced seduction. When a woman says no in real life, that means no, because in real life, rape is about violence and power. Rape in real life involves no pleasure for the woman". Alison Kent, author of the Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Erotic Romance, says the theme is rare in modern romance novels; Linda Lee also cites scholarship to conclude that [...] "by the mid-1980s, the rape fantasy was rejected". However, forced seduction has been used as a plot point in post-1980s romance novels.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for SpoilerTV, Gavin Hetherington {{praised the}} whole episode, commenting: [...] "One {{of the better}} episodes in 7A, {{with a handful of}} scenes that really stood out. The death was great, because I really <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> for like the longest time, and some of the {{characters}} had better material than the last episode (looking at you Spencer)." [...] Jessica Goldstein of Vulture gave the episode three out of 5 stars.|$|R
5000|$|According to John Allen, Jr., Mother Teresa's {{process was}} quick not [...] "simply because her postulator {{did a good}} job. It was clear that John Paul II <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Similarly with Escriva, the pope's long track record of support and devotion...left no doubt where he wanted the process to end. That, in fact, is {{probably}} the single most telling argument against the hypothesis that Opus Dei 'bought' or 'manipulated' the beatification and canonization. There was no reason why they had to." ...|$|R

The negative still resided in a vault in Paris, unseen since the 1970s, but the permission from all the estates needed to be obtained before access to the negative could be granted. Bogdanovich commented, “It’s going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in the next month or so. We’re aiming for Cannes (in 2010).

Sexual abuse happens because the system of silence around the act perpetuates it.

Muhammed always <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> but things were a complete mess. He had signed a really bad contract and his label had gone out of business and the rights to that album were sold to another company.

Charlie's jealousy, anger and fear of feeling like he is underused in regards to helping Claire develops well into the scene where he kills Ethan. Carabott also stated Ethan's death was to be expected, but didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> IGN ranked Ethan's death as number three in the Top 10 'Lost' deaths, stating that his death was the most frustrating on Lost because Ethan could have provided many answers to the island's mysteries.|$|E

Smart cities can also offer their data to civic hackers, who may create useful applications for city dwellers. Humor is an important aspect of our daily activities and experiences. In this chapter, we explore how humor can become part of smart and playable cities. We do this by investigating the role of humor in game environments. In games, we have accidental humor, for example because of bugs, and we have humor that occurs because a gamer <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> This latter type of humor can be produced by looking for bugs, by not following the rules of the game, or by intentionally creating situations that lead to humorous events in the game. This may certainly include humor at the expense of others.
