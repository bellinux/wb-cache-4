Between May 2004 and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively.

25|$|The counterattack failed, as two battalions in {{the centre}} found the German {{shelling}} {{too heavy for}} them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for “funk”, after hearing the view {{of one of the}} actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and “in complete ignorance of the situation”. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly “the most efficient in the army” “had much decreased in military value” and Wilson “had failed as a commander in the field”. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were “downhearted” and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been “pulling Charteris’ leg” as he talked of “sweeping victories” within two months. Wilson was almost “degummed” (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many “unsuccessful” corps commanders, largely in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong time, and that Haig’s animosity for Wilson was a factor.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught us anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera seems to take a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E

30|$|Another {{interesting}} aspect in the Mahabharata is {{that without}} the Kurawa, the Pandawa {{would not be able}} to exist in this world. The tension and dynamism throughout the Mahabharata is based on the conflict between the Pandawa and the Kurawa. Both sides are needed to guarantee the stability and harmony of the entire cosmos. So unlike in the Ramayana, where one side is annihilated for the other side to be happy, the annihilation of the Kurawa and the creation of a peaceful world without the Kurawa cannot possibly be an appropriate correct goal. Precisely because of this, the stories of the Baratayuda war are full of tragedy and are regarded as potentially dangerous and explosive for society if they are performed in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time. 12 This is true not only for the deaths of figures on the Pandawa side, such as Abimanyu and Gatotkaca, but just as true for the characters from the Kurawa side such as Karna and Suyudana. In fact, when the war is over, Yudistira, the oldest of the Pandawa brothers, is not happy but instead feels sad. Although in the end Astina 13 has been won, much of the country has been destroyed. Furthermore, although the Baratayuda war has ended, Aswatama still succeeds in killing all the descendants of the Pandawa with the exception of Parikesit, and in so doing has snatched victory from the hands of the Pandawa.|$|R

60|$|Before commencing the {{narrative}} of the adventures which he met with, {{it is necessary to}} premise that no person can travel among the different states and kingdoms on the continent of Europe without what is called a passport. The idea which prevails among all the governments of the continent is, that the people of each country are the subjects of the sovereign reigning there, and in some sense belong to him. They cannot leave their country without the written permission of the government, nor can they enter any other one without showing this permission and having it approved and stamped by the proper officers of the country to which they wish to go. There are, for example, at Paris ministers of all the different governments of Europe, residing {{in different parts of the}} city; and whoever wishes to leave France, to go into any other kingdom, must first go with his passport to the ministers of the countries which he intends to visit and get them to put their stamp upon it. This stamp represents the permission of the government whose minister affixes it that the traveller may enter the territory under their jurisdiction. Besides this, it is necessary to get permission from the authorities of Paris to leave the city. Nobody can leave France without this. This permission, too, like the others, is given by a stamp upon the passport. To get this stamp, the traveller must carry or send his passport to the great central police office of Paris, called the prefecture of police. Now, as the legations of the different governments and the prefecture of police are situated at very considerable distances from each other about the city, and as it usually takes some time to transact <b>the</b> business <b>at</b> each office, and especially as the inexperienced traveller often makes mistakes and goes to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place,</b> or gets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> right <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> hour, it usually requires a whole day, and sometimes two days, to get his passport all right so as to allow of his setting out upon his journey. These explanations are necessary to enable the reader to understand what I now proceed to relate in respect to Rollo.|$|R
6000|$|I {{hoped that}} if I made {{believe to be}} asleep she would get discouraged. So I closed the window ostentatiously, {{and went back to}} bed. But it only had the effect of putting her on her mettle. [...] "He did not care for that last," [...] I {{imagined}} her saying to herself, [...] "I wasn't at my best. There wasn't feeling enough in it." [...] She kept it up for about half an hour, and then the gate against which, I suppose, she had been leaning, gave way with a crash. That frightened her, and I heard her gallop off across the field. I was on the point of dozing off again when a pair of pigeons settled on the window-sill and began to coo. It is a pretty sound when you are in the mood for it. I wrote a poem once--a simple thing, but instinct with longing--while sitting under a tree and listening to the cooing of a pigeon. But that was in the afternoon. My only longing now was for a gun. Three times I {{got out of bed and}} [...] "shoo'd" [...] them away. The third time I remained by the window till I had got it firmly into their heads that I really did not want them. My behaviour on the former two occasions they had evidently judged to be mere playfulness. I had just got back to bed again when an owl began to screech. That is another sound I used to think attractive--so weird, so mysterious. It is Swinburne, I think, who says that you never get the desired one and the time and the place all right together. If the beloved one is with you, it is <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time; and if the time and the place happen to be right, then it is the party that is wrong. The owl was all right: I like owls. The place was all right. He had struck the wrong time, that was all. Eleven o'clock at night, when you can't see him, and naturally feel that you want to, is the proper time for an owl. Perched on the roof of a cow-shed in the early dawn he looks silly. He clung there, flapping his wings and screeching <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of his voice. What it was he wanted I am sure I don't know; and anyhow it didn't seem the way to get it. He came to this conclusion himself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of twenty minutes, and shut himself up and went home. I thought I was going to have at last some peace, when a corncrake--a creature upon whom Nature has bestowed a song like to the tearing of calico-sheets mingled with the sharpening of saws--settled somewhere in the garden and set to work to praise its Maker according to its lights. I have a friend, a poet, who lives just off the Strand, and spends his evenings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Garrick Club. He writes occasional verse for the evening papers, and talks about the [...] "silent country, drowsy with the weight of languors." [...] One of these times I'll lure him down for a Saturday to Monday and let him find out what the country really is--let him hear it. He is becoming too much of a dreamer: it will do him good, wake him up a bit. The corncrake after awhile stopped quite suddenly with a jerk, and for quite five minutes there was silence.|$|R

40|$|First of all, {{we would}} like to thank {{everyone}} who contributed to the fourth issue of 2010 of “Düşünen Adam” Journal of Psychiatry and Neurological Sciences. This preface is the second one I wrote for this issue. This is due to an important incident which put the issue I would like to emphasize into agenda just after the first preface I have written. First, I would like to revise the recent review articles about this. It has already been reported that schizophrenia and other psychoses are related with violence mainly like homicide and the main reason for this relationship is the comorbid substance abuse. Moreover, in these patients with comorbidity, risk of violent action is the same as non-psychotic substance abusers. Actually, these findings show that prevention programs focused on substance abuse can be effective to reduce violent acts in these cases (1). Another meta-analysis showed that 38. 5 % of homicides occur <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first psychotic episode and just before treatment started. Because homicide risk in this period is 15. 5 times higher than post-treatment period, it was proposed that early treatment of the first episode can prevent some of the homicide attempts (2). Last of all, after evaluating the 39 cases whom were psychotic <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of homicide, 10. 2 % of the actions were found to be due to mistakes of the therapist or legal authorities and 15. 4 % could be prevented by the communication of the therapist and patients’ relatives. In this study, it was concluded that all of the family members should get involved in the treatment of patient and threats of psychotic patients should be taken as serious (3). “Violence towards physician” has always been a fact but also far away from me. This did not change when this topic was turned to “violence towards psychiatrist” until it happened to people whom I know closer and loved to. I have always expected the threat from patients’ relatives rather than from them who try to hospitalize them by force. Haven’t I ever faced with danger? Yes, I did but I related my being rescued by perceiving this as a part of the disease and my growing anger causing increased tension. I think this the main reason why I have always expected danger from patients’ relatives or people I encountered in the street. After assaulted by a schizophrenic patient, my wife who is also a psychiatrist had cervical disc hernia and had to wear collar for several days. Many incidents happened in the meantime. During the last year, one of our specialist friends was taken hostage and one of our residents had to be operated after the assault of a patient and these incidents thought me “Nothing important happened in any case”. When I got the news from psychiatry mail-group that our dear Hüseyin (Soysal) who served our hospital for many years was assaulted, I also learned that his condition was well. Hüseyin also sent an e-mail to the same mail group on December 9, 2010 thinking he recovered (physically) and said; “Physicians (health professionals) and priests (religious functionary) have both an important defect. They think themselves without enemies and even untouchable. This assumption has a robust basis; they help people who need help with and without a return and ask themselves if there is anything missing with a sense of responsibility and even guilt after their service. Being such generous and such important creates a surrealistic and even an unrealistic imaginary world in the wide area between divinity and playing the divine. Patients, consultants and admirers abstract physicians and priests from their bodies. They are nearly divine beings. On the contrary, these poor guys are the targets of psychopaths and people looking for revenge of outer world. They are stabbed by inhuman creatures which they are ready to hug [...] . Physicians and priests are innocent, oppressed and –unlike generally believed- unprotected. I am greatly disappointed being realized how unprotected I am and turned my back to a man whom I tried to prevent his mother not to be harmed by him. ” Hüseyin spent several years in forensic psychiatry ward and as emergency department director just before retirement which was highly probable to have aggressive patients and he was one of the few specialists I took as a role model. When I saw him with stab wound on his chest during my visit to the hospital, I could only say “If this happened to him, then everyone of us can experience the same”. Hüseyin finished his e-mail by saying “I owe you all, many thanks”. If only what was done for the physical wound could have been done for his “disappointment”. We owe him essentially because he had to show us the only truth which we do not want to accept by putting his life on. However, we also do not know how to cope with this condition. Before this terrible incident, Hüseyin accepted to review a paper submitted to this journal. When I realized that the system sent an automatic e-mail to him due to overdue of the review period I just could not know what to do. What actually surprised me was his e-mail with the correction recommendations sent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same day. After that I said to myself “Why am I surprised? This was the responsible scientific attitude I took from Hüseyin”. Whether a coincidence or not, a review article about “schizophrenia and violence” was sent to our journal for review after a few weeks. I am sure that physicians who wrote this article do not guess how close a stab can be to their hearts. I think we should accept that risk can be reduced but cannot be completely eliminated. I say this because I want Hüseyin who bemoan for turning himself back to his patient to know that he was just <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time. I wish not to be disappointed while practicing our job or not seeing our respected colleagues disappointed… Assoc. Prof. Cüneyt Evren, M. D. Editor-in-Chie...|$|R

2500|$|The {{television}} series {{differs from the}} film versions in one fundamental aspect: Nikita (Peta Wilson) is innocent. She is not a killer, nor a drug user, just a homeless young woman in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong time. Section One —an elite, top-secret counter-terrorism organization— sets Nikita up {{to be accused of}} murdering a police officer and {{sentenced to life in prison}} where she supposedly commits suicide and is brought into Section One. Because Nikita will be killed (or [...] "cancelled") if she fails to comply, she is forced to carry out the organization's ruthless methods of fighting terrorism, while attempting to keep her moral integrity intact. This personal struggle becomes the primary conflict of the series. A key scene in the two theatrical films involves Nikita's first assignment —to murder a VIP in a crowded restaurant. Although the Nikita of the {{television series}} eventually does become, by necessity, a ruthless killer, in the television version of this first mission she uses her ingenuity to avoid having to kill the VIP (whereas the film versions of the character complete the assignment). However, despite the machinations of others in power around her, Nikita retains her compassion and humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure here was to discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I am grateful for the tidal wave that came down on me.

2500|$|The {{longevity}} {{of the war}} has engendered a strong isolationism in the Ishgardian government which filters down into the attitude of her people. Ishgard withdrew from the first Eorzean Alliance and declined {{to participate in the}} second, being preoccupied with their own war effort. This isolationism also manifests itself in a fanatic persecution of [...] "heretics", i.e., anyone accused of consorting or sympathizing with dragons. In the lead-up to the events of the expansion, Nidhogg, who had been dormant for some time, bellows a great roar to rally the dragon horde to renew their assault on Ishgard. The player's character—an adventurer hailed as a Warrior of Light for fending off the Garlean invasion—comes into the good graces of Ser Aymeric, Lord Commander of the Temple Knights, for the defense of Ishgard during one such attack. When the player is caught at the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong time during a coup attempt in Ul'dah, the hero flees to Ishgard for asylum from the charge of regicide with Alphinaud and Tataru, the only remnants of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn to escape the fiasco. Nidhogg's roar prompts a change in both sides of the conflict—Aymeric and Count Edmont of House Fortemps open Ishgard's gates to outsiders {{for the first time in}} years on the pretext of aiding the war effort. Meanwhile, Lady Iceheart grows her band of heretics and Estinien, the current Azure Dragoon, comes out of hiding in search of his archenemy, Nidhogg.|$|E

40|$|Demand {{for food}} {{is likely to}} double within the next fifty years but to double yield will require {{doubling}} fertilizer availability and, {{in the case of}} nitrogen, unless biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) can be improved, a tripling of mineral fertilizer will be required. To triple present day production would require burning of 500 million tonnes of coal, or its equivalent, annually. Technically this should be possible but environmental and political pressures are working in the opposite direction. Even if the inevitable increases in CO 2 emissions were accepted, application of such large amounts of nitrogen would undoubtely result in increasing leaching into groundwater. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), the process by which soil bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen, {{has been the subject of}} research for the past 100 years. The big-chemical processes are well understood and nuclear technology using the 15 N isotope means that researchers have an accurate method for quantifying BNF. There is a strong and continuing commitment by the scientific community to the basic research but what are the options currently available to farmers in the developing world for enhancing BNF within their own farming systems? There are four principal means by which biological nitrogen fixation can benefit agriculture: symbiotic nitrogen fixation by the crop itself; symbiotic nitrogen fixation by the Azolla/Anahaena azollae complex, which is used as a green manure; non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation at crop level by, for example, blue-green algae, azospirillum and other rhizospheric bacteria, and the use of nitrogen fixing trees or shrubs to improve the nitrogen content of the soil. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by leguminous crops has been the subject of much research. It has long been known that different legumes have different nitrogen fixing capacity and furthermore, that within each species, cultivars differ in efficiency. BNF can be greatly increased by matching the compatibility of the host plant and the strain of companion rhizobial bacteria. Where the crop legume is a new introduction to the farming system, as is often the case with soybean, naturally occurring rhizobia compatible with the new host are unlikely to be available in the soil and inoculation, either of the seed or the soil, is needed. Trials under field conditions are essential since work by, among others, Dr Gudni Hardarson at FAD-IAEA Joint Division laboratories at Siebersdorf, Austria has shown that failure of legumes to achieve economically attractive yields is often the result of inhospitable environmental conditions. Rhizobia efficiency and efficacy The ability of rhizobia to survive in the soil depends, among other factors, on soil texture, organic matter content and pH value. Improving land management for legumes should lead to tangible results, some of which will be due to increased nitrogen fixation. Even the best legume will not perform well when it is cultivated in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time. Inoculation has been shown to improve yields of soybean, for example, by 50 % or more. But, says Dr Michael Obaton of INRA (currently with ICARDA), work is still required to make the inoculant easier for farmers to use and to improve its keeping quality, especially in temperatures above 30 ° C. Furthermore, inoculation stimulates nodule growth <b>at</b> <b>the</b> root crown only. Subsequent nodulation on lateral and deeper roots is from indigenous bacteria already within the soil. While there is plenty of evidence of the successful application of inoculation technology <b>at</b> <b>the</b> resource-rich, large farm level where innovation carries little risk, the use of inoculum at small farm level is minimal according to Dr David Hubbell of the University of Florida. This is despite the fact that technology has been available commercially, in appropriate form for small farm application, for eighty years. It is the transfer of information to farmers that has become stuck in the neck of the research bottle. Scientists have been filling this bottle with research results for years but policy makers and those responsible for setting agricultural priorities have a firm hold on the cork and the corkscrew. Azolla and tree legumes Azolla, with its symbiotic partner the N 2 fixing blue green-alga Anabaena azollae, has been used for centuries as a nitrogen fixing fertilizer in some rice growing countries. However, the realizable potential of Azolla as a green manure is restricted by, among other factors, very labour intensive management. According to Dr Pierre Roger of ORSTOM, given the choice of purchasing cheap, industrially produced, balanced fertilizer or spending three to four months cultivating Azolla, dividing it, and digging to incorporate it, most farmers would choose the factory product and it seems that more are indeed doing so. Non-symbiotic, or free living, N 2 fixing organisms include blue-green algae and rhizospheric bacteria such as azospirillum and Bacillus polymyxa. Blue-green algae, which make a significant contribution to N fixation in paddy rice culture, are limited by low pH, P deficiency and the use of mineral N fertiliser. Furthermore, non-indigenous strains rarely establish themselves. These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to cultural practices to support indigenous strains, such as liming of acidic soils, split application of P and deep placement of mineral N which avoids some of its inhibitory effect (Roger). According to Dr Thierry Heulin from CNRA, bacteria associated with the root system (the rhizospheric bacteria) of cereals and forage grasses are able to fix nitrogen and promote plant growth, but these research findings are not yet implemented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> farmer level. The impact of leguminous trees and shrubs on soil fertility has also been the subject of research for many years and the technologies for intercropping annual crops with leguminous trees have been made widely available to farmers most recently by the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Increased use of inorganic fertiliser is inescapable, but a parallel return to greater exploitation of BNF would seem to make good sense. There are three challenges to be met. The first is to make sure that the research serves the farmer rather than the researcher. The second is to convey existing and, as it becomes available, future knowledge to farmers. And thirdly farmers must be placed in a position to implement the knowledge, if they wish to do so. Demand for food is likely to double within the next fifty years but to double yield will require doubling fertilizer availability and, in the case of nitrogen, unless biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) can be improved, a tripling of mineral [...] ...|$|R
