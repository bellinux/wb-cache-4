50|$|Transcript: Q. In {{relation}} to secondary devices, you were aware, I think, during your {{time at the}} scene, in {{relation to}} secondary devices, of the attendance of a Metropolitan Police explosives unit, explosives officer. Is that right?A. That's correct. Q. I think, to use the phrase that you did in your recent statement in which you went over your actions on the day itself, you noted that the box that you considered may have contained a secondary device—which would be the microwave oven, as it transpired to be — was neutralised by the explosives officer. There was a controlled explosion at one stage carried out by explosives officers that day. Was that subsequent—put it another way, was that something that occurred or that didn't occur while you were there?A. Sorry? Q. The question is probably poorly phrased. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> of a controlled explosion?A. Yes. Q. -- or simply the attendance of explosives officers? A. I heard the controlled explosion, yes. Q. Right. I don't suppose you can provide a time for that, can you, or can you? A. After 30 minutes. That's my guess, I can't know. Q. All right. That's all I want to ask about that.|$|E
40|$|According to {{a common}} thesis about {{normative}} reasons for action, you {{have a reason to}} perform a given action only if you can act for that reason. This thesis has long had broad appeal and is intended to capture the practical character of practical reasons. I’ll call it the ‘Practicality Thesis’. Recently, however, various writers have developed subtly different objections to it, each designed to show that there can be actions you have a reason to perform even though you could not act for that reason––because, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> of the reason-giving facts in the ways needed to act for the reason, it would no longer be a reason for you to so act. This article defends the Practicality Thesis against such objections. It considers some extant defenses but shows that these are inadequate. It then advances an alternative approach designed to counter any structurally similar objection...|$|E

40|$|IMAGINE THAT A RELATIVE OR A FRIEND ASKED YOUR OPIN-ion about {{accepting}} $ 1000 {{to participate}} as a humansubject in an experimental trial {{in which he}} would berequired to consume a pesticide. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> that such experiments were permissible? What advice would you give? Breaking with a long tradition in the ethics of human ex-perimentation that distinguished therapeutic from non-therapeutic agents, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule in February 2006 on ethical guidelines for enrolling human participants in testing pes-ticides. 1 Data from such experiments are used to reduce the economic costs in the statutory obligation for companies to protect the food supply from dangerous levels of pesticide residues. The policy gives regulatory standing to experi-ments that intentionally expose adults to toxic pesticides and could set a precedent for similar experiments involv-ing other industrial chemicals. In addition, the policy open...|$|E
40|$|This study {{looks at}} how {{instructors}} perceive sexism {{and respond to}} the portrayal of gender in a textbook. A total of six instructors of an institution of higher learning were interviewed. These instructors were asked three basic questions: (1) Do you discuss gender issues in the classroom? (2) <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> of the gender stereotypes in the textbook? (3) How are you going to respond to gender stereotypes in the textbook after being aware? Findings indicate that the instructors did not intend to discuss gender in the classroom. Discussions on gender would be incidental, depending on the topic of the units covered in the textbook. In addition, the instructors did not discuss gender because they had not been aware of gender stereotypes in the textbook. However, most of them felt reluctant to discuss issues on gender even after they were made aware of gender stereotypes in the textbook. Reasons for this include time constraints in completing the syllabus, students' level of profiency and students' awareness of gender issues. The avoidance of discussions on gender issues was also due to two main reasons: one, gender issues were not part of the syllabus to be covered and two, these issues were not part of the local culture. It is suggested that the instructors should attempt to discuss gender stereotypes and the idea of equality among gender in the classroom, especially if sexism existed in the textbook, to avoid gender stereotypes being part of the hidden curriculum...|$|E
