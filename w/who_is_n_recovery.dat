Methods:This was a retrospective, single-institution review of patients with non-small cell lung cancer <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>N</b> 2 negative on CT and PET/CT. All patients underwent mediastinoscopy; if N 2 positive, patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by pulmonary resection, and if N 2 negative, patients underwent pulmonary resection with mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Results:Between 2003 and 2007, there were 750 patients (547 men). Of these, 51 patients <b>were</b> <b>N</b> 2 positive at mediastinoscopy and then underwent neoadjuvant therapy (mediastinoscopy N 2 group), and 699 <b>were</b> <b>N</b> 2 negative at mediastinoscopy and then underwent mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Mediastinal lymphadenectomy revealed that 635 had N 0 or N 1 disease (N 2 -negative group), and 64 had N 2 disease (surgery N 2 group). Overall 5 -year survival was 73 % for the N 2 -negative group, 44 % for the surgery N 2 group, and 47 % for the mediastinoscopy N 2 group. Disease-free 5 -year survival was 59 % for the N 2 -negative group, 27 % for the surgery N 2 group, and 29 % for the mediastinoscopy N 2 group. Conclusions:We found that {{there were no significant differences}} in overall and disease-free survivals between the surgery N 2 group and the mediastinoscopy N 2 group. The benefit of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with PET/CT-negative but mediastinoscopy-positive N 2 disease should be confirmed by randomized studies...|$|R

Aim: We {{examined the effects}} of anti-depressant prescribing on depressive symptoms at 12 months follow-up in patients with cardiometabolic disease and a positive depression screening result at baseline. Design and Setting: We retrospectively reviewed routine UK primary care data for patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes and previous stroke for the year 2008 - 2009. 35, 537 patients with one of the three above diseases underwent depression screening using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D). Of 7080 patients with a positive screening result (HADS-D ≥ 8), 3933 (55. 5 %) patients had a repeat HADS-D recorded at 12 months follow-up. Methods: We compared the change in HADS-D at follow-up and remission rate in those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> prescribed anti-depressants (<b>n</b> = 223) against those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not (<b>n</b> = 3710). Results: The mean change in HADS-D from baseline, for the nonprescribed group was similar to the reduction observed in patients <b>who</b> <b>were</b> continuously prescribed (<b>n</b> = 93) with anti-depressants during follow-up. Patients <b>who</b> <b>were</b> prescribed intermittently (<b>n</b> = 72) or only one (n = 58) prescription during follow-up had a lower reduction in HADS-D compared to the nonprescribed group. There was no difference in remission rates between continuously prescribed and the nonprescribed group, but remission was lower in patients prescribed intermittently and single prescription. Conclusion: Improvement in depressive symptoms in patients with cardiometabolic disease at 12 months was not any better in patients prescribed with anti-depressants compared to the nonprescribed group.

In the wheat and maize seasons, 15 N-labelled fertiliser was applied as conventional urea (CONV) and urea coated with a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP). In sorghum, the fate of 15 N-labelled urea was monitored in this crop following a legume ley pasture (L 70) or a grass ley pasture (G 100). The fertiliser N applied to sorghum in the legume-cereal rotation was reduced (70 kg N ha− 1) compared to the grass-cereal (100 kg N ha− 1) to assess {{the availability of the}} N residual from the legume ley pasture. Average crop <b>N</b> <b>recoveries</b> <b>were</b> 73 % (CONV) and 77 % (DMPP) in wheat and 50 % (CONV) and 51 % (DMPP) in maize, while in sorghum were 71 % (L 70) and 53 % (G 100). Data gathered in this study indicate that the intrinsic physical and chemical conditions of Oxisols can be extremely effective in limiting N losses via deep leaching or denitrification.

Participants: Parents and guardians of preschool children (up to age 5 years) <b>who</b> <b>were</b> (<b>n</b> = 259) and <b>were</b> not (<b>n</b> = 262) classified as {{at high risk of}} incompletely vaccinating their children. High risk of incomplete vaccination was defined as any of the following: aged less than 20 years, single parents, living in one of the 20 % most deprived areas in England, had a preschool child with a disability, or had more than three children. 		 Main Outcome Measures: Participant preferences expressed as positive (utility) or negative (disutility) on eight attributes and levels describing the organization of preschool vaccination programs. 		 Results: There was no difference in preference for parental financial incentives compared to no incentive in parents "not at high risk" of incomplete vaccination. Parents <b>who</b> <b>were</b> "at high risk" expressed utility for cash incentives. Parents "at high risk" of incomplete vaccination expressed utility for information on the risks and benefits of vaccinations to be provided as numbers rather than charts or pictures.

Conclusions: Cash incentives for preschool vaccinations in England would be welcomed by parents <b>who</b> <b>are</b> "at high risk" of incompletely vaccinating their children.

Nitrogen recovery and agronomic efficiency varied significantly (P ≤ 0. 001) among forage species.

40|$|Background: The {{generation}} of antibodies is impaired in newborns {{due to an}} immature immune system and reduced exposure to pathogens due to maternally derived antibodies and placental functions. During nursing, the immune system of newborns is challenged with multiple milk-derived proteins. Amongst them, caseins are the main constituent. In particular, human aS 1 -casein (CSN 1 S 1) was recently shown to possess immunomodulatory properties. We were thus interested to determine if auto-antibodies to CSN 1 S 1 are induced by breast-feeding and may be sustained into adulthood. Methods: 62 sera of healthy adult individuals <b>who</b> <b>were</b> (<b>n</b> = 37) or <b>were</b> not (<b>n</b> = 25) breast-fed against human CSN 1 S 1 were investigated by a new SD (surface display) -ELISA. For cross-checking, these sera were tested for anti Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies by a commercial ELISA. Results: IgG-antibodies were predominantly detected in individuals <b>who</b> had <b>been</b> nursed. At a cut-off value of 0. 4, the SDELISA identified individuals {{with a history of}} having been breast-fed with a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 92 %. Under these conditions, 35 out of 37 sera from healthy donors, who where breast-fed, reacted positively but only 5 sera of the 25 donors <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not breast-fed. The duration of breast-feeding was of no consequence to the antibody reaction as some healthy donors were only short term breast-fed (5 days minimum until 6 weeks maximum), but exhibited significant serum reaction against human CSN 1 S 1 nonetheless. Conclusion: We postulate that human CSN 1 S 1 is an autoantigen. The antigenicity is orally determined, caused by breastfeeding, and sustained into adulthood...|$|R

The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate the contribution of applied N fertilizer to N turnover in rice paddy soil with different N fertilization practices that were manipulated by the quantity of treated swine slurry and chemical N fertilizer (i. e., HTSS+LAS, a high amount of TSS with a low amount of ammonium sulfate; LTSS+HAS, a low amount of TSS with a high amount of ammonium sulfate; AS, ammonium sulfate with phosphorus and potassium; C, the control) and (2) to compare the rice response to applied N derived from each N fertilization practice. Rice biomass yield, 15 <b>N</b> <b>recovery</b> in both rice grain and stems, soil total N (TN), soil inorganic N, and soil 15 <b>N</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>were</b> analyzed. Similar amounts of 15 N uptake by rice in the TSS+AS plots were obtained, indicating that the effects of the different quantities of TSS on chemical fertilizer <b>N</b> <b>recovery</b> in rice during the experimental period were not significant.
