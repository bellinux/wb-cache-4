5|$|Alexios, who <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> {{with his}} retinue {{alongside}} the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E
5|$|Back in the 1980s, the {{ideology}} of Hezbollah was described as radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first objective <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E

60|$|We must pause {{here again}} {{for a moment to}} think where we are, and who is with us. The Teutsch Ritters have <b>been</b> <b>fighting,</b> {{independently}} of all states, for their own hand, or St. Adalbert's; partly for mere love of fight, partly for love of order, partly for love of God.

5|$|During the 13th century, a folktale {{developed}} in which Richard’s minstrel Blondel roamed (singing a song {{known only to}} him and Richard) to find Richard's prison. This story was the foundation of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and inspired the opening of Richard Thorpe's film version of Ivanhoe. Sixteenth-century tales of Robin Hood began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of Richard the Lionheart; Robin became an outlaw {{during the reign of}} Richard's evil brother, John, while Richard <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> in the Third Crusade.|$|E

The loyalists become fearful and also lock themselves in from the mutineers, with the exception of Edd, who sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings against the mutineers.|$|E

5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the motivating reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a {{shortage}} of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, {{in consultation with the}} United States and the United Kingdom, decided that it was necessary to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some debate, it was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact.|$|E
