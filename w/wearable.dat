5|$|Snapdragon is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. The Snapdragon central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC instruction set, and a single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a wireless modem, and other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, gesture recognition and video. Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android and Windows Phone devices. They are also used for netbooks, in cars, <b>wearable</b> devices and other devices.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium binds urea, a {{property}} {{that has been}} utilized extensively {{to the benefit of}} patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a <b>Wearable</b> Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and <b>wearable</b> robotic exoskeletons.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} <b>wearables</b> are {{inextricably}} performative. By this I mean that performance—human and nonhuman performance {{such as those}} encountered {{both on and off}} stage, as well as social performance and the performance of fashion and technology—contribute to the creation and meaning of <b>wearables.</b> With this aim in view, the thesis explores performance from four research angles: a framing of the birth of <b>wearables</b> in a performative context; a theoretical analysis of <b>wearables</b> as somatically, aesthetically, and technologically constituted via the performative; a historical back-dating of pre-computational <b>wearables</b> stemming from Modernist performative fields; and the in-situ case studies of contemporary <b>wearables</b> creations. It is my goal to demonstrate that <b>wearables</b> are performative across transversal timelines, materials, styles, fabrication processes, and body expressions. Using references from the art-research labs currently involved in developing fashion-tech and wearables—as an important counterbalance to industry’s contributions to wearables—I ask this central question: how can concepts of performance elucidate <b>wearables?</b> I look toward performance as a key thread that follows wearables’ beginnings to the current, contemporary technological culture embedded in media arts and experimental contributions to the field. Why? Because <b>wearables</b> are {{more than the sum of}} the technologies they incorporate, they are the result of their admixtures of fashion, bodies, display, and transformation (in both human and technological form). In short, <b>wearables</b> are active, (a) live, and hence both the objects themselves and the individuals wearing them participate in the co-creation of their performance. Performance is complex—striding as it does across disciplines from the technological and engineering; to the human and unscripted—and for this reason it is richly suited to the challenges encountered when describing <b>wearables.</b> Performance is the key pathway, in my opinion, through which we can gain stronger insight into the stakes, meanings, messiness, desires, and technological innovations that are being developed in <b>wearables</b> in artistic labs past, present and future...|$|R
