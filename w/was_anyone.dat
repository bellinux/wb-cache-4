5|$|Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old {{who acted}} as a bouncer at the event, pleaded guilty to her murder {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was {{released}} on parole in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party, pleaded guilty to assault; a third male (aged 15) pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as several people who admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the forensic evidence. The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996, and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998, with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Senate-passed bill {{then was}} {{transmitted}} to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> present who could give him information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E
25|$|Lowe {{describes}} the inflation incident in his official report less dramatically, {{saying that he}} was told by the gas plant supervisor to disconnect and let another balloon go first. Lowe did not name names, but it is not likely that it <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> other than Wise. Lowe's report about a new balloon has to be considered over Hoehling's account of the Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, {{she and her}} son {{returned}} to Moscow, unaware of the reception she would receive. In Stalin's USSR, anyone who had lived abroad was suspect, as <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> who had been among the intelligentsia before the Revolution. Tsvetaeva's sister had been arrested before Tsvetaeva's return; although Anastasia survived the Stalin years, the sisters never saw each other again. Tsvetaeva found that all doors had closed to her. She got bits of work translating poetry, but otherwise the established Soviet writers refused to help her, and chose to ignore her plight; Nikolai Aseev, who she had hoped would assist, shied away, fearful for his life and position.|$|E
25|$|During the contest, Vissi {{performed}} in the 16th spot {{of the night and}} appeared alone on stage, wearing a Jean-Paul Gaultier outfit. Although she {{had been one of the}} favourites during the pre-contest period, she only managed to get 9th place with 128 points (hers was one of the two pre-qualified entries to finish in the top 10, the other being Romania). The other eight songs were all qualified from the semi-final. Finland won the contest with the rock band Lordi and their song Hard Rock Hallelujah. In interviews prior to the contest, she had stated that if there <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> she would like to lose to, it would be the Finnish entry. Lordi had also expressed their liking of the Greek song in interviews, too.|$|E
25|$|In 1619 his {{daughter}} died shortly after birth, {{the only child}} he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen {{the case of the}} Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as they please in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside.|$|E

500|$|James himself {{maintained}} {{contact with}} his supporters in England whose principal object was to re-establish him upon his throne. William {{was well aware of}} these contacts (as well as others such as Godolphin and the Duke of Shrewsbury), but their double-dealing was seen more in the nature of an insurance policy, rather than as an explicit commitment. Marlborough did not wish for a Jacobite restoration, but William was conscious of his military and political qualities, and the danger the Earl posed: [...] "William was not prone to fear", wrote Thomas Macaulay, [...] "but if there <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> on earth that he feared, it was Marlborough".|$|E
500|$|Professor Michael Hicks, a Richard III specialist, {{has been}} {{particularly}} critical {{of the use of}} the mitochondrial DNA to argue that the body is Richard III's, stating that [...] "any male sharing a maternal ancestress in the direct female line could qualify". He also criticises the rejection by the Leicester team of the Y chromosome evidence, suggesting that it was not acceptable to the Leicester team to conclude that the skeleton <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> other than Richard III. He argues that {{on the basis of the}} present scientific evidence [...] "identification with Richard III is more unlikely that likely". However, Hicks himself draws attention to the contemporary view held by some that Richard III's grandfather, Richard, earl of Cambridge, was the product of an illegitimate union between Cambridge's mother Isabella of Castile (a bastard daughter of Pedro the Cruel of Castile) and John Holland (brother in law of Henry IV of England), rather than Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (Edward III's fourth son). If that was the case then the Y chromosome discrepancy with the Beaufort line would be explained but obviously still fail to prove the identity of the body. Hicks suggests alternative candidates descended from Richard III's maternal ancestress for the body (e.g. Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln) but does not provide evidence to support his suggestions. Philippa Langley, who commissioned the excavation refutes Hicks' argument on the basis that he does not taken into account all the evidence that points to the same conclusion.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. <b>Was</b> <b>anyone</b> else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, I was glad to see Body of Proof step up its game. The only thing lacking was a bit of the humour I've grown to love".|$|E
500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she <b>was</b> <b>anyone</b> new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Jim Crow era, masked mobs {{of local}} white men carried out two {{separate}} lynchings of African-American men in Montgomery County on Rockville's courthouse lawn.
