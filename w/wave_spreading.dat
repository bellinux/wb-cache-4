Ter-Petrosyan called for an opposition rally in Yerevan's Freedom Square on 18 February not just to protest the Karapetyan administration, but to protest the government of President Serzh Sargsyan.

The HAK said it planned to rally in the square {{regardless of whether the}} city government and the national government allowed it to do so.

Early tsunami wave detection, both quick and appropriate intervention is of vital importance for minimization tsunami damage.

In this paper tsunami wave models have been widely studied using cellular automata(CA) that has special features for simulating complex phenomena.

40|$|Linear {{viscoelasticity}} theory {{offers a}} minimal {{framework within which}} to construct a consistent, linear and causal model of mechanical wave dispersion. The term dispersion is used here to imply temporal <b>wave</b> <b>spreading</b> and amplitude reduction due to absorptive material properties rather than due to geometrical <b>wave</b> <b>spreading.</b> Numerical modeling of wave propagation in absorptive media {{has been the subject}} of recent research in such areas as material property measurement [1] [2], seismology [3] [4] [5] and medical ultrasound [6] [7]. Previously, wave attenuation has been included in transient finite element formulations via a constant damping matrix [8] or functionally in terms of a power law relation [9]. The formulation presented here is based on representing the viscoelastic shear and bulk moduli of the medium as either a discrete or continuous spectrum of decaying exponentials [10]. As a first test of the correctness of the viscoelastic finite element formulation, the finite element results for a simple hypothetical medium are compared with an equivalent Laplace-Hankel transform domain solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for predicting the circumferential liquid film distribution in stratified-dispersed flow is presented. Objective {{of the model}} is to describe the typical flow conditions of wet gas transportation in long, near-horizontal pipelines. In these applications, depending on the gas velocity and pipe diameter, a large asymmetry of the liquid film distribution may arise. The model {{is based on the}} assumption that in stratified-dispersed flow, liquid droplets can only be entrained by the gas from the thick liquid layer flowing at pipe bottom. It is also assumed that the deposition of smaller droplets is related to an eddy diffusivity mechanism and regards the entire pipe circumference, while larger droplets deposit by gravitational settling on the pipe bottom. These assumptions explain the formation of a thin, non-atomizing film in the upper part of the pipe. The presence and flow structure of this film appreciably affect the pressure gradient and the liquid hold-up in the pipe and are of great importance in flow assurance studies. The model has been validated against i) the experimental observations recently published by Pitton et al. (2014), the data collected by ii) Laurinat (1982), iii) Dallman (1978), and iv) the predictions of three-dimensional CFD simulations conducted by Verdin et al. (2014). It is shown that the relevant mechanisms which are responsible for the liquid film distribution are the gravitational film drainage, droplet entrainment/deposition and <b>wave</b> <b>spreading.</b> In particular, at high gas velocities and/or small pipe diameters, the asymmetry of the liquid film diminishes owing to the wetting mechanism of <b>wave</b> <b>spreading</b> which makes the distribution of the film more uniform in the circumferential direction. As the gas velocity diminishes and/or for larger pipe diameters, <b>wave</b> <b>spreading</b> is less effective and for these flow conditions only gravitational drainage and droplet entrainment/deposition are responsible for the more asymmetric shape of the liquid film...|$|E

40|$|The {{transient}} current systems between tethered plasmas {{in a large}} magnetoplasma are investigated experimentally for extrapolation to electrodynamic tethers in space. The studies measure the perturbed magnetic fields and the current density associated with pulsed currents to electrodes in three-dimensional space and time. The electrodes excite electron whistlers because they produce fields that dominantly couple to electrons, allowing pulsed currents to propagate and disperse as whistler wave packets. The wave packets evolve into force-free, flux-ropelike field configurations, and a whistler 'wedge' is formed in the plasma due to 'eddy' currents caused by insulated tethers with dc currents. Substantial radiation into the whistler mode happens with moving VLF antennas as well as tethers, and the <b>wave</b> <b>spread</b> within the ray cone {{is the most significant}} characteristic event.
