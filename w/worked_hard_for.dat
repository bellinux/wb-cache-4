5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} about {{these changes in}} society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> her.|$|E

25|$|In 1930 Gleckman {{engineered}} Brown's {{appointment as}} chief of police. In return, Brown protected Gleckman's business interests. When Gleckman was kidnapped by rival racketeer Jack Peifer, Brown <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> his release. The ransom was paid, {{but one of the}} kidnappers was later found shot dead by an unknown assailant. Brown took the ransom from the man's safe.

25|$|After {{my return}} from Vietnam, the {{opportunity}} to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service has given me my greatest challenges and my greatest rewards.

This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E

25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning {{the first thing he did}} was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E
25|$|Ritchie proved one of {{the last}} strong upholders of states' rights, gaining {{national}} prominence in 1922 with his stand against President Harding during the Western Maryland coal strike, and his strenuous opposition to the Volstead Act. His legislative program was in three main areas: state government reorganization, increased representation for Baltimore City, and {{reduction in the number of}} elections. The first governor of Maryland reelected since the Civil War, Ritchie loomed as a serious contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1924 until the compromise on John W. Davis. Ritchie <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the ticket, and at home achieved reforms in mental health, shellfish conservation, and law enforcement while continuing to fight federal encroachments on state prerogatives.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{approval}} of honor is dependent upon the recognition of others, during ancient times individuals <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> {{the approval}} of their peers within their societal cultures. This meant that individuals {{were more likely to}} behave like their honorable counterparts. Groups reinforced {{what it meant to be}} honorable through various expected behaviors and goals placed amongst individual members. This discouraged members from any negative activity that may have adversely affected a group or family's honor. In the event that the leader of the group promoted actions that did not appear to be honorable on a larger societal scale, the leader then offered some explanation defending their actions which lead to the preservation of what they defined as honor and their traditions forever.|$|E

25|$|In 1954 the LEWU {{sent him}} to the Mohomediya Estate in Agalawatte, in the Pasdun Korale (county) to organise a strike there. He was so {{successful}} that the Agalawatte Local of the LSSP asked for him to be sent as the Party's parliamentary candidate for the constituency. At the time, the seat was held by the United National Party (UNP) with a comfortable majority (the plantation workers, who were a large minority of the electorate, were disenfranchised by the UNP Government in 1949). In 1956 he won the election for this seat in Parliament representing Agalawatte for 11 years. He <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> his constituency, building roads and schools through self-help and worked for the welfare of the poorest sections, particularly for the neglected so-called lower castes.|$|E
25|$|Symbolic racism {{represents}} {{a form of}} resistance {{to change in the}} racial status quo based on moral feelings that blacks violate such traditional American values as individualism and self-reliance, the work ethic, obedience, and discipline. Whites may feel that people should be rewarded on their merits, which in turn should be based on hard work and diligent service. Hence symbolic racism should find its most vociferous expression on political issues that involve 'unfair' government assistance to blacks: welfare ('welfare cheats could find work if they tried'); 'reverse discrimination' and racial quotas ('blacks should not be given a status they have not earned'); 'forced' busing ('whites have <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> their neighborhoods, and for their neighborhood schools'); or 'free' abortions for the poor ('if blacks behaved morally, they would not need abortions').|$|E
500|$|Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta {{was born}} on March 28, 1986, in Manhattan, New York at the Lenox Hill Hospital to a Catholic family with Italian and French Canadian roots. Her parents are Cynthia Louise (née Bissett) and {{internet}} entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, {{and she has a}} younger sister, Natali. Brought up in the affluent Upper West Side of Manhattan, she says that her parents came from lower-class families and <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> everything. From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private, all-girls Roman Catholic school. Gaga described her academic life in high school as [...] "very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined" [...] but also [...] "a bit insecure". She considered herself a misfit among her peers and was mocked for [...] "being either too provocative or too eccentric".|$|E

500|$|In 1788 Bowdoin {{served as}} a member of the Massachusetts {{convention}} that ratified the United States Constitution. [...] A strong supporter of Federalism, Bowdoin <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> its ratification, bringing a skeptical Samuel Adams and his supporters into the fold by inviting him to a dinner with other pro-ratification delegates, and offering Federalist support to John Hancock in future elections. [...] Bowdoin's Federalist supporters backed Hancock in the 1789 election, even though Bowdoin also stood for election. [...] He remained active in his charitable and scientific pursuits in his later years, continuing his leadership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as that of the Humane Society. [...] He also continued to engage in new business ventures, buying in 1789 an interest in one of the first American merchant ships to sail to China.|$|E
500|$|He <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> {{many years}} as a {{freelance}} journalist, and began to be noticed for his writing. [...] He wrote for both English language and French language publications. [...] In 1938, he covered the Munich Agreement for the French daily Paris-Soir. [...] When World War II broke out, he enlisted in the French Army as a corporal. [...] His first assignment was on patrol on the Maginot Line. [...] He later served as a liaison to the British forces at Arras, and remained with them until the Battle of Arras forced their retreat. [...] He stayed with the British forces until the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940, where {{he was one of}} the last to be evacuated. His evacuation ship was sunk by a mine, and he was rescued by a British destroyer, bleeding heavily from a neck wound. [...] Laguerre credited his rescue to his ease with the English language (his rescuers took him for British). [...] He criticised his rescuers in later years for refusing to help Frenchmen who were around him; many of them drowned.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} fired {{her father}} as her manager and employed John McClain, then A Records' {{senior vice president}} of artists and repertoire and general manager. Commenting on the decision, she stated, [...] "I just {{wanted to get out of}} the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again." [...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him, stating, [...] "I've <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> my family. The problem comes, though, when others come in behind you and try to steal them away. The wheels have already been set for Janet Jackson. Anyone who jumps on now will be getting a free ride." [...] McClain responded by saying [...] "I'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father." [...] He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting/production duo of James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.|$|E

500|$|Johansson had {{aspired to}} appear on Broadway since her childhood. She made her debut in a 2010 revival of the drama A View from the Bridge, written by Arthur Miller. Set in the 1950s, in an Italian-American {{neighborhood}} in New York, it tells the tragic tale of Eddie (played by Liev Schreiber), who has an inappropriate love for his wife's orphaned niece, Catherine (played by Johansson). Johansson was initially uncomfortable playing a teenage character, but later agreed to do the play after a friend convinced her {{to take on the}} part. Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote of Johansson's performance that she [...] "melts into her character so thoroughly that her nimbus of celebrity disappears". [...] Varietys David Rooney was impressed with the play and Johansson in particular, describing her as the play's chief performer. She won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. Some critics and Broadway actors criticized the award committee's decision to award the work of mainstream Hollywood actors, including Johansson. In response, she said that she understood the frustration, but had <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> her accomplishments.|$|E
500|$|Hirst's poor form {{continued}} when {{he returned}} to England for the 1898 season. Fatigue from continuous cricket and ongoing problems with his leg added to his difficulties and he had a poor season. His only score over fifty was an innings of 130 against Surrey, and he scored 567 runs at an average of 17.71. Statistically, he had one of his worst bowling seasons, taking 36 wickets at 25.61 and never taking more than four wickets in an innings. For Yorkshire, Hirst's loss of form was offset by the debut of Wilfred Rhodes, also from Kirkheaton, who took 154 wickets in his first season. In 1899, Hirst showed a big improvement in his batting form, scoring 1,630 runs—his best tally to date—at an average of 35.43. He increased his number of wickets to 82 at 24.75, and his form was good enough to earn selection for his first home Test match, against Australia. However, it was only injuries to three other candidates that secured his place as a fast bowler, and he was not selected {{in the rest of the}} series. Wisden noted: [...] "It cannot be said that the experiment was in any way a success. Hirst <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> his side, his fielding indeed being perfection, but as a bowler he did not cause the Australians any trouble." [...] When he played the tourists in their game against Yorkshire soon after the Test, Hirst took 13 wickets. Later in the season, he played for the Players against the Gentlemen, though without any great success.|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E
