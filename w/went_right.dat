5|$|From 1915, Summer Hill {{was served}} by trams from Hurlstone Park. Trams left New Canterbury Road {{and went down}} Prospect Road, then swung right onto Smith Street. They turned onto Lackey Street, where they <b>went</b> <b>right</b> and {{terminated}} at the station. Low usage and rival buses saw the line closed in 1933, however some remains can be seen.|$|E

He hit square #17 on his last spin, which was a space that had a Whammy in it, but he stopped the board before the Whammy could shuffle into the square and won a trip to The Bahamas valued at $2,636.|$|E
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I <b>went</b> <b>right</b> from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E

5|$|In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, it {{was again}} Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the {{critical}} role. Chetwode believed that the EEF {{did not have the}} resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at Beersheba, in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba <b>went</b> <b>right</b> down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade– the last of history's great cavalry charges– to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List.|$|E

25|$|On 23 July 1997, {{at around}} 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy {{discovered}} {{the body of}} a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown Göteborg. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and <b>went</b> <b>right</b> through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground.

25|$|Ovechkin <b>went</b> <b>right</b> {{away and}} scored the {{equalizer}} after Per-Åge Skrøder gave Norway the lead. After Russia took the lead, Patrick Thoresen {{made it a}} tied game just 28 seconds after the second period started, with his 18th point of the tournament. The game went into the last period tied, 2–2. Not even one minute into the third period, Alexei Emelin gave Russia the lead. After Russia raised the lead to two, Ilya Nikulin finished Norway off by making it a 5–2 lead with just five minutes to go. Norway was outshot 45–21 and eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Chicago's first {{touchdown}} {{resulted on}} a New York punt attempt {{from their own}} 12, forcing Sean Landeta to make the kick three yards into his goal line. As Landeta dropped the ball to kick it, the wind altered the ball's descent and caused it to go {{off the side of}} his foot. As a result, the ball <b>went</b> <b>right</b> into the ground and bounced a short distance before reserve safety Shaun Gayle picked it up and returned the -7 yard punt five yards for a touchdown. Gayle's run was the shortest punt return touchdown in NFL history.|$|E
25|$|The Giants had {{the wind}} {{again in the}} third quarter, and on their first drive of the second half, Hampton scored on a 51-yard rushing touchdown, the longest run in Giants postseason history. Then Harry Newsome's punt went just 21 yards to the Minnesota 26-yard line. Hampton {{subsequently}} converted a fourth and 1 situation with a 2-yard run and rushed for five yards on third and 2 as the team drove to another touchdown on his 2-yard score. On the extra point attempt, the snap sailed right through Horan's hands and <b>went</b> <b>right</b> {{into the arms of}} Treadwell. However, Treadwell managed to run the ball into the end zone for a successful conversion, giving the team a 17-10 lead.|$|E

25|$|The 1955-56 {{would prove}} {{to be one of the}} club's most successful. After losing six of their first twelve games in the Autumn Cup, Panthers would win the next eleven and tie their final game to win the title by seven points over Paisley Pirates. In the league, Nottingham were triumphant in a tight league race that saw only eight points {{separate}} first and last place. The championship <b>went</b> <b>right</b> down to the wire, with Panthers needing 11-10 and 7-6 wins over Harringay Racers on the final weekend of the season to claim the title on goal average over the Wembley Lions. The Panthers also travelled to Sweden where they won the Ahearne Cup and entertained Sweden, Czechoslovakia and the United States in challenge games.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Bears tied {{the game with}} WR/KR/PR Devin Hester {{returning}} a punt 75 yards for a touchdown. Denver responded with FB Cecil Sapp getting a 5-yard TD run, but afterwards, Hester <b>went</b> <b>right</b> back to work for Chicago as he returned the following kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, the Broncos replied with QB Jay Cutler completing a 68-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the fourth quarter, Denver increased its lead with Cutler completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler. Afterwards, the Bears tied the game with RB Adrian Peterson getting a 4-yard TD run, along with QB Rex Grossman completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian. In overtime, Chicago came out on top as Gould made the game-winning 39-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and <b>went</b> <b>right</b> back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Joseph Ligambi was {{released}} from prison after he successfully appealed his murder conviction and was acquitted at retrial. After 10 years in prison, Ligambi returned to a much different Mafia family that saw two violent regime changes and the family under the control of a group of young mobsters. Ligambi, who is Borgesi's uncle, was a Scarfo era soldier when he was imprisoned in 1987 and was also mentored by Merlino's father, Salvatore. Upon his release, Ligambi <b>went</b> <b>right</b> back to work for the crime family. He was well respected among his peers for staying strong when {{sentenced to life in prison}} instead of betraying his crime family to the authorities to escape prison time. When Merlino and company were arrested, Merlino named Ligambi acting boss of the family. Ligambi continued as acting boss after their convictions on racketeering related crimes in 2001.|$|E
25|$|At undefeated and 19th/21st ranked Butler, McHugh got {{his head}} on a goal kick near midfield in the fourth minute; Jambga got to the ball before the Bulldogs for a {{turnover}} and drove straight at the goalkeeper, who only {{managed to get a}} fingertip on the hard shot from seventeen yards out that gave the Cougars the early lead. Butler had a chance to tie shortly before halftime when a Cougar committed a foul in the box, but Dal Santo dived to his left to make the save on the penalty kick and preserve the SIUE lead. He was unable to repeat the feat when a second foul in the box was called in the 86th minute, and Adkins scored on his PK to tie the game at 1. In the final minute of regulation time, Awad passed to Christianson, who was double covered, but <b>went</b> <b>right</b> at the keeper and chipped the ball over him for the goal that gave the Cougars the upset win.|$|E
25|$|New York had {{the wind}} at their back in the first quarter, but could only score on kicker David Treadwell's 26-yard field goal on their opening drive. In the second quarter, they had another chance to score, but {{receiver}} Mark Jackson dropped a pass on third and 2 from the Vikings 17 and then Treadwell drilled a 34-yard field goal attempt wide left. Meanwhile, the Vikings went up 7-3 on Jim McMahon's 40-yard pass to wide receiver Cris Carter. Near {{the end of the}} half, Giants quarterback Phil Simms threw a third down pass to Dave Meggett that lost nine yards, bringing up fourth and 19 from the New York 23. On the next play, punter Mike Horan shanked a kick that <b>went</b> <b>right</b> into the back of teammate Greg Jackson, a blocker in the backfield, enabling the Vikings to take over on the Giants 36 with 29 seconds left in the half and take a 10-3 halftime lead on Fuad Reveiz's franchise postseason record 52-yard field goal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Miami drove 74 yards {{and tied it}} at 24, with Strock's 15-yard {{touchdown}} completion to Rose. San Diego countered with a 6-play, 60-yard drive to score on Fouts' 25-yard touchdown completion to tight end Kellen Winslow. But Miami re-tied the game with Strock completing six consecutive passes, the last a 50-yard score to Bruce Hardy. Then Miami defensive back Lyle Blackwood's interception set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Nathan, giving Miami their first lead of the game, 38–31, on the first play of the fourth quarter. Later on, with Miami just trying to maintain their lead and run out the clock, Chargers safety Pete Shaw recovered a fumble from Andra Franklin on San Diego's 18-yard line with 4:39 left in regulation. Fouts then led his team down to Miami's nine-yard line. With only 58 {{seconds left in the}} game, a heavy Dolphins pass rush forced Fouts to throw a blind pass intended for Winslow in the end zone. The pass sailed over Winslow's head, but <b>went</b> <b>right</b> into the arms of Brooks for a touchdown to tie the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} would {{be full of}} missed {{opportunities}} and poor play from both teams. On the first play, a high snap from Bucs center Tony Mayberry went over quarterback Shaun King's head and into the end zone. King managed to knock {{the ball out of}} the end zone to prevent a touchdown, but it gave the Rams a safety and a 5–3 lead. Az-Zahir Hakim returned the free kick 15-yards to the Rams 40-yard line. Hakim also caught a 14-yard pass and ran for six as the team drove to the Bucs 26, but the drive was halted there and Wilkins missed a 44-yard field goal attempt. Following a punt from each team, Tampa Bay also got good field position from a good return, a 14-yard punt return from Karl Williams that gave them a first down on the Rams 45. Although they would drive to the St. Louis 26, they would ultimately fair no better than the Rams did. On third down, King lost a fumble while being sacked by Charlie Clemons. King recovered the ball, but the 13-yard loss pushed the team out of field goal range. The next time Tampa Bay had the ball, King threw a pass from the Rams 41 that <b>went</b> <b>right</b> into the arms of St. Louis defensive back Todd Lyght. A few plays later, the half ended with the score still 5-3, despite the Rams 159–75 advantage over the Buccaneers in total yards.|$|E
25|$|Friedkin went to some {{extraordinary}} lengths, {{reminiscent of}} some directors {{from the old}} Hollywood directing style, manipulating the actors, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn suffered back injuries and their painful screams <b>went</b> <b>right</b> into the film. Burstyn injured her back after landing on her coccyx when a stuntman jerked her around using a special effects cable during the scene when Regan slaps her mother. According to the documentary Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist, however, the injury did not cause permanent damage, although Burstyn was upset the shot of her screaming in pain {{was used in the}} film. After asking Father William O'Malley if he trusted him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face before a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film as a very emotional Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired blanks without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for one of the takes, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regan's bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors' breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.|$|E
