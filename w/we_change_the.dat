If <b>we</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> {{definition}} of 'open set', we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concepts in}} point-set topology are continuity, compactness, and connectedness. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets {{are those that}} can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot {{be divided into two}} pieces that are far apart. The words nearby, arbitrarily small, and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets. If <b>we</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> definition of open set, we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for open set is called a topology.

2500|$|Flowing on {{from the}} BK belief that {{everyone}} is a spiritual being, is the practice of Shubhawna (pure feelings) and Shubkamna (good wishes). For BKs, all prejudices and ill-feelings are seen as arising from identifying the self and others based on external labels like race, religion, gender, nationality, beauty (or lack of), etc. However, when there is the practice of finding the intrinsic goodness in each one, the prejudice based on those labels is replaced by the vision of one Spiritual Parent, one Human family, and universal spiritual values such as respect, love, peace and happiness. A flagship slogan for the BKs has been When <b>we</b> <b>change,</b> <b>the</b> world changes. It {{is for this reason}} that BKs consider bringing about this kind of change within the self as an important form of [...] "world service".|$|E

[...] He asked the Beatles to {{consider}} making major changes to it, including increasing its tempo. By the time it was brought back into the studio on 26 November 1962, its arrangement had been radically altered, and it took 18 takes to record what George Martin immediately predicted would be their first major hit. Paul McCartney in Anthology stated: [...] "We sang it and George Martin said, 'Can <b>we</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> tempo?' We said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Make it a bit faster. Let me try it.'

2500|$|Viewed as {{a theory}} of {{elementary}} particles, Lorentz's electron/ether theory was superseded {{during the first few}} decades of the 20th century, first by quantum mechanics and then by quantum field theory. As a general theory of dynamics, Lorentz and Poincare had already (by about 1905) found it necessary to invoke the principle of relativity itself {{in order to make the}} theory match all the available empirical data. By this point, most vestiges of a substantial ether had been eliminated from Lorentz's [...] "ether" [...] theory, and it became both empirically and deductively equivalent to special relativity. The main difference was the metaphysical postulate of a unique absolute rest frame, which was empirically undetectable and played no role in the physical predictions of the theory, as Lorentz wrote in 1909, and A would be alike in all respects. It would be impossible to decide which of them moves or stands still with respect to the ether, and there would be no reason for preferring the times and lengths measured by the one to those determined by the other, nor for saying that either of them is in possession of the [...] "true" [...] times or the [...] "true" [...] lengths. This is a point which Einstein has laid particular stress on, in a theory in which he starts from what he calls the principle of relativity, i. e. the principle that the equations by means of which physical phenomena may be described are not altered in form when <b>we</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> axes of ...|$|E
