2500|$|As deputy {{director}} {{and director of}} America's leading intelligence agency for many years, Gates and his CIA staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the Soviet Union. More particularly, Gates {{has been criticized for}} allegedly concocting evidence to show that the Soviet Union was stronger than it actually was. George Shultz said that, while Secretary of State, he felt the CIA under Gates was trying to [...] "manipulate" [...] him, that the agency was [...] "a big powerful machine not under good control. I distrust <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> of it." [...] Schultz also told Gates at the time that his CIA was [...] "usually wrong" [...] about Moscow, having dismissed Gorbachev's policies as [...] "just another Soviet attempt to deceive us." [...] In 1991, Stansfield Turner, former Director of Central Intelligence, described the [...] "enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis. … I never heard a suggestion from the CIA … that numerous Soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem." [...] Turner said this failure was a consequence of deliberate distortion by those in the upper echelon of the CIA who were helping to sell the Reagan administration's defense buildup, a view backed by former CIA analyst Melvin Goodman at Gates' 1991 confirmation hearings: [...] " [...] Casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the Soviet threat … [...] Gates' role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence." [...] Reviewing the third instalment of Gates' memoirs in 2016, Goodman said, [...] "In my 24 years at the CIA, there was never the kind of toxic atmosphere that existed when Gates served as {{deputy director}} for intelligence, deputy director of CIA, and finally director of CIA." [...] Also, according to Newsweek, Gates, as deputy director of CIA, allegedly vouched for the comprehensiveness of a CIA study presented to the Senate and President Reagan alleging that the Soviet Union {{played a role in the}} 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul II. A CIA internal review later denounced the report as being skewed, but that Gates did not try to influence the report's conclusions.|$|E

60|$|In all {{the sights}} {{to be seen}} about the world there is no sight {{in which there is}} less to be seen than in a gold-mine. The two young men were made to follow their {{conductor}} along a very dirty underground gallery for {{about a quarter of a}} mile, and then they came to four men working with picks in a rough sort of chamber, and four others driving holes in the walls. They were simply picking down the rock, in doing which they were assisted by gunpowder. With keen eyes Crinkett searched along the roof and sides, and at last showed to his companions one or two little specks which he pronounced to be gold. 'When it shows itself like that all about, you may guess whether it's a paying concern! Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' As Dick and Caldigate hitherto knew nothing about ounces and tons in reference to gold, and as they had heard of nuggets, and lumps of gold nearly as big as their fist, they were not much exalted by what they saw down the 'Old Stick-in-the-Mud.' Nor did they like the darkness and dampness and dirt and dreariness of the place. They had both resolved to work, as they had often said, with their own hands;--but in thinking over it their imagination had not pictured to them so uncomfortable a workshop as this. When they had returned to the light, the owner of the place took them through the crushing-mill attached, showed them the stone or mulloch, as it was thrust into the jaws of the devouring animal, and then brought them in triumph round to the place where the gold was eliminated from the débris of mud and water. The gold did not seem to them to be very much; but still there it was. 'Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' said Crinkett, as he brought them back to his house. 'You'll find that a 10s. share'll give you about 6d. a month. That's about 60 per cent, I guess. You can have your money monthly. <b>What</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> of that there mine in a March, you can have in a April, and so on. There ain't nothing like it anywhere else,--not as I knows on. And instead of working your hearts out, you can be just amusing yourselves about the country. Don't go to Ahalala;--unless it is for dropping your money. If that's what you want, I won't say but Ahalala is as good a place as you'll find in the colony.' Then he brought a bottle of whisky out of a cupboard, and treated them to a glass of grog apiece.

6000|$|I wrote you a scrabbly {{note from}} Ravenna {{a few days}} since--but I must follow it up, without delay, with {{something}} better. I came on here an hour afterwards, and shall remain till June 1st or 2nd. I find Rome deliriously cool and empty, and still very pleasing {{in spite of the}} [...] "ruining" [...] which has been going on so long and of which one has heard so much, i.e., the redemption and cockneyfication of the ruins. This [...] "changes" [...] immensely--as everyone says; but I find myself, I am afraid, so much more changed--since I first knew and rhapsodized over it, that I am bound in justice to hold Rome the less criminal of the two. I am thinking a little about going down--if the coolness lasts--for three or four days to Naples; but I haven't decided. I feel rather hard and heartless to be prattling about these touristries to you, with the sad picture I have had these last weeks of your--William's--state of suffering. But it is only a way of saying that that state makes one feel it to be the greater duty for me to be as well as I can. Absit omen! Your so interesting letter of the 6th dictated to Alice speaks of the possibility of your abscess continuing not to heal--but I trust the event has long ere this reassured, comforted and liberated you. Meanwhile may Alice have smoothed your pillow as even she has never smoothed it before.... As regards the life, the power, the temper, the humour and beauty and expressiveness of the Diary in itself--these things were partly [...] "discounted" [...] to me in advance by so much of Alice's talk during her last years--and my constant association with her--which led me often to reflect about her extraordinary force of mind and character, her whole way of taking life--and death--in very much {{the manner in which the}} book does. I find in its pages, for instance, many things I heard her say. None the less I have been immensely impressed with the thing as a revelation of a moral and personal picture. It is heroic in its individuality, its independence--its face-to-face with the universe for and by herself--and the beauty and eloquence with which she often expresses this, let alone the rich irony and humour, constitute (I wholly agree with you) a new claim for the family renown. This last element--her style, her power to write--are indeed to me a delight--for I have had many letters from her. Also it brings back to me all sorts of things I am glad to keep--I mean things that happened, hours, occasions, conversations--brings them back with a strange, living richness. But it also puts before me what I was tremendously conscious of in her life-time--that the extraordinary intensity of her will and personality really would have made the equal, the reciprocal, life of a [...] "well" [...] person--in the usual world--almost impossible to her--so that her disastrous, her tragic health was in a manner the only solution for her of the practical problem of life--as it suppressed the element of equality, reciprocity, etc. The violence of her reaction against her British ambiente, against everything English, engenders some of her most admirable and delightful passages--but I feel in reading them, as I always felt in talking with her, that inevitably she simplified too much, shut up in her sick room, exercised her wondrous vigour of judgment on too small a scrap of what really surrounded her. It would have been modified in many ways if she had lived with them (the English) more--seen more of the men, etc. But doubtless it is fortunate for the fun and humour of the thing that it wasn't modified--as surely the critical emotion (about them,) the essence of much of their nature, was never more beautifully expressed. As for her allusions to H.--they fill me with tears and cover me with blushes.... I find an immense eloquence in her passionate [...] "radicalism"--her most distinguishing feature almost--which, in her, was absolutely direct and original (like everything that was in her,) unreflected, uncaught from entourage or example. It would really have made her, had she lived in the world, a feminine [...] "political force." [...] But had she lived in the world and seen things nearer she would have had disgusts and disillusions. However, <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> in the book--as it came out to me in fact--is that she was really an Irishwoman; transplanted, transfigured--yet none the less fundamentally national--in spite of her so much larger and finer than Irish intelligence. She felt the Home Rule question absolutely as only an Irishwoman (not anglicised) could. It was a tremendous emotion with her--inexplicable in any other way--but perfectly explicable by [...] "atavism." [...] What a pity she wasn't born there--and had her health for it. She would have been (if, always, she had not fallen a victim to disgust--a large [...] "if") a national glory! But I am writing too much and my late hindrances have left me with tremendous arrears of correspondence. I thank you, dear Alice, caramente, for your sweet letter received two or three weeks before William's. I crudely hope you won't let your house--so as to have it to go to in the summer. Otherwise what will become of you. I dig my nose into the fleshiest parts of the young Francis. Tell Peggy I cling to her--and to Harry too, and Billy not less.... I haven't sent you [...] "The Yellow Book"--on purpose; and indeed I have been weeks and weeks receiving a copy of it myself. I say on purpose because although my little tale which ushers it in ("The Death of the Lion") appears to have had, for a thing of mine, an unusual success, I hate too much the horrid aspect and company of the whole publication. And yet I am again to be intimately, conspicuously associated with the 2d number. It is for gold and to oblige the worshipful Harland (the editor).
