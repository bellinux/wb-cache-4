5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (<b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood {{has been found in}} up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E

25|$|DNA-environment {{interactions}} {{are important in}} the development of personality because this relationship determines <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. It has been noted that while different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what lead to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.|$|E
25|$|The {{serotonin}} neurotransmitter has {{the ability}} to mediate synaptic transmission through either GPCR's or LGIC receptors. Depending on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the brain region serotonin is being acted upon, will depend on whether the output is either increasing or decreasing post-synaptic responses. The most popular and widely used drugs in the regulation of serotonin during depression are known as SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the transport of serotonin back into the pre-synaptic neuron, leaving more serotonin in the synaptic gap to be used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a static analysis technique based on pro-gram slicing for CSP specifications.

Our tech-nique {{is based on a}} new data structure which extends the Synchronized Control Flow Graph (SCFG). We show that this new data structure im-proves the SCFG by taking into account the context in which processes are called and, thus, makes the slicing process more precise...|$|R

25|$|Today's {{critics of}} Voltaire's opinion are {{directed}} primarily at his economic {{assessment of the}} Canadian colony. Voltaire’s idea of the Canadian colony based essentially on fur trade was, even {{at the time of}} his own writings, already outdated by almost a century. Thus, although it may be difficult to determine exactly <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his depiction of Canada might be attributed to deliberate exaggeration for polemical purposes, to attachment to a preconceived idea or to mere misinformation, his few writings on the subject do seem to display a certain level of short-sightedness regarding the actual level of economic evolution that had, by then, already been reached in the settled parts of Canada and about the colony’s potential for further development.|$|E
25|$|The art is {{commonly}} found in rock shelters (protected by a natural ledge) and shallow caves in which sunlight can penetrate easily. There is no clear preference as to <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the rock shelter is used for art, it can be placed high or half-way up the walls. The sites were not used for habitation, and lack the organic remains of hearths and rubbish deposits which would help dating. Many sites are heavily decorated with figures superimposed, while other apparently suitable locations nearby have no images at all. The sites are often in ravines in steep valleys that would be relatively little use to farmers, but perhaps ideal for hunting by ambush and stampeding animals into a dead end.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultures}} of the Celtic and Iberian populations were gradually Romanised (Latinised) at different rates depending on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Hispania they lived in, with local leaders being admitted into the Roman aristocratic class. Hispania served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbors exported gold, wool, olive oil, and wine. Agricultural production increased {{with the introduction of}} irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors Hadrian, Trajan, Theodosius I, and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania. Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century AD and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century AD. Most of Spain's present languages and religion, and the basis of its laws, originate from this period.|$|E

We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E
25|$|If a nazirite fails in {{fulfilling}} {{these three}} obligations {{there may be}} consequences. All {{or part of the}} person's time as a nazirite may need to be repeated. Furthermore, the person may be obligated to bring sacrifices. Whether a nazirite has to repeat time as a nazirite depends on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the nazirite vow was transgressed. A nazirite who becomes defiled by a corpse is obligated to start the entire nazirite period over again. In the Mishna, Queen Helena vowed to be a nazirite for seven years, but became defiled near the end of each of two of her first nazirite periods, forcing her to twice start over. She was a nazirite for a total of 21 years. Nazirites who shave their hair are obligated to redo the last 30 days of the nazirite period. However, if the nazirite drinks wine, the nazirite period continues as normal.|$|E
