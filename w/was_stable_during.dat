Effective control over entire Yemen was not achieved by the Umayyad Caliphate. Imam Abdullah ibn Yahya Al-Kindi was elected in 745 to lead the Ibāḍī movement in Hadramawt and Oman. He expelled the Umayyad governor from Sana'a and captured Mecca and Medina in 746.

For olefins, it is low pressure and low GHSV [1.85  bar (abs): 648  h− 1], while C 5 + production is favored at high GHSV and is not affected by pressure.
