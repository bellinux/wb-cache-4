2500|$|Eumenius {{addressed}} the Franks {{in the matter}} of the execution of Frankish prisoners in the circus at Trier by Constantine I in 306 and certain other measures: [...] ("Where now is that ferocity of yours? <b>Where</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ever untrustworthy fickleness?"). [...] was used often to describe the Franks. Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view. A formulary written by Marculf about 700 AD described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that [...] "all the peoples who dwell , Franks, Romans, Burgundians and those of other nations, live... according to their law and their custom." [...] Writing in 2009, Professor Christopher Wickham pointed out that [...] "the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the River Loire everyone seems to have been considered a Frank by the mid-7th century at the latest; Romani were essentially the inhabitants of Aquitaine after that".|$|E

50|$|The Gestalt {{principles}} of perception govern {{the way we}} group different objects. Good form <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the perceptual system tries {{to fill in the}} blanks in order to see simple objects rather than complex objects. Continuity <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the perceptual system tries to disambiguate which segments fit together into continuous lines. Proximity <b>is</b> <b>where</b> objects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> close together are associated. Similarity <b>is</b> <b>where</b> objects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> similar are seen as associated. Some of these elements have been successfully incorporated into quantitative models involving optimal estimation or Bayesian inference.|$|R
