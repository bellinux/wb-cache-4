5|$|Moreau {{preferred}} to retreat through the Black Forest via the Kinzig River valley, but Nauendorf blocked that route. Instead, Saint-Cyr's column {{led the way}} over the Höllenthal, breaking through the Austrian net at Neustadt and reaching Freiburg im Breisgau on 12 October. Moreau's supply trains took a route down the Wiese River to Hüningen. The French general <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Kehl farther down the Rhine, but by this time Charles barred the way with 35,000 soldiers. In order for his trains to get away, Moreau needed to hold his position for a few days. The Battle of Emmendingen was fought on 19 October, the 32,000 French losing 1,000 killed and wounded plus 1,800 men and two guns captured. The Austrians sustained 1,000 casualties out of 28,000 troops engaged. Beaupuy and Wartensleben were both killed. There was some fighting on the 20th, but when Charles advanced on 21 October the French were gone.|$|E

Écho kept pace and attempted to guide Méduse, but to no avail. Écho then prudently moved further out to sea.|$|E
25|$|The Santa Fe Railway still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> California {{on its own}} rails (it leased the SP {{line from}} Needles to Barstow), {{and the state of}} California eagerly courted the {{railroad}} to break SP's monopoly. In 1897 the railroad traded the Sonora Railway of Mexico to SP for their line between Needles and Barstow, giving AT its own line from Chicago to the Pacific coast. It was unique in that regard until the Milwaukee Road completed its extension to Puget Sound in 1909.|$|E
25|$|The year 2000 Renewable Energy Sources Act {{provided}} for a feed-in tariff {{in support of}} renewable energy. The German government, declaring climate protection as a key policy issue, announced a carbon dioxide reduction target by the year 2005 compared to 1990 by 25%. In 1998, the use of renewables in Germany reached 284nbsp&PJ of primary energy demand, which corresponded to 5% of the total electricity demand.

The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers.

According to Monteith, Casement believed the Germans were toying with him from the start and providing inadequate aid that would doom a rising to failure.

25|$|B’laan tribe is {{probably}} the most popular Mindanao occupants of Mountain provinces for Hanging Coffins of Sagada. Even before the influence of Christianity, the elders feared being buried on the ground, since they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> heaven in their afterlife. Out of love and concern, the family would hang the coffins {{on the wall of the}} cave (such as Lumiang cave). However, this kind of burial procedure was similar to other fishing communities like Banton of Romblon. Another unique characteristic of this pre-colonial burial custom contains the tradition of inserting jars in the coffin. This was similar to the Manunggul jar discovered in Tabon cave, Palawan, making the custom pre-existing even before the pre-colonial era. For B’laan people, tree served as a zone of final rest, which is a unique pattern for most of the Mindanao tribes’ burial custom as well.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} game was in 2D, the second game {{features}} 3D graphics; this change affected the puzzle creation, as the development team could choose to layer objects behind each other or have them all visible at once. As the second game was made with a worldwide release in mind, Japanese characters and references to Japanese culture were avoided in the puzzle design; the puzzles ended up using numbers a lot since they are internationally used symbols. For the iOS version of {{the first game}}, the puzzles were removed and replaced with new story sequences; this was done as the development team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> {{people who are not}} good at solving puzzles, or who do not play games at all and who might not have a game console. However, according to Uchikoshi, the development staff felt that the game was incomplete without the puzzle sequences of the original version.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the Japanese did {{not allow}} Wang Kemin's Provisional Government of the Republic of China to have an army of its own and instead relied on a police force of 5,000 men for security. In May 1938 steps were taken towards forming an actual army for his {{government}} by opening a military academy in Beijing, with an initial intake of a hundred cadets for a one-year course. In February 1939, a Training School was opened for non-commissioned officers with one thousand cadets undergoing a six-month course. The target strength the Provisional Government <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> was 13,200 men divided into 8 infantry regiments, with six of them being formed into brigades, commanded by a Chinese major general and a Japanese adviser. Along with graduates of the academies, who were given the rank of lieutenant or second lieutenant, there were also former Nationalist and warlord officers. In addition, {{there was also a}} 400-man bodyguard unit for Wang.|$|E
25|$|Following {{consultations}} {{with a number}} of ministers of State, King Albert received Herman Van Rompuy (CD), the outgoing President of the Chamber of Representatives, and charged him with an exploratory mission in order to find a solution to the political crisis. Van Rompuy was considered by Flemish and French-speaking parties and newspapers as a good choice. He met on August 30 with the presidents of several parties of the orange-blue coalition, in particular Jo Vandeurzen (CD), Bart De Wever (N-VA), Bart Somers (Open VLD) and Jöelle Milquet (CDH). On August 31, he met with presidents Didier Reynders (MR), Olivier Maingain, (FDF) and Jean-Michel Javaux (Ecolo). The content of the discussions is unknown as Van Rompuy wanted to communicate and negotiate discreetly. De Standaard noted that Van Rompuy did not talk with a member of the PS, which could mean he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the required two-thirds majority for constitutional reform with the ecologists (Ecolo on the French-speaking side) and rather that the PS.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October, Blücher {{joined the}} column under General-Leutnant Johann Friedrich von Winning near Waren. Winning's force, {{originally}} led by General Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, missed the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October {{and had been}} trailing Blücher ever since. Winning <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Rostock to the north, and, to this end, he ordered General-Major Karl Georg Friedrich von Wobeser to move ahead and prepare the port for evacuation. However, Blücher called off the Rostock operation in favor of his own idea, which was to cross {{to the west bank}} of the Elbe at Boizenburg. He hoped to join with General Karl Ludwig von Lecoq in the former Electorate of Hanover or with General-Leutnant Franz Kasimir von Kleist at Magdeburg. To that end he sent officers to collect boats and supplies in the area. Blücher organized his army into two corps. He gave Winning command of the 11,000-man I Corps, while retaining control of the 10,000-strong II Corps. The Prussians had a particularly powerful cavalry contingent, with 80 squadrons total. Each corps was subdivided into two heavy and one light divisions.|$|E
