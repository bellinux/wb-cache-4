5|$|The 12th Battalion is {{unexpectedly}} attacked {{soon after}} by Intelligent Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them <b>with</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction. Dr. Caulder, {{leader of the}} IDS, had {{taken advantage of the}} world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers to bloom from infected individuals, {{for the sole purpose of}} studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber, the Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the village of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict, begins to flourish in the new-found peace. The sun is seen rising above the nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving hope of a brighter future.|$|E

"Hastert and {{the senior}} Republican {{leadership}} in the House were able to maintain party discipline to a great degree," [...] which allowed them to regularly enact legislation, despite a narrow majority (less than twelve seats) in the 106th and 107th Congresses. Hastert was {{a strong supporter of}} the Iraq War Resolution and the ensuing 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Iraq War. Hastert stated in the House in October 2002 that he believed there was [...] "a direct connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda" [...] and that the U.S. should [...] "do all that we can to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime before they provide al-Qaeda <b>with</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction." [...] In a February 2003 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Hastert [...] "launched into a lengthy and passionate denunciation" [...] of France's resistance to the Iraq war and stated that he wanted to go [...] "nose-to-nose" [...] with the country. In 2006, Hastert visited Iraq at Bush's request and supported a supplemental Iraq War spending bill.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the press}} conference when Rumsfeld first used the phrase, he was {{responding}} to a question by reporter Jim Miklaszewski about evidence of Iraq supplying terrorists <b>with</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction. While some dismissed Rumsfeld statement as non-answer (compare Mu (negative))— not just an evasion or a misdirection, the statement has been quoted and dealt with in various blogs, books and scientific papers.

For instance, he has made suggestions that there was collaboration among North Korea, several Middle-Eastern countries and Al Qaeda, and that was ample evidence linking [...] "Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia to Al Qaeda and to the attacks on September 11," [...] and that in Afghanistan, the link between Iraq and Al Qaeda was [...] "common knowledge." [...] He also has said that Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a supporter of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations [...] "with money, with equipment, with technology, <b>with</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction." [...] He also claimed to have firsthand knowledge of nuclear weapons being smuggled from Russia to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.|$|E

She thought the Bush administration needed something bolder, something that would represent a more dramatic break with the ideas of the past. Rice turned the writing over to her old colleague, University of Virginia Professor Philip Zelikow." [...] One criticism of this document, issued on September 17, 2002, is that it is supposed to have been a significant document in an alleged Bush administration doctrine of preemptive war.

In a drastic move of revenge, the last remnants of the Terra Liberation Front utterly destroyed Earth <b>with</b> a <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction <b>with</b> power beyond anyone’s expectation. Indeed, from a point of view, Earth had been liberated from her oppressors.|$|R

50|$|While {{the word}} {{escalation}} {{was used as}} early as in 1938, it was popularized during the Cold War by two important books: On Escalation (Herman Kahn, 1965) and Escalation and the Nuclear Option (Bernard Brodie, 1966).

50|$|Al Qaeda, on {{the other}} hand, {{represents}} a transnational threat-one very different in kind from that posed by the IRA or even newer groups such as Hamas. Al Qaeda has potentially thousands of members and no interest in bargaining with the United States or its allies.

50|$|It is a {{very far}} {{reaching}} control which would eliminate the rivalry between nations in this field, which would prevent the surreptitious arming of one nation against another, which would provide some cushion of time before atomic attack, and presumably therefore before any attack <b>with</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, and which {{would go a long}} way toward removing atomic energy at least as a source of conflict between the powers.|$|E

50|$|A {{veteran of}} the U.S. Civil Rights movement, Greeman sees mass non-violent {{resistance}} as both an effective tactic and a social ethic. ‘Against an adversary <b>with</b> endless <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction and surveillance systems, the resort to revolutionary violence is tactical and literal suicide. On the other hand, the ethic of non-violence promotes cooperation and encourages the participation of women, humanity’s majority group, whose leadership is essential {{in the struggle for}} a just and safe planet.’ Greeman—who in the 1960s was personally close to several members of the ‘Weather Underground’ and worked with the CT Black Panthers in the 1970s—rejects individual violence. ‘Throughout history, the world’s police have always resorted to agents provocateurs to infiltrate social movements and provoke violence, thus justifying state terrorism against the masses. Why do their job for them?’ he asks.|$|R

50|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1941, much of the activity at Dugway Proving Ground has been a closely guarded secret. Activities at Dugway included aerial nerve agent testing. According to reports from New Scientist, Dugway was still producing small quantities of non-infectious anthrax of a type used {{in the making of}} vaccines, as late as 1998, 30 years after the United States renounced biological weapons. There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the time period of the Dugway sheep incident. In total, almost 500000 lb of nerve agent were dispersed during open-air tests. There were also tests at Dugway <b>with</b> other <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction, including 332 open-air tests <b>of</b> biological <b>weapons,</b> 74 dirty bomb tests, and eight furnace heatings of nuclear material under open air conditions to simulate the dispersal of fallout in the case of meltdown of aeronautic nuclear reactors.|$|R
50|$|This article {{deals with}} {{activities}} of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, specifically dealing <b>with</b> arms control, <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction (WMD) and weapons proliferation.

In some cases, the details of a country's programs are introduced because they present a problem in analysis. For example, if Country X's policymakers truly believe in certain history that may not actually be factual, an analyst trying to understand Country X's policymakers {{needs to be able to}} understand their approach to an issue.|$|R
