50|$|Bimoment (aka <b>warping</b> <b>moment)</b> is a {{term used}} in the {{analysis}} of beams (continuum mechanics), which relates to torsion and warping. Its symbol is Mω. Bimoment show the distributions at a cross-section of (longitudinal) warping stress, for the cases of torsional warping and distortional warping respectively. Generally, a bimoment can be represented by a pair of equal and opposite bending moments.|$|E
30|$|Ductile {{flexural}} failures {{occurred on}} the three beam specimens, which were dominated by the combined actions of the bending moment and <b>warping</b> <b>moment.</b> Specifically, for T–M ratios of 1 : 5, flexural failure was mainly dominated by the bending moment; for T–M ratios of 1 : 1, flexural failure of the loaded half U-section was dominated by the combined action of the bending moment and <b>warping</b> <b>moment,</b> while normal stress resultant on the unloaded half U-section was very small; for T–M ratios of 1 : 0, antisymmetric flexural failure of the two webs was dominated by the <b>warping</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
30|$|Research {{into the}} {{mechanical}} response of open thin-walled RC members under combined actions of bending, shear and torsion is quite rare. Analytical and experimental {{studies on the}} behavior of RC I-beams under combined bending, shear and torsion were conducted by Luccioni et al. (1991, 1996), and a calculation method of ultimate load based on the skew bending theory (Elfgren et al. 1974) was proposed, where the skew bending theory was modified by taking warping torque into account. In the calculation method, the effect of the <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> was neglected because, due to the specific geometrical properties of the I-section, the effect of the <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> was weak and ignorable compared to the effect of the bending moment. However, it is not the case for U-shaped thin-walled RC beams studied in this paper as the geometrical properties of the U-section will make the effect of the <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> as strong as the bending moment.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} nonuniform torsion of simply or multiply connected bars of doubly symmetrical arbitrary constant cross section, taking into account secondary torsional moment deformation effect. The bar is subjected to arbitrarily distributed or concentrated twisting and <b>warping</b> <b>moments,</b> while its edges are restrained by the most general torsional boundary conditions. To account for secondary shear deformations, the concept of shear deformation coefficient is used leading to a secondary torsion constant. Four boundary value problems {{with respect to the}} variable along the bar primary and secondary angles of twist and to the primary and secondary warping functions are formulated and solved employing a pure BEM approach, that is only boundary discretization is used. The warping and the primary torsion constants are evaluated employing the aforementioned primary and secondary warping functions using only boundary integration, while the secondary torsion constant is computed employing an effective automatic domain integration. Numerical examples with great practical interest are worked out to illustrate the efficiency and the range of applications of the developed method. The influence of the secondary torsional moment deformation effect of closed shaped cross sections is verified, while the accuracy of the proposed numerical procedure for the calculation of the secondary torsion constant compared with a FEM one is noteworthy.

30|$|It can be {{also seen}} from Fig.  12 {{that for the}} three beam specimens, {{longitudinal}} bar strains changed in a linear fashion around the U-shaped section, which agrees with the distribution of normal stresses induced by the bending and <b>warping</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{interaction}} of bending normal stress and warping normal stress, for MEM- 1 : 5 and MEM- 1 : 1, the flexural failure modes have confirmed that the loaded half U-section is more critical than the unloaded half U-section (see details in Sects.  2.3 and 3.4). As for MEM- 1 : 0, the flexural failure mode was dominated by the <b>warping</b> <b>moment,</b> the loaded half U-section was also critical as the unloaded half U-section. Therefore, for U-shaped thin-walled RC beams with different T–M ratios, the ultimate bearing capacity could be determined with the loaded half U-section at support and mid-span considering the combined actions of the bending moment and <b>warping</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
30|$|A {{method to}} {{calculate}} the first cracking (i.e. flexural cracking) load and the ultimate load of the U-shaped thin-walled RC beams under combined actions of torsion, bending and shear will be suggested here. Considering the experimental results that, for all three beam specimens under different T–M ratios, the ductile flexural failure was dominated by the <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> and bending moment at mid-span and at support, and the shear action (combined shear action of shear force and torque) at mid-span and at support is very weak and negligible. This was reflected by the extremely small stirrup strains at mid-span shown in Figs.  9 b, 10 b and 11 b; thus the algorithm {{is measured by the}} normal stresses caused by the <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> and bending moment at support and mid-span, where the shear effect is neglected.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} evaluation of warping shear stresses of bars of an arbitrary doubly symmetric constant cross section undergoing nonuniform torsional vibrations taking into account the effect of geometrical nonlinearity. The bar is Subjected to arbitrarily distributed or concentrated conservative dynamic twisting and <b>warping</b> <b>moments</b> along its length, while its edges are supported by the most general torsional and axial boundary conditions. The transverse displacement components are expressed so as to be valid for large twisting rotations (finite displacement - small strain theory), thus the arising governing differential equations and boundary conditions are in general nonlinear. Employing a variational approach, a coupled nonlinear initial boundary value problem with respect to the main unknown kinematical components and two boundary Value problems with respect to the primary and secondary warping functions are formulated. The solution of the last two problems is performed by a pore BEM approach requiring exclusively boundary discretization of the bar's cross section and leading to the evaluation of the warping shear stresses. The arising linear system of equations related to the secondary warping function is singular and a special technique is used to perform its regularization. The validity of the negligible axial inertia assumption is examined for the problem at hand. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} nonuniform torsional vibration problem of bars of arbitrary doubly symmetric constant cross section, {{taking into account the}} effects of geometrical nonlinearity (finite displacement [...] small strain theory) and secondary twisting moment deformation. The bar is subjected to arbitrarily distributed or concentrated conservative dynamic twisting and <b>warping</b> <b>moments</b> along its length, while its edges are subjected to the most general axial and torsional (twisting and warping) boundary conditions. The resulting coupling effect between twisting and axial displacement components is also considered and a constant along the bar compressive axial load is induced so as to investigate the dynamic response at the (torsional) postbuckled state. The bar is assumed to be adequately laterally supported so that it does not exhibit any flexural or flexural-torsional behavior. A coupled nonlinear initial boundary value problem with respect to the variable along the bar angle of twist and to an independent warping parameter is formulated. The resulting equations are further combined to yield a single partial differential equation with respect to the angle of twist. The problem is numerically solved employing the Analog Equation Method (AEM), a BEM based method, leading to a system of nonlinear Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE). The main purpose of the present contribution is twofold: (i)  comparison of both the governing differential equations and the numerical results of linear or nonlinear free or forced vibrations of bars ignoring or taking into account the secondary twisting moment deformation effect (STMDE) and (ii)  numerical investigation of linear or nonlinear free vibrations of bars at torsional postbuckling configurations. Numerical results are worked out to illustrate the method, demonstrate its efficiency and wherever possible its accuracy...|$|R

A distributed mass model system is employed, taking into account the warping, rotatory and axial inertia, leading to the formulation of a coupled nonlinear initial boundary value problem with respect to the variable along the bar angle of twist and to an ""average"" axial displacement of the cross-section of the bar. The numerical solution of the aforementioned initial boundary value problem is performed using the analog equation method, a BEM based method, leading to a system of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAE), which is solved using an efficient time discretization scheme. Additionally, for the free vibrations case, a nonlinear generalized eigenvalue problem is formulated with respect to the fundamental mode shape at the points of reversal of motion after ignoring the axial inertia to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. The problem is solved using the direct iteration technique (DIT), with a geometrically linear fundamental mode shape as a starting vector.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3 b, normal stress due to <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> Mω anti-symmetrically {{distributes}} around the cross-section, while normal stress due to bending moment Mb symmetrically distributes; therefore they enhance {{each other on}} the loaded half U-section while counteracting on the unloaded half U-section. Thus, for MEM- 1 : 5 and MEM- 1 : 1, under the combined actions of bending moment and <b>warping</b> <b>moment,</b> the loaded half U-section will be more critical than the unloaded half U-section. As shown in Fig.  3 b, shear stresses due to circulatory torque, warping torque and shear force distribute differently around the cross-section, and they enhance one another on the external surface of the loaded web while they do not elsewhere. Therefore, under the combined actions of circulatory torque, warping torque and shear force, the external surface of the loaded web will be more critical than other surfaces of the U-section.|$|E
30|$|As to {{torsional}} {{members with}} open thin-walled sections, the warping effect is not negligible. According to Vlasov’s elastic {{theory of the}} open thin-walled member (Vlasov 1961), when the warping deformation of an open thin-walled member under torsion is restrained, a new internal force called <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> corresponding to warping normal stress will appear. When it occurs, two kinds of internal torque appears simultaneously, which are circulatory torque (the same as that in the closed section case) and warping torque. In 1961, Vlasov (1961) developed the sectorial coordinate system and derived the theoretical formula to calculate warping torque and <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> for open thin-walled members, which {{became the basis for}} analyzing open thin-walled members under torsion. Thereafter, some research outcomes on the elastic torsional response of the open thin-walled member, especially focusing on the shear deformation induced by the warping torque, have been reported (Pavazza 2005; Erkmen and Mohareb 2006; Murín and Kutiš 2008; Aminbaghai et al. 2016). When it comes to the post cracking torsional behavior of RC members with an open thin-walled section, the above mentioned softened truss model for circulatory torsion is not accurate anymore because of the considerable warping effect (Luccioni et al. 1991). In addition the Vlasov’s elastic theory should be revised due to the cracking of concrete. Zbirohowski-Koscia (1968) first addressed issues related to the post-cracking behavior of open thin-walled RC beams under the <b>warping</b> <b>moment.</b> In 1981, Krpan and Collins tested the torsional response of a fixed–fixed U-shaped thin-walled RC beam (Krpan and Collins 1981 a). The results confirmed the dominate role that the <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> played. In the analogy to bending, based on Vlasov’s theory, the method to simulate the post cracking torsional behavior of the U-shaped thin-walled RC beam was proposed (Krpan and Collins 1981 b). Then Hwang and Hsu (1983) analyzed the entire torsional behavior of the RC channel beam with a method from the Fourier series approach. In the following two decades, few research outcomes on the torsional behavior of open thin-walled RC members under torsion were reported in literature. Due to the wide application of U-shaped thin-walled RC beams in the construction of rail viaducts in recent years, their torsional behavior has again drawn research’s attention. Theoretical and experimental studies on the torsional behavior of U-shaped thin-walled RC beams have been carried out by our research group (Chen et al. 2016 a, b), and based on Vlasov’s torsional theory and the nonlinear constitutive relations of materials, a nonlinear model to predict the torsional response of such U-shaped thin-walled RC beams has been proposed.|$|E
30|$|U-shaped {{thin-walled}} {{concrete bridge}} beams usually suffer the combined actions of flexure, shear and torsion, but no research about {{the behavior of}} U-shaped thin-walled RC beams under combined actions {{has been reported in}} literature. Three large specimens of U-shaped thin-walled RC beams were tested under different torque–bending moment ratios (T–M ratios) of 1 : 5, 1 : 1 and 1 : 0 to investigate the mechanical responses such as crack patterns, reinforcement strains, failure modes and ductility. The testing results showed that ductile flexural failures occurred for all three of the U-shaped thin-walled beam specimens, although the combined shear effect of circulatory torque, warping torque and shear force increased as the T–M ratio increased from 1 : 5 via 1 : 1 to 1 : 0, reflected by diagonal cracks and stirrup strains. More specifically, basically symmetrical flexural failure was dominated by the bending moment when the T–M ratio was 1 : 5; flexural failure of the loaded half of the U-shaped thin-walled section was dominated by the combined action of the bending moment and <b>warping</b> <b>moment,</b> while {{there were only a few}} cracks on the other half of the U-shaped section when the T–M ratio was 1 : 1; and anti-symmetrical flexural failure was dominated by the <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> when the T–M ratio was 1 : 0 (pure torsion). A simple method to calculate the ultimate load of such U-shaped thin-walled RC beams under different T–M ratios was suggested, and the calculating results were corresponding well with the experimental results.|$|E
50|$|In 2371, as {{depicted}} in Star Trek Generations, the Klingon Duras sisters obtain the phase modulation frequency of the Enterprise-D's shields, rendering them useless. Although the Enterprise-D destroys the sisters' ship, damage to the warp drive coolant system prompts an emergency saucer separation. The <b>warp</b> core breaches <b>moments</b> after the saucer begins to move away, destroying the ship's stardrive section. The resulting shock wave disables the saucer's propulsion and other primary systems, sending it into Veridian III's atmosphere. Caught in the planet's gravity, the saucer section crash lands on the surface, damaged beyond repair. It {{was replaced by the}} Enterprise-E, which was introduced in the film Star Trek: First Contact.|$|R
30|$|Also, the {{ultimate}} capacities are calculated with the method proposed by Elfgren et al. (1974) {{and with the}} method proposed by Luccioni et al. (1991). As {{can be seen from}} Table  5, according to the method proposed by Elfgren and Karlsson et al., the average ratio of test results and calculated results was 1.29, which should be attributed {{to the fact that the}} method based on the skew bending theory did not take into account the restrained torsion mechanism. For the calculation method proposed by Luccioni and Reimundin et al., as shown in Table  5, the average ratio of test results and predicted ultimate torques is 0.8. The reason for overestimating {{the ultimate}} capacities is that although the restrained torsion mechanism was considered, the effect of <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> is underestimated.|$|E
30|$|Considering {{the strong}} warping {{effect in the}} U-sections, the {{interaction}} results of bending moment and <b>warping</b> <b>moment,</b> {{as well as the}} interaction results of circulatory torque, warping torque and shear force should be experimentally studied. In the current paper, considering the variation of the torque–bending moment ratio (T–M ratio) in practice, three large U-shaped thin-walled RC beam specimens will be respectively tested under different T–M ratios of 1 : 5, 1 : 1 and 1 : 0 to investigate the mechanical response. The crack pattern, reinforcement strain, failure mode and ductility will be analyzed. Finally, an approach of calculating the cracking load and the ultimate load of each kind of beam will be proposed, which will make meaningful contributions to developing design guidelines for U-shaped thin-walled RC beams subjected to combined bending, shear and torsion.|$|E
30|$|The crack {{patterns}} of the observed span of the three beam specimens are shown in Fig.  5, in which the numerical values are the corresponding external torques, and the bordered ones are first flexural cracking torques (the smaller ones) or first diagonal cracking torques (the larger ones). It {{can be seen from}} Fig.  5 that, for the three beam specimens, the cracks at support and mid-span are mainly vertical flexural types, displaying small shear features, which means at support and mid-span, <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> and bending moment predominate while shear force and warping torsion had little influence. Cracks at the L/ 4 -section are diagonal types with an inclination of about 45 °. The distributions of cracks along the beam span conform well to the distributions of internal forces shown in Fig.  3 a. For MEM- 1 : 5, flexural cracks on the loaded web were more fully developed than those on the unloaded web; for MEM- 1 : 1, flexural cracks were fully developed on the loaded web but only a few flexural cracks appeared on the unloaded web; for MEM- 1 : 0, flexural cracks anti-symmetrically developed on two webs. The different development of flexural cracks on two webs of each beam was attributable to the interaction of the bending moment and <b>warping</b> <b>moment</b> under different T–M ratios, which will be discussed in detail in the following section. As to diagonal cracks, for MEM- 1 : 5 and MEM- 1 : 1, they developed most fully on the external surface of the loaded web; for MEM- 1 : 0, they developed most fully on the external surfaces of the loaded and unloaded webs. That agrees with the distribution of shear stress resultant around the U-section (Sect.  2.3). Overall, with the increase of the T–M ratio from 1 : 5 via 1 : 1 to 1 : 0, diagonal cracks were more and more fully developed, which means the effect of shear stress resultant increased.|$|E
