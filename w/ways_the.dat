5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 <b>ways.</b> <b>The</b> number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
