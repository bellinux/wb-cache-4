5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on <b>which</b> <b>to</b> land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior.

5|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel {{production}} practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of land on <b>which</b> <b>to</b> grow the feedstocks {{is a critical}} component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland.|$|E

5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from <b>which</b> <b>to</b> watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in <b>which</b> <b>to</b> dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E

For the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a rift between western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with <b>which</b> <b>to</b> foster future relations.|$|E
