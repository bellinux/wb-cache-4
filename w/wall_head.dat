Their only child, a little girl not three years old at the time, ran out of the house alone in her little white pinafore, and, toddling across the grass of a terraced garden, pitched herself over a low <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> first into the horse-pond in the yard below.|$|E

50|$|Kevin Harvick was {{the fastest}} {{in the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 35.436 and a speed of 203.183 mph. Ryan Truex was involved in a hard wreck seven minutes into the second practice session; he lost control of his car, overcorrected and hit the <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on in turn two.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to guide one or more mice ("ChuChus") around a board into one or more goals while {{avoiding}} cats ("KapuKapus") roaming the board. The mice and cats all move in predictable paths by always turning right when hitting a <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on, by following corners or by turning around when in a dead end.|$|E
50|$|At Daytona, Hamlin started 24th and led 20 laps, {{before he}} got into a wreck off of turn 4 with Juan Pablo Montoya and Martin Truex Jr.. Hamlin stayed on the track, a lap down, and got the free pass with the next caution. However, on lap 148, Hamlin hit the tri-oval <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on and then his car was struck by A. J. Allmendinger and went airborne.|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of immersion {{with regard to}} information visualization applications have rarely been explored. In this paper, we describe a user study designed to explore a variety of information visualization tasks in immersive and non-immersive 3 D scatterplots. In the non-immersive version the information was displayed using only one wall of the CAVE, while the immersive version used all four walls. We also {{examined the effects of}} head tracking, giving a total of four conditions: four walls in the CAVE with <b>head</b> tracking, four <b>walls</b> without <b>head</b> tracking, one <b>wall</b> with <b>head</b> tracking and finally, one <b>wall</b> without <b>head</b> tracking. By separating the variables in this way, we can independently evaluate the effects of immersion and head tracking. In general, we found the fully immersive condition, (four <b>walls</b> with <b>head</b> tracking) to be most useful in viewing the datasets and performing the tasks...|$|R

50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 45 laps to go. The ninth caution of {{the race}} flew with 39 laps {{to go for a}} two-car wreck on the backstretch. Rounding turn 2, Paul Menard suffered a left-rear tire blowout, got loose, clipped Kurt Busch and sent him backwards into the wall. He continued down the track hitting the inside <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on. Ryan Newman opted not to pit and assumed the lead.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, two {{cautions}} in {{the final}} forty laps were caused by separate collisions that included eleven cars. In the first collision, Regan Smith's car flipped over once in the tri-oval, while in the second collision, Kyle Busch collided into a concrete <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on, suffering a fracture in his leg and foot. As {{a result of his}} injuries, Busch was forced to miss the first 11 races of the Sprint Cup Series season.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} inside line {{had been the}} {{preferred}} line all night, Johnson chose to restart on the outside. The race restarted with two laps {{to go on the}} first green-white-checker attempt and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. took the lead from his teammate. They only made it half a lap before the caution flew for the eleventh time after Kurt Busch lost his momentum exiting turn 2, got turned by Clint Bowyer and slammed the inside <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on.|$|E
50|$|The nave {{is similar}} to the choir, in that it has four bays on the north and south aspects, buttressed in between. The windows, however, are similar to those on the {{transept}} gables. The side aisles were raised by some 10 feet in 1811 and were finished with castellation and pinnacles. The clerestory windows {{are similar to those of}} the aisles and the <b>wall</b> <b>heads</b> finished with cornicing.|$|R
60|$|Of course, the long-legged Blueskins {{could run}} faster than poor Cap'n Bill. Some of them soon got {{ahead of the}} old sailorman {{and came to the}} rope ladder which Trot had left {{dangling}} from the stone bench, where it hung down inside the City. The Blue soldiers promptly mounted this ladder and so gained the <b>wall,</b> <b>heading</b> off the fugitive. When Cap'n Bill came up, panting and all out of breath, the Blueskins seized him and held him fast.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{music video}} in the trilogy was {{released}} {{for the third}} single [...] "Pay No Mind" [...] on 20 February 2015. The video follows Icarus and Asteria as they decode secret messages and find {{an escape from the}} futuristic city. They successfully find an exit out of the city, and are last seen outside the <b>walls,</b> <b>heading</b> towards the tower in the distance. The music video for [...] "Pay No Mind" [...] was released on Leclercq's newly created Vevo channel.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{striking}} features {{of the church is}} the tower. The tower has a corbelled <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> from which angle broaches slope up to an octagonal battlemented top section. Although {{it has been argued that}} the original purpose of the tower was to be a watchtower or stronghold in case the town was attacked, Newman argues that the lack of arrow loops rules out its purpose as a defensive fortification. To the tower's northeast is stair turret and to the south side a buttressing mass.|$|E
50|$|The blackhouses on the Isle of Lewis have roofs {{thatched}} with {{cereal straw}} over turf and thick, stone-lined walls with an earthen core. Roof timbers {{rise from the}} inner face of the walls providing a characteristic ledge at the <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> (tobhta). This gives access to the roof for thatching. Both the animals and occupants shared the same door, living at different ends of the same space. Several long ranges, or rooms, were usually built alongside each other, each one having its own ridgeline giving them the very distinctive look of the Lewis blackhouse.|$|E
50|$|It {{is called}} Donjon de la {{duchesse}} Anne (Keep of the Duchess Anne), and stands 111 feet (34m) high near the Saint Louis gate. John V, Duke of Brittany built the keep in 1382-1383. The keep is formed by {{a union of}} two tall circular towers; a moat and drawbridge divides the keep from {{the outside of the}} ramparts {{as well as from the}} inside of the city, providing a stronghold both against outsiders and from the townspeople themselves. Extensive machicolations overhang the <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> providing defensive coverage of the base of the tower.|$|E
5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west <b>wall</b> <b>headed</b> west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|R

50|$|In the 2006 Supercheap Auto 1000 {{endurance}} race at Mount Panorama {{he had a}} major crash at around 200 km/h in The Chase. While attempting to overtake Nathan Pretty he ran wide into the dirt and could not brake in time and careered into a tyre <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on, flipping the car onto its side. Rescue teams had to cut the roof off the car {{in order to get}} him out. He was then taken to a nearby hospital and then flown to a hospital in Sydney for further scans. He broke his ankle and sternum in the crash and missed the remainder of the season.|$|E
5000|$|Don Watson {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} at the Chase during qualifying for the 1994 Bathurst 1000 when his Holden VP Commodore blew a brake disc when he attempted to slow for the kink, leaving him without brakes and limited steering. His car failed to slow and take the right hand kink, instead continuing at undiminished speed across the sand trap before hitting the tyre <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on and flipping on to its roof, coming to rest on the wall. Watson initially survived the crash but later died from his injuries in Bathurst Base Hospital. The accident occurred in front of former race winners Peter Brock and England's Win Percy, who described it as a [...] "major accident".|$|E
5000|$|Just up {{the hill}} from the pier the deserted village of Inivea remains as roofless stone ruins, an {{atmospheric}} relic of the Highland clearances. David Tennant (the former Tenth Doctor on Doctor Who) traced his family back to here in the BBC programme, Who {{do you think you}} are? Around 24 buildings of the township can be seen, several of them still standing to <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> level. These included houses and barns, with enclosures probably forming kailyards. A flattish area to the north, higher than the houses, shows signs of rig and furrow cultivation and a drying kiln. [...] A rocky knoll above the houses still has the remains of a dun, though many of its stones were taken to build the houses.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Z-plan {{part of the}} Castle of Colliston {{was erected}} in 1583. It consists of a main block with two round towers projecting at opposite corners, and a stair turret rising {{in one of the}} re-entrant angles between the main block and tower. This tower, which also houses the entrance to the castle, is corbelled out at the top to form a gabled watch-chamber. The plan is similar to Claypotts Castle and is amply provided with wide splayed gun-loops and circular shot-holes for defence. The <b>wall</b> <b>heads</b> and the entire upper storey were remodelled at several times and are not original.|$|R
5000|$|By August a {{troop of}} cavalry made it to Adobe Walls, under Lt. Frank D. Baldwin, with Masterson and Dixon as scouts, where a dozen men were still holed up. [...] "Some mischievous fellow had stuck an Indian's skull on each post of the corral gate." [...] The killing had not ended, however; one {{civilian}} was lanced by Indians while looking for wild plums along the Canadian River. The next day the soldiers and remaining men left Adobe <b>Walls,</b> <b>heading</b> south to join Gen. Nelson A. Miles' main command on Cantonement Creek. The Indians later [...] "burned the place to the ground." ...|$|R

50|$|The Valleydale Meats 500 {{was held}} on April 8 at Bristol International Raceway. Davey Allison elected not to pit on the final caution on lap 391 while the other front runners took on fresh tires and fuel. The gamble paid off with Allison leading {{the rest of the}} way, holding off Mark Martin for an eight-inch victory at Bristol. Darrell Waltrip fell from {{contention}} with a cut tire with 25 laps left, leaving Allison, Martin, and Ricky Rudd in a bumper-to-bumper battle to the finish. Sterling Marlin was spun out with half a lap to go by Rudd. This resulted in a physical confrontation inside Rudd's transporter after the race. The No. 4 of Ernie Irvan won the pole. Michael Waltrip had a terrible crash in the previous day's Busch Series race when he hit the <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on and his car collapsed into itself.|$|E
50|$|The UAW-Dodge 400 was run on March 2 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Kyle Busch, a Las Vegas native, won {{the pole}} and led 56 laps {{in the race}} before {{slipping}} to 11th. Matt Kenseth also ran strong during the race leading 70 laps and was running third with five laps to go when he was spun by Jeff Gordon. Gordons car hit hard against the inside retaining <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on at 180 miles per hour, and the wall {{did not have a}} SAFER barrier, this caused his cars radiator to fly out from the chassis into the path of oncoming traffic. Kenseth was able to recover from the spin without hitting anything. The wreck brought a red flag on lap 264 as track workers cleaned up, Jeff Gordon walked away sore from the wreck and made the point that SAFER barriers should be installed to the inside walls. Carl Edwards went on to win his second race in a row and the ninth of his career.|$|E
50|$|During the {{twilight}} of his career Marcis landed the first major Internet sponsor in Winston Cup, Prodigy Internet. This company sponsored Marcis as an associate and primary sponsor between 1994 and 1996, to where at the 1996 Daytona 500 Marcis was able to display a showcar, a first for his career. Marcis had a terrific accident at Pocono in June 1999 when, after getting loose in turn two on the 91st lap, he over corrected it {{to the right and}} slammed the <b>wall</b> <b>head</b> on at a high rate of speed, sending his car airborne and completely destroying it. In what was the worst crash of his career, he climbed out of the wreckage without injury. Marcis was frequently the test driver for the Richard Childress GM Goodwrench No. 3 of his friend Dale Earnhardt during the prime of his career. This agreement with Childress was made by Marcis to help fund his own race team, although he rarely had the time to test his own equipment. Marcis finished his career at the 2002 Daytona 500, setting a record for most Daytona 500s run with 33.|$|E
