5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E
5|$|Mark Pennant, aged 15, {{was arrested}} on 9 October 1985 and charged with murder two days later, the first person charged in {{connection}} with the killing. Born in England to West Indian parents, Pennant had been raised in the West Indies until he was nine, after which he returned to the UK; he was diagnosed with learning difficulties and was attending a special school. He was arrested and handcuffed at school, taken to Wood Green Police Station, and interviewed six times over the course of two days <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> in attendance. He told the police that he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice, and named Winston Silcott as the ringleader and several others, including another juvenile, Mark Lambie.|$|E
5|$|Waller taught Sunday school {{while in}} his early teens. When he was 15, he {{attended}} Williams College, from which he graduated in 1834. At Williams College, he came near to being expelled after arguing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher.</b> After Williams College, he considered being a lawyer, businessman or government worker. His brother William advised against his becoming a government worker or businessman, {{so he decided to}} become a minister. He attended the Princeton Theological Seminary starting in October 1834 and continuing for three years. Here he also came near to being expelled after a dispute with the teacher John Breckenridge. He graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1837 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Waller moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1838.|$|E

25|$|Teachers, and {{especially}} {{those who work with}} small children, should realize that students will interact more comfortably <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> when they are in same vertical plane.

On the other hand, a disciplinarian might put this information to use in order to gain psychological advantage over an unruly student.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{a long-running}} program {{in place at}} Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was {{introduced}} in the fall of 2006. The program consists of an 8-minute session between the first two periods during which students of all grades meet <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> to whom they were randomly assigned {{at the beginning of the}} year. More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to seek advice from an influential adult. Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions. Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents. Most students do not have their advisor as a classroom instructor. In most circumstances, students will have the same advisor for all four years of high school.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{studies found}} a {{different}} prevalence {{of sexual harassment}} by teachers. For example, {{in a survey of}} 148 high school graduates in North Carolina in 1989 the graduates were given a definition of sexual harassment and asked if they had experienced sexual harassment during their high school years. 43% reported inappropriate comments, looks, or gestures by a teacher, 17.5% reported sexual touching, and 13.5% indicated that they have had sexual intercourse <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher.</b> In another study college students were asked to recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% of the respondents reported having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers. Furthermore, more than 33% said that they knew of a sexual relationship between a high school student and a teacher.|$|E

CONCLUSIONS We have looked at a parametric scheme for learning to recognize patterns <b>with</b> <b>an</b> imperfect <b>teacher.</b> The proposed scheme is com-putationally feasible since the reproducing properties of density func-tions are used in learning about the unknown parameters. All three different learning situations, namely, learning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>teacher,</b> learning <b>with</b> <b>an</b> imperfect <b>teacher,</b> and learning without <b>a</b> <b>teacher,</b> can be handled by the proposed scheme.

25|$|Born in {{the village}} of Haimanale, Prahova County (the present-day I. L. Caragiale commune, Dâmboviţa County), Caragiale was educated in Ploieşti. During his early years, as he later indicated, he learned reading and writing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> at the Romanian Orthodox Church of Saint George. Soon after, he was taught {{literary}} Romanian by the Transylvanian-born Bazilie Dragoşescu (whose influence on his use of the language he was to acknowledge in one of his later works). At the age of seven, he witnessed enthusiastic celebrations of the Danubian Principalities' union, with the election of Moldavia's Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Prince of Wallachia; Cuza's subsequent reforms were to be an influence on the political choices Caragiale made in his old age. The new ruler visited his primary school later in 1859, being received with enthusiasm by Dragoşescu and all his pupils.|$|E
500|$|Context is {{one other}} element to framing that is essential. [...] "The {{participants}} will be bound by norms of good manners: through frequency and length of turns at talk, through topics avoided, through circumspection in regard to references about self, through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly-through all these means, rank and social relationship will be given their due."

[...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never fall in love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face".

She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E
