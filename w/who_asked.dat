5|$|About 40 {{years after}} the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in {{the reign of the}} fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the {{stand-in}} Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> him {{to take control of the}} island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.|$|E

5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed {{many social}} activities, {{including}} dancing and ice-skating, {{and was an}} expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, {{to the dismay of}} Queen Victoria, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> her to stop, but without success. Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality towards them.|$|E

In enumerative geometry, one is interested in {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of algebraic geometry. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 BCE by the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> how many circles in the plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, the {{solution to the problem of}} Apollonius is that there are eight such circles.|$|E
5|$|Modi's {{relationship}} with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (<b>who</b> <b>asked</b> Modi for tolerance {{in the aftermath}} of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need to walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E

After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces {{were in the process of}} retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8September 1945.|$|E

5|$|Baker {{separated}} from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children {{to pursue a career}} there after struggling to find work in Hollywood.

5|$|Born in Jakarta, Aristo became {{interested}} in films from a young age, {{though he did not}} consider a career in the industry until after graduating from university. At the suggestion of a friend, he wrote his first screenplay, Tak Pernah Kembali Sama. With feedback on the script from director Rudy Soedjarwo and after a period reading old, successful scripts, Aristo– at the time a film reviewer for a magazine– was able to befriend Hanung Bramantyo, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> him to write a script about brownies. The resulting film, a critical success, led to Aristo receiving numerous requests for screenplays, including several adaptations of novels. In 2010, he released his directorial debut, Jakarta Maghrib.|$|E
5|$|Coyle cold called Kristin Chenoweth's {{agent and}} {{proposed}} the part, which {{is different from}} her usual roles, and her agent {{said it was the}} exact part the actress was seeking. In order to film Into Temptation, Chenoweth took a five-day hiatus from her supporting role on the ABC television series Pushing Daisies. Brian Baumgartner, best known for his supporting role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy series The Office, was a regular theater performer in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area before joining that show. While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an upfront presentation, shortly after having finished filming the fourth season of The Office, Baumgartner was offered the Into Temptation script by Coyle, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> him to consider taking the role of Father Ralph O'Brien.

5|$|Despite {{his growing}} talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over {{starting}} their son on a musical career {{at such an}} early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, {{a professor at the}} Saint Petersburg Conservatory, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> to see Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague, and was working on his fourth, Undina. Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev's mother to have her son apply for admission to the Conservatory. He passed the introductory tests and enrolled that year.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{remained}} in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them—Head On and Shock Tactics. However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, who {{went out of business}} and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden. The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and they could not be paid for their concert performances. The band's last gig was at Reading Festival, after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.|$|E
