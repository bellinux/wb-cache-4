500|$|Once {{the second}} race was over, Burton drove to victory lane {{after winning the}} race. In the next press conference, he said, [...] "It’s great to be in Victory Lane but we’ve got {{to keep it in}} {{perspective}} that this wasn’t the Daytona 500. You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what’s going to happen on Sunday? We’re going to have 400 miles of some stuff happening, but then 100 miles of a lot of things happening. We’re going to have six or seven cautions in the last 100 laps, it’s going to be a short race to [...] chequered [...] and that’s what’s going to happen." [...] The second event took one hour, five minutes and 54 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.005 seconds. A crowd of 80,000 people attended the races. The races had a television audience of 3.303 million people.|$|E
2500|$|Aronowitz {{reported}} Jane saying, [...] "My father can't {{articulate the}} way he works. He just can't do it. He's not even conscious of what he does, and it made him nervous for {{me to try to}} articulate what I was trying to do. And I sensed that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't want to hear about it.' He didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Clinton {{embarked}} on her longest trip yet, {{to a number}} of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, [...] "Wait, you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." [...] The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested {{there might have been a}} mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what [...] "Mr Obama" [...] thought.|$|E
50|$|Wilson: Well you see, sir, he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to...</b> <b>tell</b> him a story.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Aunt Barbara," [...] she said; [...] "I {{was very}} self-willed; I {{ought not to}} have fancied things, nor said you used <b>me</b> ill, and <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well." [...] She put {{her hand}} on his arm and he felt it tremble there, while she palpitated, [...] "We are all so glad you could go on to Rotterdam. My mother <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Looking at {{him with}} amazement that is almost terror.] You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Robert that the woman you {{expected}} was not Mrs. Cheveley, but myself? That it was I whom you thought was concealed in a room in your house, at half-past ten o’clock at night? You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} you would <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them. Shall we go now at once?" [...] said Deronda, much {{relieved}} by this unwavering compliance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should smile you didn't," [...] {{retorted}} Bo. [...] "Wish {{you could}} just have seen your eyes. Nell, do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you something? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simple things," [...] complained Jessie to her mother, [...] "that I {{used to do}} when I was {{no bigger}} than Essie, and yet she is always teasing one about how and why! She <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> why I carried one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, say," [...] {{she broke}} off suddenly, [...] "pa {{wants to see you}} about something. He <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>to</b> come down to-night." [...] She was dusting the floor at the moment, while he was moving the furniture. [...] "I wonder what he wants?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I disturb you, uncle?" [...] she asked; she did {{not call}} him great-uncle, because that, she rightly said, was ridiculous; and now, {{as part of the}} informality, she went on without waiting for him to answer, [...] "Because, you know, you <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what I thought of your last story; and I've just read it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you all I {{think of}} you, and that isn't good for you, dad--not too often. It would be you {{who would have}} swelled head then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} you were irresistible? How could I have sent you away? But you! What made {{you come back to}} me with your very heart on your lips?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you?” I pursued with interest. “It {{would be}} utterly {{impossible}} to an American girl—I mean unperverted, and that’s the whole point—to talk as you’re {{talking to me}} now.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My mother <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you," [...] she said, [...] "that {{she hopes}} you have begun your poem. She says every one ought to write poetry.... All my {{relations}} write poetry," [...] she went on. [...] "I can't bear {{to think of}} it sometimes--because, of course, it's none of it any good. But then one needn't read it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not long since, I {{was coming}} home in the dark when I found Lance talking to Tom Shanks in the wood. Lance said he had caught the fellow poaching, and I thought it strange they should talk quietly. I {{suspected}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Jim, but I did not. His grudge against Jim had been getting worse." ...|$|R
60|$|She now <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{her where}} I {{had really been}} and what had {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I gave her a sketch of my adventures. Of course I could not enter deeply into particulars, for that would make too long a story, but I told her where I had stopped, and my accounts of the bear and the horse were deeply interesting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{as the young}} man grasped his hand, [...] "you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you why your eyes are bloodshot, why your cheeks burn, and your hand is dry and hot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [With a smile.] Did you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} in so many words? I admire you, and I trust you. I should be very happy if George could grow into so brave and honest a man as you.|$|E
6000|$|... "That--I {{beg your}} pardon. I've {{no right to}} call him names." [...] The young fellow halted, {{and looked at her}} downcast face. [...] "Well, do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you to take him? That is too much. I {{did n't know you were}} cruel." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{got over}} my {{difficulties}} with the ladies, I found more difficulties {{waiting for me}} when I {{went back to my}} own room. In came Penelope--with the natural sweetness of women--to kiss and make it up again; and--with the natural curiosity of women--to ask another question. This time she only <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her what was the matter with our second housemaid, Rosanna Spearman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Appleby <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} that young feller, Ward Porton, ain't goin' {{to be with}} 'em no more," [...] {{announced}} Tad Rason to Dave. [...] "He says the young feller writ a letter sayin' {{that he was on}} the track of his parentage, and he guessed as how he'd have plenty of money of his own when he could prove who he was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kate, half ashamed, but {{far more}} exultant, and hanging down her head; [...] "I came from London--I came by myself. My aunt <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story, and--and I have run away. O Charlie! take me home!" [...] and with a fresh access of alarm, she again threw her arms round him, as if to gain his {{protection}} from some enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} to marry some day," [...] she said dreamily--"both of us. We have so much money {{that we will not}} be allowed to {{disappoint}} the public. Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the kind of a man I could love, Sis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a lady's secret? But {{in such a}} case as {{this the}} truth is always the best. She does wish it, with all her heart,--as much as any woman ever wished for anything. You need have no doubt about her loving you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you? How I went {{twice a week}} to eat free dinners! How I took charity! How I was hungry! There was a rich {{cousin of}} my mother's--I {{used to go to}} him. I didn't like it. But if you're {{starving}} in the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lander {{took the}} word, [...] "Well, I wouldn't {{say it to}} everybody. But you're our doctor, and I guess you won't mind it. We don't like the way Mrs. Milray acted to Clementina, in the ship, and we don't want to be beholden to any of her folks. I don't know as Clementina <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you just what it was, and I won't; but that's the long and sho't of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{started from}} 'Frisco {{that night on}} the boat ready to fling myself into anything--or the river!" [...] she went on hurriedly. [...] "There {{was a man in}} the cabin who noticed <b>me,</b> and began <b>to</b> hang around. I thought he knew who I was,--had seen me on the posters; and as I didn't feel like foolin', I told him so. But he wasn't that kind. He said he saw I was in trouble and <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him all." ...|$|R
6000|$|The solemn man-servant, who was {{now also}} sleepy, but who saved the respect due the young ladies by putting his hand over a yawn when he let them in, brought Cornelia a letter which {{he seemed to have}} been keeping on his {{professional}} salver. [...] "A letter for you, miss. It came about an hour after you went out. The messenger said he wasn't to wait for an answer, and Mrs. Maybough thought she needn't send it to you at the Synthesis. She <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, miss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She has {{got such}} an {{artificial}} mind," [...] said Mrs. Almond, who always enjoyed {{an opportunity to}} discuss Lavinia's peculiarities with her brother. [...] "She didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that she had asked me about Mr. Townsend; but I told her I would. She always wants to conceal everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never forget}} it," [...] she answered, {{and for the}} first time her change to a more natural tone helped him to believe in himself and his own judgment. [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you how {{grateful}} I am, I might try, but it would be a very hard task." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that's very well. A girl can be {{a hypocrite}} if she pleases, and perhaps she ought. Of course I shall be a hypocrite to all the world except you. I {{tell you what it}} is, Patty;--you make me tell you everything, and say that of course you and I are to tell everything,--and then you scold me. Don't you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you everything?" ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR LITTLE JIMMIE,--Your {{big brother}} havin' hurt his hand, <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that otherways he is all hunky and A1. He says he don't forget you and little Cissy, you bet! and he's sendin' money to old Ricketts {{straight}} off. He says don't you and Cissy mind whether school keeps or {{not as long}} as big Brother Dick holds the lines. He says he'd have written before, but he's bin follerin' up a lead mighty close, and expects to strike it rich in a few days.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not certain}} if the dream {{would not be}} more {{interesting}} to you," [...] said the voice laughingly. [...] "But I think your hostess is already saying 'good-by.' You know everybody goes at once at this kind of party; the ladies don't retire first, and the gentlemen join them afterwards. In another moment we'll ALL be switched off; but Sir William <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that his coachman will drive you to your uncle's, unless you prefer {{to try and make}} yourself comfortable for the night here. Good-by!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Rupert, {{slightly}} recovering his dimples and his readiness, [...] "Johnny, yer, <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> ye something. Ef he wasn't {{the most}} original self-cocking, God-forsaken liar in Injin Spring--ef he didn't lie awake in his crib mornin's to invent lies fer the day, I wouldn't mind tellin' ye, and would hev told you before. However, since you ask, {{and since you}} think you saw somebody around the school-house, Johnny yer allows that Seth Davis is spyin' round and followin' ye wherever you go, and he dragged <b>me</b> down yer <b>to</b> see it. He says he saw him doggin' ye." ...|$|R
