5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} the pennant number L134 during 1973. At {{the start of}} the year, Sydney was marked for a potential deployment to Mururoa in support of a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate sent to protest French nuclear testing at the atoll. The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN's dedicated replenishment oiler, , was undergoing refits. The Australian government did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> warship until all other avenues of protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant Supplys refit was finished before Sydney was deployed, and the oiler was sent instead. Sydney visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May.|$|E
500|$|Hays and others, such as Samuel Goldwyn, {{obviously}} {{felt that}} motion pictures presented {{a form of}} escapism that served a palliative effect on American moviegoers. Goldwyn had coined the famous dictum, [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> message, call Western Union" [...] in the pre-Code era. However, the MPPDA took the opposite stance when questioned about certain so-called [...] "message" [...] films before Congress in 1932, claiming the audiences' desire for realism led to certain unsavory social, legal, and political issues being portrayed in film.|$|E
500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you all right for boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> message to the enemy that we were in any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E

500|$|Smith's {{return to}} the U.S. on July 22, 1983, was celebrated {{by the people of}} Maine with roses, a red carpet, and a {{limousine}} and her popularity continued to grow in her native country. Some critics at the time remained skeptical, believing Smith was unwittingly serving as an instrument of Soviet propaganda. In December 1983, continuing in her role as [...] "America's Youngest Ambassador", she was invited to Japan, where she met with the Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and attended the Children's International Symposium in Kobe. In her speech at the symposium, she suggested that Soviet and American leaders exchange granddaughters for two weeks every year, arguing that a president [...] "wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> bomb to a country his granddaughter would be visiting". Her trip inspired other exchanges of child goodwill ambassadors, including a visit by the eleven-year-old Soviet child Katya Lycheva to the United States. Later, Smith wrote a book called Journey to the Soviet Union whose cover shows her at Artek, her favorite part of the Soviet trip.|$|E

6000|$|The speech brought Mysie to {{the verge}} of tears. Aunt Jane's sharp ears heard it, {{and she looked at}} the head of the table, expecting to hear a rebuke; but Lady Merrifield turned a deaf ear on that side.

60|$|But {{that risk}} must, of course, be run. Blakeney's former lodging {{was the one}} place that Armand would know of to which he could {{send a message to}} his chief, if he wanted to do so.

You'll stay put, until we see if we can ship you out with the construction boys to the Calgary side. If that plan won't go, we'll push across the range for the big park valley and try to run you south.
