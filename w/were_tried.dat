5|$|Further {{activities}} of Operation Labrador were abandoned in September, after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb, and confiscated {{documents related to}} the operation. The authorities took nearly a month to analyze the captured documents, allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee. Fifteen others were arrested {{in connection with the}} attack, but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange. Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador <b>were</b> <b>tried</b> in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted.

5|$|Additional SS {{trials and}} {{convictions}} followed. Many defendants attempted to exculpate themselves using the excuse {{that they were}} merely following superior orders, which they had to obey unconditionally {{as part of their}} sworn oath and duty. The courts did not find this to be a legitimate defense. A trial of 40 SS officers and guards from Auschwitz took place in Kraków in November 1947. Most were found guilty, and 23 received the death penalty. In addition to those tried by the Western allies, an estimated 37,000 members of the SS <b>were</b> <b>tried</b> and convicted in Soviet courts. Sentences included hangings and long terms of hard labor. Piotr Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, estimates that of the 70,000 members of the SS involved in crimes in concentration camps, only about 1,650 to 1,700 <b>were</b> <b>tried</b> after the war. The International Military Tribunal declared the SS a criminal organization in 1946.|$|E
