40|$|In RF and {{microwave}} engineering, the vector network analyzers (VNAs) {{are commonly used}} for network analysis with great accuracy and precision. VNAs are complex and versatile instruments employed to characterize active and passive networks. The network characterization is {{defined in terms of}} scattering parameters (S-parameters). The S-parameters are ratios of wave quantities which provide information about reflection and transmission characteristics of the device under test (DUT). The VNA measurements are associated with different sources of errors; mainly classified as systematic, random and drift errors. During a VNA calibration procedure, the systematic errors are characterized {{and most of them are}} mathematically removed afterwards. The other sources of errors can possibly be minimized, however, they affect the S-parameter measurements and become different sources of uncertainty associated with the measurements. Therefore, the uncertainty analysis is also an integral part while doing measurements with VNAs. The aim of this thesis is to perform VNA measurements and uncertainty assessments in both coaxial and waveguide test-set environments. The frequency of interest ranges from few MHz up to Terahertz frequency band. The uncertainty analysis is performed both numerically and analytically. The uncertainty sources considered are the definitions of the calibration standards, VNA noise, repeatability and drift. The different uncertainty sources are linearly propagated to compute the final uncertainties associated with the measurements. The dimensional characterization of standards is also carried out. The thesis is based on several S-parameter measurement and uncertainty assessment comparisons. The research work presented in first four chapters has been carried out at Politecnico di Torino and Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM), Italy. The fifth and sixth chapter described the research activities conducted at National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK. While the seventh chapter presented the research work carried out at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany. In the first chapter, a general introduction to the VNA measurements and uncertainty assessment is presented. The different measurement errors, calibration standards and the calibration techniques are also described. A brief description is also provided for the classification of the uncertainty components and the S-parameter uncertainty representation. An informal bilateral comparison concerning the S-parameter measurements and uncertainty evaluation at millimeter frequencies (50 - 110 GHz) is presented in the second chapter. This comparison has been conducted successfully between National Metrology Centre (NMC) A*STAR, Singapore and INRIM, Italy. The aim of this comparison was to assess the compatibility between high frequency measurement systems at both institutes. The electromagnetic computations based on mechanical characterization of the <b>waveguide</b> <b>shim</b> standards are also presented. In the third chapter, a comparison of different S-parameter calibration techniques at millimeter frequencies (75 - 110 GHz) is described. All the calibration standards were mechanically measured and different calibration techniques were used for tracing S-parameter measurements to the International System of Units (SI). The aim of this comparison was to analyze the efficiency of two different VNA calibration techniques in terms of S-parameter measurements and related uncertainty. The metrological comparison of two different software packages, VNA Tools II and MMS 4, is described in fourth chapter. VNA Tools II is developed by Bundesamt f√ºr Metrologie (METAS), Switzerland. While, the Multiport Measurement Software version 4 (MMS 4) is commercial software package developed by High Frequency Engineering (HFE), Switzerland. Both software packages are based on different mathematical models and have different implementation. However, a comparison is important to validate the reliability of both software packages for the uncertainty contributions considered. This comparison will also allow the metrologists to have more confidence in using these packages for S-parameter measurements and uncertainty analysis. In fifth and sixth chapter, the connection repeatability investigation and calibration comparison of VNA in WR 05 waveguide (140 - 220 GHz) are presented respectively. The connection repeatability investigation is important to analyze the variability of the repeated measurements and flanges' alignment mechanisms especially at these frequencies because of the very small dimensions of the waveguide apertures. In calibration comparison, the behaviour of different calibration techniques is demonstrated. Finally, in the seventh chapter, the suitable verification artefacts to check the performance of VNAs including their applicability to coaxial and waveguide systems are described. The waveguide verification standards considered for analysis are: WR- 05 (140 - 220 GHz) and WR- 03 (220 - 325 GHz) cross-guides and a custom-made WR- 03 (220 - 325 GHz) circular iris section. Moreover, a novel type N coaxial verification standard architecture (DC- 18 GHz) based on an air-line has been designed, fabricated and analyze...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} were performed in which return loss and insertion loss of waveguide test assemblies {{in the frequency}} range from 325 to 508 GHz were measured by use of a swept-frequency two-port vector network analyzer (VNA) test set. The {{experiments were}} part of a continuing effort to develop means of characterizing passive and active electronic components and systems operating at ever increasing frequencies. The waveguide test assemblies comprised WR- 2. 2 end sections collinear with WR- 3. 3 middle sections. The test set, assembled from commercially available components, included a 50 -GHz VNA scattering- parameter test set and external signal synthesizers, augmented with recently developed frequency extenders, and further augmented with attenuators and amplifiers as needed to adjust radiofrequency and intermediate-frequency power levels between the aforementioned components. The tests included line-reflect-line calibration procedures, using WR- 2. 2 <b>waveguide</b> <b>shims</b> as the "line" standards and waveguide flange short circuits as the "reflect" standards. Calibrated dynamic ranges somewhat greater than about 20 dB for return loss and 35 dB for insertion loss were achieved. The measurement data of the test assemblies were found to substantially agree with results of computational simulations...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports on}} a 248 GHz HBV (Heterostructure Barrier Varactors) -varactor quasi-optical {{multiplier}} array with a {{maximum output power of}} 18 mW and a corresponding conversion efficiency of 2 %. The module utilizes a mechanically compact and simple shim system, combining the large array power handling capability with the convenience of waveguide interfaced circuits. At the same time this approach offers excellent power and frequency scalability. The multiplier is based on a 12 by 6 element, 72 in total, planar 2 D HBV varactor array. The diodes are fabricated on a three barrier InGaAs/InAlAs material system on InP as carrier substrate. Easch diode consist of two 20 um^ 2 serially connected mesas, yielding a total of six barrier per diode. The HBV diodes are coupled to a uniform dipole array through which the power is coupled in and out. One HBV diode and the corresponding dipole make up a square unit cell with a side of 211 um. The chip measures 2, 54 x 1, 27 mm^ 2, fitting inside a standard WR 10 waveguide. The complete module consists of three parts, the 2 D HBV array, a combined output filter and output matching slab and an input matching slab. A rhombic aperture frequency selective surface is used as the uutput bandpass filter and the quartz filter substrate also serves as a matching slab for the output tone. On the input a piece of InP substrate is used to match the incoming pump signal to the diodes. The components are mounted inside two WR- 10 <b>waveguide</b> <b>shims,</b> providing an easy assembly and a modular system. The current version of the multiplier module produces 18 mW at 248 GHz but a significant increase in output power and efficiency is expected with a new output matching network and more pump power. Recent measurement results will be presented together with a detailed discussion regarding the design, pointing out advantages and challenges compared to more traditional approaches to frequency multiplier design in the frequency range. Future improvements and challenges will also be covered...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) {{scattering}} parameters (S-parameters) {{play an important}} role to characterise RF signal transmission and reflection of active and passive devices such as transmission lines, components, and small-signal amplifiers. Vector network analysers (VNAs) are employed as instrumentation for such measurements. During the last years, the upper frequency limit of this instrumentation has been extended up to several hundreds of GHz for waveguide measurements. Calibration and verification procedures are obligatory prior to the VNA measurement to achieve accurate results and/or to obtain traceability to the International System of Units (SI). Usually, verification is performed by measuring well-matched devices with known S-parameters such as attenuators or short precision <b>waveguide</b> sections (<b>shims).</b> In <b>waveguides,</b> especially above 110 GHz, such devices may not exist and/or are not traceably calibrated. In some cases, e. g. filter networks, the devices under test (DUT) are partly highly reflective. This paper describes the dependency of the S-parameters a) on the calibration procedure, b) on the applied torque to the flange screws during the mating process of the single waveguide elements. It describes further c) how highly-reflective devices (HRD) can be used to verify a calibrated VNA, and d) how a measured attenuation at several hundreds of GHz can be substituted by a well-known coaxial attenuation at 279 MHz, the intermediate frequency (IF) of the VNA, to verify the linearity. This work is a contribution towards traceability and to obtain knowledge about the measurement uncertainty of VNA instrumentation in the millimetre-wave range...|$|R
