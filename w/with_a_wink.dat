500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life.

In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wink</b> and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people.

2500|$|The {{fighting}} between the IRA, UVF and British Army resumed the following day. According {{to the book}} UVF (1997), British soldiers were moved into {{the ground floor of}} the abandoned flats while the UVF snipers continued firing from the flats above them. The soldiers and UVF were both firing into Ballymurphy, and according to the book both were [...] "initially unaware of each other". However, according to a UVF gunman involved in the battle, there was collusion between the UVF and British soldiers. He alleged that a British foot patrol caught a UVF unit hiding guns in a bin but ignored their cache <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wink</b> when the UVF member said the guns were [...] "rubbish". According to Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald, Jim Hanna — who later became UVF Chief of Staff — was one of the snipers operating from Springmartin during the battle. Jim Hanna told journalist Kevin Myers that, during the clashes, a British Army patrol helped Hanna and two other UVF members get into Corry's Timber Yard, which overlooked the Catholic Ballymurphy estate. When a British Army Major heard of the incident he ordered his men to withdraw, but they did not arrest the UVF members, who were allowed to hold their position. The IRA's Ballymurphy unit was returning fire at an equal rate and some 400 strike marks were later counted on the flats.|$|E
2500|$|Reinhart's {{style has}} been noted for its {{infusion}} of mainstream pop with elements of retro-pop and traditional jazz.

Reinhart's debut album was also distinguished for its fusion of various musical genres, such as pop, R, rock and roll, and soul into a combination that {{has been described as}} [...] "timeless and irresistibly fresh." [...] Reinhart has crafted her music to reflect [...] "that raw musicianship that means so much to me." [...] Of her first album she describes [...] "it wasn't about trying so hard; it was all about pure feeling and energy. To me that's the important stuff. That's what I want to bring back into music today." [...] Jason Scott of Popdust noted Reinhart for the [...] "slinky way she delivers a lyric... an unfettered, daring confidence masked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wink</b> and a smile." [...] In a review for Better, he also opined that [...] "her framework has always been the jazz standards of the ’30s and ’40s with a lacquered coat of ’60s disco, with a bit of soul painted on for equal measure." [...] Zach Dionne for Fuse described Reinhart as a [...] "soulful, jazzy, altogether genre-defying singer-songwriter." [...] Of Reinhart's style, Atwood Magazine noted [...] "from the [...] bluesy rocker-chick during her Idol era to her more pop-driven Motown vibe in her first album Listen Up! to her current jazz-funk fusion sound on her latest album Better, Reinhart has proven time and time again that she is no jack-of-all-trades, but the master and supreme innovator of each one." ...|$|E
