25|$|In {{the series}} Astonishing X-Men, a {{flashback}} shows that Frost's {{survival of the}} destruction of Genosha was due to Cassandra Nova creating Frost's secondary mutation as part of a scheme to infiltrate the X-Men as a sleeper agent. A guilt ridden Frost creates psychic manifestations of a new Hellfire Club and proceeds to take down the X-Men one by one by showing them their deepest fears. Later on it is revealed that Frost's survivor's guilt is being exacerbated by Cassandra Nova who had placed a glimmer of her mind in Frost's before being trapped in the body of Stuff, and that Nova had even tricked Frost into thinking that she had been complicit in the destruction of Genosha. Kitty with aid from Cyclops, Blindfold, Hisako Ichiki, and Frost herself eventually prevent Nova from transferring her mind into Hisako. Everyone present is then suddenly teleported onto a S.W.O.R.D. ship headed towards the Breakworld. The arc concludes with Kitty trapped in the bullet heading towards Earth and the team trying to find various <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the Earth and save Kitty. Frost keeps in telepathic contact with Kitty, trying to reassure her, even offering to psionically sedate her. Kitty sacrifices herself, phasing the bullet through Earth. In the aftermath, the X-Men are uncertain of Kitty's fate, believing her to either be dead or at least phased into part of the runaway bullet. Frost is devastated.|$|E

2500|$|Seeking other <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> money, the Board {{obtained}} permission in November 1931 to {{have only}} a single conductor on duty per tram regardless {{of the number of}} trailers. By mutual agreement with the union in February 1932, it was decided on a temporary system of a reduction in hours for all traffic staff rather than terminating the employment of 11 men that had become redundant. When the men refused to agree to a renewal of this arrangement the Board dismissed 12 of its staff. A rally in support of the tramway men was held on May Day at which it was decided to strike from the following Wednesday if the notices of dismissal were not rescinded. The Board warned its staff that if they refused to go to work on Wednesday that they would be dismissed, and also advertised for [...] "volunteers" [...] to apply for permanent positions with the Board. Despite offers of negotiation from the union, the Board remained implacable in its position.|$|E
2500|$|The tomb of Nahum is {{supposedly}} inside the synagogue at Alqosh, {{although there are}} other places outside Iraq which also lay claim to being the original [...] "Elkosh" [...] from which Nahum hailed. Alqosh was abandoned by its Jewish population in 1948, when they were expelled, and the synagogue that purportedly houses the tomb {{is now in a}} poor structural state, {{to the extent that the}} tomb itself is in danger of destruction. The tomb underwent basic repairs in 1796. When all Jews were compelled to flee Alqosh in 1948, the iron keys to the tomb were handed to an Assyrian man by the name of Sami Jajouhana. Few Jews visit the historic site, yet Jajouhana continues to keep the promise he made with his Jewish friends, and looks after the tomb. A team of US/UK construction engineers, led by Huw Thomas, is currently planning <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the building and the tomb. Money had been allocated for proposed renovation in 2008. The tomb is currently in disrepair and may be threatened by the rise of ISIS in Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{concession}} {{came up for}} renewal in 1926, the Railways Department offered an indefinite extension, which the Board accepted. [...] However, by 1930 patronage of the service to the railway station had dropped to levels that were no longer commercially viable. [...] With {{the onset of the}} Great Depression, the Board sought <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> on costs, and considered the possibility of discontinuing the Papanui railway station connection. [...] In 1932 the matter was examined and a passenger count revealed that an average of 96 passengers used 76 trips to the station weekly, but the Boards costs for providing this service were not passed on to the passengers (no extra was charged for going to the railway station vs. Papanui). [...] It therefore decided to terminate services at the Papanui Township. [...] This concerned the Railways Department {{to the extent that they}} waived the annual fee for use of their land at the railway station to keep the service going. [...] Use of the railway station service continued to decline to the point where passengers had almost completely abandoned it, and a new timetable introduced on 16 April 1934 for the Papanui tramline eliminated the railway station extension.|$|E

2500|$|The Harbour Commission {{appealed to}} City Council to allow jets and a fixed link {{suggesting}} that passenger levels would {{increase from the}} current 150,000 to over 1.2 million by 2002, turning the airport into a [...] "money maker", while Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall requested that former mayor David Crombie report on <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the airport without harming the waterfront. The City Council's economic development committed began holding public hearings on the airport, hearing over 60 speakers. Backers of the expansion advocated it on economic reasons, {{and the idea that}} expansion was necessary to keep the airport open now that subsidies had ceased. Waterfront residents such as those living in the Harbourfront district and on the island, opposed the increases in noise and pollution an expansion would entail. The Harbourfront district residents suggested that the 1983 agreement should be upheld as they had bought residences in the area, based on that expectation. After 10 1/2 hours of speeches and debate, the committee voted 11–4 in favour of building a bridge to the airport paid for by the private sector and to adopt new noise standards that would allow new jets at the airport. A bridge would still require an environmental assessment. The full Toronto City Council voted against allowing jets, and voted against starting an environmental assessment for a bridge, and put off the island airport for further study.|$|E
2500|$|Buffalo National Park, {{established}} in 1909 in Wainwright, Alberta, received its first shipment of 325 bison on June 16, 1909 after being transferred from Elk Island National Park. [...] The national park {{was created to}} preserve the plains bison {{that were on the}} brink of extinction in the mid-1880s mostly due to systematic slaughter, increased settlement and advances in hunting practices. [...] After the arrival of numerous shipments, the bison population at Buffalo National Park increased rapidly and exceeded 2,000 by 1916, resulting in the largest bison herd in the world. [...] The rapid growth of the bison population appears to have been one indicator of the saving effort's success despite having little information of, or precedent for, efficient <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> and increase wild animal populations other than in the mountain parks. [...] The transfer of plains bison from the overpopulated range in Buffalo National Park to the understocked range in Wood Buffalo National Park resulted in hybridization between the species and the infection of the northern herds with tuberculosis and brucellosis. [...] Not until the 1930s would park and wildlife managers begin to study the relationships within species and with their environment, and ideas of carrying capacity, so administrators were treading in unfamiliar territory when the reserve was established. [...] The placement of the park area on poor agricultural land coupled with an overpopulation problem led to the degradation of the range and the spread of disease. [...] Experiments such as crossbreeding bison and domestic cattle and commercializing the herd were unsuccessful. The Canadian Parks Branch lacked sufficient funding to run the park or to remedy the crises the bison faced. After deciding to close the park in 1939, the Department of National Defence (Canada) repurposed the area for military training and the bison disappeared once again. [...] During its thirty-one years of activity, Buffalo National Park {{played an important role in}} saving the plains bison from extinction.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. The text implies, that {{at certain}} times the most godly {{man in the world}} may be hard put to it by the sin that dwelleth in him; yea, so hard put to it, as {{that there can be no}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> himself from a fall, but by imploring heaven and the throne of grace for help. This is called the needy time, the time when the wayfaring man that knocked at David's door shall knock at ours (2 Sam 12); or when we are got into the sieve into which Satan did get Peter (Luke 22:31); or when those fists are about our ears that were about Paul's; and when that thorn pricks us that Paul said was in his flesh (2 Cor 12:7,8). But why, or how comes it to pass, that the godly are so hard put to it at these times, but because there is in them, that is, in their flesh, no good thing, but {{consequently}} all aptness to close in with the devil and his suggestions, to the overthrow of the soul? But now here we are presented with a throne of grace, unto which, as presented with a throne of grace, unto which, as David says, we must 'continually resort'; and that is the way to obtain relief, and to find help in time of need (Psa 71:3).|$|E
