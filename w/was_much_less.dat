5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film was extremely negative. The acting, story, and characters attracted the most criticism {{as well as the}} film's setting on a slow-moving cruise ship, which <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> thrilling than Speed setting on a fast-moving bus. The film was also a financial disappointment, earning $164 million worldwide against a budget of $110 million. It was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards, and won the award for Worst Re-Make or Sequel.|$|E
5|$|Deane Malott, {{who became}} {{president}} of Cornell in 1951, <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> sympathetic, and instructed Morrison to curtail all activities beyond his academic field. Morrison agreed {{to do so in}} 1954. Nonetheless, {{he was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|His second {{first-class}} {{season with}} Middlesex <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> successful than the first; Kartik took only 16 wickets at 34.06 in seven matches, with a best of 4/101 against Derbyshire. He scored 161 runs at 20.12 with a best of 44 against Warwickshire. His one-day form was also lean, yielding six wickets at 33.00 in six matches.|$|E

5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> arid {{than it is}} today. Large {{regions of}} Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and {{this is also the}} period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E
5|$|The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker {{invented the}} first soluble forms of {{cellulose}} acetate in 1903, which <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> flammable than cellulose nitrate. It was eventually made available in a powder form from which it was readily injection moulded. Arthur Eichengrün developed the first injection moulding press in 1919. In 1939, Arthur Eichengrün patented the injection moulding of plasticised cellulose acetate.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolution}} was widely accepted in scientific circles {{within a few}} years of the publication of Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its driving mechanism <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism.|$|E
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial hemisphere. The comet <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> impressive to southern hemisphere observers {{than it had been}} in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> influential. Until the mid-1940s it {{was focused on}} younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E
5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E

5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the busy preceding season, this season had much lower activity than usual, with only 36days {{in which there was}} a tropical storm or cyclone active; this was 17 less than normal. However, the number of days with a tropical cyclone was slightly above normal at 15. In general, the southern hemisphere as a whole had the least active season since 1954. There were only five named storms, only the fifth such time {{since the beginning of the}} satellite era in 1967. As most storms formed toward the eastern periphery of the basin, damage <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than the preceding year.|$|E
5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver brooch was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E

5|$|North of Guam, Chataan {{affected}} Rota with 74km/h (46mph) sustained {{winds and}} gusts to 120km/h (75mph) at the island's airport. Rainfall <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than {{elsewhere in the}} typhoon's path, and a 24-hour total of 38.6mm (1.52in) was reported at Rota's airport. The storm inflicted heavy damage to crops and fisheries, and 60% of farmers reported a total loss. Chataan also damaged roads on the island, many due to fallen trees. Nine huts were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $2.7million.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{response}} <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> effusive.

Our World was the lowest rated prime time show of the 104 that aired during the 1986-7 television season, bringing in only a 6.5/10 rating/share. One segment of the public who responded very favorably to the program was teachers, who assigned Our World as homework. ABC created a study guide for the show, mailing out some 39,000 copies a month to educators and fans.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than initially anticipated. In all, damages {{from the storm}} amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in a ditch after being swept away by flood waters.|$|E
