In preparation for the enrollment period, Burwell hired additional staff to coordinate operations.

The Secretary noted the <b>website</b> had been reconfigured, {{reducing the number of}} screens from over seventy to just over a dozen <b>website</b> pages, {{in an effort to make}} the application process smoother.|$|E

After that are discussed chosen methods. Web sites are evaluated by user testing with eye-tracking, SWET, and trunk testing. Based on these tests, <b>websites</b> are rated and evaluated.

40|$|Abstract — In {{recent times}} machine {{learning}} algorithms are used for internet traffic classification. The infinite number of <b>websites</b> in the internet world can be classified into different categories in different ways. In educational institutions, these <b>websites</b> can be classified into two categories, educational <b>websites</b> and non-educational <b>websites.</b> Educational <b>websites</b> are used to acquire knowledge, to explore educational topics while the non-educational <b>websites</b> are used for entertainment and {{to keep in touch}} with people. In case of blocking these non-educational <b>websites</b> students use proxy <b>websites</b> to unblock them. Therefore, in educational institutes for the optimum use of network resources the use of non-educational and proxy <b>websites</b> should be banned. In this paper, we use five ML classifiers Naïve Bayes, RBF, C 4. 5, MLP and Bayes Net to classify the educational and non-educational <b>websites.</b> Results show that Bayes Net gives best performance in both full feature and reduced feature data sets for intended classification of internet traffic in terms of classification accuracy, recall and precision values as compared to other classifiers.

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To investigate {{the quality and}} content of dental practice <b>websites</b> by constructing an audit framework based on regulations, guidance and expert advice, and applying this framework to {{a random sample of}} UK dental practices' <b>websites.</b> Methods An audit framework was constructed and in-depth data collected from a random sample of 150 UK dental practices. Results Thirty-five percent of dental practices in this study were found to have <b>websites.</b> Compliance with rules and regulations regarding dental practice <b>websites</b> was generally poor. Use of advised content for practice promotion was variable. Many <b>websites</b> were poorly optimised. Eighty-nine percent of the <b>websites</b> advertised tooth whitening, despite the issues surrounding its legality; 25 % of the <b>websites</b> advertised Botox even though advertising of prescription only medicines is illegal. Some <b>websites</b> gave misleading information about the specialist status of their dentists. Conclusions Those responsible for dental practice <b>websites</b> {{need to be aware of}} a wide range of regulations and guidance, and are advised to follow expert advice on content and optimisation in order to maximise the potential of their <b>websites...</b>|$|R

30|$|We measure {{exposure}} to Craigslist {{with the number}} of job-related postings on Craigslist and the number of years since Craigslist’s entry in the market in which competing <b>websites</b> operate. We code employment <b>websites</b> that served a particular US state as competing with Craigslist if Craigslist entered at least one city in that state. For <b>websites</b> serving the entire USA, we consider two treatments. In the first treatment, these <b>websites</b> are coded as competing with Craigslist once Craigslist entered its first city. In the second, these <b>websites</b> are coded as not competing with Craigslist. To control for heterogeneity across employment <b>websites,</b> we control for time-varying website-level attributes (e.g., the number of different types of postings that the <b>websites</b> hosted, services offered by the <b>websites,</b> age) and add website-level fixed effects. We also include controls for attributes of the markets that employment <b>websites</b> served (e.g., unemployment rate, job creation rate, educational attainment, Internet access by residents, population size and density, fraction of workers employed in information sector).|$|R
