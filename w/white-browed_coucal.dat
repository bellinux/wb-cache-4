2500|$|Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve {{is located}} on the north east coast of Unguja, [...] from the Zanzibar Town. The reserve is an {{important}} biodiversity spot in the coral rag zone. The forest reserve is rich both in faunal and floral species. The faunal species reported from the reserve are: Endemic species of red colobus monkey, Aders' duiker, sykes, blue monkeys, suni antelope and several species of snakes. The avifauna species consist of 47 bird species, which includes Fischer's turaco, Zanzibar sombre greenbul, crowned hornbill and <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucal.</b> There are 100 plant species which includes many medicinal species. There are also coral caves within the reserve where stalactites and stalagmite formations can be seen. There is also a spice plantation near the reserve. Coral rag forest, a sensitive ecosystem, is under threat due to timber extraction, since the 1970s. Conservation measures have been undertaken to preserve the rich biodiversity of the reserve.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucal</b> or lark-heeled cuckoo (Centropus superciliosus), is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the Cuculidae family. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa. It inhabits areas with thick cover afforded by rank {{undergrowth}} and scrub, including in suitable coastal regions. Burchell's coucal is sometimes considered a subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Burchell's coucal (Centropus burchellii), is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the Cuculidae family. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa. It inhabits areas with thick cover afforded by rank {{undergrowth}} and scrub, including in suitable coastal regions. Common names include Gewone Vleilourie in Afrikaans and umGugwane in Zulu. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many coucals {{have a long}} claw {{on their}} hind toe (hallux). The genus name from Greek kentron, a spike and pous for foot {{describe}} this hallux claw. The feet have minute spurs and this {{is responsible for the}} German term for coucals Sporenkuckucke. The common name is perhaps derived from the French coucou and alouette (for the long lark like claw).(Cuvier, in Newton 1896) The length of the claw can be about 68-76% of the tarsus length in the African black coucal C. grillii and lesser coucal C. bengalensis. Only the short-toed coucal C. rectunguis is an exception with the hallux claw of only 23% of the tarsus length. Thread like feather structures (elongated sheaths of the growing feathers that are sometimes termed trichoptiles) are found on the head and neck of hatchlings and can be as long as 20mm. Nestlings can look spiny. Many are opportunistic predators, Centropus phasianus is known to attack birds caught in mist nets while <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucals</b> Centropus superciliosus are attracted to smoke from grass fires where they forage for insects and small mammals escaping from the fire.|$|R
50|$|The <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucal</b> is a {{medium-sized}} species growing to 36 to 42 cm in length. The sexes are similar, adults having a blackish crown and nape, a white supercilium, rufous-brown back, chestnut wings, blackish rump and black tail, glossed with green, {{with a white}} tip. The underparts are creamy-white, the eyes red, the beak black, and the legs and feet greyish-black or black. Juveniles have rufous streaking on the crown, a faint buff supercilium, barred upper parts and darker underparts.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucal</b> is {{native to}} eastern and {{southern}} Africa, and the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Its range includes Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe in Africa, as well as Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It is a common species with a very wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as a [...] "least-concern species".|$|E

5000|$|Thick-billed weavers are polygynous, in that {{a single}} male {{attempts}} to attract and mate with several females. up to six, and three nest may ne active in any male's territory at once. Where they are found at low density there are many apparently monogamous pairs, although they normally nest in small colonies; more than 100 nests in one South African colony. After mating the female normally will lay a clutch of 3 whitish pink eggs, spotted with red, purple and brown. The incubation of the eggs is carried out solely by the female, lasting 14-16 days and the chicks are fed by regurgitation by the female until fledging, although occasionally the male also feeds the young. The chicks fledge after about 18-20 days in the nest. The nests are vulnerable to predation and recorded nest predators include the <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucal</b> Centropus superciliosus, house crow Corvus splendens and the Nile monitor [...] Varanus niloticus. After the nests {{have been used by}} the wevaers they may be commandeered by climbing mice, or used for breeding by the zebra waxbill Amandava subflava or brown firefinch Lagonosticta nitidula.|$|E
40|$|The {{period of}} parental care {{can be a}} {{demanding}} life-history stage because parents need to find sufficient resources to feed themselves and their offspring. Often, this is reflected by elevated baseline levels of glucocorticoidsâ€”hormones that regulate metabolism and energy allocation. During 10 breeding seasons, we studied plasma corticosterone (the major avian glucocorticoid) concentrations as a physiological correlate of parental expenditure in two closely related coucal species with fundamentally different mating systems: the sex-role reversed black coucal (Centropus grillii) with female competition and male-only care and the socially monogamous and biparental <b>white-browed</b> <b>coucal</b> (C. superciliosus). The two species {{live in the same}} habitat and share a similar breeding biology. However, female black coucals aggressively defend a territory and produce many eggs for their various male partners, and male black coucals feed their offspring much more frequently and rest less often than female and male white-browed coucals. These differences were reflected in baseline and stress-induced concentrations of corticosterone: male black coucals had higher baseline and stress-induced corticosterone concentrations when they were feeding young than outside a feeding context, and also the concentrations of female black coucals were higher during the main period of breeding when they defended territories and produced multiple clutches. In contrast, baseline and stress-induced concentrations of corticosterone in female and male white-browed coucals did not differ between periods when they were feeding young and periods without dependent offspring. Paradoxically, on an individual basis feeding effort was negatively related to baseline corticosterone in male black coucals and female white-browed coucals. In conclusion, corticosterone concentrations of coucals reflected differences in competition and parental roles and support the notion that a switch from biparental to uniparental care and an increase in mate competition may come at a physiological and energetic cost...|$|E
