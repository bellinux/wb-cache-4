50|$|Twist that {{decreases}} the local chord's incidence from root to tip is {{sometimes referred to}} as washout. Twist that increases the local incidence from root to tip is less common and is called <b>wash-in.</b> The X-29 had strong <b>wash-in</b> to compensate for the additional root-first stalling promoted by the forward sweep.|$|E
50|$|The {{reverse twist}} (higher {{incidence}} at wingtip), <b>wash-in,</b> {{can also be}} found in some designs though less common.|$|E
50|$|Winglets {{have the}} {{opposite}} effect to washout. Winglets allow {{a greater proportion of}} lift to be generated near the wing tips. (This can be described as aerodynamic <b>wash-in.)</b> Winglets also promote a greater bending moment at the wing root, possibly necessitating a heavier wing structure. Installation of winglets may necessitate greater aerodynamic washout in order to provide the required resistance to spinning, or to optimise the spanwise lift distribution.|$|E
50|$|Ecologically, goniatites {{were limited}} to environments of normal-marine salinity—as {{appears to be the}} case for all {{cephalopods}} throughout their history. Goniatites are much more abundant and speciose in sediments that represent called epicontinental seas than they are in those that represent the open ocean. Within these inland seas, goniatites' greatest abundance and diversity appears to have been achieved in deeper offshore and basinal environments rather than in nearshore environments. Known nearshore (e.g., lagoonal) occurrences have generally been ascribed to <b>wash-in</b> of shells from offshore waters.|$|E
5000|$|There is a cult {{following}} among hill walkers, mountaineers (particularly {{in northern}} England and Scotland), {{certain parts of}} UK Armed Forces, divisions of the Metropolitan Police and Mountain Rescue Teams for Páramo waterproofs. Generally the garment designs are well received from a utility perspective. The waterproofs can often be carried instead of separate fleece and shell garments, reducing carried load.Páramo provide multiple lengths of leg for most styles of waterproof trousers in the range.The use of <b>wash-in</b> water repellant treatments means an easy maintenance and long functional life for the fabrics ...|$|E
50|$|Durable water repellent, or DWR, is a coating {{added to}} fabrics {{at the factory}} to make them {{water-resistant}} (or hydrophobic). Most factory-applied treatments are fluoropolymer based. Durable water repellents are commonly {{used in conjunction with}} waterproof breathable fabrics such as Gore-Tex to prevent the outer layer of fabric from becoming saturated with water. This saturation, called 'wetting out,' can reduce the garment's breathability (moisture transport through the breathable membrane) and let water through. As the DWR wears off over time, re-treatment is recommended when necessary. Many spray-on and <b>wash-in</b> products for treatment of non-waterproof garments and re-treatment of proofed garments losing their water-repellency are available from sources of sporting apparel.|$|E
5000|$|Forward-swept wings {{can also}} {{experience}} dangerous flexing effects compared to aft-swept wings that can negate the tip stall advantage if the wing is not sufficiently stiff. In aft-swept designs, when the airplane maneuvers at high load factor the wing loading and geometry twists the wing {{in such a}} way as to create washout (tip twists leading edge down). This reduces the angle of attack at the tip, thus reducing the bending moment on the wing, as well as somewhat reducing the chance of tip stall. [...] However, the same effect on forward-swept wings produces a <b>wash-in</b> effect which increases the angle of attack promoting tip stall.|$|E
50|$|The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt (Akaflieg Darmstadt) {{was first}} formed in 1921. It was, and is, {{a group of}} {{aeronautical}} students who design and construct aircraft {{as part of their}} studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. Before the Cirrus their sailplanes designs, whilst often advanced, had all been constructed from wood and fabric. It was well known that high performance required large lift to drag ratios, and that these were obtained by using high aspect ratio wings. The 20 m (65 ft 7 in) span wings of the Cirrus had an aspect ratio of 33.6, the highest of any aircraft built at the time, and such slender structures could not be built entirely from wood. Instead, a singe, wide, tapering duralumin spar was built up out of corrugated sheets, with upper and lower skins that formed about one third of each wing surface at the root and more at the tip. Ahead and aft of the spar the wing profile was shaped with wooden ribs and plywood skinned. It was straight tapered in plan, constructed from an inner 10 m (32 ft 10 in) centre section and two outer panels each 5 m (16 ft 5 in) long, with a high taper ratio of 4 and with squared off tips. Strongly tapered wings have a lift distribution which falls rapidly along the span, so the angle of incidence of the wings of the Cirrus initially increased along the span (<b>wash-in),</b> then decreased towards the tips (wash-out), producing a better approximation of the lift distribution to that of the aerodynamically ideal elliptical wing. The outer panels had ailerons along the whole of their trailing edges, and the inner section similarly carried flaps. The ailerons were of the differential type and were interconnected to the rudder to simplify yaw correction. Mid-chord spoilers were fitted on the centre section.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} semi-quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) parameters {{for the detection of}} prostatic carcinoma in correlation to whole-mount histopathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer were examined by DCE-MRI at 1. 5 -T. Cancerous and benign prostatic tissue regions of interest were delineated based on the histopathology of whole-mount sections and several semi-quantitative parameters were calculated: time to peak (TTP), maximal contrast enhancement (Cpeak), speed of contrast uptake (<b>Wash-in)</b> and clearance rate of the contrast agent (Wash-out). The area under the ROC curve was determined for each parameter. RESULTS: Within individual patients, a consistently higher Cpeak and faster <b>Wash-in</b> were present in cancerous compared to benign prostatic tissue. Both the TTP and the Wash-out occurred more rapidly in tumour tissue than in normal prostatic tissue. Despite a considerable inter-patient overlap of parameter values between tumour and normal prostatic tissue, area under the ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the <b>Wash-in</b> was a good discriminator for cancer and benign tissue (AUC 0. 82). Combination of the <b>Wash-in</b> and the Wash-out proved to be even more accurate (AUC 0. 87) to discriminate between cancerous and benign prostatic regions.

There remain some situations where N 2 O should be avoided, which limits {{the generalizability of}} this <b>wash-in</b> scheme. The objective of our {{study was to determine}} the performance of this scheme in contexts where N 2 O is not used. Methods: We recruited 106 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. After induction and intubation, <b>wash-in</b> was started with a fresh gas flow of air:O 2 1 : 1 L/min and a vaporizer concentration of desflurane of 12 %. Controlled ventilation was then adjusted to maintain PACO 2 at 30 – 35 mmHg. Results: The alveolar concentration of desflurane (FAD) rose rapidly from 0 % to 6 % in 4  minutes in the same pattern as observed in our previous study in which N 2 O was used. An FAD of 7 % was achieved in 6 minutes. An FAD of 1 % to 7 % occurred at 0. 6, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, and 6  minutes. The rise in heart rate during <b>wash-in</b> was statistically significant, although not clinically so.

We measured the <b>wash-in</b> and wash-out times (time to saturate and to eliminate the anaesthetic agent, AA), for sevoflurane and desflurane, in a test-lung with fixed 3 MAC vaporizer setting at different fresh gas flow (FGF) and calculated the consumption of AA. We tried to find an optimal flow rate for speed and gas consumption, comparing two anaesthesia machines (AMs) : Aisys and Flow-i. Time to reach 1 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) (<b>wash-in)</b> decreased (p< 0. 05) at higher flow rates (1 – 2 – 4) but plateaued at 4 - 4. 8 l/min. The consumption of AA was at its lowest around 4 - 4. 8 l/min (optimal flow) for all but the Aisys /desflurane group. Wash-out times decreased as FGF increased, until reaching plateau at FGF of 4 - 6 l/min. Aisys had generally shorter <b>wash-in</b> times at flow rates < 4 l/min as well as lower consumption of AA. At higher flow rates there were little difference between the AMs. The “optimal FGF” for wash-out, elimination of gas from the test-lung and circle system, plateaued with no increase in speed beyond 6 l/min.

Materials and Methods: Four different inhalation protocols, including 3 -min, 6 -min, and 8 -min <b>wash-in</b> protocols, and a 3 -min wash-in/ 5 -min washout protocol, were compared in five healthy volunteers. Each subject under-went two serial Xe CT examinations with an interval of 30 min between the first one (<b>wash-in)</b> and the second one (wash-in/washout). A computer simulation was also performed to support the results of the clinical study. The rate of success was calculated from our experience of 110 clinical cases examined with the wash-in/washout protocol over the last 9 months. Results: The mean CBF values with 6 -min and 8 -min <b>wash-in</b> protocols were 59. 0 and 59. 5 mL/ 100 -g brain per min in the thalamus, and 19. 5 and 19. 0 mL/ 1 00 -g brain per min in the frontal white matter, respectively. The mean CBF values with 3 -min wash-in/ 5 -min washout protocol were 60. 0 mL/ 100 -g brain per min in the thalamus and 18. 5 mL/ 100 -g brain per min in the frontal white matter, respectively. Computer simulation showed improved signal-to-noise ratio by employing the 3 -min wash-in/ 5 -min washout protocol instead of 8 -min <b>wash-in</b> protol for the same number of data points. The rate of success improved to 99. 1 % due to the significant decrease in head motion with the shorter period of inhalation.

A prerequisite for effective low flow anaesthesia is the possibility to rapidly increase and decrease gas concentrations in the circle system, thereby controlling the depth of anaesthesia.   Methods: We studied the <b>wash-in</b> and wash-out of sevoflurane in the circle system with fixed fresh gas flow and vaporizer setting. We compared two modern anaesthesia work stations, the Aisys (GE, Madison, WI, USA) and FLOW-i (Maquet, Solna, Sweden) in a test lung model.   Results: We found fresh-gas flow to have, as expected, {{a major influence on}} <b>wash-in,</b> as well as wash-out of sevoflurane. The <b>wash-in</b> time to reach a stable circle 1 MAC (2. 1 %) decreased from an average of 547 ± 83 seconds with a constant fresh gas flow of 300 ml/min and vaporizer setting of 8 %, to a mean of 38 ± 6 seconds at a fresh gas flow of 4 L/min. There were only minor differences between the two works-stations tested; the Aisys was slightly faster at both 300 and 4 L/min flow. Time to further increase circle end-tidal concentration from 1 - 1. 5 MAC showed likewise significant associations to fresh gas and decreased from 330 ± 24 seconds at 300 ml/min. to less than a minute at constant 4 L/min (17 ± 11 seconds), without anaesthetic machine difference.

40|$|An {{approach}} is presented for monitoring {{the effects of}} neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Ewing's sarcoma using dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) images. For that purpose, we modify the three-compartment pharmacokinetic permeability model introduced by Tofts et al. (Magn Reson Med 1991; 17 : 357 - 67) to a two-compartment model. Perfusion MR images acquired using an intravenous injection with Gadolinium (Gd-DTPA) are analyzed with this two-compartment pharmacokinetic model {{as well as the}} with an extended pharmacokinetic model that includes the (local) arrival time t(o) of the tracer as an endogenous (estimated) parameter. For each MR section, a <b>wash-in</b> parameter associated with each voxel is estimated twice by fitting each of the two pharmacokinetic models to the dynamic MR signal. A comparison of the two <b>wash-in</b> parametric images (global versus local arrival time) with matched histologic macroslices demonstrates a good correspondence between areas with viable remnant tumor and a high <b>wash-in</b> rate. This {{can be explained by the}} high number and permeability of the (leaking) capillaries in viable tumor tissue. The novel pharmacokinetic model based on a local arrival time of tracer results in the best fit of the <b>wash-in</b> rate, the most important factor discerning viable from nonviable tumor components, However, parameter estimates obtained with this model are also more sensitive to noise in the MR signal, The novel pharmacokinetic model resulted in a sensitivity between 0. 22 and 0. 60 and a specificity between 0. 61 and 1. The model based on a global arrival time gave sensitivities between 0. 33 and 0. 77 and specificities between 0. 58 and 0. 99. Both statistics are computed as the fraction of correctly labeled voxels (viable or nonviable tumor) within a specified ROI, which delineates the tumor. We conclude that the added value of estimating the local arrival time of tracer first manifests itself for moderate noise levels in the MR signal. The novel pharmacokinetic model should moreover be preferred when pharmacokinetic modeling is applied on the average signal intensity within a ROI, where noise has less effect on the fitted parameters...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that changes in the blood concentration, and possibly in the perfusion, of different areas in the brain can be assessed {{by the use of}} ultrasound contrast agent (CA) and (linear) echo densitometry. The experiments were performed with piglets (n= 3) under general anesthesia and artificial ventilation. Ultrasound CA was administered through a femoral vein as a short bolus. First passage <b>wash-in</b> curve was measured from image gray level during continuous low level (mechanical index< 0. 2) ultrasound imaging. This curve was obtained from 1 -cm 2 areas of the cortex (surface), the brain stem (inner) and the left carotid artery (vessel). Cerebral hemoglobin concentration changes were measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This approach enabled a cross-validation of these techniques. The measurements were repeated under conditions of normocapnia, mild hypercapnia and deep hypercapnia. Several physiologic signals, as well as the carotid blood flow, were measured simultaneously and related to gray level by linear regression analysis. The most significant results found were a high R 2 -statistic of the regression of the percentage change of the peak of the surface and inner <b>wash-in</b> curves with the arterial carbon dioxide pressure (R 2 = 0. 63 and R 2 = 0. 70, respectively), the blood pH (R 2 = 0. 79 and R 2 = 0. 81), the carotid flow (R 2 = 0. 75 and R 2 = 0. 72) and the partial arterial oxygen pressure (R 2 = 0. 47 and R 2 = 0. 55). Finally, a high correlation of peak gray level with total hemoglobin concentration change, independently measured by NIRS, was found (R 2 = 0. 69). In conclusion, these experiments show a reasonable intersubject variability of various relative measures derived from gray level ultrasound <b>wash-in</b> curves. High sensitivity to physiologic changes related to hypercapnia was observed for the peak contrast of <b>wash-in</b> curves.

Oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon tensions were measured in muscle and subcutaneous tissue by mass spectroscopic analyses. Venous blood obtained {{at regular intervals}} was analyzed for coagulation and fibrinolytic factors. Inert gas narcosis was not observed. After breathing argon for 30 min, muscle argon tensions were almost three times the subcutaneous tensions. Argon <b>wash-in</b> mirrored nitrogen wash-out.

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} rounded atelectasis (RA) with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in {{the differential}} diagnosis of solitary peripheral pulmonary neoplasm. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four patients with diagnostically equivocal peripheral pulmonary nodules were examined with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. 13 patients had a total of 16 rounded atelectases and 11 had a neoplasm. The final diagnosis was made either by histology (n = 14) or follow-up examinations of at least 24 months (n = 10). The peripheral nodules were evaluated concerning their morphology and contrast-enhancement dynamics. Curves for signal intensity (SI) versus time were produced and the relative increase in SI, slope of SI during <b>wash-in,</b> and slope of SI during wash-out calculated. Additionally, SI time curves were evaluated using a two compartment model where the ratio for the SI of the fast and the slow component were calculated. Mean values from different tissues of interest were compared by an unpaired two-sided t-test. Results: Analysis of the SI-time curves of the RAs revealed a curve shape similar to the pulmonary artery, but a magnitude in SI between artery and normal lung tissue. Linear curve fit showed a significantly steeper slope during <b>wash-in</b> and wash-out, and higher relative signal increase in atelectases as compared to neoplasms. Results from the two compartment model showed increased flow and a high ratio of the slow to the fast components with a long mean transit time in neoplasms. Conclusion: Three parameters, slope of SI during <b>wash-in</b> and wash-out, and the slow/fast ratio {{can be used as}} diagnostic tools for discrimination of RA and neoplasm...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{challenge}} in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) is the accurate assessment of aggressiveness. OBJECTIVE: To validate the performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate at 3 tesla (T) {{for the assessment of}} PCa aggressiveness, with prostatectomy specimens as the reference standard. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 45 patients with PCa scheduled for prostatectomy were included. This study was approved by the institutional review board; the need for informed consent was waived. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Subjects underwent a clinical MRI protocol including DCE-MRI. Blinded to DCE-images, PCa was indicated on T 2 -weighted images based on histopathology results from prostatectomy specimens with the use of anatomical landmarks for the precise localization of the tumor. PCa was classified as low-, intermediate-, or high-grade, according to Gleason score. DCE-images were used as an overlay on T 2 -weighted images; mean and quartile values from semi-quantitative and pharmacokinetic model parameters were extracted per tumor region. Statistical analysis included Spearman's ρ, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Significant differences were seen for the mean and 75 th percentile (p 75) values of <b>wash-in</b> (p = 0. 024 and p = 0. 017, respectively), mean wash-out (p = 0. 044), and p 75 of transfer constant (K(trans)) (p = 0. 035), all between low-grade and high-grade PCa in the peripheral zone. ROC analysis revealed the best discriminating performance between low-grade versus intermediate-grade plus high-grade PCa in the peripheral zone for p 75 of <b>wash-in,</b> K(trans), and rate constant (Kep) (area under the curve: 0. 72). Due to a limited number of tumors in the transition zone, a definitive conclusion for this region of the prostate could not be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative parameters (K(trans) and Kep) and semi-quantitative parameters (<b>wash-in</b> and wash-out) derived from DCE-MRI at 3 T have the potential to assess the aggressiveness of PCa in the peripheral zone. P 75 of <b>wash-in,</b> K(trans), and Kep offer the best possibility to discriminate low-grade from intermediate-grade plus high-grade PCa. Copyright © 2013 European Association of Urology.

3000|$|Using a small {{molecular}} weight contrast agent, DCE-MRI allows for visualization and quantification of the perfusion/vessel permeability {{of the tumor}} vessels. In contrast to weighted MR images, DCE-MRI revealed heterogeneous vascular functionality in all tumor cases. Through voxel-based registration of SPECT values and DCE-MRI-derived parameters, a clear correlation between localized tissue perfusion parameters and radioactivity accumulation in the tumor could be established (Fig.  2).
