5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was a new president.|$|E
2500|$|Heinrich Lissauer {{shared his}} ideas about agnosia after Wernicke and Kussmaul. In 1890, he theorized {{that there were}} two ways in which object {{recognition}} impairment could occur. [...] One way in which impairment could occur <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was damage to early perceptual processing or if there was damage to the actual object representation. [...] If the actual object representation was damaged, this would not allow the object to be stored in visual memory, and therefore the individual {{would not be able to}} recognize the object. [...] During the time of Wernicke, Kussmaul and Lissauer there was little known about the cerebral cortex. [...] Today, with new neuroimaging techniques, we have been able to expand our knowledge on agnosia greatly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: [...] "The odd {{thing is that}} my father was such a good story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't tell me where my grandfather was buried. It <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E

2500|$|The risk {{of stroke}} from non-valvular AF [...] can be {{estimated}} using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. [...] A 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline said that for nonvalvular AF, anticoagulation <b>is</b> recommended <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a score of 2 or more, not using anticoagulation may <b>be</b> considered <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a score of 1, and not using anticoagulation <b>is</b> reasonable <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a score of 0.|$|R

2500|$|Winx {{was given}} some time off, then {{returned}} to training in January 2017. Her next start was the Apollo Stakes at Randwick, originally scheduled for 11 February but delayed to 13 February due to extreme heat in the Sydney area. Winx broke poorly, then settled in mid pack behind a fast early pace. She swung out three-wide leaving the far turn, then pulled away in the stretch to defeat Hartnell by two lengths. [...] "My only worry going into the race <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was no tempo but that went at a good gallop and that really helped," [...] said Bowman. [...] "Chris [...] {{and his team have}} done a great job to have her ready after so long away from the races and it's a privilege to be part of this." ...|$|E

"You don't suppose," [...] said Tuppy, {{with rising}} vehemence, [...] "that I would have exposed this dashed {{synthetic}} shark for the flatfish it undoubtedly <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{had not been}} causes {{that led up to}} it. What induced me to speak as I did was the fact that Angela, the little squirt, had just been most offensive, and I seized the opportunity to get a bit of my own back." ...|$|E

"It {{laid the}} {{injunction}} {{on me that}} I should never propose to see the writer, who had long been estranged from all intercourse with the world, but who would see a confidential agent if I would appoint one. I accredited Mr. Kenge. The lady said, of her own accord and not of his seeking, that her name was an assumed one. That she <b>was,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were any ties of blood in such a case, the child's aunt. That more than this she would never (and he was well persuaded of the steadfastness of her resolution) for any human consideration disclose. My dear, I have told you all." ...|$|E
50|$|The type of mini-game (4-player, 1-vs.-3, and 2-vs.-2) is {{determined}} by what color the players' panels <b>are.</b> <b>If</b> all four players have the same color panels, a four-player game <b>is</b> selected. <b>If</b> <b>there's</b> one blue panel, and three red panels or vice versa, a 1-vs.-3 game <b>is</b> selected. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two panels of both colors, a 2-vs.-2 game <b>is</b> selected. <b>If</b> <b>there's</b> a green panel, the color will switch to either red or blue (usually blue) randomly.|$|R

6000|$|I wish he {{had told}} me what breed it <b>was,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are others; but I shall know the dog next time, and then if I can bring myself to it I will put {{delicacy}} aside and ask. If I seem strangely interested in dogs, I have a reason for it; for a dog saved me from an embarrassing position once, and that has made me grateful to these animals; and if by study I could learn to tell some of the kinds from the others, I should be greatly pleased. I only know one kind apart, yet, and that is the kind that saved me that time. I always know that kind when I meet it, and if it is hungry or lost I take care of it. The matter happened in this way: ...|$|E

I shot a deer, last Wednesday was a fort night, and it floundered through the snow-banks till it got over a brush fence; I catched the lock of my rifle in the twigs in following, and was kept back, until finally the {{creature}} got off. Now I {{want to know}} who is to pay me for that deer; and a fine buck it <b>was.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> hadn’t been a fence I should have gotten another shot into it; and I never drawed upon anything that hadn’t wings three times running, in my born days. No, no, Judge, it’s the farmers that makes the game scarce, and not the hunters.” ...|$|E
60|$|But somehow, in {{the most}} unaccountable way, I had {{suddenly}} become nervous. There was no particular reason why I should be, beyond the ordinary reasons which surround the Central African traveller, and yet I undoubtedly <b>was.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> is one thing more than another of which I have the most complete and entire scorn and disbelief, it is of presentiments, and yet here I was {{all of a sudden}} filled with and possessed by a most undoubted presentiment of approaching evil. I would not give way to it, however, although I felt the cold perspiration stand out upon my forehead. I would not arouse the others. Worse and worse I grew, my pulse fluttered like a dying man's, my nerves thrilled with the horrible sense of impotent terror which anybody who is subject to nightmare will be familiar with, but still my will triumphed over my fears, and I lay quiet (for I was half sitting, half lying, in the bow of the canoe), only turning my face so as to command a view of Umslopogaas and the two Wakwafi who were sleeping alongside of and beyond me.|$|E

60|$|Lady Fawn, {{after much}} consideration, was of opinion {{that she must}} carry out her {{intention}} of calling upon her son's intended bride {{in spite of all}} the evil things that had been said. Lord Fawn had undertaken to send a message to Mount Street, informing the lady of the honour intended for her. And in truth Lady Fawn was somewhat curious now to see the household of the woman who might perhaps do her the irreparable injury of ruining the happiness of her only son. Perhaps she might learn something by looking at the woman in her own drawing-room. At any rate she would go. But Mrs. Hittaway's words had the effect of inducing her to leave Augusta where she <b>was.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> were contamination, why should Augusta be contaminated? Poor Augusta! She had looked forward to the delight of embracing her future sister-in-law;--and would not have enjoyed it the less, perhaps, because she had been told that the lady was false, profligate, and a vixen. As, however, her position was that of a girl, she was bound to be obedient,--though over thirty years old,--and she obeyed.|$|E
60|$|Of all {{the learned}} professions, pugilism {{is the one}} in which the trained expert is most sharply divided from the mere dabbler. In other fields the amateur may {{occasionally}} hope to compete successfully with the man who has made a business of what is to him but a sport, but at boxing never: and the whole demeanour of Bugs Butler showed that he had laid this truth to heart. It would be too little to say that his bearing was confident: he comported himself with the care-free jauntiness of an infant about to demolish a Noah's Ark with a tack-hammer. Cyclone Mullinses might withstand him for fifteen rounds where they yielded to a K-leg Binns in the fifth, but, when it came to beating up a sparring-partner and an amateur at that, Bugs Butler knew his potentialities. He was there forty ways and he did not attempt to conceal it. Crouching as was his wont, he uncoiled himself like a striking rattlesnake and flicked Ginger lightly over his guard. Then he returned to his crouch and circled sinuously about the ring with the amiable intention of showing the crowd, payers and deadheads alike, what real footwork <b>was.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> was one thing on which Bugs Butler prided himself, it was footwork.|$|E

50|$|The {{case had}} lain dormant {{for a decade}} when The New York Times {{received}} a letter from a woman claiming that as many as 40 patients had been murdered at a hospital by its chief surgeon.

50|$|A {{pioneering}} {{study in}} traditional perceptual dialectology {{took place in}} the Netherlands in 1939 and was conducted by W.G. Rensink. The study sought to investigate perceptual dialect boundaries through a Dutch dialect survey in which subjects were asked to state whether they thought other people spoke the same or different dialect as them, and what the dialect difference <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was deemed to be any. Weijnen analyzed this data through the little-arrow method that she devised. Many studies proceeded from this, and perceptual dialectology surveys took place in various countries.|$|E

50|$|Wilson had {{developed}} a reputation in his late teens for {{his knowledge of the}} woods, his logging abilities, road building capabilities, and knowledge of heavy equipment. He eagerly took to the job. He spent two months tramping, judging, and recording his notes. His only concern at the time <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> would be adequate elevation change to comply with international rules. Subsequent land purchases solved that problem. As a result of the efforts required to hold the 1980 Olympics it became next to Holmenkollen, the premier cross country ski center in the world. Under its new director it is again headed that way.|$|E

She further stated that she [...] "never found voice to utter two contrary opinions" [...] and she affirmed her belief that [...] "this voice comes from God, and by His command".|$|E
