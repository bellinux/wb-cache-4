However, by January 15, of the following year Sauvé resigned as an MP, and thus as speaker, and two days later she was hospitalised; rumours circulated that it was due to cancer, but the official story <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> contracted a respiratory virus, which was further complicated by an allergy to antibiotics.|$|E

500|$|Lead {{writer and}} {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies initially had {{the idea of an}} unnamed policewoman stumbling across a team of alien investigators in an alley as a premise, before Torchwood or the 2005 revival of Doctor Who were commissioned. Having been enamoured by her television performances, most notably in the 2005 episode of Doctor Who in which she guest-starred, Davies wrote the character of Gwen specifically for Eve Myles. Myles stated that having the part written for her was like her [...] "own personal Oscar". Part of the attraction of playing Gwen for Myles <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to play an action hero with her own accent. Speaking on the casting of Welsh actors on Torchwood, Davies commented that it was deliberately intended, to make the Welsh accent mainstream, [...] "to make it as acceptable as Scottish or Irish". In an analysis of Welsh mythology in Torchwood, Lynette Porter observes that Gwen's national consciousness forms part of her characterisation: her knowledge of local myths [...] "highlights her Welsh heritage and common knowledge from her experience and formal education." [...] Discussing the international co-production behind series four, executive producer Julie Gardner commented that Myles' continued involvement helped ensure that the [...] "flavour of Wales" [...] remained evident.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, {{marking the}} end of the {{relatively}} conflict-free [...] "Phoney War" [...] phase of World War II. As the U.S. began to move toward war footing, Roosevelt found herself again depressed, fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs. She briefly considered traveling to Europe to work with the Red Cross, but was dissuaded by presidential advisers who pointed out the consequences should the president's wife be captured as a prisoner of war. She soon found other wartime causes to work on, however, beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children. She also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis, including Jews, but fears of fifth columnists caused Franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it. Eleanor successfully secured political refugee status for eighty-three Jewish refugees from the S.S. Quanza in August 1940, but was refused on many other occasions. Her son James later wrote that [...] "her deepest regret at {{the end of}} her life" [...] <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not forced Franklin to accept more refugees from Nazism during the war.|$|E

500|$|Other decided cases {{also do not}} {{indicate}} whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation will be developed {{in the way it}} has been developed in the UK. In Siah Mooi Guat, another argument the applicant raised <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a legitimate expectation to continue to reside in Singapore until the expiry of her re-entry permit. Sinnathuray J. distinguished Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (1983), a Privy Council case on appeal from Hong Kong, from the case at hand. In the Privy Council case there had been an express promise made to Ng by the Government of Hong Kong which had created a substantive legitimate expectation. In the present case, no promise had been made to be applicant that her stay in Singapore was to be conditioned by any considerations other than those provided in the Immigration Act and related regulations. No substantive legitimate expectation arose in the applicant's favour, following the dictum of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in the GCHQ case that legitimate expectation arises [...] "either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue". Thus, the judge did not discuss the detailed legal rules to be applied to determine when an aggrieved person may be said to have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right.|$|E
500|$|In Borissik, the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} were joint owners of a semi-detached house with a plot size of around [...] which was attached to another semi-detached house with a plot size of around [...] In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) revised its guidelines for the redevelopment of semi-detached houses, now permitting a semi-detached house to be converted to a detached house if and only if both the semi-detached plot and its adjoining semi-detached plot each had a size of at least [...] On the basis of this guideline, the URA rejected the application submitted by {{the applicant}} and her husband to demolish their semi-detached house {{and replace it with a}} detached house. Dissatisfied, the applicant applied for a mandatory order for approval to be granted. One of her arguments <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a legitimate expectation that her proposal would be approved on the basis of the old guidelines; in other words, she sought fulfilment of a substantive legitimate expectation. In the end, the High Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her. She could neither show that any person with actual or ostensible authority had made any promise to her, nor that the URA's officers had acted in a way to lead her to have a legitimate expectation that her redevelopment plans would be approved. Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has cautioned against reading the case as an implicit acknowledgement that legitimate expectations can be substantively enforced. He noted that [...] "there is good reason for judges in Singapore to tread carefully, stepping gingerly on each stone in crossing the river".|$|E
