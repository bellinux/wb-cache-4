Phase I of this effort is nearing completion to autonomously weld double-hull ship sections together.

50|$|Chemical oxygen generators, such {{as those}} in {{commercial}} aircraft, provide emergency oxygen to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure. Oxygen is generated by high-temperature decomposition of sodium chlorate. Heat is generated by oxidation of a small amount of iron powder mixed with the sodium chlorate, and the reaction consumes less oxygen than is produced. Barium peroxide (BaO2) is used to absorb the chlorine which is a minor product in the decomposition.An ignitor charge is activated by pulling on the emergency mask.

50|$|The main {{components}} of every orbital <b>welding</b> <b>system</b> are the power source and controller, the welding head and, where required, a wire feed mechanism.

These aspects include the arc length, magnitude and pulse frequency of the welding current, welding speed, inert shielding gas, parent material, filler material, weld preparation, and thermal conductivity.

50|$|Owing to {{its ability}} to realise high purity results, orbital welding found {{its place in the}} {{production}} of clean-room components for the semiconductor industry. Its application has now expanded to the construction of pipework and equipment for diverse industries like food processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, automotive engineering, biotechnology, shipbuilding and aerospace. Automated orbital TIG welding is also used in the construction of power stations, (thermal power plants). The construction materials used must be able to withstand the enormous mechanical loads produced by the high pressures and temperatures created by the media carried in the tubes. Notches, pores and inclusions in the weld seams must be avoided at all costs, as these create weak points that can lead to subsequent formation of cracks. These in turn can have serious consequences in terms of component failure. This means that tubes are often made from nickel-based materials with walls up to 200mm thick. One manufacturer has developed an orbital narrow gap <b>welding</b> <b>system</b> with hot-wire feed specifically for this purpose, which uses running gear that moves on a guide ring fixed around the tube. This new variant has created {{a lot of interest in}} the sector, with the worldwide boom in power station construction fueling the never-ending search for increasingly productive manufacturing methods using new types of high-temperature steels.|$|E

The Universal <b>Weld</b> <b>System,</b> manufactured by MTS Systems Corporation, will be installed at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and will be capable of manufacturing domes up to 30 ft in diameter. All welding will be accomplished using the Adaptable Adjustable Pin Tool (AdAPT) weld head and controller manufactured by MTS. Weld parameters will be developed for an aluminum alloy in gauges ranging from 0. 320 to 0. 400 in. thick. Weld quality will be verified through radiography, mechanical property testing at ambient and LN 2 temperatures, and metallurgical analysis. The AdAPT weld head will then be mounted on a 22 -ft diameter dome tool, which will be modified to include a welding track and drive system for moving the AdAPT weld head along the weld joint. This tool will then be used to manufacture a 22 -ft diameter dome of an aluminum alloy, with 0. 320 -in. constant thickness joints, consisting of three individual gore panels. Finally, the 27. 5 -ft diameter quarter dome will be welded on the Universal <b>Weld</b> <b>System.</b> The quarter dome will consist of three individual gore panels with weld lands tapering from 0. 320 to 0. 360 in. in thickness.
