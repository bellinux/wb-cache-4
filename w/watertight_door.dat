5|$|The 2000 {{expedition}} by RMS Titanic Inc. {{carried out}} 28 dives during which over 800 artefacts were recovered, including the ship's engine telegraphs, perfume vials and <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> gears. In 2001, an American couple – David Leibowitz and Kimberly Miller – caused controversy {{when they were}} married aboard a submersible that had set down on the bow of Titanic, in a deliberate echo of a famous scene from James Cameron's 1997 film. The wedding was essentially a publicity stunt, sponsored by a British company called SubSea Explorer which had offered a free dive to Titanic that Leibowitz had won. He asked whether his fiancée could come too {{and was told that}} she could– but only if she agreed to get married during the trip. The same company also brought along Philip Littlejohn, the grandson of one of Titanics surviving crew members, who became the first relative of a Titanic passenger or crew member to visit the wreck. Cameron himself also returned to Titanic in 2001 to carry out filming for Walt Disney Pictures' Ghosts of the Abyss, filmed in 3D.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1970, coincidentally Coast Guard Day, {{the pair}} of cutters set out on what {{would prove to be}} their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts {{embarked}} for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, Point Marone was the target of a command detonated mine. The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts. After the mine explosion, Point Marone listed to starboard but managed to get underway while Point Cypress laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. Point Marone suffered three shrapnel holes at the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> between the mess deck and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud. After patching and painting, Point Marone was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both Point Marone and Point Cypress.|$|E
25|$|Three {{types of}} doors are {{commonly}} used between compartments. A closed <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> is structurally capable of withstanding the same pressures as the watertight bulkheads they penetrate, although such doors require frequent maintenance to maintain effective seals, and must, of course, be kept closed to effectively contain flooding.|$|E
50|$|On 21 October 1981, S-178, {{under the}} command of Captain Third Rank V.A. Marango, was transiting on the surface at 9 kn, {{returning}} to base after two days of sound trials. The sea state was 2 (less than one-metre waves) and night time visibility was unlimited. The starboard diesel was under repair, so the propulsion plant was aligned port diesel, starboard electric motor. For convenience, the diesel mechanics and electricians had opened the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> between compartments. In addition, the cooks had opened other <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> so that they could serve dinner.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, it was {{reported}} that Danny F II had been detained at Adelaide because of defects which included holed bulkheads, defective navigation lights and radio equipment and defective <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{the second}} {{compartment}} rapidly flooded, the officers within shut the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> to prevent flooding the adjacent compartments. When the seawater flooded the battery well, {{many of the}} officers and civilians in the second compartment were killed by chlorine gas.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} damaged <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> of the firemen's tunnel, the <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. Britannic had reached her {{flooding}} limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) {{with her first}} six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising {{all the way up}} to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the Titanic disaster. (Titanic could float with her first four compartments flooded.) The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards. As the ship's angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.|$|E
25|$|Thomas A. Walker was the {{contractor}} entrusted {{by the chief}} GWR engineer Sir John Hawkshaw with rescuing and completing the tunnel after the 1879 flooding. Holding the Great Spring in check required the installation of greatly increased pumping facilities, and a diver had to be sent down a shaft and 300m along the tunnel heading to close a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> in the workings and seal off the waters. This troublesome task was finally achieved in November 1880 by lead diver Alexander Lambert using Henry Fleuss' new self contained breathing apparatus, but work {{in the area of}} the Great Spring was unable to continue until January 1881 when the Great Spring was temporarily sealed off.|$|E
25|$|The design {{specifications}} for Point Baker included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction {{was used to}} save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces {{were a part of}} the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, an {{expedition}} led by Carl Spencer dived into the wreck. This {{was the first}} expedition to dive Britannic where all the bottom divers were using closed circuit rebreathers (CCR). Diver Rich Stevenson found that several <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> were open. It {{has been suggested that}} this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted the doorframes. A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of U-73 that Britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b> Spencer's expedition was broadcast extensively across the world for many years by National Geographic and the UK's Channel 5.|$|R
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{subdivided}} into an eleven watertight compartments,so proportioned {{that the ship}} would float if any two adjacent compartments became flooded. The <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> throughout the ship were operated on the Stone-Lloyd system that enabled all doors to be closed instantly and simultaneously from the bridge.|$|R
50|$|During Week Six, {{recruits}} learn shipboard {{damage control}} and firefighting skills. Recruits {{will learn to}} escape smoke-filled compartments, open and close <b>watertight</b> <b>doors,</b> use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs), carry fire hoses, and learn to extinguish fires. Week Six also includes the Confidence Chamber (tear gas chamber).|$|R

25|$|The design {{specifications}} for the 82-foot cutter included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure to save weight.

Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one-man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. Berthing spaces were provided for 13 so that requirements were met for passengers and extra wartime manning needs. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an 18-knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Already part of the design, crews stationed in Vietnam found the air-conditioned interior especially helpful. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer but for Vietnam service the spaces quartered the commanding officer, the executive officer and chief boatswain's mate {{as well as the}} chief engineman. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck, which also included three bunks for first-class petty officers. A <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was 10 feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E
25|$|This {{new concept}} in lock design {{has yet to}} be {{installed}} on any waterway. It is basically a shaft lock with a diagonal shaft. The proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete, of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted, to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels. The bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong <b>watertight</b> <b>door,</b> but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top, installed a boat's length from the far wall of the tube. The change in level is achieved by filling the tube with water from the top pound, or by draining. The vessel floats {{on the surface of the}} water, with a guide float or pontoon, shaped to fit the tube, floating alongside to keep it clear of the walls. Side ponds, piped from the main tube, are incorporated to save water. In replacing a traditional flight or staircase of locks, a considerable time saving is anticipated. It differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat does not have to be carried in a submerged chamber.|$|E

5000|$|Koombana was 340 ft long between perpendiculars. She had {{a beam of}} 48 ft and a draught of 20 ft. [...] Her tonnage was [...] [...] All of her {{compartments}} were {{fitted with}} <b>watertight</b> <b>doors,</b> and she was capable of carrying 900 tons of ballast water.|$|R
25|$|Later, in a 1998 {{documentary}} titled Titanic: Secrets Revealed, the Discovery Channel ran model simulations {{which also}} rebutted this theory. The simulations indicated that opening Titanics <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> {{would have caused}} the ship to capsize earlier than she actually sank {{by more than one}} half hour, confirming the findings of Bedford and Hacket.|$|R
25|$|Andrea Doria was {{designed}} with her hull divided into 11 watertight compartments, separated by steel bulkheads which {{ran across the}} width of her hull, rising {{from the bottom of}} the ship's hull up to A Deck. The only openings in the bulkheads were on the bottom deck, where watertight doors were installed for use by the engine crew and could be easily closed in an emergency. Her design specified that if any two adjacent compartments out of any of her 11 watertight compartments were breached, she could remain afloat. In addition, following the rules and guidelines set by the International Conference for Safety of Life at Sea of 1948, Andrea Doria was also designed to take a list, even under the worst imaginable circumstances, no more than 15°. However, the combination of the five flooded tanks on one side and the five empty tanks on the other left Andrea Doria with a list which within a few minutes of the collision exceeded 20°. While the collision itself penetrated only one of Andrea Dorias watertight compartments, the severe list would gradually pull the tops of the bulkheads along the starboard side below the level of the water, allowing seawater to flow down corridors, down stairwells, and any other way it could find into the next compartment in line. In addition, the collision had also torn into an access tunnel which ran from the generator room, which was located in the compartment directly aft of where the collision had happened, to a small room at the forward end of the tank compartment which contained the controls for the pumps for the tanks. It was here that there was a fatal flaw in Andrea Dorias design, as at the point where the tunnel went through the bulkhead separating the two compartments, no <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> was present. This allowed the generator room to flood rapidly, contributing to not only an increase in flooding, but also to a loss of electricity to the stricken liner.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{began to}} flood immediately, with water pouring in at an {{estimated}} rate of [...] per second, fifteen times faster than it could be pumped out. Second Engineer J. H. Hesketh and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett were both struck by a jet of icy water in No.6 boiler room and escaped just before the room's <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> closed. This was an extremely dangerous situation for the engineering staff; the boilers were still full of hot high-pressure steam {{and there was a}} substantial risk that they would explode if they came into contact with the cold seawater flooding the boiler rooms. The stokers and firemen were ordered to reduce the fires and vent the boilers, sending great quantities of steam up the funnel venting pipes. They were waist-deep in freezing water by the time they finished their work.|$|E
2500|$|Also, a [...] <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> {{may have}} been [...] "missing" [...] between {{bulkheads}} near the engine room, which was thought to have contributed to Andrea Dorias problems.|$|E
50|$|Chief gunner's mate {{on board}} the torpedo boat Winslow, for gallant and {{conspicuous}} conduct in the action at Cardenas, Cuba, May 11, 1898. Brady's energy in assisting to sustain fire, his efforts to repair the steering gear under fire, and his promptness in maintaining closed <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and hatches, was largely instrumental in saving the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Rogo {{leads the}} {{remaining}} survivors—Rosen, Martin, Nonnie, Susan, and Robin—through the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> {{and into the}} propeller shaft tunnel. They hear a noise from outside and bang on the hull to attract attention. The rescuers cut a hole through the hull, assist the sole group of six survivors from the ship, and fly them to safety.|$|R
50|$|The {{electromechanical}} equipment {{that supports the}} Adige-Garda Tunnel consists of grilles, <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and gates with associated control panels, and controls housed in special rooms. The gates are positioned on four intake windows. Each gate has a width of 9.50 m and {{is made up of}} two overlapping panels. The lower of the two panels is 3 m high and the upper one 5 m high.|$|R
2500|$|Exploration of Andrea Dorias impact area {{revealed}} that the Stockholms bow had ripped a much larger gash in the critical area of the large fuel tanks and watertight compartments of the Italian liner than had been thought in 1956. The question of the [...] "missing" [...] <b>watertight</b> <b>door,</b> although still unanswered, was probably moot: Andrea Doria was doomed immediately after the collision.|$|E
2500|$|LST-464 was {{converted}} into a [...] "first aid ship" [...] at Sydney, Australia, in 1943. These modifications included the installation in the tank deck bulkhead of a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> to allow access to the forward troop compartment from both the starboard and port sides of the ship. Spaces were also converted to receiving, sterilizer, and operating rooms. On the tank deck, 78 hospital beds, refrigerators, lockers, toilets and wash basins were installed. LST-464s medical staff was increased to six doctors, one dentist {{and a number of}} corpsmen.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{specifications}} for Point Banks included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction {{was used to}} save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of [...] helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an [...] maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces {{were a part of}} the original design for the Point-class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was [...] long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.|$|E
25|$|Mallison and Chapman {{spent the}} first few hours sorting out the {{submersible}} which was almost upside down. They checked all the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> for leaks and prepared for rescue to come. To preserve oxygen {{they knew they had}} to make as little physical exertion as possible, not even speaking. They made themselves as comfortable as possible as high up as they could get to avoid the foul air that sank down.|$|R
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b> This {{theory suggests}} that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled {{on an even keel}} and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|R
25|$|Each {{engine was}} located in a {{separate}} watertight engine compartment. In case of a hull breach in that area, only one engine room would then be flooded, and the ship would still have use of the adjacent engine. In addition to this Lucania had 16 transverse watertight compartments, with <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> that could be manually closed on command from the telegraph on the bridge. She could remain afloat with any two compartments flooded.|$|R

50|$|The {{entrance}} to the Swimming Pool is blocked by a closed <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> along the bulkhead.

25|$|Others {{called to}} give {{testimony}} included Phillip A. S. Franklin, Vice President of International Mercantile Marine Co., the shipping consortium headed by J. P. Morgan that controlled White Star Line. The inquiry concluded with Smith visiting Titanics sister ship Olympic in port in New York on 25 May 1912, where he interviewed {{some members of}} the crew and inspected the ship's system of <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and bulkheads, which was identical to that of Titanic.|$|R

50|$|In November 1969, she {{underwent}} a £40,000-refit at Lamonts. The tearoom was upgraded to a cafeteria/restaurant with a proper galley. The observation lounge was refurbished and additional crew cabins were provided. <b>Watertight</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted {{forward of the}} hoist and the side ramps were remodelled to better fit piers on her new service at Islay. She lost her Caley lions and was repainted in MacBrayne colours, although only briefly operated by that company.|$|R
