5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, {{the main}} {{industries}} in the town were flax spinning and linen weaving. To cope with increasing imports of flax, timber and hemp, and exports of coal, salt and linen, between 1843 and 1846 a new <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> and pier was built at the harbour. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer, Michael Nairn, took out a licence on Frederick Walton's patent {{for the production of}} floorcloth, and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead. When the patent expired in 1876, Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of linoleum. Production of both floorcloth and linoleum occupied seven factories in the town by 1883, employing 1,300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908, for another increase in linoleum and coal.|$|E
25|$|The Ipswich docks area ("the waterfront") is now devoted {{primarily}} to leisure use and includes extensive recent development of residential apartment blocks and a university campus. Businesses operated {{from the dock}} include luxury boats and a timber merchant. Other industries have been established {{to the south of}} the <b>wet</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the new foundations and superstructure, the <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> at river level was also converted into a dry dock and the aqueduct between the lift and the canal was strengthened. The original caissons were retained, but were modified to take the wire ropes that now supported them on each side.|$|E

50|$|In the 18th century {{there were}} major harbour {{improvements}} with dredging of channels {{and construction of}} piers. <b>Wet</b> <b>docks</b> were built at London, Liverpool, Hull and Bristol.|$|R
50|$|Another Dredge {{suspension}} bridge in India was erected over {{the entrance to}} the <b>wet</b> <b>docks</b> at Kidderpoor near Calcutta in c1845. This had a 120 ft central span and a 24 ft wide platform.|$|R
25|$|Work {{began in}} Spring 2004 with the {{excavation}} of Chavasse Park, and construction began in Autumn the same year. Early works incorporated archaeological investigations, as Chavasse Park covered {{the ruins of}} buildings destroyed in World War II bombing, and the Canning Place car park was {{on the site of}} the Old Dock, the world's first <b>wet</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|E
25|$|The harbour was {{catering}} for {{the growing}} trade of imports of flax, timber and hemp and exports of coal, salt and linen cloth, when {{a decision was made}} to build a new <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> and pier from 1843–46. The subsequent demands for linoleum and coal led to a further extension from 1906–08 {{in the form of an}} inner dock.|$|E
25|$|From the 1720s, Greenland whalers {{also used}} the dock and {{substantial}} blubber boiling houses were built to produce oil on the south side. Howland Great <b>Wet</b> <b>Dock</b> was sold by the fourth Duke of Bedford in 1763. Extensive usage by the Greenland whaling ships prompted the dock to be renamed Greenland Dock. However, this trade declined sharply {{by the start of}} the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|One major {{innovation}} of the Jourdan {{series was}} {{the atmosphere of}} the places where he would go to. Whereas previous series like The Adventures of Tintin were based in spotlessly clean homes and locations, Jordans world was made up of dusty offices, littered streets, <b>wet</b> <b>docks</b> and mud-splattered farms.|$|R
50|$|Lighthouse {{engineer}} Robert Stevenson {{oversaw the}} later {{construction of the}} outer breakwaters, which were completed in 1863. Thereafter the Resident Engineer was John Howkins, followed by his son, also John Howkins. The original concept to create two large <b>wet</b> <b>docks</b> on the landward side was abandoned as this proved impractical.|$|R
50|$|The {{first six}} were {{published}} together in 1797 as A Collection of Tracts on <b>Wet</b> <b>Docks</b> for the Port of London, with Hints on Trade and Commerce and on Free Ports. They were republished in 1839, with the Comparative Statement and other pieces as Tracts on Docks and Commerce, printed between 1793 and 1800.|$|R
25|$|As {{trade from}} the West Indies, {{including}} sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, {{and as the}} River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> was built in Liverpool in 1715. Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were {{at the forefront of}} the abolitionist movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{improvement}} at West Wemyss was welcome, but {{it remained}} {{a small and}} inconvenient harbour, {{and the absence of}} any modern facility in the area led eventually to the formation of the Leven Harbour Dock and Railway Company by Act of Parliament on 24 July 1876. As well as construction of a <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> at Leven, the company was to build a five furlong railway from the Leven and East of Fife Railway at Leven station. The construction cost £40,000 and was completed in November 1879. The branch railway was worked by the North British Railway, which by this time had taken over the Leven and East of Fife Railway company. From the outset Leven Harbour suffered from silting and continuous dredging was required, and it was not profitable.|$|E
25|$|Robert Milligan (c. 1746-1809) {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for the construction of the West India Docks. Milligan was a wealthy West Indies merchant and shipowner, who returned to London having previously managed his family's Jamaica sugar plantations. Outraged at losses due to theft and delay at London's riverside wharves, Milligan headed a group of powerful businessmen, including the chairman of the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants, George Hibbert, who promoted the creation of a <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> circled by a high wall. The group planned and built West India Docks, lobbying Parliament to allow the creation of a West India Dock Company. Milligan served as both Deputy Chairman and Chairman of the West India Dock Company. The Docks were authorised by the West India Dock Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3, c. lxix) - the first parliamentary (as opposed to a municipal) Act for dock building.|$|E
5000|$|As France {{began to}} pose {{more of a}} {{military}} threat to England, the strategic importance of Portsmouth grew. In 1689, Parliament ordered one new dry dock and two new <b>wet</b> <b>docks</b> (or non-tidal basins) to be built there; work began in 1691. (A building slip was also constructed, where the Mary Rose is now in No. 3 dock.) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{very small}} village at Barrow grew {{into one of}} about 2,000 serving the ore-export {{facility}} there, with the Furness Railway effectively responsible for the settlement. The FR took over Barrow Harbour from its Commissioners in 1863 to allow the construction of <b>wet</b> <b>docks</b> at Barrow; in 1864 it obtained powers to supply Barrow and the surrounding district with gas and water.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>docks</b> (usually called basins) often {{accommodated}} ships {{while they}} were being fitted out. The number and size of dockyard basins increased dramatically in the steam era. At the same time, large factory complexes, machine-shops and foundries sprung up alongside for the manufacture of engines and other components (not to mention, in due course, the metal hulls of the ships themselves).|$|R
25|$|As a major British port, {{the docks}} in Liverpool have {{historically}} been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts {{have occurred in the}} city including the construction of the world's first enclosed <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes. The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain. Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered {{to be one of the}} most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.|$|E
2500|$|The West India Docks, {{built on}} the Isle of Dogs, was the first large wet docks built in the Port of London. Between 1800 and 1802 a <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> area of [...] was created with a depth of , and {{accommodating}} 600 ships. Jessop was the Chief Engineer for the docks, with Ralph Walker as his assistant.|$|E
2500|$|The port {{obtained}} {{its current}} appearance after 1856 and {{the inauguration of}} the <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> and the lock. In 1860, the first wooden casino, built by former Mayor Méquin, was inaugurated. In 1865, {{it was followed by}} the hospice of St. Peter. In 1866, Victor Chesnais composed a hymn for his town, [...] "La Granvillaise", adapted in 1868 at the theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Greenland Dock is {{the oldest}} of London's {{riverside}} <b>wet</b> <b>docks,</b> located in Rotherhithe {{in the area of}} the city now known as Docklands.

Greenland Dock is now used purely for recreational purposes; [...] it is one of only two functioning enclosed docks on the south bank of the River Thames.|$|R
50|$|In 1796, Reveley made four {{proposals}} to straighten the River Thames between Wapping and Woolwich Reach in east London. A new channel across the Rotherhithe, Isle of Dogs and Greenwich peninsulas {{would reduce the}} river's length, improve flow to remove pollution, and simplify navigation. Three large horseshoe bends of the river would have been left as huge <b>wet</b> <b>docks,</b> connected to the new channel through locks. Parliament rejected all four proposals.|$|R

2500|$|The dock was {{originally}} laid out between 1695 and 1699 on land {{owned by the}} aristocratic Russell family of the 1st Duke of Bedford.

They immediately set about [...] "improving" [...] the rural property, obtaining parliamentary permission in 1695 to construct a rectangular dock with an area of about , capable of accommodating around 120 ships. It was named Howland Great <b>Wet</b> <b>Dock</b> in honour of John Howland. Designed by local shipwright, John Wells, the dock was intended to refit [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{volume of}} traffic through the lift grew {{steadily}} through the 1880s and 1890s, but the hydraulic cylinders continued to cause problems. The gland of one cylinder (where the piston travelled through the cylinder wall) was temporarily repaired in 1887 and replaced in 1891, and the gland of the other cylinder was replaced in 1894. The main cause for concern was corrosion of the pistons. The use of canal water as a working fluid in the hydraulic system and the immersion of the pistons in the <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> at river level led to corrosion and [...] "grooving" [...] of the pistons. Attempts to repair the grooves with copper made matters worse as it reacted electrolytically with the acidic canal water and hastened corrosion of the surrounding iron. In 1897 the lift was converted to use distilled water as its working fluid, slowing corrosion, but not stopping it completely. Over {{the next few years}} maintenance and repairs took place with increasing frequency, requiring complete closure of the lift for several weeks or a period of reduced and slower operation with a single caisson.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 18th century, {{the major}} port in {{northwest}} England was Chester. [...] However silting of the River Dee prevented access to Chester and in 1708 Thomas Steers was commissioned {{to build the}} first <b>wet</b> <b>dock</b> in Liverpool. [...] By 1710 Liverpool had become the third largest port in the country contributing £50,000 in customs revenue. During the early-mid 18th century the major materials passing through Liverpool were salt from Cheshire and coal from the Lancashire coalfields. [...] Other important materials were building stone, roofing slates from North Wales, and ores, particularly copper ore, from Anglesey. [...] Later came imports of cotton, timber and grain to Manchester, and potters' materials to The Potteries. [...] These materials were carried mainly by flat-bottomed barges known as Mersey flats. [...] In the mid-Mersey area communications were being improved {{by the development of}} inland waterways, including the Sankey Canal from St Helens to Warrington which was completed in 1757, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, the act for which achieved Royal Assent in 1720, and the Bridgewater Canal from Manchester to Runcorn, which opened throughout its length in 1776.|$|E

Whereas previous series like The Adventures of Tintin are based in spotlessly clean homes and locations, Jourdan's world is made up of dusty offices, littered streets, <b>wet</b> <b>docks</b> and mud-splattered farms. Fast and furious car chases also added to its popularity.|$|R
25|$|Three {{principal}} {{kinds of}} <b>docks</b> existed. <b>Wet</b> <b>docks</b> were where ships were laid up at anchor and loaded or unloaded. Dry docks, which were far smaller, took individual ships for repairing. Ships were built at dockyards along the riverside. In addition, {{the river was}} lined with innumerable warehouses, piers, jetties and dolphins (mooring points). The various docks tended to specialise in different forms of produce. The Surrey Docks concentrated on timber, for instance; Millwall took grain; St Katharine took wool, sugar and rubber; and so on.|$|R

60|$|Between {{the point}} of the first or main wall is the {{entrance}} into the port, and the second or opposite wall, breaking the violence of the sea from the entrance, the ships go into the basin as into a pier or harbour, and ride there as secure as in a millpond or as in a <b>wet</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|E

Immediately one of the rowers or seamen starts up in the boat, and, throwing his arms abroad as if he had been bewitched, cries out as loud as he could bawl, [...] "A school! a school!" [...] The word was taken to the shore as hastily as it would have been on land if he had cried [...] "Fire!" [...] And by that time we reached the quays the town was all in a kind of an uproar.|$|E
