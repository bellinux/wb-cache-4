5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to end.|$|E
5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sitting and, when you are gone, attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth {{would be unable to}} see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

25|$|Achieving city {{status in}} 1484, Galway celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway {{in itself is}} not {{particularly}} known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene. This is partly because 25% {{of the population of}} Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from NUI Galway and GMIT, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway {{is said to be the}} most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> likely to hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the Gaeltacht area of Connemara is only a few kilometres away. The biggest lake in the country, Lough Corrib, is situated north of the city. The ferry to the Aran Islands is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of Rossaveal regularly. The Aran Islands are located in Galway Bay, and the Irish Language is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a bit from the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.|$|E

500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> that all of the little tricks that we needed sort of go away. And hopefully when you see it on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the story}} is told by the songs, with the lyrics {{coordinating}} with the events {{of the story}}. For example, [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line [...] "we will both be sorry"; this is unsung by the characters, but nonetheless emphasise in the episode. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing [...] "don't you want me?" [...] when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including [...] "Don't forget it's me who put you <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> now // And I can put you back there too".|$|E

[...] Raymond says [...] "I started slowing it down," [...] he went on, [...] "enjoying the places I went, going to museums, understanding the nature of what artists were trying to say."
