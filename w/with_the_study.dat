5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
5|$|Howe and Murray {{returned}} to England in 1778. Howe was disaffected by his experiences of command in North America, and consequently did not bestow patronage on those junior officers under his command, {{as was the}} custom. Instead a friend of Murray's father, Captain George Montagu arranged for him {{to draw up a}} record of his service and good conduct in the North American campaign, which was then passed on to the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 19 November 1778, and quickly received his commission on 31 December that year. He was to be second lieutenant aboard the 32-gun , under Captain Charles Holmes Everitt. It was to be a short-lived appointment as on 19 March 1779 she ran aground and was wrecked on the Breton coast while chasing a French frigate. Murray was captured and became a prisoner of war, spending the next two years in captivity and occupying himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of the French language and naval regulations. He was released and exchanged {{when he came to the}} attention of the French authorities after chastising an American privateersman for wearing a British uniform.|$|E

5|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} summer camp at Fort Clinton, MacArthur had the cadets trained to use modern weapons by regular army sergeants at Fort Dix; they then marched back to West Point with full packs. He attempted to modernize the curriculum by adding liberal arts, government and economics courses, but encountered strong resistance from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes, {{the study of the}} campaigns of the American Civil War was replaced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of those of World War I. In History class, more emphasis was placed on the Far East. MacArthur expanded the sports program, increasing the number of intramural sports and requiring all cadets to participate. He allowed upper class cadets to leave the reservation, and sanctioned a cadet newspaper, The Brag, forerunner of today's West Pointer. He also permitted cadets to travel to watch their football team play, and gave them an allowance of $5 ($ in modern dollars) a month. Professors and alumni alike protested these radical moves. Most of MacArthur's West Point reforms were soon discarded but, in the ensuing years, his ideas became accepted and his innovations were gradually restored.|$|E
5|$|This view of {{language}} is associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, {{as well as in}} sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E
