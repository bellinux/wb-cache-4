5|$|Coastal Command {{had agreed}} to provide three {{squadron}}s of Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers. The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) contributed one squadron of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. RAF Bomber Command had some 300 bombers on standby for any operation. There were problems, however. The Swordfish were very slow, and fighter escort of the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>difficult.</b> The Beaufort squadrons were all spread out and it <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to bring them together. One squadron was based at Leuchers, Scotland, one at Thorney Island, Portsmouth, England, and one near St Eval, Cornwall, England.|$|E

5|$|According to Williams, {{the game}} <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to market, {{as the team}} wanted to prevent spoiling the {{narrative}} yet encourage people to buy the game. He added that the demo they released was unrepresentative of the final game. Williams expected the game to be sold through word of mouth promotion {{and that it would}} eventually become a cult classic.|$|E

5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps.

5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained {{that in the}} early days of Nightwish, it <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{affected}} area is extremely remote, distributing the relief supplies <b>was</b> <b>difficult.</b> Reaching some villages would require a five-hour drive over unpaved roads, some of which had collapsed or had been covered by landslides during the earthquake. Helicopters were used to provide supplies to some otherwise inaccessible areas.|$|E

5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked about how his {{upbringing}} <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> and impoverished.

5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

5|$|Communication to the Riviera Maya area <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> {{after the}} storm; not all {{cellular}} phones were receiving coverage to the area, land lines were down, and electricity was out. About 18,000people in 20 low-lying {{communities in the}} state of Tamaulipas, just south of the U.S.-Mexican border, were evacuated. Including losses sustained by the oil industry, damage in Mexico amounted to 8.87billion pesos ($834.3million).|$|E
