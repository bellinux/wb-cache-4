25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
500|$|Epstein's {{death in}} August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: [...] " [...] a strange time for us, when it's someone who've relied {{on in the}} business, where <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> involved." [...] Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, Magical Mystery Tour. Starr's growing {{interest}} in photography at the time led to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by McCartney.|$|E

Garfield recalled, [...] "I think all of [...] were in our backyards. We had two or three scenes with me talking over the fence, and there was one with us riding together on a motorcycle that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to shoot." [...] By mid-June, Mary Jane was cut from the film, with director Webb explaining it as [...] "a creative decision to streamline the story and focus on Peter and Gwen and their relationship." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 31, 2001, {{the band}} {{released}} the album, Artifact, which included several guest musicians, most notably former Moby Grape guitarist, Peter Lewis. Deemed the [...] "one <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to make", {{the album was}} a cohesive take on the band's psychedelic sound. In August 2002, the group toured Europe {{for the first time}} since 1968, with concerts in the UK and Greece and, in 2003, a DVD looking into the UK portion of their European tour, called Rewired, was released. Additional albums were released over the years, including the concept album, California, in 2004, and their most experimental album since The Electric Prunes's reformation, Feedback, in 2006.|$|E
500|$|In week two, the Giants {{defeated}} the San Diego Chargers 20–7 {{in front of}} 74,921 fans at Giants Stadium. The Giants led the Chargers 10–7 after three quarters before scoring 10 {{in the fourth quarter}} to put the game out of reach. Joe Morris rushed 30 times for 83yards and defensive backs Terry Kinard and Kenny Hill intercepted two passes each. Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts threw five second half interceptions. [...] "We took away their outside running game and their short passes", Giants' defensive coordinator Bill Belichick said. [...] "When Fouts tried to go deep, that's when we got interceptions." [...] The Giants dominated the Chargers in time of possession; 39 minutes 44 seconds to the Chargers' 20 minutes 16 seconds. The Giants defense forced eight turnovers overall, and held the Chargers to 41 rushing yards on 13 carries. After the game Fouts complimented the Giants defense, [...] "There was no comparing the Giants' defense with the Dolphins' defense (the Chargers scored 50 points and totalled 500yards against the Dolphins in week one). <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> anything established against the Giants. Momma said there would be days like this, and she was right." ...|$|E
500|$|Since retiring, Pelé has {{continued}} to be lauded by players, coaches, journalists and others. Brazilian attacking midfielder Zico, who represented Brazil at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup, stated; [...] "This debate about the player of the century is absurd. There's only one possible answer: Pelé. He's the greatest player of all time, and by some distance I might add". French three time Balon D'or winner Michel Platini said; [...] "There's Pelé the man, and then Pelé the player. And to play like Pelé is to play like God." [...] Joint FIFA Player of the Century, Argentina's 1986 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona stated; [...] "It's too bad <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> along, but he was an awesome player". Prolific Brazilian striker Romário, winner of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and player of the tournament; [...] "It's only inevitable I look up to Pelé. He's like a God to us". Four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo said: [...] "Pelé is the greatest player in football history, and there will only be one Pelé", while José Mourinho, two-time UEFA Champions League winning manager, commented; [...] "I think he is football. You have the real special one – Mr. Pelé." [...] Real Madrid honorary president and former player, Alfredo Di Stéfano, opined; [...] "The best player ever? Pelé. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are both great players with specific qualities, but Pelé was better".|$|E

2500|$|In music, the Scottish post-rock band Mogwai {{are named}} after the film's creatures: as for {{the reason for the}} band chose this as their name, their guitarist, Stuart Braithwaite, has stated that [...] "it has no {{significant}} meaning and we always intended on getting a better one, but like {{a lot of other things}} <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> round to it". Welsh singer and songwriter Rod Thomas performs under the name Bright Light Bright Light, which is a direct quote from the film.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{a saying}} that truth will out. I {{have come to}} doubt that saying. Nineteen years have elapsed, and despite our untiring efforts, we have failed to find the man who really did throw the bomb. Undoubtedly he was some {{emissary}} of the Iron Heel, but he has escaped detection. <b>We</b> have <b>never</b> <b>got</b> the slightest clew to his identity. And now, at this late date, nothing remains but for the affair {{to take its place}} among the mysteries of history.* ...|$|R

2500|$|He spent {{close to}} a year before {{production}} dressing in Morrison-like clothes, and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along the Sunset Strip. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of The Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's. Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of [...] "The End" [...] for the band's guitarist, Robby Krieger, who told him, [...] "I'm really glad they got 'The End'. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it." [...] However, Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek was less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed in Stone's interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|Parker later {{spoke of}} how his musical {{relationship}} with Canyons came to be: [...] "They used to run a label which Tame Impala used to sort of be on. We released a 12” vinyl with them once, on one side it had three Tame Impala songs {{and on the other}} it was the same three songs remixed by Canyons and that was really cool, it was a really casual relationship. We always talked about releasing things but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> round to it because I’d just go round to his house and talk about music for a while. So we never actually got anything pressed until we had signed with Modular and then we went back and did stuff with Canyons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, Connolly's {{mother went}} to meet him {{backstage}} after a Humblebums gig in Dunoon, where she {{was working in the}} cafeteria at Dunoon General Hospital. It was the second and final meeting between them since she abandoned Connolly. She had been living in the town with her partner, Willie Adams, with whom she had three daughters and a son. [...] "I went home to her house and stayed the night, instead of the hotel. The sadness is... She was a very nice woman, but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> along. We both tried to like each other, and I don't think she liked me very much. I don't regret it, but I'm sad about it. I wish I'd liked her. And I wish she'd liked me." ...|$|E

6000|$|That {{hour and}} twenty minutes went like a flash, for {{we had so}} much {{to say to each other}} that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> even <b>got</b> to the things we wanted to say. For instance, I began to tell her about King Solomon's Mines, which was a long story; and she to tell me what {{happened}} after we parted on the shores of the Red Sea. At least the first hour and a quarter went, when suddenly the door opened and Alfred in a somewhat frightened voice announced--"Mr. and Mrs. Atterby-Smith, the Misses Atterby-Smith and Mr. Atterby-Smith junior." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for the marquis, as he {{has never}} been {{friendly}} with us, it does not matter. He is, I have heard, a very tough sort of man; and my father is not likely to survive him.

2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked {{to put a lot of}} topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 {{version of}} Freddy Krueger {{appeared}} as a downloadable playable character for Mortal Kombat. He has become the second non-Mortal Kombat character {{to appear in the}} game with the other being Kratos from the God of War series (who was an exclusive character for the PlayStation 3 version, while Freddy was available across all versions of the game). The game depicts Krueger as a malevolent spirit inhibiting the Dream Realm who attacks Shao Kahn for [...] "stealing" [...] the souls of his potential victims. During the fight, he is pulled into the game's fictional depiction of the real world. The injured Krueger arms himself with two razor claws to continue to battle Kahn. Upon defeating him, Krueger is sent back to the Dream Realm by Nightwolf, where he continues to haunt the dreams of his human prey. In an interview with PlayStation.Blog, Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cited the character's violent nature and iconic status as reasoning for the inclusion in the game, [...] "Over the years, we’ve certainly had a number of conversations about guest characters. At one point, we had a conversation about having a group — imagine Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> a grip on how we would do it, whether they’d be DLC characters or what. We also wanted to introduce a character who was unexpected. This DLC thing opens the doors to realizing these ideas." [...] Krueger went on to become playable in the mobile edition of the game's sequel, Mortal Kombat X, alongside Jason from Friday the 13th. In October 2017, Krueger's 2010 version was released as a downloadable playable character in the seventh chapter of the asymmetric survival horror game Dead by Daylight, alongside Quentin Smith.|$|E

Of course I know my father better than people in general do. I have known {{that he was not}} what he seemed to be. It has always been my sorest trouble, that <b>we</b> have <b>never</b> <b>got</b> on well together. He has never liked me, and I {{have not been able to}} respect him.

5000|$|The {{content and}} {{arrangement}} of the material reflected a sharp division in the band which would lead to their breakup the following year; all the songs on side A were composed by Darryl Way (with some assistance from Ian Eyre) with lyrics by Sonja Kristina, while all those on side B were composed by Francis Monkman. Francis Monkman explained: [...] "Basically Darryl and I respect each others' work, but we don't really see eye-to-eye on most things. And <b>we</b> <b>never</b> really <b>got</b> the co-writing thing together. I wanted to get my first 'epic' together, {{so it looks like}} a split forming (at the time of the [...] "Second Album")." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{preparation}} for the writing and recording of the album, Wilson purchased about two thousand dollars' worth of marijuana and hashish. Carl summarized: [...] "To get that album Smile out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us.

[...] In 1976, Brian told journalist Timothy White: [...] "a lot of the stuff was what I call little ‘segments’ of songs, and it was a period when I was getting stoned, and so <b>we</b> <b>never</b> really <b>got</b> an album; <b>we</b> <b>never</b> finished anything! ... <b>We</b> were too fucking high, you know, to complete the stuff.
