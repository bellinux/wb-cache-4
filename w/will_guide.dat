5|$|Clock Tower is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game with}} 3D graphics. The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse {{to move the}} cursor on the screen. The cursor will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. Clicking in any location <b>will</b> <b>guide</b> the player character in that direction. Moving the cursor {{to the top of}} the screen will reveal the player's inventory. Clicking an item and then clicking an object on the screen will use the item on that object or in that location. Some items such as keys are used automatically when clicked.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{orders the}} {{survivors}} to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains {{him to the}} mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the Pearl to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover the heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett {{the heart and the}} Letters of Marque meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The Pearls crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain that <b>will</b> <b>guide</b> them: the resurrected Captain Barbossa.|$|E
25|$|The teleological argument, if flawed, still offers that {{critical}} {{distinction between a}} <b>will</b> <b>guided</b> by inclination and a <b>will</b> <b>guided</b> by reason. That <b>will</b> which is <b>guided</b> by reason, Kant will argue, is the will that acts from duty. Kant’s argument proceeds by way of three propositions, the last of which {{is derived from the}} first two.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{for lack}} of {{transportation}} and <b>willing</b> <b>guides,</b> few conquistadors set foot in Sagada during the Spanish Era, and a Spanish Mission was not founded until 1882.

5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which <b>will</b> <b>guide</b> future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E
5|$|The {{world is}} portrayed from a three-quarters {{overhead}} view. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints <b>will</b> <b>guide</b> the {{player in the}} early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and external storage.|$|E
5|$|With Kate {{convicted for}} Pope's murder, Merc plans {{a way for}} Faith to ambush the police convoy {{transporting}} her to prison, and Faith helps to free Kate. She gives Kate her comms unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he <b>will</b> <b>guide</b> her back to his hideout. When Faith returns to the hideout, she finds it in ruins, with Merc dying and Kate recaptured. In his dying words, Merc tells Faith that Kate {{is now at the}} Shard, which contains Mayor Callaghan's office and the servers that run the city's surveillance systems. With Miller's help, Faith is able to enter the Mayor's private offices, and destroys the servers that will unlock the rooftop security door. She gains access to the roof, but Miller is killed. On the roof, she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife. Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus, and {{has been part of the}} plan all along to lure the Runners out of hiding. When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter, Faith jumps on before it can leave, knocking Jacknife out of the helicopter to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process. Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter.|$|E
