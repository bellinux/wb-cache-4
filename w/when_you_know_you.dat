500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

Old Hoxton says he is the youngest Dux they have had these fifty years that he has known the school, and Mr. Wilmot said 'twas the most creditable examination he had ever known, and that I might tell papa so.

60|$|ZOO. What good {{have our}} counsels ever done you? You {{come to us}} for advice <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are in {{difficulties}}. But you never know you are in difficulties until twenty years after you have made the mistakes that led to them; and then it is too late. You cannot understand our advice: you often do more mischief by trying to act on it than {{if you had been}} left to your own childish devices. If you were not childish you would not come to us at all: you would learn from experience that your consultations of the oracle are never of any real help to you. You draw wonderful imaginary pictures of us, and write fictitious tales and poems about our beneficent operations in the past, our wisdom, our justice, our mercy: stories in which we often appear as sentimental dupes of your prayers and sacrifices; but you do it only to conceal from yourselves the truth that you are incapable of being helped by us. Your Prime Minister pretends that he has come to be guided by the oracle; but we are not deceived: we know quite well that he has come here so that when he goes back he may have the authority and dignity of one who has visited the holy islands and spoken {{face to face with the}} ineffable ones. He will pretend that all the measures he wishes to take for his own purposes have been enjoined on him by the oracle.|$|E
60|$|The {{second class}} of old {{people are not}} anecdotic; they are rather hearers than talkers, {{listening}} to the young with an amused and critical attention. To have this sort of intercourse to perfection, I think we must go to old ladies. Women are better hearers than men, to begin with; they learn, I fear in anguish, to bear with the tedious and infantile vanity of the other sex; and we will take more from a woman than even from the oldest man {{in the way of}} biting comment. Biting comment is the chief part, whether for profit or amusement, in this business. The old lady that I have in my eye is a very caustic speaker, her tongue, after years of practice, in absolute command, whether for silence or attack. If she chance to dislike you, you will be tempted to curse the malignity of age. But if you chance to please even slightly, you will be listened to with a particular laughing grace of sympathy, {{and from time to time}} chastised, as if in play, with a parasol as heavy as a pole-axe. It requires a singular art, as well as the vantage-ground of age, to deal these stunning corrections among the coxcombs of the young. The pill is disguised in sugar of wit; it is administered as a compliment--if you had not pleased, you would not have been censured; it is a personal affair--a hyphen, a trait d'union, between you and your censor; age's philandering, for her pleasure and your good. Incontestably the young man feels very much of a fool; but he must be a perfect Malvolio, sick with self-love, if he cannot take an open buffet and still smile. The correction of silence is what kills; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> have transgressed, and your friend says nothing and avoids your eye. If a man were made of gutta-percha, his heart would quail at such a moment. But when the word is out, the worst is over; and a fellow with any good humour at all may pass through a perfect hail of witty criticism, every bare place on his soul hit to the quick with a shrewd missile, and reappear, as if after a dive, tingling with a fine moral reaction, and ready, with a shrinking readiness, one-third loath, for a repetition of the discipline.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{manifestation of}} the scarcity heuristic is the fear of losing access to some resource resulting from the possession of a small or diminishing quantity of the asset. For example, your favorite shirt becomes more valuable <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> cannot replace it. If you had ten shirts of the same style and color, losing one would likely be less distressful because you have several others to take its place.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Stephan Jenkins published in Billboard in 1998, he explained: [...] The song’s inspiration came about when Third Eye guitarist Kevin Cadogan was tinkering around with an autoharp, ‘which is a vintage-sounding instrument that you can’t really play without it having a sort of nostalgic sound to it. That inspired this emotional condition in me,’ Jenkins says. That condition surrounds the idea of lost love, of realizing that there may come a despairing day when the two meet and no longer know each other. ‘I think we all feel violated when we find that a relationship actually has time limits, that it’s not unconditional. That’s the thing that aches in people,’ he explains. ‘That’s something everybody can relate to, even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> have no business being with this person anymore.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|Tolstoy {{is one of}} {{the giants}} of Russian literature; his works include the novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina and novellas such as Hadji Murad and The Death of Ivan Ilyich. His contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. Fyodor Dostoyevsky thought him the {{greatest}} of all living novelists. Gustave Flaubert, on reading a translation of War and Peace, exclaimed, [...] "What an artist and what a psychologist!" [...] Anton Chekhov, who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, [...] "When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature." [...] The 19th-century British poet and critic Matthew Arnold opined that [...] "a novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life".|$|E
