50|$|The Social Environment Enhances the Educational Environment. Scholars have {{obtained}} mixed {{results on the}} effectiveness of collaborative learning. While some studies have found that collaborative learning may contribute to educational outcomes, other studies have noted that, in cases <b>where</b> <b>learners</b> <b>must</b> confront a wide range of complex information, individual and teacher-directed learning may be preferred by students as a coping mechanism. Because JRI educational policy assumes that there are no formal teachers in research past a certain level of learner expertise, traditional methods of teacher lecture are not employed. The policy does, however, take into account the idea that external guidance should not be done away with completely. As such, instructors employ Socratic questioning on an individual level as a means of guiding students through the process of asking their own questions in the face of ambiguity. It is expected that by the time a student graduates from phase 1, he or she will know not only what to expect from laypersons during the former’s demonstration of specialized knowledge, but also how to best prepare for the demands of research in a way that fits their individual learning style.|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{learning}} {{theories and}} their implementations associated with {{information and communication}} technologies increasingly integrate social constructivist approaches in order to assist and facilitate the construction of knowledge. Social constructivism also highlights the important role of culture, learning attitude and behavior in the cognitive process. Modern e-learning systems need to include these psychological aspects in addition to knowledge construction in order to connect with long-standing pedagogical issues such as the decrease and lack of motivation for education. Motivation is a central part of educational psychology and {{plays an important role in}} Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environment. A prominent factor of motivation consists in the strong connection between pedagogical goals and purposes for learning because learners want to know the reasons why learning is important for them, to make it more meaningful. However, although pedagogical institutions provide structured curricula with specific outcomes, students are often unable to relate to these goals as they have various conceptual perceptions and learning purposes. This issue has even more consequence in informal and self-regulated learning environments <b>where</b> <b>learners</b> <b>must</b> monitor their own actions, motivation, and goals. Contemporary CSCL applications need therefore to integrate a larger social presence in order to provide more diverse purposes for achieving a shared goal. Current social networking services (SNS) provide a platform where peers can for instance express their passion, emotion and motivation towards learning. This research utilizes therefore this platform to recommend motivational contents from peers for learning motivation enhancement (i. e. learners’ perception of their goal and purpose for learning). The proposed system consists of an SNS platform for learners to 1) express and evaluate their own goals for learning, 2) observe diverse motivational messages expressed by peers who share a same goal and recommended by an LDA-based (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model, and 3) evaluate their perceptions on motivational attributes after each observation. This platform initially requires a database of messages from peers publicly expressing on SNS their own purposes for learning various subjects. This part of the research focuses on collecting and analyzing messages from Twitter to determine linguistic features used to construct the meaning of expressing diverse learning purposes. The recommender system was implemented as a Web-based application using SNS environment to conduct an experiment over a semester, with students who could observe purposes expressed by other peers. Results compared evaluations from 77 students on motivational attributes before and after observing diverse or similar purposes from peers. Participants who observed diverse purposes significantly and positive enhanced their motivational perceptions, such as on goal specificity, attainability and on the confidence to achieve the desired outcome. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve {{educator}} knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of blended learning in higher education. Design/methodology/approach – A longitudinal case study approach is adopted. Three case studies each involve tracking a student evaluations of teaching (SET) measure (willingness to recommend) and grade point average for three subjects from the same business discipline over six years. The cases involve comparison of: a business subject taught solely online; a business subject where experimentation in the blend of face-to-face teaching and learning is involved; and a business subject where face-to-face teaching is primarily used, and where in the most recent iteration online content supplements the learners 2 ̆ 7 experiences. Findings – The findings suggest that there are situations where integrated use of blended learning involving face-to-face teaching, digital media and digital communication with simple navigation between the content items leads to positive student perceptions. This is in contrast to negative student perceptions in the situation <b>where</b> <b>learners</b> <b>must</b> navigate in online learning, and where there is little or no face-to-face instruction. While not examined in detail, nor part of the research question, it is not surprising to find no relationship between learning mode and grade point averages is evidenced. Research limitations/implications – The effects of prior computer literacy and language proficiency across the students used in this study, and potential demographic and experiential differences between on-campus and off-campus students are not controlled for. Additionally, only three business subjects are investigated and it is recognised that there is a need for a broader study. Finally, with response levels to the university-controlled SET that typically range between 20 - 43 per cent for these large subjects, there is possible non-response bias that it was not possible to counter over the six years involved. Practical implications – The findings in this study suggest that while blended learning offers many benefits to higher education institutions and learners alike, care needs to be taken in the manner in which such approaches are implemented in light of possible negative learner perceptions where a less traditional approach is taken. Originality/value – A major contribution of this study is the fact that experimentation has taken place in terms of the degree of face-to-face and online learning that have been blended in at least one subject (case study two), and the fact that the SET for this subject are compared, longitudinally, with two other subjects which lie on either side of this subject in terms of the extent of online and face-to-face teaching and learning employed – 100 per cent online in case study one and almost 100 per cent face-to-face in case study three. <br /...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel solution for modeling professional bimodal hybrid training {{based on the}} ontological engineering and the pedagogical competencies approach.

40|$|Proactive Learning is a {{generalized}} form of active learning <b>where</b> the <b>learner</b> <b>must</b> {{reach out to}} multiple oracles exhibiting different costs and reliabilities (label noise). One of the its major goals is to capture the cost-noise tradeoff in oracle selection. Sequential active learning exhibits coarse accuracy {{at the beginning and}} progressively refine prediction at later stages. The ability to learn oracle accuracies over time and select better oracles or oracle ensembles lead to potentially faster error reduction rate as a function of total cost, and thus improve its cost complexity. To realize this potential, we propose a statistical model that adapts to a range of accuracies at different stages of active learning. In a more general scenario, we formulate the problem as maximum submodular coverage subject to a budget envelope. This research is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation.

Introduction [...] The learner as discursive {{practitioner}} [...] The curriculum [...] The learners [...] Researching {{the curriculum}} [...] Interaction {{in the curriculum}} [...] Conclusion. The study is {{an account of the}} conceptualisation, design, implementation and evaluation of an innovative curriculum in an EFL (English as a Foreign Language) proficiency program in Japan. The study takes the form of an interpretative case study and monitors classroom interaction of learners who are 'false beginners' (British tradition) or 'interactive novices' (US tradition) in a process syllabus, <b>where</b> <b>learners</b> <b>must</b> 'co-construcf, or negotiate together, the planning, management, presentation and evaluation of substantial elements of the curriculum, in peer groups. A central element is the theorising of discourse in terms of a system of social relations and symbolic power; as a mode of social practice, and focuses on contrasting subject positions of learners and their investment in classroom discourse in different EFL settings. In this way, the crucial issue is the translation of power and control into principles of communication, which become their carriers or relays (Bernstein 1996 : 93). [...] The context of the study is the transition of young Japanese learners from the foreign language pedagogic practices of high school to university. It therefore includes a critical review of the sociocultural context of foreign language pedagogy in Japanese high schools, and the way that the pedagogic subject tends to be constructed: restricted to responsive roles, often in the learners' first language. The innovative curriculum described here (hereafter the Kanda Curriculum) is a response to this situation and aims to transform learners' institutional experience of foreign language pedagogy by shifting the locus of discursive control ('framing') away from the teacher to the learners, involving a very different 'speech exchange system' (Sacks et al. 1974) and hence more active/signifying and less responsive roles by learners. A pivotal assumption is the Foucaultian idea (1969) that a change in the order of discourse is not a trivial change, it amounts to a transformation in social practice and hence consciousness of the individual. [...] The curricular goal is to provide opportunities for learners to engage in sustained collaborative problem-solving in the target language, which stands in contrast with the more usual implicit goal of learners' 'acquiring' a second or foreign language. The curriculum is aimed at a prospective identity for learners; one which is built around the idea of the acquisition of 'communication': actively signifying in the target language across a range of situations and activities. [...] The research component of the study empirically explores how different activities in the curriculum differentially afford opportunities for participation by learners; in other words, how the 'contexts' of talk and activity mutually (re) configure each other, and empirical links between activity and discourse types are demonstrated and discussed. In this way, the thesis explores the potential for communicative practices in foreign language education, and is especially relevant to relatively monolingual societies where the target language is seldom used in the wider community.

40|$|Abstract In most {{problem-solving}} activities, {{feedback is}} received {{at the end}} of an action sequence. This creates a credit-assignment problem <b>where</b> the <b>learner</b> <b>must</b> associate the feedback with earlier actions, and the interdependencies of actions require the learner to remember past choices of actions. In two studies, we investigated the nature of explicit and implicit learning processes in the credit-assignment problem using a probabilistic sequential choice task with and without a secondary memory task. We found that when explicit learning was dominant, learning was faster to select the better option in their Wrst choices than in the last choices. When implicit reinforcement learning was dominant, learning was faster to select the better option in their last choices than in their Wrst choices. Consistent with the probabilitylearning and sequence-learning literature, the results show that credit assignment involves two processes: an explicit memory encoding process that requires memory rehearsals and an implicit reinforcement-learning process that propagates credits backwards to previous choices...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{learning}} in an online, bandit setting <b>where</b> the <b>learner</b> <b>must</b> repeatedly select among K actions, but only receives partial feedback based on its choices. We establish two new facts: First, using a new algorithm called Exp 4.

The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension d while incurring regret at most O(√(T(d(T) + (1 /δ)))) with probability 1 -δ. These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for the contextual bandit setting.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{competing}} with any large set of N policies in the nonstochastic bandit setting, <b>where</b> the <b>learner</b> <b>must</b> repeatedly select among K actions but observes only the reward of the chosen action. We present a modification of the Exp 4 algorithm of Auer et al. [2], called Exp 4. P, which with high probability incurs regret at most O (√ KT ln N). Such a bound does not hold for Exp 4 due to the large variance of the importance-weighted estimates used in the algorithm. The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. For the stochastic version of the problem, we can use Exp 4. P as a subroutine to compete with a possibly infinite set of policies of VCdimension d while incurring regret at most O (√ Td lnT) with high probability. These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing guarantees for this setting that are comparable to those in standard supervised learning...|$|R
40|$|Sequential {{prediction}} {{problems arise}} commonly {{in many areas}} of robotics and information processing. Examples of such problems include: 1) imitation learning, <b>where</b> a <b>learner</b> <b>must</b> predict a sequence of actions given observations revealed over time to perform a task, based on previously observed demonstrations; 2) structured prediction, which can often be tackled by constructing the structured output from a sequence of interdependent predictions as in SEARN [1]; 3) model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where we learn a model of a system from observations in order to predict its behavior under various action sequences for planning. Learning in such sequential problems is challenging as the predictor and data-generation process are inextricably intertwined. This often leads to a significant mismatch between the distribution of observed data during training and test executions (see Figure 1). Naively applying statistical learning methods can yield a predictor that makes good predictions during training but performs badly at the task during test execution. Figure 1 : Example driving scenario. Training: an expert demonstrates how to drive. Testing: the learned predictor drives and, due to mistakes, ends up in new situations leading to poor behavior. We present a simple and general strategy to address this issue where learning occurs over repeated rounds of interaction. By applying no-regret online algorithms over these rounds of interaction...|$|R
