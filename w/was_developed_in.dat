Therefore, it needs precautionary approach to manage fisheries activity in that locations. The objectives {{of this study}} are to determine optimum allocation of fishing gears and fisheries development areas based on potential fishing gears in Jakarta Bay. The methods used in this study are Linear Goal Programming (LGP) and Locations Quotient (LQ). The result revealed that the potential fishing gears to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>were</b> pelagic danish seine, drift gillnet, boat lift net, set bottom long line, portable trap and muroami which have the optimum allocation for each fishing gear; 7 units, 98 units, 23 units, 18 units, 8547 units, and 798 units. The potential fishing gears for pelagic danish seine could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan and North Seribu Island Districts; drift gillnet could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Cilincing District; boat lift net could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan District; set bottom long line could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan District; portable trap could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Cilincing and South Seribu Island Districts while muroami could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan and South Seribu Island Districts...|$|R
