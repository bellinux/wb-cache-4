25|$|The {{advantages}} {{of this technology}} are potentially enormous. Well-coordinated fully automatic driving <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> efficient, with reduction in traffic jams and road accidents, which cost trillions {{per year in the}} US alone. Efficiency will also reduce energy consumption and thus pollution and climate change.|$|E

25|$|The loss of Freyr's sword has consequences. According to the Prose Edda, Freyr had {{to fight}} Beli without his sword and slew him with an antler. But the result at Ragnarök, {{the end of the}} world, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> serious. Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant Surtr and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated. In the Íslendingabók, Freyr's sword is known as Sumarbrandr.|$|E
25|$|Local {{planning}} restrictions {{combined with}} a lack of available surplus land mean that St Paul's is faced with progressively replacing obsolete buildings with new ones located in the same general area. The plan should eventually result in a large building footprint area increase as well as increasing the amount of staff housing. The number of car parking spaces will be reduced, but there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> available room for bicycles.|$|E
25|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} is {{used during}} a duochrome eye test {{to ensure that}} a correct lens power has been selected. The patient is confronted with red and green images and asked which is sharper. If the prescription is right, then the cornea, lens and prescribed lens will focus the red and green wavelengths just in front, and behind the retina, appearing of equal sharpness. If the lens is too powerful or weak, then one will focus on the retina, and the other <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> blurred in comparison.|$|E

25|$|Interstellar {{travel is}} the term used for {{hypothetical}} crewed or uncrewed travel between stars or planetary systems. Interstellar travel <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult than interplanetary spaceflight; the distances between the planets in the Solar System are less than 30 astronomical units (AU)—whereas the distances between stars are typically {{hundreds of thousands of}} AU, and usually expressed in light-years. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the speed of light; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both.|$|E
25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. Even {{if we do not}} know exactly what is going to come next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that there is a distinction, often confounded in acquisition research, between mapping a label to a specific instance or individual and mapping a label to an entire class of objects. This latter process is sometimes referred to as generalization or rule learning. Research has shown that if input is encoded in terms of perceptually salient dimensions rather than specific details and if patterns in the input indicate that a number of objects are named interchangeably in the same context, a language learner <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> likely to generalize that name to every instance with the relevant features. This tendency is heavily dependent on the consistency of context clues and the degree to which word contexts overlap in the input. These differences are furthermore linked to the well-known patterns of under and overgeneralization in infant word learning. Research has also shown that the frequency in co-occurrence of referents is tracked as well, which helps create associations and dispel ambiguities in object-referent models.|$|E

25|$|The show {{makes it}} clear that every Stargate {{originally}} had its own DHD, located {{directly in front of the}} gate and facing it. Over time, however, some DHDs have been damaged or lost. This has been the source of plot difficulties for the protagonists on several occasions, as it is still possible to travel to a Stargate that lacks a DHD, meaning that dialing home again <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult, if not impossible. One of the primary functions of the MALP that precedes an SG team is to confirm the presence of a DHD. In the absence of a DHD, a user must select the address by manually rotating the inner ring of the Stargate, and use an external power source, as the ring will not rotate unless it is energised. Pegasus Galaxy Stargates do not have a movable ring, so manually dialing these is impossible. Travelers can also emulate a DHD through a Dialing computer as present at Stargate Command. Remote dialers have been used by several races like the Goa'uld and Asgard in various episodes. As the Stargates in Stargate Universe are a different (less advanced model) the crew of the Destiny are forced to use such a device as no planet visited so far has any variation of DHD present.|$|E
500|$|Unlike common {{proselytising}} movements, has TJ mostly {{focused on}} making Muslims 'better and purer' and ideally [...] "religiously perfect", rather than {{preaching to the}} non-Muslims.

500|$|... "Back to the Pilot" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of the tenth season of the {{animated}} comedy series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 13, 2011. In [...] "Back to the Pilot", two of the show's main characters, baby genius Stewie and anthropomorphic dog Brian, both voiced by series creator Seth MacFarlane, use a time machine to travel {{back in time to}} the first episode of the series, [...] "Death Has a Shadow". Trouble ensues however, when Brian tells his former self about the September 11 attacks, causing the present to be dramatically changed, and ultimately resulting in a second civil war. The two must then prevent themselves from going back to the past in the first place, but soon realize that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult than they had originally thought.|$|E
500|$|Grips early issues {{attracted}} little notice. [...] The Hamilton Spectator {{declared it}} [...] "dull... When Grip dies, {{which will be}} soon, Toronto <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> cheerful.... Grip is what Punch would be with all the spirit left out". [...] Events arising from the Canadian federal election of 1872 shortly gave Bengough sufficient popular material to lampoon: accusations of bribery and other improprieties involving prime minister JohnA. Macdonald and business magnate Hugh Allan inflated into the Pacific Scandal, the most closely followed scandal in the young nation's history. [...] Macdonald's features lent themselves to caricature and gave Bengough the chance to proselytize. [...] Circulation rose to about 2,000 copies per issue at the time; Bengough's brother Thomas reported that each new issue was eagerly awaited at the House of Commons. [...] A 23 August 1873 cartoon entitled [...] "The Beauties of a Royal Commission: When shall we three meet again?" [...] drew praise from newspapers across Canada, {{as well as from}} Liberal MP Lucius Seth Huntington {{in a speech to the}} House of Commons.|$|E
500|$|The main {{thesis is}} that {{economic}} growth has slowed in the United States {{and in other}} advanced economies, {{as a result of}} falling rates of innovation. In Chapter 1, Cowen describes the three major forms of [...] "low-hanging fruit": the ease of cultivating free and unused land, rapid invention from 1880 to 1940 which capitalized on the scientific breakthroughs of the 18th and 19th centuries and the large returns from sending intelligent but uneducated children to school and university. There are potentially two further minor forms: cheap fossil fuels and the strength of the American constitution. Cowen concludes, [...] "You could say, 'The modern United States was built at five forms of low-hanging fruit, and at most only two of those are still with us.' Fair enough." [...] While they produced extremely large returns, future advances <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> incremental. He offers anecdotal and statistical illustrations for this slowdown. First, he compares the changes witnessed by his grandmother with those of his own generation. Then, he cites median income statistics: the rate of growth drastically slowed from 1973 onwards. He further argues that the failure to diagnose the trend has led to a degradation in political discourse since left and right leaning actors blame the policies of [...] "the other side" [...] and [...] "what I like to call the 'honest middle' cannot be heard above the din." ...|$|E

2500|$|Part of Sachs’ {{philosophy}} includes {{strengthening the}} International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the United Nations.
