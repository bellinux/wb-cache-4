Several planned stations in the New York City Subway may possibly feature platform screen doors, possibly including future stations such as those part of the Second Avenue Subway. Currently, the MTA is planning a test program to install screen doors at a subway station on the BMT Canarsie Line. As part of the 2010–2014 capital program, the station {{was going to be}} Sixth Avenue, but it is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> this will be the station chosen. Following a series of incidents during one week in November 2016, in which 3 people were injured or killed after being pushed onto the tracks, the MTA started to consider installing platform edge doors for the 42nd Street Shuttle.|$|E

25|$|An Independent Practice Association is a {{legal entity}} that {{contracts}} {{with a group of}} physicians to provide service to the HMO's members.

The contract is not usually exclusive so individual doctors or the group may sign contracts with multiple HMOs.

25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can decide <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given {{a central role in}} this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E

500|$|The town's {{years as}} a {{coalfield}} were unhappy. Living conditions {{in many of the}} hastily erected cottages were insanitary, lacking water and drainage. There was a serious outbreak of cholera in Jarrow and northeast England in the winter of 1831–32, as part of an epidemic that spread from Europe and resulted in more than 200 deaths in Newcastle alone. Relations in Jarrow between employer and employee were poor; workers were held by the [...] "bond" [...] system [...] whereby they were tied to a particular employer for a year, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> employer could provide work. Working conditions in the mines were dangerous: there were explosions in 1826, 1828 and 1845, each with large loss of life. Attempts by workers to organise into a trade union were fiercely opposed by the employers. Nevertheless, miners conducted lengthy strikes in 1832 and 1844, each ending when hunger forced them back to work. After the easier seams of coal were exhausted, the Jarrow pits became less profitable, and in 1851 the owners abandoned them altogether.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the new project, drummer Rob Bourdon said, [...] "We tend to be perfectionists and it's sort of how we work. We {{like being in the}} studio and when we get in there we write a ton of material." [...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E
500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of state courts accept {{that there must be}} a duty of care for there to be liability: the courts of Wisconsin, though, have stated that they have adopted Andrews' approach, and impose liability when there was a duty to any person, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> person is the plaintiff. The Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) amended the earlier formulation only slightly, but the third Restatement (2009), takes an approach closer to that of Andrews in focusing on whether the defendant engaged in an activity that carried a risk of harm to another (not necessarily the plaintiff), and on whether the defendant exercised reasonable care. The new formulation makes foreseeability, or the scope of the risk, not a hurdle that must be overcome, as in Palsgraf, but a factor to be weighed with others when determining whether there was negligence. Thus, according to law professor David Owen in his 2009 article, [...] "the Restatement (Third) discards Judge Cardozo's elemental work in Palsgraf so long ago. And... also rejects Judge Andrew's [...] valuable insight that juries should be offered a wide range of fairness factors, beginning with foreseeability, in figuring how far responsibility should extend".|$|E

500|$|Although not {{considered}} a [...] "ground breaking rule" [...] by some law reviewers, the case received responses from both proponents and opponents of gun control. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which was the only gun prevention group to file an amicus brief hailed the Court's decision as a victory over the “corporate gun lobby.” Dan Gross, {{the president of the}} Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated that the decision “will save lives by keeping guns {{out of the hands of}} dangerous people," [...] and that [...] "the Supreme Court rejected efforts by the corporate gun lobby to undermine federal gun laws, reaffirming that sensible laws can have a big impact while being consistent with the Second Amendment.” Adam Winkler, writing for New Republic, also supported the ruling, stating that it is a [...] "relief to law enforcement." [...] However, others, like the National Rifle Association (NRA), [...] criticized the ruling, stating that it [...] "seemingly allows the government to require virtually any information it wants from a person buying a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> information has any relationship to public safety or the policies of federal law." [...] John Lott, a gun rights advocate, criticized the Court's statement that collecting this [...] "information helps to fight serious crime," [...] claiming that registration doesn’t help solve crimes, since registered guns are rarely left at the scene. He noted, for example, that Hawaii's requirement to register guns hasn't solved a single crime in 50 years, though Lott cited no evidence to support his claim. According to Lott, the Court [...] "confirmed a horrible injustice, with no understanding of how gun tracing works, and without producing any increased safety for Americans." [...] A Harvard Law Review case note contended that, as a matter of law, the word [...] "person" [...] was properly interpreted by the majority, thus avoiding [...] "gutting key provisions of the statute," [...] and argued, against the dissent, that the majority's interpretation is also consistent with common English. However, the case note argued that a narrower reading of the second count was more appropriate, because the statute explicitly requires the name age and residence, and not anything else. Thus, the law review concluded, the Supreme Court established an unnecessary precedent.|$|E
