5|$|Cortana has a {{built in}} system of {{reminders}} which for example can {{be associated with}} a specific contact; it will then remind the user when in communication with that contact, possibly at a specific time or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> is in a specific location. Originally these reminders were specific to the device Cortana was installed on, but since Windows 10 Microsoft synchronises reminders across devices.|$|E
5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E
25|$|Most GSM {{mobile phones}} have 112, 999 and 911 as pre-programmed {{emergency}} {{numbers that are}} always available. The SIM card issued by the operator can contain additional country-specific emergency numbers {{that can be used}} even when roaming abroad. The GSM network can also update the list of well-known emergency numbers <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> registers to it.|$|E

25|$|Scandal {{erupted in}} June 1995 when a {{recording}} of a 1990 telephone conversation between Johnson and his friend Darius Guppy was made public. In the conversation, Guppy revealed that his criminal activities were being investigated by News of the World journalist Stuart Collier, and he asked Johnson to provide him with Collier's private address, seeking to have the latter beaten up. Johnson agreed to supply the information although he expressed concern {{that he would be}} associated with the attack. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> conversation was published in 1995, Johnson insisted that he did not ultimately give the information to Guppy; Hastings reprimanded Johnson's behaviour but did not sack him.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and [...] "wavy"-looking videos. The optical image stabilization system was also found to {{have been affected by}} accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning that magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.|$|E
500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E

2500|$|Zone Mail Hour, {{as it was}} named, varies {{depending}} on the geographic location of the node, and was designated to occur during the early morning. [...] The exact hour varies {{depending on}} the time zone, and any node with only one telephone line is required to reject human callers. In practice, particularly in later times, most FidoNet systems tend to accept mail {{at any time of}} day <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line is not busy, usually during night.|$|E

50|$|A flip or {{clamshell}} phone {{consists of}} two or more sections that are connected by hinges, allowing <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to flip open then fold closed in order to become more compact. <b>When</b> flipped open, <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> speaker and microphone are placed closer to the operator's ear and mouth, improving usability. <b>When</b> flipped shut, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> becomes much smaller and more portable than when it is opened for use.|$|R
50|$|Users {{can choose}} to protect their phone by {{enabling}} a PIN. <b>When</b> enabled, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> will prompt users to type the PIN, and on success <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> will grant access. Users can also protect their SIM card, which is standard phone practice.|$|R
2500|$|Ideomotor apraxia: [...] These {{patients}} have deficits {{in their ability}} to plan or complete motor actions that rely on semantic memory. [...] They are able to explain how to perform an action, but unable to [...] "imagine" [...] or act out a movement such as [...] "pretend to brush your teeth" [...] or [...] "pucker as though you bit into a sour lemon." [...] However, when the ability to perform an action automatically when cued remains intact, this is known as automatic-voluntary dissociation. For example, {{they may not be able}} to pick up a phone when asked to do so, but can perform the action without thinking <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> rings.|$|E
2500|$|Mobile phones {{can be used}} in {{countries}} with different emergency numbers. This means that a traveller visiting a foreign country does not have to know the local emergency numbers. The mobile phone and the SIM card have a preprogrammed list of emergency numbers. When the user tries to set up a call using an emergency number known by a GSM or 3G phone, the special emergency call setup takes place. The actual number is not even transmitted into the network, but the network redirects the emergency call to the local emergency desk. [...] Most GSM mobile phones can dial emergency numbers even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> keyboard is locked, the phone is without a SIM card, emergency number is entered instead of the PIN or there isn't a network signal (busy network).|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Hadfield was {{to record}} a video which would be {{broadcast}} during the unveiling ceremony, but on 7 March 2013, the plan was changed because an executive at the Bank of Canada wanted a live event. By 12 March, the new plan was in place. The plan was scripted to include press conference speeches by Jim Flaherty and Mark Carney, the latter {{of which would be}} interrupted by a phone call revealed to be from Hadfield. Contingency plans were created in case a communications link to the ISS could not be established (the [...] "green script"), or if it was interrupted or failed at any point (the [...] "blue script"). These were unnecessary, but Flaherty finished his speech early and requested the media to wait because [...] "something is supposed to happen", saying [...] "Hallelujah" [...] <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> rang.|$|E

2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard.
