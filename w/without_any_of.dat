5|$|Chandrasekaran, Gnanasekaran and Gunasekaran {{are three}} Indian {{immigrant}} brothers from Madurai, Tamil Nadu living in Rangoon, Burma with Chandrasekaran's wife Saraswati. Their younger sister Kalyani {{was raised in}} their home town by their father Manickampillai. In 1942, during World War II, the three brothers and Saraswati plan to visit Madurai to attend the impending wedding of Kalyani to a writer named Thangappan. Due to war conditions and bombardment of Burmese ports by Japan, the shipping company offers only one ticket and Gunasekaran, the youngest brother, takes it and leaves for Tamil Nadu. The ship fails to reach on time due {{to the dangers of}} the war, and Kalyani's marriage takes place <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> her brothers present.|$|E

He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.|$|E

5|$|Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin. Set in New York City in the 1930s, and {{designed}} {{in the style of}} Al Hirschfeld's known caricatures of the time, the story follows four individuals, Duke, Joe, Rachel, and John, who wish for a better life. The segment ends with all four getting their wish, though their stories interact with each other's <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them knowing. Introduced by Quincy Jones with pianist Ralph Grierson.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} October 9, the {{depression}} {{consisted of a}} circulation center <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the associated deep convection {{that is one of}} the prerequisites of being a tropical cyclone. Several hurricane forecast models predicted Kyle to weaken until dissipation. After 24hours without significant convection, thunderstorms reformed to the southeast of the center on October 10 as the depression entered an area of warmer water temperatures. Environmental conditions became more favorable, with weakening wind shear and decreasing dry air. The depression continued tracking around a ridge, turning to the west and west-northwest toward the coast of Florida. Convection increased markedly early on October 11 as it turned northward ahead of an approaching cold front, and Kyle regained tropical storm status about 35miles (60km) east of the border between Florida and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Colley Cibber was {{a rather}} {{unsuccessful}} young actor {{at the time of}} the split, with a squeaky voice and <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of Love's Last Shift, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the premi√®re of The Relapse could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in Love's Last Shift. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.|$|E

The Los Angeles Aqueduct had become the target of frequent sabotage by angry farmers and landowners in the Owens Valley and the city was eager to avoid any repeat of these expensive and time-consuming repairs.|$|E

25|$|The new, '{{national}} revolutionary' profile {{proved to}} be a non-starter for the electoral work of the party. For example, Niekisch's national revolutionary line had alienated the trade unionists in the textile industry, whom initially had supported the party. With their departure from the party, it lost whatever influence in the labour movement it once had. The party got 65,573 votes in the 1928 Reichtag election, but no seats. 35,000 of the votes had come from Saxony. After the election a new party programme was adopted, <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the 'national revolutionary' references.|$|E
