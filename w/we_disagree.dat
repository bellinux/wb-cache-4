We want Bianca to be with a woman (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn’t sure she was even queer and then left her for another woman). We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Ludwig Wittgenstein {{read the}} book as a schoolboy and was deeply {{impressed}} by it, later listing {{it as one of}} his influences and recommending it to friends. Wittgenstein is recalled as saying that he thought Weininger was [...] "a great genius". [...] However, Wittgenstein's deep admiration of Weininger's thought was coupled with a fundamental disagreement with his position. Wittgenstein writes to G. E. Moore: [...] "It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which <b>we</b> <b>disagree.</b> It is his enormous mistake which is great." [...] In the same letter to Moore, Wittgenstein added that if one were to add a negation sign before the whole of Sex and Character, one would have expressed an important truth; that is, he did not disagree with Weininger point by point but as a whole.|$|E

2500|$|This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed {{on several}} {{previous}} occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign journalists {{critical of the}} government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling Time, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, {{and we want to}} give our interpretation.' If <b>we</b> <b>disagree,</b> the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [...] go along, we are going to lose our power of legislation." [...] Mahathir also lashed out at [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent," [...] accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice Harun Hashim who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.|$|E
2500|$|Mahathir, who {{had never}} been fond of the judiciary, began making heated {{statements}} about it at this time. Mahathir declared, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and we want to give our interpretation.' If <b>we</b> <b>disagree,</b> the courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' ... We know exactly what we want to do, but once we do it, it is interpreted in a different way." [...] Mahathir also lambasted [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent" [...] and play to public opinion. Soon after, nine judges sitting on the High Court were reassigned to different divisions; Justice Harun Hashim, who presided over the UMNO case, was transferred from appellate and special powers cases to commercial crimes. However, because the UMNO case was already in progress, his transfer would not take effect until the case closed. Harun later ruled that under the evidence presented, it was clear several UMNO delegates had come from unregistered branches of the party. In line with the law, he declared he was forced to declare UMNO an illegal society, and thereby dismissed the case of the plaintiffs. Mahathir soon formed a new party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO), to replace UMNO. Within a year, the suffix [...] "Baru" [...] was dropped, making it just plain [...] "UMNO".|$|E

To infer a serious motive for your opponent's convictions, however wrong you may think them, can do you no harm: to infer a scoffing motive can do him no good.

6000|$|Looking {{round at}} these poor prisoners, therefore, {{it struck me}} as an immense absurdity that they should fancy us their enemies; since, whether we intend it so or no, they have a far greater stake on our success than we can {{possibly}} have. For ourselves, the balance of advantages between defeat and triumph may admit of question. For them, all truly valuable things are dependent on our complete success; for thence would come the regeneration of a people,--the removal of a foul scurf that has overgrown their life, and keeps then in a state of disease and decrepitude, one of the chief symptoms of which is, that, the more they suffer and are debased, the more they imagine themselves strong and beautiful. No human effort, on a grand scale, has ever yet resulted according to the purpose, of its projectors. The advantages are always incidental. Man's accidents are God's purposes. We miss the good we sought, and do the good we little cared for. [The author seems to imagine that he has compressed a great deal of meaning into these little, hard, dry pellets of aphoristic wisdom. <b>We</b> <b>disagree</b> with him.

I bow to intellect in every form: and we should be grateful to any school of philosophers, even if <b>we</b> <b>disagree</b> with them; doubly grateful in this country, where for so long a period our statesmen were in so pitiable an arrear of public intelligence. There has been an attempt to reconstruct society on a basis of material motives and calculations. It has failed. It must ultimately have failed under any circumstances; its failure in an ancient and densely-peopled kingdom was inevitable. How limited is human reason, the profoundest inquirers are most conscious. We are not indebted to the Reason of man for any of the great achievements which are the landmarks of human action and human progress. It was not Reason that besieged Troy; it was not Reason that sent forth the Saracen from the Desert to conquer the world; that inspired the Crusades; that instituted the Monastic orders; it was not Reason that produced the Jesuits; above all, it was not Reason that created the French Revolution. Man is only truly great when he acts from the passions; never irresistible but when he appeals to the imagination. Even Mormon counts more votaries than Bentham.' ...|$|E
