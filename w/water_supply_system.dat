5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system.</b> This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Landslides {{encompass}} smaller areas, develop on {{the steep}} cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly {{located in the}} artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija. However, {{the majority of the}} land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> (burst pipes, etc.). The neighborhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.|$|E

40|$|Issues {{related to}} {{improving}} the reliability of hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> are considered. Currently, centralized hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> are in an emergency condition {{due to the fact}} that the external networks are made of black pipes without anticorrosive coatings. A fundamental difference between hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> and heating systems is the nature of black metal corrosion. The purpose of this article is to conduct a research of the state of hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> and consider options for their recovery. The options suggested for restoration of hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> in cities and settlements of Ukraine are the following: complete replacement of failed networks with new pre-insulated plastic pipelines; refusal from external networks of centralized hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> and a central heat point with the installation of individual heat points in each house; decentralization of hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> by installing electric water heaters. A technical and economic comparison of these options is carried out, and the advantages and disadvantages of each option are considered. The arrangement of a set of individual heat points instead of one central point cannot be considered as the recommended method, because of the need for large additional costs for the reconstruction of heating, <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and electricity <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> The most technically and economically justified method from the considered renovation methods of hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> is the complete replacement of failed steel pipelines with new nonmetallic pre-insulated structures...|$|R
40|$|Part of the {{responsibility}} of maintaining the sanitary quality of individual <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> {{has been placed on}} the local sani-tarian of Oregon.

5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system.</b> The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water {{collected}} is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system.</b> Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} faced by residents of small urban towns globally is that of poor Water and Sanitation Service delivery. The management of urban water services has become very important {{in the wake of}} the cholera outbreak of 2008 - 09 which claimed more than 4000 lives in Zimbabwe. The outbreak was linked to poor WS systems delivery. The poor quality of service was attributed to the economic collapse of the country which to some extent affected the capacity of local councils to manage <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> services. The economic collapse also affected the capacity of residents to pay for water services. In the aftermath of the near collapse of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> in urban areas, the government directed the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) to take-over the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> in most of the urban areas, resulting in towns such as Gokwe and Karoi having their <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> managed by ZINWA. However, in some urban areas local councils retained the management of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> This study compares the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> of selected small urban towns in Zimbabwe which are Chipinge, Gokwe, Karoi and Rusape. Financial and governance aspects of water resources management are major contributors to the collapse or sustainability of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> and these were investigated. Data collection for the study was done through key informant interviews covering governance issues, revenue collection, water tariff setting processes, technical issues and stakeholder involvement in urban water management. A total of 765 household questionnaires investigating customer perceptions on service delivery, willingness and ability to pay, impact of water tariffs on household water use and stakeholder involvement in the management of urban <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> services were administered in the four towns. Both the ZINWA and council <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> management <b>systems</b> in the four towns were found to have active institutional and legal structures but service delivery was generally poor. Consistence of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> in the areas was found to be largely affected by recurrent power cuts while the breakdown of equipment affected <b>water</b> treatment and <b>supply</b> capacity. Although there was high meter coverage (ranging from 82 - 94 %) functionality of meters was low mostly for the council managed <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> Revenue collection was found to be very low accounting for less than 30 % of the billed amount for both <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> This was due to customersâ€Ÿ low willingness to pay for reasons which included poor service delivery, poor customer care service, inaccuracy of bills and poor water quality. Unaccounted for water was found to be above 30 % for council managed systems and less than 15 % for ZINWA managed <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> Findings also show that there is little involvement of stakeholders in the setting of water tariffs. In conclusion, power cuts, poor customer care services, increased unaccounted for water, low stakeholder participation among other things have contributed to poor service delivery and low revenue collection in the four towns. Stakeholder participation is critical for the sustainability of urban water management and <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> There was no significant difference in performance between Local council and ZINWA managed <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> because the performance indicators varied between the systems.,WATERne...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEnergy {{efficiency}} of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> in high-rise residential buildings becomes {{a concern for}} sustainable development nowadays. It has been reported the energy efficiency for high-rise <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> is below 25 % and more than 75 % input energy is ‘lost’, {{about half of the}} energy loss attributes to water pumps. Water pump operating at low efficiency is highly undesired. This paper investigates the in-use water pump efficiency for <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> in high-rise buildings of Hong Kong. The pumping efficiencies evaluated from a survey of 20 high-rise <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> were presented as a function of installation time. Expressions of in-use pump efficiency were proposed and pump replacement time was suggested. Better performed pumps got longer suggested service period and poorer performed ones got shorter payback periods.

5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a trickle. Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system,</b> but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E

5|$|Phoenix {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} {{response}} to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary <b>Water</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>System</b> (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses. At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.|$|E
