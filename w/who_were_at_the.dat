5|$|Early in his career, Peart's {{performance}} {{style was}} {{deeply rooted in}} hard rock. He drew most of his inspiration from drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, players <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of the British hard rock scene. As time passed, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experienced}} pilots <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{airport at}} the time of the accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles {{had failed to}} control Washington. During the trial, {{numerous}} players and coaches <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team {{to prevent him from}} suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.|$|E

5|$|Gourcuff {{began his}} career with Lorient, <b>who</b> <b>were,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, managed by his father Christian in 1992. During his time at Lorient, he also trained at PEF Ploufragan, a {{regional}} academy located in the Brittany region that trained players similarly to the Clairefontaine academy in the Île-de-France. Further to his father's departure to Stade Rennais, Gourcuff, who initially considered rivals Nantes, followed suit and signed an aspirant (youth) contract with the club in 2001. He {{spent two years in}} the club's youth academy and, while competing domestically in the system, Gourcuff played on the club's under-19 team that won the 2003 edition of the Coupe Gambardella. Rennes defeated Strasbourg 4–1 in the final match at the Stade de France. Gourcuff scored the club's opening goal. Included on that team with Gourcuff were future club and international teammates Jimmy Briand and Sylvain Marveaux.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Dave Russell {{joined the}} club from Bury <b>who</b> <b>were,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, two {{divisions}} above Tranmere. Considered a shrewd businessman, Russell made some revolutionary changes. He developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. More visibly, he introduced an all-white kit {{to set the}} team apart from local rivals, Division One club Everton; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. He also {{took advantage of the}} floodlights, regularly arranging home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays; Friday night games continued until the 1990s. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened. He became general manager in 1969, allowing Jackie Wright to take over.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when}} the club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E

5|$|Tipu's {{successful}} {{attacks in}} 1790 on the Kingdom of Travancore, a British ally, was an effective victory for him, however {{it resulted in}} greater hostilities with the British {{which resulted in the}} Third Anglo-Mysore War. In the beginning, the British made gains, taking the Coimbatore district, but Tipu's counterattack reversed many of these gains. By 1792, with aid from the Marathas who attacked from the north-west and the Nizam who moved in from the north-east, the British under Lord Cornwallis successfully besieged Srirangapatna, resulting in Tipu's defeat and the Treaty of Srirangapatna. Half of Mysore was distributed among the allies, and two of his sons were held to ransom. A humiliated but indomitable Tipu went about re-building his economic and military power. He attempted to covertly win over support from Revolutionary France, the Amir of Afghanistan, the Ottoman Empire and Arabia. However, these attempts to involve the French soon became known to the British, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time fighting the French in Egypt, were backed by the Marathas and the Nizam. In 1799, Tipu died defending Srirangapatna in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, heralding the end of the Kingdom's independence. Modern Indian historians consider Tipu Sultan an inveterate enemy of the British, an able administrator and an innovator.|$|E
