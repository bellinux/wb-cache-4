A major component of <b>wood</b> <b>smoke</b> is fine particles that may account for a large portion of particulate air pollution in some regions. During cooler months, wood heating accounts for as much as 60% of fine particles in Melbourne, Australia.|$|E

Studies {{indicate}} that 73% percent of air pollution in Launceston and surrounding areas during the winter period is caused by <b>wood</b> <b>smoke,</b> while about 8% is from motor vehicle pollution. During the early 1990s about 60% of households used wood heaters, but since the mid 2000s only 25–30% of households use wood heating. According to the 2011 Tasmanian Air Monitoring report, particulate matter met the Air NEPM goals starting in 2006, and did not exceed the PM10 standard in the years 2009–2011.|$|E

Some of the header faces are exposed to <b>wood</b> <b>smoke,</b> generating a grey-blue colour, while other simply vitrified until they reach a deeper blue colour. Some headers have a glazed face, caused by using salt in the firing. Sometimes Staffordshire Blue bricks are used for the heading bricks.|$|E

40|$|Protein {{quality is}} a long-accepted {{paradigm}} for human protein needs however the quality is affected with processing methods. The protein and amino acids content of poached or charcoal or <b>wood</b> <b>smoked</b> horse mackerel fish (HMF) were determined using standard methods. Chemical analyses {{were carried out}} on the processed fillet and skin, head and bone (SHB) diets under standard conditions. A total of 40 weaned male rats were fed with processed fillet or SHB diets for 12 days to assess protein quality and amino acids digestibility. Fish samples were also analyzed for protein efficiency ratio (PER), net protein ratio (NPR), Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Scores (PDCAAS), true and apparent protein digestibility (TPD and APD). Results showed that the <b>wood</b> <b>smoked</b> fillet had the highest PDCAAS regarding to the controls whereas PER, NPR and TPD was highest in SHB. The best results were obtained from animals fed on coal or <b>wood</b> <b>smoked</b> fillet/SHB on protein quality and amino digestibility parameters selective. The SHB {{could be used as}} a valuable source of ingredients for animal feeds and human consumption instead of being discarded as agricultural waste...|$|R

2500|$|Wood heat {{continues}} {{to be used in}} areas where firewood is abundant. [...] For serious attempts at heating, rather than mere ambience (open fireplaces), stoves, fireplace inserts, and furnaces are most commonly used today. [...] In rural, forested parts of the U.S., freestanding boilers are increasingly common. [...] They are installed outdoors, some distance from the house, and connected to a heat exchanger in the house using underground piping. [...] The mess of wood, bark, smoke, and ashes is kept outside and the risk of fire is reduced. [...] The boilers are large enough to hold a fire all night, and can burn larger pieces of wood, so that less cutting and splitting is required. [...] There is no need to retrofit a chimney in the house. [...] However, outdoor wood boilers emit more <b>wood</b> <b>smoke</b> and associated pollutants than other wood-burning appliances. [...] This is due to design characteristics such as the water-filled jacket surrounding the firebox, which acts to cool the fire and leads to incomplete combustion. [...] Outdoor wood boilers also typically have short stack heights in comparison to other wood-burning appliances, contributing to ambient levels of particulates at ground level. [...] An alternative that is increasing in popularity are wood gasification boilers, which burn wood at very high efficiencies (85-91%) and can be placed indoors or in an outbuilding. There are plenty of ways to process wood fuel and the inventions today are maximizing by the minute.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} source tests was {{conducted}} to determine the chemical composition of fine particle emissions from the fireplace combustion of six species of woods grown in the northeastern United States:[*] red maple, northern red oak, paper birch, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, and balsam fir. Results include fine particle emission rates for total mass, organic and elemental carbon, ionic species, elemental species including potassium, and over 250 specific organic compounds. The data are intended for use in source-apportionment studies that utilize particulate organic compounds as source-specific tracers. The cellulose pyrolysis product levoglucosan was quantified {{in each of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>smokes</b> studied and is thus a good candidate as a molecular tracer for wood combustion in general. Differences in emission rates of specific substituted phenols and resin acids can be used to distinguish between the smoke produced when burning hardwoods versus softwoods. Certain organic compounds, such as betulin from paper birch combustion and juvabione and dehydrojuvabione from balsam fir combustion, are unique to those species and can potentially be utilized to trace particulate emissions back to a specific geographical region where those individual tree species are used for firewood...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Food, Nutrition, Dietetics and HealthEdgar Chambers IVSmoking of food {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} methods of food {{preservation}} and still is used widely to help preserve foods such as meats, fish and cheeses. Apart from its conservation function, the smoking process also has a considerable influence on the sensory characteristics of the products. A highly trained, skilled descriptive sensory panel identified, defined and referenced 14 attributes related to the flavor of food products labeled as smoked or smoky. The lexicon included: Smoky (Overall), Ashy, Woody, Musty/Dusty, Musty/Earthy, Burnt, Acrid, Pungent, Petroleum-Like, Creosote/Tar, Cedar, Bitter, Metallic and Sour. Definitions of these attributes were written and references were found that anchor a 0 - 15 point scale. This lexicon was used to evaluate the differences among smoked products under different circumstances such as products on the market versus products smoked at home, different <b>woods</b> used to <b>smoke</b> products and the length of time a product spends in the smoker. There are many methods used to impart this smoky flavor and due to health, environmental and economic concerns, many producers use nontraditional methods while hobbyists thrive on the traditional methods. Descriptive analysis was used to see if there are differences between products smoked using an at-home smoker and market products. Using principal component analysis, cluster analysis and analysis of variance, it was found that market products were significantly different than products smoked using an at home smoker. The market products were significantly more Sour and less Smoky, Ashy, Woody, Musty/Dusty and Acrid. Many types of woods are used to smoke products and many market products distinguish themselves based on the wood used. Six highly trained panelists evaluated pork that was smoked with either hickory, mesquite, cherrywood or Applewood and was smoked for 1, 2 or 4 hours. The flavor profiles of the smoke flavor was similar between the types of woods although as the length of time in the smoker increased and the intensities of most attributes rose, the differences among products <b>smoked</b> with different <b>woods</b> became more pronounced. Apple <b>wood</b> <b>smoked</b> products had higher intensities for Overall Smoky, Ashy, Burnt, Pungent, Petroleum-Like, Creosote/Tar and Cedar, while cherry <b>wood</b> <b>smoked</b> products had lower intensities for all attributes. Hickory and Mesquite smoked products were not significantly different from each other and typically scored between the other two woods. Smoking is a slow process and many popular restaurants that smoke their own products find that their claims of smoking for long periods of time are beneficial to their image. Descriptive analysis was used to see how the flavor changes based on the length of time the product (pork) was in the smoker. The samples of pork ranged from not smoked to smoked for 15 hours, with samples at every 2. 5 hour increment. For most attributes, the intensities went up with the amount of time the product was in the smoker. The only exceptions were Musty/Earthy and Sour. The regression analysis revealed that Smoky, Ashy, Acrid, Creosote/Tar and Bitter are all at least moderately correlated with the time the product spent in the smoker...|$|R
