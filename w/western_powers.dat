5|$|During the Cold War, and {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of <b>Western</b> <b>powers</b> by disruption of their hold on African colonies. Nikita Khrushchev, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' as a means to weaken the West. For the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a rift between <b>western</b> <b>powers</b> and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.|$|E
5|$|Gunboat {{diplomacy}} {{was typically}} conducted by cruisers or smaller warships. A British squadron of three protected cruisers and two gunboats {{brought about the}} capitulation of Zanzibar in 1896; and while battleships participated in the combined fleet <b>Western</b> <b>powers</b> deployed during the Boxer rebellion, the naval part of the action was performed by gunboats, destroyers and sloops.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Stalin {{repeatedly}} {{proposed a}} plan to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations if the new Germany were {{to stay out of}} Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the <b>Western</b> <b>powers.</b> Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.|$|E
40|$|It {{should have}} led to lower {{electricity}} prices; that was the theory at least. But the 2006 disaggregation of Western Australia’s vertically-integrated electricity utility, <b>Western</b> <b>Power</b> Corporation, into four separate state-owned entities – Verve Energy (generation), <b>Western</b> <b>Power</b> (networks), Synergy (retail sales) and Horizon Power (the state’s regional power supply entity) – has not met {{the expectations of the}} policy pundits who pushed for the reform. The disaggregation of <b>Western</b> <b>Power</b> was expected to lead to increased efficiency due to the introduction of competition, which would in turn bring about lower electricity prices. However this has not transpired. Rather, between 2008 and 2012, retail electricity prices for households connected to the <b>Western</b> <b>Power</b> Network in the south west of the state rose by 48...|$|R

5|$|All in all, the {{membership}} reflected a mid-1950s combination of anti-communist Western nations and such nations in Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom, France and the United States, {{the latter of}} which joined after the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty by an 82–1 vote, represented the strongest <b>Western</b> <b>powers.</b> Canada also considered joining, but decided against {{it in order to}} concentrate on its NATO responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|During the Komnenian, or Comnenian, {{period from}} about 1081 to about 1185, the five {{emperors}} of the Komnenos dynasty (Alexios I, John II, Manuel I, Alexios II, and Andronikos I) {{presided over a}} sustained, though ultimately incomplete, restoration of the military, territorial, economic, and political position of the Byzantine Empire. Although the Seljuk Turks occupied the heartland of the Empire in Anatolia, most Byzantine military efforts during this period were directed against <b>Western</b> <b>powers,</b> particularly the Normans.|$|E

5|$|The {{sight of}} {{elephants}} executing captives both horrified and attracted {{the interest of}} European travelers, and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised {{the region in the}} 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by <b>Western</b> <b>powers,</b> such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The story centres on {{the theft}} of two atomic bombs by the crime {{syndicate}} SPECTRE and the subsequent attempted blackmail of the <b>Western</b> <b>powers</b> for their return. James Bond, Secret Service operative 007, travels to the Bahamas to work with his friend Felix Leiter, seconded back into the CIA for the investigation. Thunderball also introduces SPECTRE's leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld, {{in the first of}} three appearances in Bond novels, with On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice being the others.|$|E
5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the <b>Western</b> <b>powers,</b> than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E

5|$|After the {{revolution}} broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of {{what became the}} Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion {{was in favor of}} it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by <b>Western</b> <b>powers.</b> Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.|$|E
5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other <b>western</b> <b>powers,</b> McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization {{with an eye to}} eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the <b>Western</b> <b>powers.</b> Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E

This peer review has two main dimensions: a technical review of the multi-criteria analysis (MCA) methodology used, including confidence analysis using an alternative MCA technique; and a review of the sustainability assessment approach taken in the context of international practice and <b>Western</b> <b>Power’s</b> commitment to corporate sustainability.

5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the <b>western</b> <b>powers.</b> When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring badly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947 Molotov {{took part}} in all four {{conferences}} of foreign ministers of the victorious states in World War II. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the <b>Western</b> <b>powers.</b> Molotov, {{at the direction of}} the Soviet government, condemned the Marshall Plan as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan. The plan created several bilateral relations between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the United States had renounced {{its trade}} treaty with Japan; and, {{beginning}} with an aviation gasoline ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure. During this time, Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September. Despite several offensives by both sides, {{the war between}} China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces {{in the event of}} a war with the <b>Western</b> <b>powers,</b> Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina. Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and mechanical parts against Japan. Other sanctions soon followed.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) {{was intended to}} destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the <b>Western</b> <b>powers.</b> The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the war would drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E

The <b>Western</b> <b>powers</b> demanded establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe in order to calm down the widespread revolutionary movements in Europe.
