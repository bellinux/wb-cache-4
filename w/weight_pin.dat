40|$|Bovine {{chromosomes}} 2 (BTA 2) and 5 (BTA 5) of purebred, half-sib progeny sired by five Japanese black bulls were genotyped using microsatellite DNA markers. The {{data were}} subjected to linkage analysis for the detection and mapping of segregating quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing live weight, average daily gain and body measurements at weaning. Probability coefficients of inheriting allele 1 or 2 from the sire at specific chromosomal intervals were computed. The phenotypic data on progeny were regressed on these probability coefficients in a within-common-parent regression analysis. Fixed effects of sex, parity and season of birth as well as age as a covariate, were fitted in a linear model to the phenotypic data and subsequently analysed using QTL Express by generating an F-statistic through permutation tests at chromosome-wide significance thresholds over 10, 000 iterations at 1 cM intervals. Highly significant (P< 0. 01) segregating QTL for body measurements were detected on BTA 2 for hip width (1 cM) and chest depth (8 cM) in Sire Family 1 and pin bone width (16 cM) in Sire Family 3. Other significant QTL (P< 0. 05) detected were withers height (3 cM), hip height (4 cM), body length (4 cM), shoulder width (6 cM), lumbar width (3 cM), thurl width (3 cM) and canon circumference (2 cM) in Sire Family 1, shoulder width (16 cM) in Sire Family 3 and thurl width (24 cM), pin bone width (19 cM), heart girth (26 cM) and abdominal width (69 cM) in Sire Family 4. Significant (P< 0. 05) QTL for live weight and average daily gain were detected on BTA 2 for birth weight (5 cM) and weaning weight (3 cM) in Sire Family 1 and post-weaning average daily gain (68 cM) in Sire Family 4. BTA 5 contained QTL for birth <b>weight,</b> <b>pin</b> bone width and heart girth in Sire Family 3 that were only suggestive and not significant. Such localization of economically important QTL as demonstrated in this study, will expedite genetic improvement via marker-assisted selection, gene introgression and positional cloning in Japanese black cattle...|$|E

In modern raptors, these claws are used to help grip and hold prey of sizes smaller than or equal to the predator, while the birds use their body <b>weight</b> to <b>pin</b> their prey to the ground and eat it alive. Fowler and colleagues suggested that this behavior is entirely consistent with the anatomy of advanced dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus, which had slightly opposing first toes and strong tendons in the toes and foot. This makes it likely that advanced dromaeosaurids also used their claws to puncture and grip their prey to aid in pinning it to the ground, while using shallow wing beats and tail movements to stabilize themselves. Other lines of evidence for this behavior include teeth which had large, hooked serrations only on the back edge (useful in pulling flesh upward rather than slicing it) and large claws on the wings (for greater maneuvering of prey while mantling it with the wings).|$|R

The factors involved were Jatropha oil percentages, sliding velocities and load which was optimized for weight loss, friction coefficient and specific wear rate characteristics. The conventional lubricant was SAE 40. It is observed that the Jatropha oil percentage factor had significant influence on the weight loss, friction coefficient and wear rate of the pin. The optimum result was A 2 B 3 C 1 for <b>pin</b> <b>weight</b> loss, friction coefficient and wear rate. From the experimental result, it is found that the wear scar diameter increases with the increase of load for lube oil and reduced by addition of percentage of Jatropha oil.

The overall results of this experiment reveal that the addition of 15 % Jatropha oil with base lubricant produces better performance and anti-wear characteristics. This blend can be used as lubricant oil which is environment friendly in nature and would help to reduce petroleum based lubricant substantially.|$|R

On the other hand, a pin fall attempt cannot occur in the first place when one rolls out of the ring if falls do not count anywhere, or if the opponent lies on his/her stomach upon impact, so it would take extra effort to roll the opponent over, even when he/she is knocked out cold due to the body being effectively a dead weight.|$|R

Tests are performed both in dry and wet conditions. Roughness of the disk materials is evaluated by a tester and by a laser scan device. Temperature in proximity of the contact patch is measured by pyrometer pointed on the disk surface in the pin trailing edge, while room temperature is measured by a thermocouple.

40|$|The wear {{behavior}} of a forged Co- 29 Cr- 6 Mo alloy without any Ni and C added has been investigated by using a tribosystem consisting of a pin-on-disc type wear testing machine in distilled water containing different dissolved oxygen content. Dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water was controlled by aerating with oxygen or by deaerating with argon. Wear volume in the distilled water containing high oxygen content is approximately two times larger than in that containing low oxygen content. Accordingly, it is deduced that the overall wear volume is significantly affected by the dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water surrounding the tribosystem. Although abrasive wear, caused by wear debris, is operative as a wear mechanism in the present tribosystem irrespective of oxygen content, {{the transfer of the}} wear debris to sliding surfaces, as well as the aggregation of the wear debris on the sliding surfaces, is more prone to occur during the wear process with the lower oxygen content. Therefore, in the present tribosystem with the lower oxygen content, since the transfer of the wear debris to the disc or the pin readily occurs, the generation of the wear debris does not directly contribute to the wear volume, leading to the apparently lower wear volume in the tribosystem with lower oxygen content than in that with higher oxygen content; the transfer of the wear debris is not counted as wear loss because the wear volume is estimated based on the loss in disc and <b>pin</b> <b>weight</b> that occurs during the wear test.

The addition of molybdenum serves to stabilize the gamma phase of uranium, as well as increasing the melting point of the fuel. Thermal properties of U-Mo alloys have not been fully characterized, especially within the area of partial phase decomposition of the gamma phase of the alloy. Additional data was acquired through this research to expand the characterization data set for U-Mo alloys. The U-Mo alloys used for this research were acquired from the Idaho National Laboratory and consisted of three alloys of nominal 7, 10, and 13 percent molybdenum by <b>weight.</b> The sample <b>pins</b> were formed by vacuum induction melt casting. Once the three sample pins were fabricated and sent to the Fuel Cycle and Materials Laboratory at Texas A&M University, the pins were homogenized and sectioned for heat treatment. Several heat treatments were performed on the samples to induce varying degrees of phase decomposition, and the samples were subsequently sectioned for phase verification and thermal analysis. An Electron Probe Microanalyzer with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy was used to observe the phases in the samples as well as to characterize each phase. The density of each sample was determined using Archimedes method. Finally, a light flash analyzer was used to determine thermal diffusivity of the samples up to 300 degrees C as well as to estimate the thermal conductivity. For U- 10 Mo, thermal diffusivity increased with increasing phase decomposition from gamma to alpha +U 2 Mo while U- 7 Mo saw a flattening of the thermal diffusivity curve with increased phase decomposition...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} monitor a nuclear {{boiling water reactor}} fixed and movable {{detectors}} are used, such as the neutron sensitive LPRM (Local Power Range Monitors) detectors and the gamma sensitive TIP (Traversing Incore Probe) detectors. These provide a mean to verify the predictions obtained from core simulators, which are used for planning and following up the reactor operation. The core simulators calculate e. g. the neutron flux and power distribution in the reactor core. The simulators can also simulate the response in the LPRM and TIP detectors. By comparing with measurements {{the accuracy of the}} core simulators can be quantified. The core simulators used in this work are PHOENIX 4 and POLCA 7. Because of the complexity of the calculations, each fuel assembly is divided axially into typically 25 nodes, which are more or less cubic with a side length of about 15 cm. Each axial segment is simulated using a 2 D core simulator, in this work PHOENIX 4, which provides data to the 3 D code, in this case POLCA 7, which in turn perform calculations for the whole core. The core simulators currently use both radial <b>pin</b> <b>weights</b> and axial node weights to calculate the gamma TIP detector signal. A need to bring forward new weight factors has now been identified because of the introduction of new fuel designs. Therefore, the gamma TIP detector response has been simulated using a Monte Carlo code called MCNPX for a modern fuel type, SVEA- 96 Optima 2, which is manufactured by Westinghouse. The new weights showed some significant differences compared to the old weights, which seem to overestimate the radial weight of the closest fuel pins and the axial weight of the node in front of the detector. The new weights were also implemented and tested in the core simulators, but no significant differences could be seen when comparing the simulated detector response using new and old weights to authentic TIP measurements...|$|R
