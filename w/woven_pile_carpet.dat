2500|$|When and {{how exactly}} the Persians started <b>weaving</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> is {{currently}} unknown, but {{the knowledge of}} carpet weaving, and of suitable designs for floor coverings, was certainly available in the area covering Byzance, Anatolia, and Persia: Anatolia, located between Byzance and Persia, was ruled by the Roman Empire since 133 BCE. Geographically and politically, by changing alliances and warfare {{as well as by}} trade, Anatolia connected the East Roman with the Persian Empire. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabulary, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman Antioch. A Turkish carpet pattern depicted on Jan van Eyck's [...] "Paele Madonna" [...] painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of Khirbat al-Mafjar.|$|R
50|$|Rugs exist {{which are}} known to be woven in European manufactories as early as the mid sixteenth century, imitating the {{technique}} and, to some extent, the designs of Oriental rugs. In Sweden, flat and <b>pile</b> <b>woven</b> rugs (called “rya”, or “rollakan”) became part of the folk art, and are still produced today, mostly in modern designs. In other countries, like Poland or Germany, the art of carpet weaving did not last long. In the United Kingdom, Axminster carpets were produced since the mid-eighteenth century. In France, the Savonnerie manufactory began <b>weaving</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> by the mid-seventeenth centuries, but turned to European-style designs later on, which in turn influenced the Anatolian rug production during the “mecidi”, or “Turkish baroque” period. The Manchester-based company Ziegler & Co. maintained workshops in Tabriz and Sultanabad (now Arak) and supplied retailers such as Liberty & Company and Harvey Nichols. Their designs were modifications of the traditional Persian. A. C. Edwards was the manager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers' operations in Persia from 1908 to 1924, and wrote one of the classical textbooks about the Persian carpet.|$|R
50|$|Knotted <b>pile</b> <b>woven</b> <b>carpets</b> {{were likely}} {{produced}} {{by people who}} were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques. The different knot types in carpets from locations as distant from each other like the Pazyryk carpet (symmetric), the East Turkestan and Lop Nur (alternate single-weft knots), the At-Tar (symmetric, asymmetric, asymmetric loop kots), and the Fustat fragments (looped-pile, single, asymmetric knots) suggest that the technique as such may have evolved at different places and times.|$|R
50|$|Pile rugs made of wool are not {{essential}} household {{items in the}} hot and humid climate of India. They might have been introduced by succeeding waves of migrants from central and western Asia. The first people to invade India from the Eurasian steppe were the Aryans at around 1800 BC. The Aryans were nomadic people subsiding on animal breeding. It {{has been suggested that}} they might have introduced sheep breeding, and the production of woolen textiles to Northwestern India. In the sixth century BC, India was invaded by the Hephthalite Empire, another steppe nomad culture. In the fourth and fifth century BC, some areas were ruled by the Persian Achaemenid Empire. To what extent these peoples were already <b>weaving</b> <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> remains unknown, since no carpets exist from this period to support the hypothesis. The earliest references to Indian carpets come from Chinese writers during the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD). With the Arab invasion of Sindh in 712, India came in touch with Islam. The Afghan Ghaznavids and their successors, the Ghaurids, further spread Islam in India. The Arabian geographer Al-Muqaddasi mentions carpets from Sindh in 985 AD. Carpet weaving can with more certainty be traced {{to the beginning of the}} Mughal Empire in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babur, extended his rule from Kabul, Afghanistan to India and founded the Mughal Empire. Baburs successor, Humayun, took refuge in the Persian Safavid court of Shah Tahmasp I. Supported by the Safavid Empire, Humayun returned to India. His son, Akbar the Great extended is power to northern India and Deccan. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>woven</b> Turkish <b>carpets</b> {{were found}} in Konya and Beyşehir in Turkey, and Fostat in Egypt, and were dated to the 13th century, which {{corresponds}} to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243-1302). Eight fragments {{were found in}} 1905 by F.R. Martin in the Alâeddin Mosque in Konya, four in the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir in Konya province by R.M. Riefstahl in 1925. More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb {{of the city of}} Cairo.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{geographical}} position, Transylvania {{has been}} an important trade center between East and West during the 15th-17th century. <b>Pile</b> <b>woven</b> <b>carpets</b> from Anatolian manufacturers were part of the merchandise, and were traded in large numbers. Anatolian carpets were also appreciated as objects of high value and prestige, and collected as such by Transylvanian municipalities and individual persons. Inscriptions on the rugs and church records prove that rugs and carpets were donated as decorative wall and pew furnishings to Protestant churches. By their preservation in Christian churches, the rugs were protected from wear and the changes of history, and often remain in excellent condition today.|$|R
50|$|Carpet {{styles are}} divided into two basic types. These types are loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> and cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpets.</b> Especially for {{cut-pile}} and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.|$|R
50|$|A knotted-pile carpet is {{a carpet}} {{containing}} raised surfaces, or piles, from the cut off ends of knots woven between the warp and woof.

A flat or tapestry <b>woven</b> <b>carpet,</b> without <b>pile,</b> is a kilim. A <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> is influenced by width and number of warp and weft, pile height, knots used, and knot density.|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in an experimental room to measure the effect of human activity on airborne dispersal of settled fungal spores from carpet and vinyl tile flooring. A series of experiments were conducted in which commercial loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> residential cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> or vinyl tile installed in the experimental room were contaminated with Penicillium chrysogenum spores. The flooring materials were contaminated to two different levels (106 and 107 colony forming units per square meter [c. f. u. /m 2] of flooring surface). Airborne culturable and total P. chrysogenum concentrations were measured using Andersen single-stage impactor samplers and Burkard personal slide impactor samplers, respectively. Bioaerosol concentrations were measured at floor level, 1 meter, and the adult breathing zone (1. 5 meter) heights before and after human activity consisting of walking in a prescribed pattern for 1 minute in the room. Airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were greater with the higher surface loading for all three flooring materials. For all flooring materials {{there was no significant}} difference between sampler locations, although the data from the 1 -meter location were the highest, followed by the floor level and the breathing zone locations, respectively. The data from these experiments indicate that while a very small fraction of culturable P. chrysogenum spores present on flooring materials were aerosolized by walking, relatively high airborne concentrations of spores maybe re-entrained from contaminated materials. The airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were significantly higher after walking on cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> than with the other two flooring materials at both contamination levels, with the differences in concentration often ≥ 2 orders of magnitude. No differences were measured in airborne culturable P. chrysogenum between vinyl flooring and loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> at both contamination levels. Total spore data from the experiments with the 107 c. f. u. /m 2 contamination level indicated that walking on loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> produced higher airborne spore concentrations than similarly contaminated vinyl tile although no significant difference was observed at the 106 c. f. u. /m 2 level...|$|R

2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop <b>pile.</b> Twist <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|R
