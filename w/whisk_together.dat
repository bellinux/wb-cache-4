25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and <b>whisk</b> <b>together</b> with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design of an {{electric}} hand mixer while in the entire process is favored new perspective {{not only on the}} design of the product but also its function from the user's point of view. Its goal is to design the look of the product which will be unique and differently shaped from the products occurring these days in the market and will satisfy every technical and ergonomic requirements. It should be design of the lower price category product. This thesis, among other things, {{deals with the}} handling and storage of mixer beaters. The solution is to be an innovative way of keeping <b>whisk</b> <b>together</b> with the mixer which does not adversely affect the handling and does not increase the price...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, McDonald's {{admitted}} that [...] "the special sauce ingredients {{were not really}} a secret" [...] because the recipe had been available online [...] "for years". It consists of store-bought mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish and yellow mustard <b>whisked</b> <b>together</b> with vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.|$|R
2500|$|Hollandaise sauce ( [...] or [...] ), also {{referred}} to as Dutch sauce, is an emulsion of egg yolk, liquid butter, water and lemon juice (or a white wine or vinegar reduction), <b>whisked</b> <b>together</b> over the low heat of a double boiler. Additional salt, white pepper and/or cayenne pepper is used for seasoning.|$|R
60|$|The {{reader who}} has had the {{patience}} to accompany me on these somewhat futile errands must {{have been aware of}} making them largely on the lordly omnibus-tops which I always found so much to my proud taste. Often, however, we <b>whisked</b> <b>together</b> from point to point in hansoms; often we made our way on foot, with those quick transitions from the present to the past, from the rush and roar of business thoroughfares to the deep tranquillity of religious interiors, or the noise-bound quiet of ancient church-yards, where the autumn flowers blazed under the withering autumn leaves, and the peaceful occupants of the public benches were scarcely more agitated by our coming than the tenants of the graves beside them.|$|R
50|$|As Serradura is {{more common}} and popular nowadays, people started to create new flavors, like green tea, {{chocolate}} and Oreo flavors. To add different flavors into Serradura, green tea powder, vanilla extract or any other flavors can be added into the cream. Then, <b>whisk</b> them <b>together.</b> Another way {{to make some changes}} according to individual preferences, is to replace the Marie biscuits with other biscuits, such as Oreo.|$|R
6000|$|Eleven P.M.--In {{the boat}} [...] "City of Boston," [...] escorted thither by my car acquaintance, and {{deposited}} in the cabin. Trying {{to look as if}} the greater portion of my life had been passed on board boats, but painfully conscious that I don't know the first thing; so sit bolt upright, and stare about me till I hear one lady say to another--"We must secure our berths at once;" [...] whereupon I dart at one, and, while leisurely taking off my cloak, wait to discover what the second move may be. Several ladies draw the curtains that hang in a semi-circle before each nest--instantly I <b>whisk</b> mine smartly <b>together,</b> and then peep out to see what next. Gradually, on hooks above the blue and yellow drapery, appear the coats and bonnets of my neighbors, while their boots and shoes, in every imaginable attitude, assert themselves below, as if their owners had committed suicide in a body. A violent creaking, scrambling, and fussing, causes the fact that people are going regularly to bed to dawn upon my mind. Of course they are; and so am I--but pause at the seventh pin, remembering that, as I was born to be drowned, an eligible opportunity now presents itself; and, having twice escaped a watery grave, the third immersion will certainly extinguish my vital spark. The boat is new, but if it ever intends to blow up, spring a leak, catch afire, or be run into, it will do the deed to-night, because I'm here to fulfill my destiny. With tragic calmness I resign myself, replace my pins, lash my purse and papers together, with my handkerchief, examine the saving circumference of my hoop, and look about me for any means of deliverance when the moist moment shall arrive; for I've no intention of folding my hands and bubbling to death without an energetic splashing first. Barrels, hen-coops, portable settees, and life-preservers do not adorn the cabin, as they should; and, roving wildly to and fro, my eye sees no ray of hope till it falls upon a plump old lady, devoutly reading in the cabin Bible, and a voluminous night-cap. I remember that, at the swimming school, fat girls always floated best, and in an instant my plan is laid. At the first alarm I firmly attach myself to the plump lady, and cling to her through fire and water; for I feel that my old enemy, the cramp, will seize me by the foot, if I attempt to swim; and, though I can hardly expect to reach Jersey City with myself and my baggage in as good condition as I hoped, I might manage to get picked up by holding to my fat friend; if not it will be a comfort to feel that I've made an effort and shall die in good society. Poor dear woman! how little she dreamed, as she read and rocked, with her cap in a high state of starch, and her feet comfortably cooking at the register, what fell designs were hovering about her, and how intently a small but determined eye watched her, till it suddenly closed.|$|R
