40|$|The consumer’s {{interest}} for smaller, lighter and higher performance electronics products {{has increased the}} use of ultra fine pitch packages, such as Flip Chips and Chip Scale Packages, in printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. The assembly processes for these ultra fine pitch packages are extremely complex and each step in the assembly process influences the assembly yield and reliability. Generally speaking, end-of-line SMT defects can be greatly influenced by the stencil printing operation. The importance of the stencil printing process progressively increases as the pitch and the package size decreases. A thorough understanding of basic stencil printing principles would facilitate the design of printers, stencils and pastes, and would ultimately permit the extension of reliable print techniques to the ultra fine print arena. Stencil design and stencil fabrication techniques are critical factors that affect the stencil printing process. This work compares the stencil design elements, such as aperture <b>wall</b> <b>taper</b> and aperture wall finish that {{play a major role}} in the print performance of the small apertures. Designed experiments are performed to determine the ‘optimum ’ level of aperture taper and aperture wall finish. The study also compares three major stencil-manufacturing techniques (chemical etching, laser cutting and electroforming) for small aperture printing. From the knowledge gathered, guidelines are being developed for the stencil design and the stencil printing process for small apertures...|$|E
40|$|A {{new process}} kit for a SPTS Pegasus DRIE Si-Etch tool has been {{developed}} and tested for several different process regimes, e. g. bulk-Si cavity etching and TSV (through-Silicon-Via) etching with high aspect ratios > 10 : 1, using the so-called Bosch process. Additionally, Si-etch back (recess etching) with a single step process has been tested as well. The especially developed, edge protection kit", consisting of Al 2 O 3 material and optionally of PEEK material, covers {{the edge of a}} wafer, preventing it from being etched or even being etched away. However, placing such a part on top of the cathode, results in changes of the electric field distribution and the gas flow behavior compared to the standard process kit supplied by SPTS. The consequences may be altered Si-etch rates combined with changes of the tilt and side <b>wall</b> <b>taper</b> of the etched structures, mainly near the outside regions of the wafer. To this end, extensive investigations on the mask and bulk-Si etch rates, the tilt and taper angle of various MEMS test structures and their respective uniformity over the wafer surface have been performed. Additionally, simulations applying Comsol Multiphysics have been carried out to visualize the potential impact of the new process kit on the electrical field distribution. A simplex-optimization was carried out, varying the platen power and source power, in order to improve the tilt and to maintain the proper taper angle. One major advantage of the new process kit design compared to the original one is the reduction of movable parts to a minimum...|$|E
40|$|Background: Full-coverage {{porcelain}} {{fused to}} metal crowns is commonly recommended for restoration of extensively damaged teeth. Ability of the dentist to adequately prepare teeth {{is fundamental to}} success and longevity of these restorations. Aims: This {{study was designed to}} compare recommended convergence angle and taper values of tooth preparation with clinically practiced values and to assess the factors such as tooth position, operator experience, vitality, and restorative status on convergence angle of prepared teeth. Setting and Design: It was a descriptive, cross-sectional study design and held at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Dental Section, for a period of 1 year. Materials and Methods: A minimum of 197 crown preparation models of molar and premolar teeth prepared by residents and specialists were collected in order to achieve the objectives of the study on the basis of convenient sampling technique. Statistical Analysis: One sample t-test used to compare the mean practiced convergence angle values with its recommended values. Independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA was used to see difference in the convergence angle values of the teeth prepared by different operators, tooth type, vitality status, and restorative status of teeth. Results: Mean reported convergence angle and axial <b>wall</b> <b>taper</b> values were 23. 7 °± 8. 9 ° and 11. 3 °± 7. 8 °, respectively, which is significantly greater (P< 0. 001) than the recommended values. Convergence angle values were greater for molars as compared to premolars. Conclusion: There was a considerable disparity between the convergent angles values recorded in this study and the recommended guidelines and are affected by tooth type, vitality, and restorative status of tooth...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{selective}} area epitaxial growth {{of high quality}} InP in shallow trench isolation (STI) structures on Si (0 0 1) substrates 6 ° miscut toward (1 1 1) using a thin Ge buffer layer. We studied the impact of growth rates and steric hindrance effects on the nano-twin formation at the STI side walls. It was found that a too high growth rate induces more nano-twins in the layer and results in InP crystal distortion. The STI side <b>wall</b> <b>tapering</b> angle and the substrate miscut angle induced streric hindrance between the InP facets and the STI side walls also contribute to defect formation. In the [- 1 1 0] orientated trenches, when the STI side <b>wall</b> <b>tapering</b> angle is larger than 10 °, crystal distortion was observed while the substrate miscut angle has no {{significant impact on the}} InP defect formation. In the [- 1 1 0] trenches, both the increased STI tapering angle and the substrate miscut angle induce high density of defects.

50|$|According {{to recent}} archaeological excavations, {{carried out in}} 1962-63 {{on the ground floor}} of the tunnel, the tower was built on a large rock sloping toward the sea, and the {{buttress}} structure projecting out from the main tower provided stability to the tower.
