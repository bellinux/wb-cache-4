Ryuji's Super Power manifests in his arms, giving him superstrength. His <b>Weakpoint</b> is that his body overheats if he uses his superpower for too long. Once overheated, his strength increases exponentially and gains a murderous personality along with it, being thoroughly incapable of telling friend from foe. He cannot be stopped once overheated and one can only wait until he shuts down on his own. As a side effect, Ryuji is also far more susceptible to heat than normal people and can overheat if his surroundings are too warm, although he would merely be very aggressive and irritable instead of murderous. Though ice and large amounts of water can be used, a special cooling cream is more effective to cool him down. Compared to his teammates, his <b>Weakpoint</b> is the least likely to happen, so long as he uses his Super Power sparingly and with caution, but it is also the most devastating when it does happen. Ironically, his <b>Weakpoint</b> can be considered a mixed blessing as he can use the increased strength and destructive personality to deal with Metaloids far easier than it would usually be.

We compare (1) GCC with two nonfree ARM cross-compiler toolchains, (2) how GCC evolved from release 3. 2. 2 to version 3. 3, and (3) two runtime libraries for the Linux kernel. All tests were performed using the C front end and for the ARM target both as standalone and as Linux executables. The test suite is comprised of applications from wellknown benchmark suites such as SPEC and Mediabench. An optimal combination of compiler (and linker) options with respect to minimal code size is elaborated as well.

40|$|Investigations {{of optical}} and thermal {{properties}} of {{high power laser}} diodes (HLDs) provided {{a lot of new}} results for achieving a better diode performance by using the knowledge of optimization of the semiconductor structure and the thermal architecture of diode laser. Theoretical modeling was done for obtaining better understanding of the interaction between thermal and optical processes in laser diodes in particular in the facet region. The calculated temperatures of the laser facets for certain operation parameters were in good agreement with the data obtained in micro-Raman facet temperature measurements. Further theoretical and experimental results were achieved on the catastrophical optical damage (COD) mechanism in the facet region. Finite Elemente Modeling (FEM) was used to investigate the influence of different structure and material parameters e. g. layer thickness, material composition, doping concentration, and parameters of the thermal architecture on the thermal behavior of the diodes. The transient temperature behavior of high power laser diodes was monitored for different mounting configurations. The diode behavior from ns pulses up to cw-operation was measured in detail. Nondestructive methods have been developed for both strain characterization and defect estimation. A new optical scanning technique based on photocurrent spectroscopy was developed successfully to find out local <b>weakpoints</b> upon aging. With the near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) technique these processes were characterized in sub-#mu#m region.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. An ad-hoc network {{encompasses}} the cooperative engagement {{of a collection}} of mobile nodes that are free to move and communicate with each other wirelessly without the required intervention of any centralized access point or existing infrastructure. The advantage of such a network lies in it’s robustness, adaptiveness, the fact that its self-configurable and that it becomes somewhat indestructible due to it’s decentralized nature. But such a network layout simultaneously introduces many complex network management issues which are normally taken care of inherently by a rigid network architecture. The biggest challenge faced by any such protocol {{is the fact that it}} needs to be scalable, must maintain a decent stable data throughput, all whilst performing it’s own continuous network management and associated routing algorithms. These mobile nodes need a complex, scalable, compact and essentially realtime algorithm for maintaining an up to date representation of the overall network layout, yet without clogging the system’s communications channels with too much overhead traffic, and drastically lowering the effective data throughput. Since each mobile node only has a limited communications range each node also needs very advanced routing capabilities which will allow it to track who is currently within communications range, and at the same time allow the node to create multihop paths to distant destination nodes, thus connecting nodes which cannot directly communicate. This report follows the development process of both the software needed to successfully conceptualize, simulate and test the protocol, as well as the hardware needed as proof of concept. It highlights and discusses the various design choices / considerations made in development of such a protocol, the strong- and <b>weakpoints</b> of the developed protocol, as well as providing several possibilities to further evolve the developed protocol...|$|R

40|$|Lock-in {{thermography}} (LIT) is an {{imaging method}} that depicts radiated heat andits diffusion in manifold samples. LIT offers versatile {{possibilities for the}} characterizationof solar cells and modules since the radiated heat {{is proportional to the}} dissipationof electrical power. Up to now, the quantitative correlation of detected heat and dissipatedelectrical power has been known for silicon solar cells only. For many other typesof solar cells and modules – especially thin film solar cells – LIT has been used as aqualitative measurement tool for depicting the location of defects, for example. Thus,the potential of LIT in terms of the calculation of power generation and dissipation inthin film solar cells has not been exploited. This visualization and calculation of powerflows leads {{to a better understanding of}} the influences of defects on the efficiency ofsolar modules. Furthermore, it enables the evaluation of potential improvements, whichresults in solar modules with higher efficiencies, produced to lower costs. In order to interpret LIT signals accurately, the lock-in algorithm and particularlyits limits have to be understood. The present thesis shows the evaluation of the lockinalgorithm and its algebraic complex result with simulations. It is found that the <b>weakpoints</b> of the lock-in algorithm lie in the sampling of the acquired heat signal. Samplingmoments that are not uniformly distributed in a lock-in period produce unreliable results. A low sampling at high measurement frequencies shows significant deviationsdistorting the LIT result. The findings allow for the development of user-friendly LITsystems that automatically avoid sampling errors and produce reliable LIT results. The comprehension of LIT measurements of thin film solar cells needs a theoreticalthermal model for the solar cells that can be used to solve the differential heatdiffusion equation. The solution describes the surface temperature distribution that isacquired in LIT measurements. By the evaluation of the frequency response of a pointheat source in a thin film solar cell, a simple thermal model representing a solid body isfound to adequately reproduce LIT measurements. LIT investigations in the scale of the thermal diffusion length are hampered bythe diffusion of heat that leads to a blurring of heat sources. With the description of thethermal model and a Fourier transform technique, it is possible to successfully deconvolutethe heat generating sources from the heat diffusion, meaning the removal of thethermal blurring. This leads to the unimpeded visualization of the dissipated power ofsmall heat sources such as shunts or the series interconnection of cells in a thin filmsolar module [...] ...|$|R

Instead of creating the objective educational environment, the subjective enlightenment work was enforced till the end of the World War II. Though the leading principle, democracy, was instructed after the War, it was ineffective {{because of the lack of}} identity to lives of the people. Then the new idea for an institutional aspect of social education・・・・ Kominkan (community life and educational center) ・・・・manifested in 1946, and the Social Education Act was issued in 1949. But the <b>weakpoint</b> of modern institutions for our social education is not eliminated yet, and it is also the researcher's pending question to find the way how to make the institutions and their activities stand on the modern objective base...|$|E
40|$|A {{prefabricated}} building was designed in 1965 by the Committee for Antarctic Buildings and built in 1966 at Syowa Station. This building is of box-frame structure, {{which can be}} easily assembled in short time for multi-purpose establishment in the Antarctic area, such as sleeping quarters, mess hut, laboratory, etc. Therefore, even expedition members without any experiences in such construction are able to put it together. With the said building, thickness of the panel and its weight are exceptionally much more {{than those of the}} standard type, since the building is expected to accommodate deep frozen food as a cold storage. Of course, there is no changes in basic design. The outline of this building for cold storage is as follows : [table] Each panel contains insulation material of 100 mm thick which is sandwiched by water-proof plywood. Exterior surface of the panel is covered with stainless steel sheet and in-terior is lined with vinyl resin coated steel sheet. This {{prefabricated building}} has the following features : 1. For the jointed part of each corner of the structure, the unique prefabricated Lshaped corner-wall is employed. Since it is manufactured under a standard size, other components of the establishment, such as roof, floor, and side-wall can also be standardized. Besides, such tightly fastened prefabricated corner completely eliminates the fundamental <b>weakpoint</b> that has been unavoidable so far withstanding shock and tortion. 2. As for the jointing method of two panels, a long sized bolt of 13 φ is tightly screwed across the both adjacent frames, thus the surface of the both frames being tightly put together each other. In this method, only the bolting at two points in a panel substitutes for the traditional connecting method that is less endurable against shock and tortion. 3. Each jointed surface of the panel is finished with foamed chloroprene rubber, so that the gaps at the jointed surface can be completely eliminated. This foamed rubber lining has another merit that the elasticity of the rubber makes the errors characteristic to the assembly of the customary prefabricated structure practically ignorable...|$|E
