5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the <b>word</b> <b>size</b> is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the <b>word</b> <b>size</b> reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E
50|$|Fixed point {{digital signal}} {{processors}} often support unusual <b>word</b> <b>sizes</b> and precisions {{in order to}} support specific signal resolutions. For example, the Motorola 56000 DSP chip uses 24-bit <b>word</b> <b>sizes,</b> 24-bit multipliers and 56-bit accumulators to perform multiply-accumulate operations on two 24-bit samples without overflow or rounding. On devices that do not support large accumulators, fixed point operations may be implicitly rounded, reducing precision to below that of the input samples.|$|R

25|$|The {{behavior}} of GCC's back end is partly specified by preprocessor macros and functions specific to a target architecture, for instance to define its endianness, <b>word</b> <b>size,</b> and calling conventions. The front {{part of the}} back end uses these to help decide RTL generation, so although GCC's RTL is nominally processor-independent, the initial sequence of abstract instructions is already adapted to the target. At any moment, the actual RTL instructions forming the program representation have {{to comply with the}} machine description of the target architecture.|$|E
25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given <b>word</b> <b>size,</b> such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E

50|$|As {{computer}} designs {{have grown}} more complex, the central importance of a single <b>word</b> <b>size</b> to an architecture has decreased.
