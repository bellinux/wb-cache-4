40|$|In {{recent years}} in Hawai'i {{numerous}} shallow waste injection wells, constructed for the disposal of domestic sewage effluent, have failed to operate as designed or desired. In {{the course of this}} study a field reconnaissance of all the known waste injection wells on O'ahu and Kaua'i, and approximately half of those on Maui, was made and their methods of operation and injection problems evaluated. The results {{of this study indicate that}} injection well problems are primarily due to physical and biological, and probably to a much lesser extent, chemical clogging phenomena at the well face. The clogging in a large part results from improper treatment plant operation, improper injection <b>well</b> <b>operation</b> and maintenance, and poor well site selection. Improper well construction practices also contribute to a much lesser degree. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that inadequate data collection, both prior to and after injection has begun, makes early detection and solution of the injection problems more difficult. Recommendations for more adequate data collection and treatment plant and injection <b>well</b> <b>operation</b> and maintenance are made which hopefully will avoid or at least alleviate many of the injection well problems encountered in this study.

Following the improvement of river water quality and a drastic decrease in water demand during the last 20 years in Germany, the influence of landside groundwater quality has become more important for the raw water quality of waterworks relying on bank filtration.

30|$|One {{operation}} parameter and three controlled design parameters were selected as input variables: mud pressure, elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and void ratio. Mud pressure is a <b>well</b> <b>operation</b> parameter {{that represents the}} mud weight commonly applied to maintain well integrity during drilling and extraction process. It is {{also referred to as}} the bottom-hole pressure. The magnitude and gradient of this pressure must exceed the formation pressure gradient to avert the inflow of formation fluid to the wellbore and well breakout; however, excessive mud pressure increases the potential for tensile fracturing and fluid loss. The elastic modulus and Poisson ratio are deformation parameters that dominate control of the rock strain characteristics, particularly at the elastic range. The void ratio is a measure of consistency and packing of the rock grains and can be used to estimate porosity, specific gravity, density and saturation.|$|E

In the design of this system with the boost chopper as the core, the power-factor correction control chip named UCC 28019 is chosen to produce PWM waveform to realize double closed loop feedback control and implement voltage output instead of the normal UC 3854. The experiment results show that: when the ac voltage at the power input and the dc current of load change in a wide range, the output voltage of the dc power supply remains high stability. The ac power factor of power supply reaches 97 %, therefore, it has the good effect of {{power factor correction}}. In addition to that, the functions such as the 2. 5 A over-current protection, the power factor measurement or display and so on are realized in this system.
