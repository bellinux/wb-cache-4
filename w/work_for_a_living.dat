Medwin related that Shelley and he remained close friends at Syon House, forming a bond so close that Shelley apparently sleepwalked his way to Medwin's dormitory. After a further year in a public school, Medwin matriculated at University College, Oxford {{in the winter of}} 1805, but left without taking his degree.

25|$|Many of the arrivals {{were noted}} Torah {{scholars}} whose communities felt {{honored to be}} represented in Eretz Yisrael and sent them ma'amodos (stipends) on a regular basis. The kollel network that was established many years prior in Jewish communities around the globe, to financially and charitably take care of one another while under the civic authority and care of the foreign governments {{of the countries in}} which Jews lived, also facilitated the use of halukkah charity and allowed religious Jews to study Torah without having to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Money for this purpose was raised in Jewish communities around the world for distribution among the various kollelim that were correspondingly established (by country or community of origin) in the Old Yishuv, especially in Jerusalem. From the thirteenth through the turn-of-the 20th century, Jewish communities living in the Old Yishuv dispatched travelling emissaries (shlihim or Meshullahim) to raise money in the diaspora for sustenance. The funds they raised were known as Halukah and were collected around the world by these envoys of the religious community, who subsequently assisted in the transference of Diaspora funds to Eretz Yisrael under the larger umbrella of welfare and financial aid.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway {{thought he}} {{lost touch with}} American values while living in Paris, but his biographer Michael Reynolds claims the opposite, seeing {{evidence}} of the author's midwestern American values in the novel. [...] Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of [...] "the rotten crowd" [...] living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval {{of the people who}} did not pay up. [...] Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, not so much of the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, {{and those who do not}} <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> spend their lives posing.|$|E

500|$|In the Church's mythology, Jehovah1 had {{intended}} for Dobbs {{to lead a}} powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Dobbs refused to support the group; instead, he infiltrated it and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach {{that he was a}} very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including Sufism, Rosicrucianism, and the Fourth Way. Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to Tibet; there he learned vital truths about topics including Yetis. The Church teaches that Yetis exist, and that SubGenius members have descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs that the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs—Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father. Dobbs is married to a woman named Connie; SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about Shiva and Parvati. Church literature has variously described Dobbs' occupation as [...] "drilling equipment" [...] or fluoride sales, and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence. SubGenius leaders believe that he is capable of time travel, and that this ability results in occasional changes to doctrine, deemed the [...] "Sacred Doctrine of Erasability" [...] by the Church. Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.|$|E

As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook, a stage actress, a sailor and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel.

[...] The building, described at the time as a French chateau type building, was dedicated in February 1913 [...] "as a memorial not only to his own mother but as a shrine where thousands of young women in the coming years may worship the memory of their good mothers." [...] The building, designed by Arthur Burnett Benton (1858–1927), with many gables, cupolas, turrets and balconies, was turned over to the YWCA, having been built and furnished at a total cost of $500,000.

5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum).
