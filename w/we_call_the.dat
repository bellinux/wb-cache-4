25|$|First the {{vertices}} of any polyhedron {{are considered}} vectors from the polyhedron center. These vectors create the zonohedron which <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> zonohedrification {{of the original}} polyhedron. For any two vertices of the original polyhedron, there are two opposite planes of the zonohedrification which each have two edges parallel to the vertex vectors.|$|E
25|$|When {{values and}} {{operations}} can be paired up {{in a way}} that leaves everything important unchanged when all pairs are switched simultaneously, <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> members of each pair dual to each other. Thus 0 and 1 are dual, and ∧ and ∨ are dual. The Duality Principle, also called De Morgan duality, asserts that Boolean algebra is unchanged when all dual pairs are interchanged.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the above}} methods for simple polygons, we allow that {{particular}} regions within the polygon may have their area multiplied {{by a factor}} which <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> density of the region. For example, the central convex pentagon {{in the center of}} a pentagram has density 2. The two triangular regions of a cross-quadrilateral (like a figure 8) have opposite-signed densities, and adding their areas together can give a total area of zero for the whole figure.|$|E
25|$|Prof. Henry was {{introduced}} to Prof. Thaddeus Lowe, a balloonist from New Hampshire who had taken interest in the phenomenon of lighter-than-air gases, and exploits into meteorology, in particular, the high winds which <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Jet stream today. It was Lowe's intent to make a transatlantic crossing by utilizing an enormous gas-inflated aerostat. Henry took {{a great interest in}} Lowe's endeavors, promoting him among some of the more prominent scientists and institutions of the day.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E
30|$|In {{reliability}} experiments, the {{another way}} to to save time and reduce cost is censored data (see references Voltermana et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014; Balakrishnan and Kundu 2013; Park et al. 2015. If the experimental time is fixed, <b>we</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> scheme is Type-I censoring scheme, {{in this case the}} number of observed failures is a random variable. Otherwise, if the number of observed failures is fixed, <b>we</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> scheme is Type-II censoring scheme, in this case the experimental time is a random variable.|$|R

A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, {{in the case of}} the wiki, to edit the content. This is what <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Read/Write web. Talis believes that Library 2.0 means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.|$|E
25|$|What <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Sonneborn-Berger {{system was}} not invented by Sonneborn or Berger, {{and it was}} not {{originally}} designed for tie-breaking. It was invented by Oscar Gelbfuhs about 1873 {{to be used as a}} weighted score in round-robin tournaments. It would be used instead of the raw score for final places. In 1886 Sonneborn criticized the system and suggested an improvement that would give a better weighted score. His suggestion was to add the square of the player's points to the amount calculated as above. In 1887 and 1888 Berger studied Gelbfuhs' system and the suggestion of Sonneborn. This improvement became known as the Sonneborn-Berger system.|$|E

She crossed the Atlantic to France in November 1861, and in Marseille {{was the subject of}} a painting, possibly by Honoré de Pellegrin, a well-known maritime artist of the Marseilles School. In 1863 Parker was succeeded by William Thompson, who {{remained in}} command until 1867. These were quiet years; Amazons mate later recalled that, [...] "We went to the West Indies, England and the Mediterranean—what <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> foreign trade. Not a thing unusual happened." [...] In October 1867, at Cape Breton Island, Amazon was driven ashore in a storm, and was so badly damaged that her owners abandoned her as a wreck. On October 15, she was acquired as a derelict by Alexander McBean, of Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.|$|E
