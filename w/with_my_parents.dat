I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out.

She became interested in acting {{at an early age}} when she saw a local production of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Live to Tell" [...] {{portrays the}} {{complexity}} of deceit and mistrust. The song is also about childhood scars and had an extreme emotional pitch. According to the book The Heart of Rock & Soul by Dave Marsh, the archetype of songs like [...] "Live to Tell" [...] is The Platters' song [...] "The Great Pretender". In an interview about the song, Madonna said, [...] "I thought about my relationship <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> and the lying that went on. The song is about being strong, and questioning whether you can be that strong but ultimately surviving." ...|$|E

500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone {{rated the}} song {{three out of}} five stars and {{compared}} it to the musical styles of [...] Rihanna. He added, [...] "It's no 'Party in the U.S.A.' or 'See You Again,' but the chorus packs plenty of electro-fizz pizzazz". Bill Lamb of About.com rated [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] two and half out of five stars. He criticized the song for lyrics that headed into a [...] "selfish territory", however, believing it would have airplay success. Monica Herrera of Billboard gave [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] a favorable review, writing, [...] "But Cyrus knows how to proffer her sass. When she sneers, 'I'm not a fake, it's in my DNA,' in pre-emptive retaliation against her critics, she does it with the professionalism of a Disney-groomed star." [...] Jarett Wieselman of The New York Post said he liked the song and that {{though he did not}} buy Cyrus' [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] (2009), he feared he would not [...] "be able to resist" [...] buying [...] "Can't Be Tamed". He said the song had a [...] "naughty old school Britney Spears" [...] vibe, called it [...] "totally catchy" [...] and predicted it would be a summer hit. Ailbhe Malone of The Irish Times wrote, [...] "Miley’s taken a sexy electro-edge. Less [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", more Party <b>With</b> <b>My</b> <b>Parents</b> Away, we like this. A LOT." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he {{completed}} 8th grade, his parents {{sent him to}} a yeshiva, but after three months, they pulled him out. For high school, Vanunu attended Yeshivat Ohel Shlomo high school, a Bnei Akiva-run school, where he was an honor student. According to Vanunu, whilst in secondary school, he had a personal crisis which led to him deciding to leave Judaism. In an interview, he said that [...] "already at this stage, I decided to cut myself off from the Jewish religion, but I didn't {{want to have a}} confrontation <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> because I wanted to complete my studies".|$|E

5000|$|Speaking of her {{childhood}} in Wales, McCleen says [...] "I {{grew up in a}} fundamentalist religion and didn’t have much contact <b>with</b> non-believers. <b>My</b> <b>parents</b> weren’t typical converts so we didn’t have much contact with other believers either. When I was ten I was taken out of school and we moved to the country Ireland. I spent {{all the time in the}} fields with two sheepdogs, or making things in my room".|$|R
2500|$|Vandenbroucke said in 2004: [...] "I've {{never done}} {{anything}} to make myself popular. In fact, the opposite. Sometimes I think it's all a dream. I've thrown up a marriage, I've been on bad terms <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> for a long time, all of which has troubled and exhausted me." [...] He said he had disappointed sponsors, managers and directeurs sportifs, even though they continued to show confidence in him. [...] "I had become schizophrenic," [...] he said. Without psychiatric help, he would [...] "have followed the same path as Pantani", the Italian rider found dead on a hotel floor. After 450,000 French francs a month at Cofidis, he earned 220,000 at Lampre in 2001 and then half that at Fasso Bortolo.|$|E
2500|$|Jemison {{graduated}} from Chicago's Morgan Park High School in 1973 and entered Stanford University {{at the age}} of 16. [...] "I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me," [...] Jemison said. [...] "It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> having enough confidence in me to [...] go that far away from home." [...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" [...] She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E

60|$|Our trip {{around the}} {{reservation}} with the Agent began {{a few days}} later with an exultant drive across the prairie to the South Fork of the Canadian River. It was glorious summer here.

Through a land untouched by the white man's plow, we rode on a trail which carried me back to my childhood, to the Iowa Prairie over which I had ridden <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> thirty years before. This land, this sky, this mournful, sighing wind laid hold of something very sweet, almost sacred in my brain. By great good fortune I had succeeded in overtaking the vanishing prairie.|$|E

He tuned the instrument in a leisurely way, pausing often to continue the conversation <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> until at last, seeing how eager we all were, he began to play, and his music and style were strange to us, for he had no jigging tunes with fantastic flights and flourishes so much affected by our native guitarists.

Mr. Armadale had never seen his West Indian property. He lived in England; and, after sending me the customary godfather's present, he held no further communication <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> for years afterward.

These consisted of household goods mostly, and the task of equitable division was difficult. We got on very well with the napkins, towels and such things, and the silverware was parted pretty nearly equally, but you can see for yourself that when you try to divide a single music-box by two without a remainder you will have trouble. It was that music-box which brought disaster and disgrace upon our family. If we had left it my poor father might now be alive.|$|E
