Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld.

Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking.

The use of fusion welding is common for closed single-bevel, closed single J, open single J, and closed double J butt joints.

When welding thicker metals, a double-V joint requires less filler material because there are two narrower V-joints compared to a wider single-V joint. Also the double-V joint helps compensate for warping forces. With a single-V joint, stress tends to warp the piece in one direction when the V-joint is filled, but with a double-V-joint, there are welds on both sides of the material, having opposing stresses, straightening the material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{welding process}} to make joints, {{residual}} stress is inevitably produced and weld metal should be used. These influence the static and dynamic behavior of steel structures with <b>welded</b> <b>joints,</b> such as steel piles. In steel structures, dynamic mechanical behavior is different to static mechanical behavior. Therefore, to accurately predict {{the behavior of}} steel piles with a <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> under static-dynamic loading, the research on influence of a <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> on the static and dynamic behavior of steel piles is necessary. For that purpose, a rate-dependent plasticity model was used, considering strain rate hardening and temperature rise. In this paper, the distribution of welding residual stress in a <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> was computed by using three-dimensional heat conduction analysis and three-dimensional thermal elastic-plastic analysis.
