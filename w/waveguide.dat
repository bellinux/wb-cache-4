5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller <b>waveguide</b> filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode <b>waveguide</b> filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode <b>waveguide</b> filters have seen successful use where <b>waveguide</b> size or weight are important considerations.|$|E

5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the <b>waveguide</b> to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The <b>waveguide</b> could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the <b>waveguide.</b>|$|E

The BRAGGATIR <b>waveguides</b> combine {{the advantages of}} Bragg <b>waveguides</b> and lateral ARROWs (antiresonant reflecting optical <b>waveguides)</b> [...] namely, large core sizes allowing easy and low loss fiber coupling and their reduced sensitivity to fabrication errors, with the properties of high index contrast ridge <b>waveguides</b> which tolerate small bending radius. Since the proposed <b>waveguides</b> have only one Fabry-Perot layer, they are more compact compared to the Bragg <b>waveguides.</b> Moreover, the large dispersion of the BRAGGATIR <b>waveguides</b> near the resonances may find applications in optical signal processing.

25|$|Waveguides {{are similar}} to coaxial cables, as both consist of tubes, with the biggest {{difference}} being that the <b>waveguide</b> has no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides {{do not have an}} inner conductor to carry a return current, waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an electric current, but rather by means of a guided electromagnetic field. Although surface currents do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the <b>waveguide</b> and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the <b>waveguide.</b> Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies. In addition to this mechanical feasibility, electrical resistance of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the <b>waveguide</b> cause dissipation of power (surface currents flowing on lossy conductors dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.|$|E
