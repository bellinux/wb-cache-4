There {{have been times when}} I have been {{flat-out}} to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In [...] I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact {{the only thing you can}} judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.|$|E

6000|$|RAMSDEN. Well, perhaps not. No: {{of course}} not. I see that. No: you {{certainly}} couldn't. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win</b> her {{on your own}} merits, {{it will be a}} great happiness to her to fulfil her father's desire as well as her own. Eh?

6000|$|... "It is an ugly fascination," [...] he said. [...] "You {{are in the}} swim, and {{you must}} hold your own. You gamble with other men, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win</b> you chuckle. All the time you're whittling your {{conscience}} away--if ever you had any. You're never quite dishonest, and you're never quite honest. You come out on top, and afterwards you hate yourself. It's a dirty little life!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It was I that writ {{every line}} of that paper, my dear,” says Mr. Esmond. “You {{are not so}} worldly as you think yourself, Beatrix, and better than we believe you. The good we have in us we doubt of; and the {{happiness}} that’s to our hand we throw away. You bend your ambition on a great marriage and establishment—and why?

6000|$|... 'Confound you, {{what do you}} mean?' {{said the}} stout man rising a little, and {{supporting}} himself on his elbow. 'Keep you poor! You'd keep us poor if you could, wouldn't you? That's the way with you whining, puny, pitiful players. When you lose, you're martyrs; but I don't find that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win,</b> you look upon the other losers in that light.

6000|$|... "If {{you can be}} {{constant}} in your love <b>you</b> may <b>win</b> her yet. Remember how young she is; and how young you both are.

Vy, Captain Scarborough, the little game you wash playing there, which wash a very pretty little game, is as nothing to my game wish you. When you see the money down, on the table there, {{it seems to be}} mush because the gold glitters, but it is as noting to my little game, where the gold does not glitter, because it is pen and ink. A pen and ink soon writes ten {{thousand}} pounds. But you think mush of it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win</b> two hundred pounds at roulette." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get away, you naughty creature!" [...] says Mrs. Roundhand, {{giving me}} a great slap: [...] "you're all the same, you men in the West End--all deceivers. The Count was just like you. Heigho! Before you marry, it's all honey and compliments; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win</b> us, it's all coldness and indifference.

[...] (She pronounced it without the h; but {{that there should be no}} mistake, laid her hand upon the place meant.) [...] "Ah, no! Will you be so neglectful when you marry, Mr. Titmarsh?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It helps <b>when</b> <b>you</b> start <b>winning.</b> It {{helped a}} lot when I started winning, and having grown up, you know, never having been {{anywhere}} and then get {{to go out of}} country to Montreal and Australia and different places, somebody else paying the bill for me to go shoot arrows, that was very much incentive." ...|$|R

[...] Professions of trust, and confidence, and unselfishness, and all that! Bah, bah, bah! We see what they're worth. But, you mustn't laugh at life; you've got a game to play; a very serious game indeed! Everybody's playing against you, you know, and you're playing against them. Oh! it's a very interesting thing. There are deep moves upon the board. You must only laugh, Dr. Jeddler, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win</b> - and then not much. He, he, he! And then not much,' repeated Snitchey, rolling his head and winking his eye, {{as if he would}} have added, 'you may do this instead!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Tooting, {{somewhat}} contemptuously. [...] "No, I {{tell you}} he hasn't got that kind of sense. He never took any trouble to get ahead, and I guess he's sort of sensitive about old Hilary. It'd make {{a good deal of}} a scandal in the family, with Austen as an anti-railroad candidate." [...] Mr. Tooting lowered his voice to a tone that was caressingly confidential. [...] "I tell you, and you sleep on it, a man of your brains and money can't lose. It's a chance in a million, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win</b> you've got this little State tight in your pocket, and a desk in the millionaire's club at Washington. Well, so long," [...] said Mr. Tooting, [...] "you think that over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that ought}} to be {{considered}} robbery," [...] replied the captain, with a frown. [...] "Betting is a mean, shabby, contemptible way of obtaining money for nothing on false pretences. The man who bets says in his heart, `I want my friend's money without the trouble of working for it, therefore I'll offer to bet with him. In so doing I'll risk an equal sum of my own money. That's fair and honourable!' Is that logic?" [...] demanded the captain, vehemently, [...] "It is not! In the first place it is mean to want, not to speak of accepting, another man's money without working for it, and it is a false pretence to say that you risk your own money because it is not your own, it is your wife's and your children's money, who are brought to poverty, mayhap, because of your betting tendencies, and it is your baker's and butcher's money, whose bread and meat you devour (as long as they'll let you) without paying for it, because of your betting tendencies, and a proportion of it belongs to your church, which you rob, and to the poor, whom you defraud, because of your betting tendencies; and if you say that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>win</b> the case is altered, I reply, yes, it is altered for the worse, because, instead of bringing all this evil down on your own head you hurl it, not angrily, not desperately, but, worse, with fiendish indifference on the head of your friend and his innocent family. Yes, madam, although many men do not think it so, betting is a dishonourable thing, and I'm ashamed of having done it. I repent, Mrs Tipps, the money burns my fingers, and I must return it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{regard to}} {{preliminary}} expenses," [...] she interrupted, calmly, [...] "I {{have said that}} your reward will be ample <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>won</b> the game. But meantime I am willing to invest the necessary funds in the enterprise. I will allow you a thousand a month." [...] "Bah! that's nothing at all!" [...] said he, contemptuously, as he flicked the ashes from his cigarette.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is not true!' said Stephen passionately. 'It was you put me out. And now you'll {{be pushing}} in again between us, and depriving {{me of my}} chance again! My right, that's what it is! How ungenerous {{of you to come}} anew and try to take her away from me! <b>When</b> <b>you</b> had <b>won</b> her, I did not interfere; and you might, I think, Mr. Knight, do by me as I did by you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{would rather}} {{it should be}} later," [...] Archie replied. [...] "I may have done enough for honour, {{but it is not}} for honour that I am fighting, but for Scotland. Your work is but begun yet, I can assure you. We are far from being {{at the end of our}} {{resources}} yet. It will be time enough to talk about surrendering <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>won</b> the breach and the outer walls." ...|$|R

5000|$|In satirist-activist Dick Gregorys final nightclub {{performance}} album, Caught in the Act (recorded 8/2-8/4/73), {{he tells}} his Massachusetts audience, [...] "Do you realize {{you were the only}} state that voted for McGovern? You have the distinction of being able to tell the other forty-nine states, We told you. And I guess black folks are pretty cool too, because he also won Washington, D.C.

6000|$|... "Stupid women, {{and all are}} stupid, {{think the}} first winning of the man the final victory. Then they settle down and grow fat, and state, and dead, and heartbroken. Alas, they are so stupid. But you, little infant-woman with your first victory, you must make your love-life an unending chain of victories. Each day <b>you</b> must <b>win</b> your man again. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>won</b> the last victory, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can find no more to win, then ends love. Finis is written, and your man wanders in strange gardens. Remember, love must be kept insatiable. It must have an {{appetite}} knife-edged and never satisfied. You must feed your lover well, ah, very well, most well; give, give, yet send him away hungry {{to come back to}} you for more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do not {{understand}} a man like Wingrave," [...] she declared. [...] "Nothing {{that he has done}} is inconsistent with my point of view. He gave you a safe tip, knowing very well that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had <b>won</b> a little, <b>you</b> would try again on your own account and lose--which you did. He lent us the money to become our creditor; and he lends us the yacht to give another handle {{to the people who are}} saying already that he occupies the position in our family which is more fully recognized on the other side of the Channel!" ...|$|R
