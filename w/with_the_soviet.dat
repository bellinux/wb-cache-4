After <b>the</b> Poles and <b>Soviets</b> defeated <b>the</b> Germans on July 17, 1944, Polish officers, including Krzyżanowski, who had been invited to a debriefing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> were arrested and imprisoned.|$|R
50|$|The US was {{building}} up its missiles, with President Eisenhower issuing the National Defense Education Act in 1958, {{which was an}} attempt to close <b>the</b> missile gap <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> It gave funds to U.S. schools to start researching more so that the United States' military could catch up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet's</b> technology. Eisenhower also started N.A.S.A. which was originally made for the purpose of researching missile technology.|$|R

5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E
5|$|More broadly, one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aircraft}} design {{to receive the}} Su-35 designation had its origins in the early-1980s, {{at a time when}} the Su-27 was being introduced into service <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Armed Forces. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass ("serial") production with the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial operational readiness <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Air Defence Forces. Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982, the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the Soviet Council of Ministers to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M). Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project's existence, under the oversight of General Director Mikhail Simonov, who had been the chief designer of the Su-27.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained}} {{a close relationship}} with France, a policy known as Françafrique, and he built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser on African policy in the de Gaulle and Pompidou governments. He aided the conspirators who ousted Kwame Nkrumah from power in Ghana in 1966, took part in the failed coup against Mathieu Kérékou in Benin in 1977, and was suspected of involvement in the 1987 coup that removed Thomas Sankara from power in Burkina Faso. Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained a}} strong anti-communist foreign policy, which resulted in, among other things, severing diplomatic relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1969 (after first establishing relations in 1967) and refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China until 1983. He provided assistance to UNITA, a United States-supported, anti-communist rebel movement in Angola. In 1986 he re-established relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, shortly before the fall of its confederation.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain good relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position {{in the eyes of}} its allies and neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{varied from}} cool to {{extremely}} strained between West Pakistan and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. This {{was during the}} Cold War, and Pakistan's close ties <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States came {{at the expense of}} relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} month, Kennedy sent W. Averell Harriman to Moscow {{to negotiate}} a treaty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> <b>The</b> introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> to allow inspections that would verify compliance.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s Lieth-Thomsen {{actively}} {{participated in}} the German efforts to build a secret Air Force in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.

Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Bolivia and Iran competed at the Winter Games {{for the first}} time, making Bolivia the first {{completely}} Tropical nation {{to participate in a}} Winter Olympic. Korea, Liechtenstein, and Turkey returned after having missed the 1952 Winter Olympics, while Argentina, Denmark, New Zealand, and Portugal did not compete at these Games, after having participated in the previous edition. Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany, an arrangement that would continue for the following two Olympiads.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 610 {{aircraft}} were built, including prototypes, and they entered service in 1948 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Air Forces. At least 372 {{were transferred to}} the People's Liberation Army Air Force in 1950 to defend Chinese cities against air raids by the Nationalist Chinese and train the Chinese pilots in jet operations. The MiG-9 was quickly replaced by the MiG-15, and three are known to survive.|$|E

Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|Alves and Van-Dunem {{planned to}} arrest Neto on 21 May before {{he arrived at}} a meeting of the Central Committee and before the {{commission}} released its report on the activities of the Nitistas. However, the MPLA changed the location of the meeting shortly before its scheduled start, throwing the plotters' plans into disarray, but Alves attended the meeting and faced the commission anyway. The commission released its report, accusing him of factionalism. Alves fought back, denouncing Neto for not aligning Angola <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. After twelve hours of debate, the party voted 26 to 6 to dismiss Alves and Van-Dunem from their positions.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
