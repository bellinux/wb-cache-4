Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on.</b> We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E

500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I'd have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s Courtney was {{part in a}} gang of {{teenagers}} from Belfast's Shankill Road and nearby districts who spent their days near the Buffs Club on Century Street in the nearby Oldpark district. This gang included Johnny [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Adair with whom Courtney formed a friendship. The gang as a group had joined C8, one of around eighteen teams of 30 to 60 men that made up C Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, {{over a period of}} several months in 1984. Courtney and Adair became closer as the 1980s <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> 23 November 1985 they attended the [...] "Ulster Says No" [...] rally against the Anglo-Irish Agreement at Belfast City Hall together. According to Courtney the signing of the Agreement saw a surge of recruits to the UDA in general and C Company in particular, leading to an upswing in violent activity.|$|E

2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but it just <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on.</b> The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy Benjamin {{told the}} Daily Star that keeping the secret that her {{character}} {{was responsible for}} the attempted murder had been the [...] "worst two months of her life". She commented to The Mirror, [...] "For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on.</b> The first person I told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [...] I thought he was a good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.|$|E
