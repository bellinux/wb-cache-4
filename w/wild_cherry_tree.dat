60|$|It was a still mild day in November, a month {{which in}} the country, and {{especially}} on the light soils, has many charms, and the whole Ferrars family were returning home after an afternoon ramble on the chase. The leaf had changed but had not fallen, and the vast spiral masses of the dark green juniper effectively contrasted with the rich brown foliage of the beech, varied occasionally by the scarlet leaves of the <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree,</b> that always mingles with these woods. Around the house were some lime trees of large size, and at this period of the year their foliage, still perfect, was literally quite golden. They seemed like trees in some fairy tale of imprisoned princesses or wandering cavaliers, and such they would remain, until the fatal night that brings the first frost.|$|E

It restored his soul to have Sam Clark trustingly bellow, [...] "Better {{come down to}} the lake this evening and have a swim, doc. Ain't you going to open your cottage at all, this summer? By golly, we miss you." [...] He noted the progress on the new garage. He had triumphed in the laying of every course of bricks; in them he had seen the growth of the town. His pride was ushered back to its throne by the respectfulness of Oley Sundquist: [...] "Evenin', doc! The woman is a lot better. That was swell medicine you gave her." [...] He was calmed by the mechanicalness of the tasks at home: burning the gray web of a tent-worm on the <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree,</b> sealing with gum a cut in the right front tire of the car, sprinkling the road before the house.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{assessing}} {{the growth and}} production of a mixed oak/hornbeam forest stand established by combined regeneration in 1940 to 1942. The stand is situated {{at an altitude of}} 460 [*]m. Since 1961, it is left to its natural development. The 25 –year–old stand was characterized as an individually mixed, both diameter- and height-differentiated pole-stage stand. The proportion of tree species was as follows: sessile oak 77 %, hornbeam 19 %, birch 1 %, lime 1 %, black poplar 1 %, <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree,</b> wild service tree, and field maple. During 41 years of measurements, the proportion of oak slightly decreased to 76 %, on the other hand, the proportion of hornbeam increased to 22 %. The initial growing stock of the 25 –year–old stand, 75 m 3. ha− 1, increased to 323 m 3. ha− 1 at an age of 66 years in 2008. At present, current volume increment ranged between 6. 3 m 3. ha− 1. year− 1 and 11. 6 m 3. ha− 1. year− 1 during years 1967 and 1998. Since the age of 61, the growth of the stand has decreased and then even ceased due to increased mortality of oak...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWidespread {{ecosystem}} {{change has}} led to declines in species world-wide. The loss of pollinators in particular constitutes a problem for ecosystem function and crop production. Understanding how landscape change affects pollinator movement, effective pollen flow, and plant and pollinator survival is therefore a global priority. In this study we investigated patterns of effective pollen flow, using <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> (Prunus avium) progeny arrays, to address two questions in three case studies: Do land-use types present different resistances to pollinator movement? Which pollinator travel path best explains the pollination data (straight lines, weighted straight lines, least cost paths or pair-wise resistance) ? Trees and progeny arrays were genotyped and effective pollen flow and pollinator movement were estimated using the spatially explicit mating model. We found that pollinators did modify their travel paths in response to land-use type and arrangement, but the travel path that best described pollinator movement and the resistance rank of the land uses depended on the type and size of land-use patches and the landscape context. We propose a novel theoretical framework rooted in behavioural ecology, the resource model, for interpreting pollinator behaviour in heterogeneous landscapes. We conclude by discussing the importance and practicality of conservation and management strategies in which native and non-native land-use types together provide functional habitat and support ecosystem services across economic landscapes...|$|E

40|$|We have {{isolated}} the cDNA {{of the gene}} PaLAX 1 from a <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tree</b> (Prunus avium). The gene and its product are highly similar in sequences to both the cDNAs and the corresponding protein products of AUX/LAX-type genes, coding for putative auxin influx carriers. We have prepared and characterized transformed Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis thaliana plants carrying the gene PaLAX 1. We have proved that constitutive overexpression of PaLAX 1 is accompanied by changes in the content and distribution of free indole- 3 -acetic acid, the major endogenous auxin. The increase in free indole- 3 -acetic acid content in transgenic plants resulted in various phenotype changes, typical for the auxin-overproducing plants. The uptake of synthetic auxin, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, was 3 times higher in transgenic lines compared to the wild-type lines and the treatment with the auxin uptake inhibitor 1 -naphthoxyacetic acid reverted the changes caused by the expression of PaLAX 1. Moreover, the agravitropic response could be restored by expression of PaLAX 1 in the mutant aux 1 plants, which are deficient in auxin influx carrier activity. Based on our data, we {{have concluded that the}} product of the gene PaLAX 1 promotes the uptake of auxin into cells, and, as a putative auxin influx carrier, it affects the content and distribution of free endogenous auxin in transgenic plants. ...|$|E

40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} (TLS) {{technology is a}} powerful tool for assessing tree growth based on time series analysis, as it allows a level of scrutiny not achievable using established destructive techniques. We applied TLS technology to 21 <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> grown in a research plot near Breisach (southern Germany) in order to build quantitative structure models (QSMs) for each tree. Scans were carried out over three subsequent years (2012 - 2014), so that three QSMs per each tree were constructed. Using the above approach, we were able to assess the annual growth of the individual <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> in terms of diameter and height, stem and branch volume, and the merchantable timber fraction. In addition, the growth of single branches of sample trees was detected and quantified. The availability of QSMs based on TLS-derived data allowed the accurate determination of crown length and width, as well as the volume reduction {{as the result of the}} tree pruning applied after the first scan (2012). The aboveground biomass (AGB) was assessed for each tree based on the QSM-derived volume and published wood density values for <b>wild</b> <b>cherry,</b> and then compared with AGB values estimated with standard allometric methods, obtaining a very high correlation (r(adj) (2) = 0. 941). We concluded that the proposed approach is an effective non-destructive technique to accurately assess the increase of tree biomass, and discuss its future application in the forestry sector...|$|R

40|$|Pruning <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus avium L.) is {{a common}} {{silvicultural}} practice carried out to produce valuable timber at a veneer wood quality. Sub-optimal pruning treatments can permit un-occluded pruning wounds to develop devaluing decay. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine relevant branch, tree and pruning characteristics affecting the occlusion process of pruning wounds. Important factors influencing occlusion time for an optimised pruning treatment for valuable timber production utilising <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> are derived. 85 artificially pruned branches originating from ten <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>trees</b> were retrospectively analysed. Branch stub length, branch diameter and radial stem increment during occlusion were found to be significant predictors for occlusion time. From the results it could be concluded that for the long term success of artificial pruning of <b>wild</b> <b>cherry</b> it is crucial to (i) keep branch stubs short (while avoiding damage to the branch collar), (ii) to enable the tree to maintain significant radial growth after pruning, (iii) to avoid large pruning wounds (> 2. 5 cm) by removing steeply angled and fast growing branches at an early stage...|$|R
