5|$|Fort Ridgely {{was built}} in 1853–1854 near the Dakota {{reservation}} in southwestern Minnesota, near modern New Ulm. It was named by U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis in honor of three army officers named Ridgely {{who had died in}} the Mexican-American War. The fort was created to <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota River Valley, in addition to the larger frontier. It replaced Fort Doge in Iowa, which was decommissioned during the same period. The fort operated as a military post until 1867.|$|E
5|$|Link {{locates the}} Triforce on Skyloft and {{uses it to}} destroy Demise. With Demise dead, Zelda is freed, but Ghirahim arrives and kidnaps Zelda: though Demise is dead in the present, Ghirahim intends to use Zelda as a {{sacrifice}} to resurrect him in the past. Link pursues Ghirahim into the past and fights through his army. He then defeats Ghirahim, who {{turns out to be}} the spirit of Demise's sword, but is unable to prevent Zelda's soul from being used to reincarnate Demise's humanoid form. Groose guards Zelda's body while Link challenges Demise to single combat: Link triumphs, absorbing Demise's essence into the sword, but not before Demise curses Link and Zelda's descendants to be haunted by his reincarnated rage. To complete the sword's seal, Link drives it into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple, with Fi accepting eternal slumber as a result. Groose, Link and the revived Zelda return to their time while Impa remains behind and destroys the Time Gate, as she is a person of that time period and must <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Master Sword. In the present, the old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes, revealing that she was Impa. The game ends with Zelda deciding to remain on the Surface to <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Triforce: she and Link together establish the kingdom of Hyrule.|$|E
5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|E

5|$|As the Anzac Mounted Division {{approached}} Um Zughla at 02:00 on 21 December, a halt {{was called}} until 03:30 when the column continued on to El Arish. At 07:45, the advanced troops entered the town, unopposed, {{to contact the}} civil population and arrange water supplies for the mounted force. One prisoner was captured, while lines of observation were set up, which maintained a close <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country east {{and south of the}} town. By 16:00 the 1st and 3rd Light Horse, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the Imperial Camel Brigades were in bivouac at El Arish, the only casualties during the day being two members of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, who were blown up by a stranded mine on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{was the son}} of Hugh of Briel and Alice of Villehardouin, a {{daughter}} of the Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey I of Villehardouin. The family, which hailed from Briel-sur-Barse in the French province of Champagne, is variously named in the sources, e.g. Brieres or Prieres (Μπριέρες or Πριέρης in Greek), Bruières, Briers, Briel or Brielle. Geoffrey's father inherited the Barony of Karytaina sometime around 1222 from his brother, Renaud of Briel. The Barony was the third largest (after Akova and Patras) in the Principality of Achaea, counting 22 knights' fiefs and being responsible for keeping <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rebellious inhabitants of the mountainous Skorta area.|$|E
5|$|In December 1447, {{after leaving}} a {{protective}} force {{of three to}} four thousand men under Vrana Konti to guard the frontier {{in the event of}} an Ottoman incursion, Skanderbeg turned towards Dagnum with a force of 14,000 men. Initially offering the garrison at Dagnum the opportunity to surrender, he promptly besieged the fortress upon rejection. In order to pressure the Venetians, Skanderbeg also turned towards Durazzo, then another possession of Venetian Albania, and cut the city off from their local resources and trade. This move forced Venice to redirect to Durazzo two galleys, which initially were bound for Crete, in order to <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> events there.|$|E

5|$|Night Trap is an {{interactive}} movie video game developed by Digital Pictures and originally released by Sega for the Sega CD in 1992. The game is presented primarily {{through the use}} of full motion video (FMV). In Night Trap, the player takes the role of a special agent tasked to watch over teenage girls (starring Dana Plato) visiting a house which, unbeknownst to them, is full of danger. The player watches live surveillance footage of the house and triggers traps to capture anyone seen endangering the girls. The player can freely switch their view between different cameras to keep <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> girls and eavesdrop on conversations to follow the story and listen for clues.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory that}} the song refers to the burying, perhaps alive, of {{children}} in the foundations of the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha Gomme (later Lady Gomme) in The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland (1894–1898) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie. This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice, who will then <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bridge. However, there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in the foundations of London Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{situation}} in the North Sea in late 1918 remained much as it had been for the previous four years—with the Grand Fleet maintaining its endless <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> High Seas Fleet—the war on the Western Front was rapidly drawing to a close. Operation Michael, the last German offensive, had been stopped in late summer, and with the aid {{of hundreds of thousands of}} American doughboys, the Allies had begun to overwhelm the German Army. On 3 October, Prince Max of Baden replaced Georg von Hertling as Chancellor of Germany, and immediately asked President Woodrow Wilson to arrange an armistice.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey is {{mentioned}} {{again in the}} campaigns of the early 1270s, when Palaiologos sent a new commander to the Morea, Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos. In 1270, Geoffrey and his neighbour, the Baron of Akova, joined the Prince's army with 150 horsemen and 200 infantry. The Latin force raided the Byzantine holdings in Laconia, but Philanthropenos avoided being drawn into a pitched battle. A period of relative peace followed due to the ongoing Second Council of Lyon, but in 1275, the mutual truce was broken by the Greeks. Prince William entrusted a force of 50 horse and 200 crossbowmen to Geoffrey, who stationed them to keep <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> defiles of Skorta, but he died of dysentery in late 1275. After his death, Karytaina was increasingly subject to the attacks of the Byzantines, and finally fell to them in 1320.|$|E

5|$|In 548, Emperor Justinian {{dispatched}} 8,000 {{men under}} Dagisthaeus, who {{together with a}} Lazic force set siege to the Persian garrison at Petra. As the Persians were well provisioned, the siege dragged on. Dagisthaeus had neglected to keep <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mountain passes that led into Lazica, and a far larger Persian relief force under Mihr-Mihroe arrived and raised the siege. Yet, the Persians lacked sufficient supplies, and so, after strengthening the garrison at Petra and leaving further 5,000 men under Phabrizus to secure its supply routes, Mihr-Mihroe left. In the spring of the next year, Gubazes and Dagisthaeus combined their forces, destroyed Phabrizus's army in a surprise attack, and pursued the survivors into Caucasian Iberia. In the same summer, they won another victory against a new Persian army, led by Khorianes. The allies failed, however, to prevent another Persian army from reinforcing Petra, and Dagisthaeus was recalled and replaced by Bessas.|$|E
5|$|Studying {{the outcome}} of the events in Rolling Thunder, the Air Force and Navy came to very {{different}} conclusions on how to adapt. The Air Force noted that most of their air-to-air losses were due to unseen attacks from the rear, and thus the problem could be addressed through additional technology that would provide early warning of such attacks. They began modifying their aircraft with built-in M61 Vulcans for close-in use, adopted the Sidewinder and began upgrading them to improve their performance, and introduced new ground and air-based radars to provide an overall <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. The Navy concluded that the primary problem was that their pilots had not been given proper air combat maneuvering training, and were forced to rely on missiles that were not performing as expected. In 1968 they introduced the TOPGUN program, a move that was welcomed by the F-8 pilots who had been campaigning for this all along.|$|E
5|$|In {{his letter}} of 29 October 1862, Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi. In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell, {{notified}} Bulloch, who had purchased the ships {{in his own}} name, that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war. Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863, nominally {{on behalf of the}} Egyptian government, with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea. The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships, so this was superficially plausible. North Carolina, later HMS Scorpion, was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi, later HMS Wivern, received the name of El Monnassir. Lord Russel, prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador, Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels. The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship, , to <b>watch</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September. The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October.|$|E
