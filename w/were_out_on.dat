5|$|Australia batted {{and passed}} England's total {{on the first}} afternoon. Tallon came in to bat {{on the second day}} with the score at 7/332, joining opener Morris, who had already passed 150. It took a run out to remove Morris; he {{attempted}} a quick run to third man after being called through by Tallon but was not quick enough for the substitute fielder's arm, leaving Australia at 8/359. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring, before both <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> 389, ending Australia's innings. In the second innings, Tallon caught Hutton from Miller and conceded nine byes as England were dismissed for 188 and lost by an innings, sealing a 40 series victory for Australia.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. The {{following}} batsmen {{were unable to}} establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five and Harvey 17, both falling to Hollies as Australia progressed to 265/5. Loxton accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before Edrich removed him for 15. Young removed Lindwall for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he had attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man but was not agile enough for the substitute fielder's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> 389, ending Australia's innings. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two spinners.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done anything wrong. Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E

Alternatively, Turner writes that, unknown to Epstein, arrangements had been made between Ramon Ramos and Vic Lewis for the Beatles to spend the night on the yacht, since that presented a better security option than a city hotel. Aspinall, who had arrived at the marina with the Beatles' hand luggage while they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the bay, said that their abduction was carried out by a militia gang who were rivals of the individuals presenting the upcoming concerts.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, May 3, 1886, {{a general}} strike was called on Milwaukee's breweries, {{with as many as}} 1,000 men marching on Falk's Brewery in an effort to close the facility. Masses of brewery workers joined the protest and by that evening some 14,000 brewery workers <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> strike. That same {{afternoon}} several hundred Polish workers went to the railroad shops located in the Menomonee Valley to appeal to the 1400 railway shopmen working there to join the general strike. Most refused to quit work and law enforcement authorities were called upon to break up the group of strike agitators.|$|E

25|$|Scores of {{military}} and commercial pilots, flying everything from small bush planes to four-engined turboprops, were {{the backbone of the}} operation. USAF LC-130 aircraft, operated by the 139th Airlift Squadron, provided a significant amount of airlift to sites like Dye 3 that <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> ice caps such as the ones in northern Greenland. C-124 Globemaster and C-119 Flying Boxcar transport planes also supported the project. Together, these provided the only means of access to many of the stations during the wintertime. In all, 460,000 tons of materials were moved from the US and southern Canada to the Arctic by air, land, and sea.|$|E
25|$|Following {{an intense}} quarrel over her behavior, Piaf left Louis Dupont (Marcelle's father) taking Mômone and Marcelle with her. The three {{stayed at the}} Hôtel Au Clair de Lune, Rue André-Antoine. During this time, Marcelle was often left {{alone in the room}} while Piaf and Mômone <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the streets or at the club singing. Dupont {{eventually}} came and took Marcelle away, saying that if Édith wanted the child, she must come home. Like her own mother, Piaf decided not to come home, though she did pay for childcare. Marcelle died of meningitis at age two. It is rumored that Piaf slept with a man to pay for Marcelle's funeral.|$|E
500|$|On a Sunday {{afternoon}} in Chicago, during either the 1886 or 1887 baseball season, Sunday {{and several of}} his teammates <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the town on their day off.

Attracted by the hymns he had heard his mother sing, Sunday began attending services at the mission. After talking with a former society matron who worked there, Sunday – after some struggle on his part – decided to be [...] Christian. He began attending the fashionable Jefferson Park Presbyterian Church, a congregation handy to both the ball park and his rented room.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} the crew <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the {{surrounding}} ice during the night when a break-up of the pack occurred. When morning came, the group, consisting of Tyson, Meyer, six of the seamen, the cook, the steward, {{and all of the}} Inuit, found themselves stranded on an ice floe. The castaways could see the Polaris [...] away, but attempts to attract the ship's attention with a large black cloth were futile. Resigned to the ice, the Inuit soon had igloo shelters built, and Tyson estimated that they had [...] of food. They also had the ship's two whaleboats, and two kayaks, although one kayak was soon lost during a breakup of the ice. Meyer reckoned that they were drifting on the Greenland side of the Davis Strait and would soon be within rowing distance of Disko. He was incorrect; the men were actually on the Canadian side of the strait. The error caused the men to reject Tyson's plans for conserving. The seamen soon broke up one of the whaleboats for firewood, making a safe escape to land very unlikely. One night in November, the men went on an eating binge, consuming a large quantity of the food stores. The group drifted on the ice floe {{for the next six months}} over [...] before being rescued off the coast of Newfoundland by the sealer Tigress on April 30, 1873. All probably would have perished had the group not included the skilled Inuit hunters Ebierbing and Hendrik, who were able to kill seal on a number of occasions. Despite this, scarcely a word was written about the Inuit in either the official reports of the expedition, or the press.|$|E
