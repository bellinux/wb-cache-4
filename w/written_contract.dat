25|$|The {{home country}} {{organization}} will contact a partner {{organization in the}} country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program {{may or may not be}} screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be allowed to come on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a <b>written</b> <b>contract</b> that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.|$|E

500|$|The {{rights to}} Buddha and its {{associated}} recordings were {{the subject of a}} legal dispute between the band and Secor in later years. According to Secor, he and the band had a gentleman's agreement: he would pay for the costs of recording and manufacturing the tape, and in exchange would receive half of all the profits from it. Raynor contends that the oral agreement was that Secor would invest $1,000 and when that money was recouped, the band would have complete ownership of the work product. Secor helped the band sign to Cargo Music in 1994, as he had connections at the label; he felt that by helping the briskly growing band sign a deal he could build his own label, Filter, in the wake of Blink's success. According to Secor, he attempted to contact the band to discuss the rights to the tape, but would only receive comments such as [...] "Oh, let me call my manager and I'll call you right back." [...] Secor asserted he should have the rights to the master tapes, as he financed the entire production. Cargo Music began calling and making threats, and Secor had no money to fight back with, as they had no <b>written</b> <b>contract.</b> In 1996, the band signed a joint-venture deal with major label MCA Records, who also began making calls to Secor.

However, though the Kenya Horticultural Crops Development Authority’s code of conduct on contractual guidelines has promoted business to farm business (B 2 B) relationships between exporters and smallholders, the relationships have received little empirical analysis.

The analysis reveals that the B 2 B strategies are based on supply chain governance constructs: <b>written</b> and verbal <b>contracts.</b> The purpose of the contracts is to manage procurement of high quality and safe produce which in itself is contingent on the European Union market served. On targets, <b>written</b> <b>contracts</b> seem efficient with organized producers and verbal contracts with independent producers. As competitive edges, <b>written</b> <b>contracts</b> are orientated toward differentiation strategy and verbal contracts, low-cost strategy.
