25|$|An {{important}} factor that {{allowed for the}} expansion of the Manchukuoan army was conscription. The Military Supplies Requisition Law of 13 May 1937 allowed the Manchukuoan and Japanese armies to conscript laborers, as well as allowing them to appropriate land and materials for the purposes of keeping order. The draft of soldiers did not begin until April 1940 and was not officially signed into law until 1941, which allowed every able-bodied male between the ages of eighteen and forty to be called up. All youths were required to get a physical and then 10% of them were selected for service. Education, physical fitness, and their families' loyalty to the regime <b>were</b> <b>things</b> taken into consideration for selecting conscripts. When this was not enough, the Japanese forcibly drafted males from across the country into the army, and many efforts were taken to foster a Manchukuoan patriotic spirit among the troops.|$|E
500|$|For the 2009 {{version of}} Friday the 13th, effects artist Scott Stoddard took {{inspiration}} from Carl Fullerton's design in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's work in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard {{wanted to make}} sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed, there <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I thought were great, but there <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up." [...] In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.|$|E

500|$|For Jason's wardrobe, Mears {{was given}} a pair of combat boots and a [...] "high-priced t-shirt" [...] that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt.

[...] The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed {{over the top of the}} military jacket. Mears called it a [...] "giant Frankenstein jacket."

500|$|While von Stauffenberg {{listens to}} Richard Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] in the film, {{in reality the}} colonel hated Wagner. In addition, von Stauffenberg's elder brother Berthold was also omitted from the film.

He explained the removals, [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>things</b> I actually left out because I knew people would think we were making them up ... imagine Tom Cruise saying 'No morphine!' People would think it's a contrivance." [...] In the film, von Haeften steps {{out in front of}} von Stauffenberg when he faces the firing squad, but when filmmakers attempted to reconstruct the scene based on eyewitness testimony and photographs, they discovered that the shots that killed von Haeften would also have killed von Stauffenberg, who was actually shot shortly after. Another alteration was to the portrayal of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, played in the film by Kevin McNally. Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic, dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy, though filmmakers considered him a [...] "much more moral character" [...] in reality.|$|E

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval.

I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there <b>were</b> <b>things</b> he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny".
