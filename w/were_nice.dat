500|$|For the {{research}} facility at [...] "Taskerlands", Kneale {{was influenced by}} a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, {{the research}}ers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal {{of the members of}} the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape. Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, [...] "The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. [...] They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, which is a very clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research... They <b>were</b> <b>nice</b> chaps– and so we got some very nice chaps for the TV version".|$|E
500|$|Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine's reviewers heavily {{praised the}} graphics, music, and {{multiplayer}} gameplay, {{saying that it}} had [...] "some of the best music I've ever heard from a cartridge". They hoped that other companies would take the game's lead in adding multiplayer modes to role-playing games. Diehard GameFans review of the game named the multiplayer as the game's best component, with reviewer Kelly Rickards saying that while the graphics <b>were</b> <b>nice,</b> the multiplayer [...] "made the game". GamePros review praised the graphics, plot, [...] "first-rate gameplay" [...] and [...] "positively massive" [...] world [...] "dwarfing even Zelda", while stating the gameplay and multiplayer were [...] "rough around the edges", concluding it to be [...] "one of the finest action/RPGs" [...] on the SNES. Nintendo Power called it an [...] "enthralling epic", praising the [...] "wide variety of sites and terrain," [...] music, [...] "Beautiful graphics and great depth of play" [...] but criticizing the [...] "unnecessarily long" [...] sword powering-up and [...] "awkward" [...] item selection method.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they <b>were</b> <b>nice</b> or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E

500|$|Thomas {{liked the}} visuals, {{saying that the}} game was capable of {{conveying}} characters' moods instantly despite being limited to only a few frames of animation, and that the backgrounds <b>were</b> <b>nice</b> and fitting in well with the ones from returning locations; he did however dislike how {{a lot of the}} artwork was reused from previous Ace Attorney games. Cole and Moriarty were not bothered by the limited character sprites and animation or static backgrounds; Cole called the character designs [...] "memorable and hilariously animated", while Moriarty, who liked both, said that the characters looked [...] "awesome". Thomas called the game's music outstanding, saying that the intense music that plays at high-stakes moments during trials, as well as the character themes, all fit well. Cole said that the courtroom and character themes were memorable and fitting; he called them improvements over their counterparts in Justice for All, and [...] "at least on par with" [...] those in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Moriarty said that the music [...] "set the mood perfectly" [...] for each scene.|$|E
500|$|Although {{her husband}} {{was aware of the}} books she was writing, he showed no {{interest}} in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste. She took the name [...] "Bannon" [...] from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it. She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage, however, and in realizing that [...] "not all lesbians <b>were</b> <b>nice</b> people", she took these frustrations out on her characters. [...] "I couldn't stand some of what was happening to me–but Beebo could take it. Beebo really, in a way, had my nervous breakdown for me...I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger that I was not able to express," [...] she recalled later. Women in the Shadows was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon's readers. The book examined interracial relationships, self-loathing in matters of sexuality and race, alcoholism, jealousy, violence, and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s, also explored the intricate details {{of what it was like}} to pass as heterosexual in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 7.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} a [...] "good" [...] episode. He was positive towards the Logan and Keith storylines, writing [...] "the other main storylines, featuring Logan and Keith, <b>were</b> <b>nice</b> ones for the respective characters," [...] calling the half-brother plotline [...] "interesting". On the advancing of the rapist plot, Goldman praised the increase in Veronica's personal involvement with the case, while continuing to criticize the portrayal of the feminists in the episode. [...] "At this point, neither we, nor Veronica, seem to be meant to have nearly any sympathy for them. And yet, shouldn't we all naturally be able to connect more to a group of girls who are passionately seeking to stop a serial rapist on campus?" [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a very positive review, lauding the Logan's half-brother storyline, calling it [...] "Top quality stuff. I loved the moment when Veronica realized Logan's brother was an imposter and in the next scene we saw the two guys surfing together. So much suspense!" [...] Television Without Pity gave [...] "Charlie Don't Surf" [...] a [...] "B+". The reviewer was very positive towards the plot involving Logan and his supposed half-brother, writing, [...] "since Logan actually knows how to find Charlie in person, perhaps this all doesn't have to be quite as tragic as it's coming off. Still, in my opinion? Best episode of the season so far." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1810, she was {{presented}} to the elected heir to the throne, Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she {{was presented}} to the next elected heir to the throne, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: [...] "I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believe that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!" [...] At the meeting, her face were to have turned white, but at the end, she {{is said to have been}} delighted by his charm.

2500|$|Haye grew {{up among}} the town {{houses of the}} Peabody Estate, near the famous Tate Modern Gallery and {{around the corner from}} the South Bank tourist attraction, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Haye went to school at Bacon's College. His College {{principal}} Tony Perry remembers Haye as a 'very athletic, very smart young man'. Haye started his ambition and passion for boxing at old-school boxing gym Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth, South London, where he quickly impressed and confidently won his first amateur bouts. Mick Carney, who ran the gym where David began training from 10 years old, said of Haye: [...] "He could whack as a kid. I think he chinned about three kids. But that made it really hard to get him matches. When you've got three first-round knockouts on your card everybody runs for the hills." [...] Of his upbringing, he described Haye as [...] "a lovely kid. He comes from a beautiful, loving family. He wasn't on the streets. He went to school, came to the gym, went home. His family bestowed love and affection on him. Bermondsey might have been bad, but he, his brother and his sister <b>were</b> <b>nice</b> people from a nice family." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1924 {{election}} campaign, Reeves {{was asked}} to {{speak on behalf of}} both the Liberal and Labour Party candidates. [...] She choose to support Labour: [...] "The Liberal audiences <b>were</b> <b>nice</b> narrow decent people. They sat upright in rows and clapped their cotton gloves... But when I got to the Labour meetings in the slums, among the costers and the railway men and the women in tenth hand velvet hats – when I saw their pinched grey-and-yellow faces in those steamy halls, I knew all of a sudden that they were my people". [...] She soon {{became a member of the}} party and supported her husband as the Labour Party candidate for Holland-with-Boston in Lincolnshire. [...] The seat had gone to the Liberals in a by election earlier that year and Rivers failed to win it back. Amber attempted to get her theories on currency, later brought together in her book The Nationalisation of Banking, adopted by the Labour Party, and she and Rivers became responsible for a party publication called Womens Leader. Amber remained active in the Fabian Society, and by this time many Fabians agreed that there was a need to work through the parliamentary Labour Party. She stood twice as a candidate for Hendon, in 1931 and 1935 ...|$|E
