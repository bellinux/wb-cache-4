5|$|Several {{species of}} animal can {{integrate}} cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the earth's magnetic field or from the sky) to identify <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including olfaction and echolocation may also be used.|$|E
25|$|They {{locate a}} {{habitable}} world, which Ellie names Charity, and the passengers become colonists. Meanwhile, the crew continues {{to try to}} figure out <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> whether they can return to Earth. Unfortunately, it turns out the planet is already inhabited by hostile centaur-like sapients. Max and Ellie are captured, but Ellie's pet is able to guide Sam to them. They escape, though Sam is killed covering their retreat.|$|E
25|$|A truck breaks down. Three fugitives from justice get out {{and find}} {{themselves}} in the city of Mahagonny: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.|$|E

25|$|In some countries, convicts are transported from {{court to}} prison or from one prison to another by railway. In such {{transportation}} {{a specific type}} of coach, prisoner car, is used. It contains several cell compartments with minimal interior and commodities, and a separate guard compartment. Usually the windows are of nontransparent opaque glass to prevent prisoners from seeing outside and determine <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> windows usually also have bars to prevent escapes. Unlike other passenger cars, prisoner cars do not have doors at the ends of the wagon.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{demand of}} the {{movement}} has been for decent, public housing and much of its work {{takes the form of}} opposing evictions. The movement has often used the phrase 'The Right to the City' to insist that the location of housing is critically important and demands that shack settlements are upgraded <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> that people are not relocated to out of town developments. The movement rejects technocratic approaches to the housing crisis and stresses the need for dignity to be central to the resolution of the housing crisis. It is opposed to shack dwellers being moved into 'transit camps'.|$|E
25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: {{a cause for}} growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their e-mail inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> post it online for all to see. Users can protect themselves by updating virus protection, using security settings, downloading patches, installing a firewall, screening e-mail, shutting down spyware, controlling cookies, using encryption, fending off browser hijackers, and blocking pop-ups.|$|E
60|$|Jean le Roi's {{long fingers}} took firm {{hold of the}} notes. He buttoned them up in his pocket, slapped the place <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> poured out more brandy.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{that night}} <b>they</b> abided <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> when the early {{breaking}} of the day had come they departed thence upon {{the way that the}} damsel had pointed out.|$|R
60|$|For {{several days}} they kept patiently on, {{watching}} every sign {{that might give}} them an idea as to <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> how near to {{the banks of the}} Missouri.|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times {{rated the}} film as the best of 2009, writing, [...] "The Hurt Locker is a great film, an {{intelligent}} film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> what they're doing and why." [...] He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film [...] "spellbinding." [...] Ebert considered Renner [...] "a leading contender for Academy Awards," [...] writing, [...] "His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man {{is and what he}} feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense." [...] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next day}} the constabulary began raiding other central Taranaki Māori {{settlements}} in search of arms, and within days the raids, accompanied by destruction and looting, had spread to Waitara. On 11 November, 26 Whanganui Māori were arrested and Bryce, frustrated {{in his attempt to}} identify those from outside central Taranaki, telegraphed Hall to advise he intended destroying every whare in the village. He told Hall: [...] "Consider, here are 2000 people sitting still, absolutely declining to give me any indication of where they belong to; they will sit still <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> do nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Premier Gardiner sent a wire to the Prime Minister, {{accusing the}} police of [...] "precipitating a riot" [...] {{while he had}} been {{negotiating}} a settlement with the Trekkers. He also told the prime minister the [...] "men should be fed <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> sent back to camp and homes as they request" [...] and stated his government was prepared to [...] "undertake this work of disbanding the men." [...] An agreement to this effect was subsequently negotiated. Bennett was satisfied that he had smashed what he believed was a communist revolt and Gardiner was glad to rid his province of the strikers.|$|E
60|$|After much {{consideration}} <b>and</b> consultation, it <b>was</b> agreed that, in the meantime, {{the party}} should remain <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and,</b> when their claims began to fail, {{go off to}} Grizzly Bear Gulch.|$|R
50|$|They both {{met while}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{students}} at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> still <b>are</b> best friends while going to university together. They started professionally recording music in 2014.|$|R
60|$|Followed by the others, Olfan sprang {{first to}} the door of the cell <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> then through the {{connecting}} passage to that of Juanna's prison. It was true, both were closed.|$|R
2500|$|Blackstone's Memorial {{was signed}} by several hundred {{prominent}} Americans, and received wide attention. Although the Memorial did not contain the phrase [...] "land without a people", shortly after returning from his trip to Palestine in 1881 Blackstone had written, also {{in the context of}} his concern over the fate of the Jews of the Russian Pale, [...] "And now, this very day, we stand {{face to face with the}} awful dilemma, that these millions cannot remain <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> yet have no other place to go... This phase of the question presents an astonishing anomaly – a land without a people, and a people without a land".|$|E
2500|$|Thompson and {{his crew}} {{witnessed}} an unarmed woman being kicked and shot at point-blank range by Captain Medina, who later claimed that he thought she had a hand grenade. Thompson then saw a group of civilians (again consisting of children, women, and old men) at a bunker being approached by ground personnel. Thompson landed and told his crew that if the soldiers shot at the Vietnamese while {{he was trying to}} get them out of the bunker that they were to open fire on these soldiers. Thompson later testified that he spoke with a lieutenant (identified as Stephen Brooks of 2nd Platoon) and told him there were women and children in the bunker, and asked if the lieutenant would help get them out. According to Thompson, [...] "he [...] said the only way to get them out was with a hand grenade". Thompson testified that he then told Brooks to [...] "just hold your men right <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> I'll get the kids out". He found 12–16people in the bunker, coaxed them out and led them to the helicopter, standing with them while they were flown out in two groups.|$|E

50|$|The disciples became greatly perturbed <b>and</b> <b>were</b> {{sure that}} Ambaji must have died. As <b>they</b> <b>were</b> about to rush towards the well, Ramadas {{asked them to}} remain <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> to sit calmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Betsey {{says that}} Gregory says that madam wasn't {{a bit too}} well {{pleased to see them}} <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> that to his believing <b>they</b> <b>was</b> {{expected}} to come here {{just like the rest of}} us." ...|$|R
60|$|Anyhow, {{they had}} got {{something}} to start from then. <b>They</b> did know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> the map <b>was</b> once more consulted, and the thing seemed simpler than ever, and off they started for the third time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{plan is to}} burn {{every single}} thing,' said Miss Fowler. 'Then we shall know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> no one can handle them afterwards. What do you think?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course Peter was all {{excitement}} and interest at once. [...] "Where are their homes?" [...] he asked eagerly. [...] "Tell me <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> I'll go straight over and call." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh—I {{can find}} you that—and the will. He told me <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> {{to give them}} you when you came. He seemed to {{think a lot of}} you. Perhaps he might ha' done better for himself——" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Miss Vance, fashionably, {{and looked}} down; {{then she looked}} up and said, intellectually: [...] "Don't you think it's a great pity? How much better for them to have stayed <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> what <b>they</b> were!" ...|$|R
50|$|During the attack, Sergeant Wan Yaacob {{heard the}} gunfiring {{and he knew}} that the Malay platoon was in under attacked. He told the Chinese to stay <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> he led his men to the place where the gunfiring came from.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, he is,' said Mr. Pickwick and Sam, {{with great}} earnestness. 'Then I know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> that's all about it,' said Mr. Weller; 'they're at Ipswich, safe enough, them two.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We may get {{a chance}} at them in some other way," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "We have this advantage, we know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> they don't know {{we are on the}} isle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You’d {{better come}} out," [...] ses Mr. Cutts; [...] "you ain’t doing no good. We know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> we’ll watch the pond till daylight—that is, unless Smith ’ud like to ’ave a try." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} midnight before the Henry and the Sea Nymph floated free, but <b>they</b> {{anchored}} <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> {{waited for the}} morning.

5000|$|... ''''Weissnichtwo:'''' In the book, Weissnichtwo (weiß-nicht-wo, German for [...] "don't-know-where") is an {{imaginary}} European city, {{viewed as the}} focus, and as exhibiting the operation, of all the influences for good and evil of the time, described in terms which characterised city life {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th Century; so universal appeared the spiritual forces at work in society at that time that it was impossible to say <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not, <b>and</b> hence the name of the city, [...] "Don't-know-where" [...] (cf.
