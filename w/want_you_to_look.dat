Take charge and watch after the Indians {{in all the}} world." [...] Kimball saw the assignment as fulfillment of a prophecy given in the patriarchal blessing he received as an eight-year-old in 1903, which had stated that Kimball would [...] "preach the Gospel to many people, but more especially to the Lamanites." [...] That term refers to a people in the Book of Mormon believed by Latter-day Saints {{to be among the}} ancestors of modern Native Americans; another term was Nephites.|$|E

[...] He knew Afghanistan was in their sphere of {{influence}} {{and they would be}} queasy. [...] "At the very least we <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> away." [...] He did not want the Russians trying to gum up CIA operations. [...] "From my humble position, I think this is a historical opportunity. Let's get out of the last century into the next one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They say--Mrs d'Urberville says--that she <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after {{a little}} fowl-farm which is her hobby. But this is only her artful way of getting 'ee there without raising your hopes. She's going to own 'ee as kin--that's the meaning o't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll <b>want</b> <b>you,</b> Theodore, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{after the}} {{balls in the}} potatoes," [...] said Mr. Pope lest that ingenuous mind should be {{corrupted}} behind his back....|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Veitch made a {{short-lived}} return to sketch comedy in Let Loose Live. Prior to the show's debut, Veitch {{had said in}} an interview with the Melbourne Age... I think that there is a hunger for comedy. We need something to hold the mirror up and look at the familiar in a different way. So much of the world is presented to us as a kind of impervious block of information, and what satire does is say well, actually, no, <b>you</b> don't have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at everything the way that society <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that." [...] Then {{he brought}} out the necklace, and, taking {{it out of the}} case, {{displayed}} the gems tastefully upon the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Letitia," [...] {{cried the}} Colonel, and {{the tone of}} his voice {{surprised}} her into silence, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> closely at our friend. Does he not remind you of someone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, {{shaking her}} head; [...] "I love you always best, only I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the bambino and love him; I used only to {{want you to}} love me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Brimming with {{gorgeous}} visuals, {{a moving}} score, and a fully realized future {{that might not}} be too far off, there's never a moment where '15 Million Merits' is anything less than gripping, scary, and thought-provoking. It may make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hang yourself, it may make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> throw your computer out of the window, it may make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> quit your job, it may make you ponder the meaning of life, but its goal is simply <b>to</b> make <b>you</b> aware of such things so that we may avoid such an awful future. '15 Million Merits' <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in the mirror and do something about it. [...] " [...] Tim Surette ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dash it all!" [...] he cried. [...] "That's {{just what}} I jolly well {{complain}} of. Who the dickens <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after me? Hang it, you've kept {{your eye on}} me all these years like a frightful policeman! You cut off my allowance {{right in the middle}} of my time at college, just when I needed it most, and I had to come and beg for money whenever I wanted to buy a cigarette. I looked a fearful ass, I can tell you! Men who knew me used to be dashed funny about it. I'm sick of the whole bally business. You've given me a jolly thin time all this while, and now I'm going to get a bit of my own back. Wouldn't you, Pitt, old man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at those; I merely {{meant to}} give you an idea of my {{investment}} transactions. But if you do cost as much as they, never mind. You'll yield a better return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> over there," [...] said Sam, {{pointing}} to the seats some distance away. [...] "Do you see that man sitting near the bottom--right beside that boy with the basket of peanuts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has enough}} {{to worry about}} as it is," [...] he said; [...] "and if they get me, as they will, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after her {{and let me know}} how she gets on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Jerry, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for him!" [...] cried Larkspur warningly. [...] "He {{rooms with}} Dick Rover, remember. They are old chums." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pressure can be {{toward the}} patient's will: [...] "Can we <b>look</b> <b>to</b> your feelings? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> us <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> your feelings?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{authors of}} Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love & Typography add {{hierarchy}} {{to the idea}} of making structure explicit. They say: [...] "effective hierarchy gets people <b>to</b> <b>look</b> where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> there. Without it the reader is left confused and frustrated. Emphasis can be stressed by size, weight, color, style, and placement". Thus, emphasis from several different font decisions joins headings as a feature that makes structure explicit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want them}} to notice me, Philip," [...] she murmured. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{just for a moment}} as though you thought me {{the only person in the}} world--as you did once, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for {{the bill}} in the legislature. Of course there won't be much to do, except to stand by, but {{you will get a}} better idea of what goes on down there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look up, Ruth dear," [...] he begged. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> now--look {{along the}} lighted way and {{hold my hand}} very tightly. Don't you think that, after all, one of your ships has come home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> lads <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{a little}} steam yacht that's layin' at the next pier," [...] Bob said; {{and as a matter}} of course the boys were more than willing to make such inspection, since, after their late experience, {{anything}} in the way of boats or vessels had a new interest for them.|$|R
60|$|You see, her diadem is {{a wreath}} of them; but the {{blossoms}} {{of it are}} not fastening enough for her hair, {{though it is not}} long yet--(she is only in reality a Florentine girl of fourteen or fifteen)--so the little darling knots it under her ears, and then makes herself a necklace of it. But though flowing hair and flowers are wild and pretty, Botticelli had not, in these only, got the power of Spring marked to his mind. Any girl might wear flowers; but few, for ornament, would be likely to wear grass. So the Sibyl shall have grass in her diadem; not merely interwoven and bending, but springing and strong. You thought it ugly and grotesque at first, did not you? It was made so, because precisely what Botticelli <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, the marriage-register, to be sure," [...] {{said the}} clerk, taking a little bunch of keys from his pocket. [...] "How far do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{now that}} we have seen how {{religion}} grows and spreads in men's hearts, now that the fields are white with harvest, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> also and see what the teachers of religion are doing," [...] said the Angel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I don't {{want to be}} seen {{about with}} you," [...] she declared, [...] "because I don't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me, because I want you to leave me alone," [...] she added, with a little passionate choke in her voice.|$|E
6000|$|Carrie's fingers {{tightened}} on his arm. [...] "Perhaps it is so; I {{suppose it}} must be; but, after all, I don't {{think that was}} your only reason. I mean, when you started the quarrel. No, you needn't turn away. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you call it. You're round {{with him in the}} gondoler, night and day, and when he's he'e, you'a settin' with him half the time on the balcony, and it's talk, talk, the whole while." [...] Clementina took in the fact with silent recognition, and Mrs. Lander went on. [...] "I ain't sayin' {{anything}} against it. He's the only one I don't believe is afta the money he thinks you'a goin' to have; but if <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> him, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> what you're about." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> understand, <b>look</b> at the stars," [...] {{that is what}} General de Gaulle advised him. He {{was born}} in Ukraine and he {{established}} great career in France.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he was mad}} enough," [...] replied Dave, with a grim smile. [...] "But say, {{when you}} get the chance, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that Hank Snogger. He looks like {{somebody}} I've met somewhere, but {{for the life of me}} I can't place him." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{and what}} do you think about it now? I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and think. I want every one to look and think. Half the misery in the world comes first from not looking, and then from not thinking. And I do not want you to be miserable.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, there, my pet," [...] the {{sergeant}} said soothingly. [...] "You must not cry any more. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> your best this evening, you know, {{and to do}} credit to us all. And now, I think we have settled everything, so we will {{be going back to}} tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Aunt Pen, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{pretty and}} be a credit to you; but how would <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> see my face the color of those geraniums all the evening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He said, 'You're arresting me, huh? Say, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> where you're goin'; I {{cut some}} ice in this town. I made half the big {{politicians}} in New York!' That {{was what he}} said." ...|$|R
