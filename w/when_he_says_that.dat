5|$|Pearl {{returns to}} her {{penthouse}} apartment. She is visited by Captain Steel, {{who says he has}} been thinking about her recently and regrets their breakup. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he still loves her and {{would like to have a}} relationship with her again, Pearl declines. The next night, she goes to a nightclub with Olivia and Jennifer. They have fun joking about the fortunes, and Pearl admits she is a little sad hers did not come true. Pearl goes to a coffee house and cries when the fortune's deadline passes without anyone talking to her. Friday morning, Pearl is leaving for work when she meets a man who is about to knock on her door. He says he works at the coffee house she visited, and that she left her wallet behind. After a conversation, Pearl and the man arrange a date.|$|E
5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

40|$|I {{discuss what}} Aristotle means <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{scientific}} demonstration must proceed from necessary principles. I argue that, for Aristotle, scientific demonstration {{should not be}} reduced to sound deduction with necessary premises. Scientific demonstration ultimately depends on the fully appropriate explanatory factor for a given explanandum. This explanatory factor is what makes the explanandum what it is. Consequently, this factor is also unique. When Aristotle <b>says</b> <b>that</b> demonstration must proceed from necessary principles, he means that each demonstration requires the principle that is the necessary one for the fully appropriate explanation of its explanandum. This picture also provides a key to understand Aristotle's thesis that scientific explanation depends on essences: it is the essence of the attribute to be explained (rather then the essence of the subject-term within the explanandum) that should be stated as the fully appropriate explanatory factor...|$|R

25|$|The Apology of Socrates {{begins with}} Socrates {{addressing}} {{the jury to}} ask if the men of Athens (the jury) have been persuaded by the Orators Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus, who have accused Socrates of corrupting the young people {{of the city and}} of impiety against the pantheon of Athens. The first sentence of his speech establishes the theme of the dialogue — that philosophy begins with an admission of ignorance. Socrates later clarifies that point of philosophy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> whatever wisdom he possesses comes from knowing that he knows nothing (23b, 29b).|$|E

At that point, {{on the day of the}} Summer Solstice, the vertical rod of the gnōmōn casts a shadow extending in theory to the horizon over 360° as the sun does not set. Under the pole the Arctic Circle is identical to the Equator and the sun never sets but rises and falls on the horizon. The shadow of the gnōmōn winds perpetually around it.|$|E

Robbie Reyes is followed by Daisy Johnson, the vigilante Quake, to the mechanic where he works after she confronted him the previous night about his actions as the Ghost Rider. Johnson believes Reyes <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he, as the Ghost Rider, only murders people who [...] "deserve it", and now wants him to kill her.

He has returned because Jack, Kate and Hurley (Jorge Garcia) have managed to travel back in time and become part of the Initiative. After learning from Jack that they were sent to the island by Daniel's mother, Eloise (younger: Alice Evans; older: Fionnula Flanagan), Daniel visits Dr. Pierre Chang (François Chau) at the [...] and warns him of a catastrophic event that is to occur at the Swan station in six hours.

5000|$|The Bible {{contains}} {{a good example}} of equivocation. Abraham was married to Sarah/Sarai, his half-sister by a different mother. Fearing that as he traveled people would covet his beautiful wife and as a result kill him to take her, he counselled her to agree with him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "she is my sister."

There was also a discussion that the gang had about the show Wings while swimming in the beer tank. Quagmire admits {{that he is the}} most knowledgeable about the show because he is a pilot and the show focuses on two pilots. When Peter goes to look at his secret stash of pornography, the intro from Get Smart is referenced. Stewie asks Brian if Jillian has an alibi, and Brian says no. [...] Stewie starts singing the song [...] "U.G.L.Y.", understanding that Jillian does not have an alibi. Brian sets up a cutaway <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> breaking up with Jillian will be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin. The ensuing gag shows the actors looking for mention of their play following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
500|$|During his trial, Berger {{claimed that}} he had not been aware of the Final Solution until after the war, but the {{prosecution}} produced evidence that he had been present at the first of Himmler's infamous 1943 Posen speeches in which the Reichsfuhrer-SS had explicitly spoken of the extermination of Jews. Berger's defence counsel claimed that his client did not believe the word [...] "extermination" [...] had been used by Himmler with regard to Jews during the speech. Berger's lawyer went on in an attempt to mitigate Berger's actions by claiming that the Cold War bore strong parallels to the Nazi fight against [...] "Jews and Bolsheviks", and the possibility that the US would also have to fight the Soviet Union in the near future. During the war, Berger wrote in an article, [...] "We the National Socialists believe the Fuhrer <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the annihilation of Jewry in Europe stands {{at the end of the}} fight instigated by the Jewish World Parasite against us as his strongest enemy." [...] Berger and others also claimed that the unit commanded by Dirlewanger was not part of the SS, although when the text of Himmler's second Posen speech was uncovered in 1953, it [...] "cast dubious light" [...] on Berger's claim. He displayed no remorse for his actions.|$|E
500|$|Boyle's time as Education Minister was tumultuous: many {{teachers}} enlisted {{to fight in}} World War I, and many others left the profession for more lucrative opportunities elsewhere. [...] In its members' handbook, the Alberta Teachers' Association describes Boyle's efforts to remedy this situation as [...] "heroic", citing in particular his convincing the legislature to set a minimum teachers' salary of $840 per year. [...] Another of Boyle's tactics to alleviate the teacher shortage was {{to make it easier}} for teachers qualified in Quebec to teach in Alberta. [...] However, this liberalization was subject to applicants' English proficiency: Boyle insisted that all instruction in Alberta schools be delivered in English. [...] A Québécois teacher who passed an English language proficiency exam would be granted a temporary teaching license, which could be upgraded to a full Alberta Teaching Certificate with five months' study at a normal school. [...] Boyle's insistence that Alberta was English offended not only the province's French Canadian minority, but also its Ukrainian-speaking population; an editorial in a Ukrainian newspaper maintained angrily that [...] "the minister of education lies <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Alberta is an English province. [...] Alberta is a Canadian province, where everyone has equal rights, including the Ukrainians." [...] During a by-election in Whitford Boyle accused the Conservatives of promising Ukrainian language schools to court the immigrant vote.|$|E

5000|$|In the LXX, Haman {{is called}} a [...] "Macedonian" [...] by Xerxes (see Esther 16:10). Scholars have had two {{different}} explanations for this naming. 1. Macedonian was used to replace the word [...] "Mede", and emphasises this <b>when</b> <b>he</b> also <b>says</b> <b>that</b> there was no Persian blood in him. (In practice the Persians and the Medes co-ruled an empire, but there was great friction between them.) 2. Another opinion is that Xerxes was calling him a Macedonian Spy, due to his insistence on causing civil war within Persia between the Jews and the Persians.|$|R
500|$|Bani Khuraiza,^ as {{they had}} {{assisted}} the confederates, breaking their league with the Muslims. The Muslim army besieged them for fifteen days and nights and reduced them to distress. They came down at the order given them by Saad bin Maaz, who adjudged that the males should {{be put to the}} sword, the women and children made slaves, and their goods divided among the Muslims. The Prophet (the blessing and peace of God be on him !) addressing Saad, said, [...] "0 Saad Maaz—you have pronounced that which the Most High had ordered above the seven skies." [...] God refers to this event <b>when</b> <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> He brought them out of their fortresses {{as they had}} assisted the confederates and protected them. These were believers in the Old Testament, namely, Jews. God cast into their hearts terror of the Prophet and his army, and those who were killed numbered between seven and nine hundred, and their women and children were made slaves. You inherited their land, gardens, fields and houses, their fortified places, and their property consisting of money and cattle. All these were given you by God. And this saying likewise applies to the Kliaiber, to Turkey, or to Persia. It is also spoken in order that whatever country the Muslims may hereafter be in possession of, until the last day, may also be included in the above passage. God is almighty.|$|E
