5|$|The Bill of Middlesex {{exploited}} the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior {{to the introduction}} of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>trespass</b> from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill of arrest. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.|$|E

5000|$|In 1278, {{however, the}} Statute of Gloucester was passed. This limited {{actions in the}} royal courts to {{property}} damage worth above 40 shillings, maims, beatings or wounds.

50|$|The <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{trespass}}</b> and trespass on {{the case}} are the two catchall torts from English common law, the former involving trespass against person, the latter involving trespass against anything else which may be actionable.

5000|$|By the 1350s, <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trespass</b> {{could only}} be litigated in the royal courts if they alleged [...] "force and arms." [...] This was, however, largely a problem of procedure; some {{sections}} of the royal courts were more liberal than others in this respect. In particular, procedure under the King's Bench was less strict than procedure by writ in the Court of Common Pleas. Several cases were brought by a procedure of Bill into the King's Bench which did not allege force and arms between the 1340s and 1360s. In the Humber Ferry Case (1348), a horse was lost while being ferried across the Humber, and no force and arms was alleged.|$|R
2500|$|After the Norman Conquest, fines {{were paid}} only to courts or the king, and {{quickly became a}} revenue source. A wrong became known as a tort or trespass, and there arose a {{division}} between civil pleas and pleas of the crown. The petty assizes (i.e. of novel disseisin, of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The trespass action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for slander, breach of contract, or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts {{so that in the}} 1250s the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>trespass</b> was created and made de cursu (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace.

Later, after the Statute of Westminster 1285, in the 1360s, the [...] "trespass on the case" [...] action arose for when the defendant did not direct force. As its scope increased, it became simply [...] "action on the case". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case.|$|E

40|$|When Oliver Wendell Holmes {{synthesized}} the <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trespass</b> and trespass on the case, he {{left out}} of his gloss of modern accident law an extremely important part, namely, the strict liability that everyone faces for routine errors, such as failing to check one’s blind spot before changing lanes. One proof of how poorly the language of negligence fits the strict liability that actually exists for routine “compliance errors” is the debate among legal historians about whether the modern tort rule governing accidents is less strict than the classical English rule. As I develop in the article, the modern accident rule is, in reality, strikingly similar to the ancient accident rule. Holmes’s neglect of the strict liability component of the modern negligence rule has hindered our understanding of both it and the classical accident rule. When we see clearly what the strict-liability component of the modern negligence rule is, it opens a new window on negligence theory...|$|R

40|$|Location: Library balcony Artist 2 ̆ 7 s Commentary January 28, 2004 Significance: This work {{is unique}} in that it {{reflects}} and draws upon relevant case law, theories, ideas, and history examined in the 1 st semester of law school here at the University of Georgia. Considering that our legal education here is premised on case study and in acknowledging and honoring the significance of Justice Holmes 2 ̆ 7 Lowell lectures I felt it only appropriate to title this work The Common Law. The following dialogue explains this work the the artist 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and gives some light to the various elements incorporated into this piece. Criminal Law: The faint beer bottle in the central character 2 ̆ 7 s head draws upon Proctor v. State symbolizing the concept of thought crimes. the two women with joined hands holding a purple tulip (see Torts) to the central character 2 ̆ 7 s neck draw upon concepts of conspiracy, murder, and attempt. Property: The feather in the hair of the woman (left) represents Johnson v. M 2 ̆ 7 Intosh and the concepts of right to title and right to occupancy. In the central character 2 ̆ 7 s left hand he bear a fox and a time piece on his wrist. Those elements are reflective of Pierson v. Post, the rule of capture, {{and the concept of}} first in time. In the central character 2 ̆ 7 s other hand he holds a twig, which draws upon the ceremonial practices of feudal England in the passing of seisin from one party to another. Civil Procedure: The man in the background in the legendary Rex Grossman, who is serving process in the most effective method, in person. The elongated arms of the woman being served are symbolic of the long-arm statutes provided in state laws. Contracts: The woman (left) is presenting a salt shaker in her right hand, symbolizing Droughty v. Salt and the concept of the donative gift promise. The lines running between the two characters in the background are symbolic of the formation of a contract in the meeting of the minds. Torts: The purple tulip is pulled from the Old English case of Byrd v. Holbrook and symbolizes the spring gun used to protect the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s garden. Here it is being used against the central character and raises the concern of doing with an instrument of device that which one is not permitted to do in person. The holding of hands also represents Summers v. Tice and the concept of joint tortfeasors. The life preserver bearing the name Grayton symbolizes the Grimstad case and the irony embodied in the court 2 ̆ 7 s but-for test. The four (4) dots on the eye of the woman (right) represent foresight, and the eye in her bun of hair represents hindsight. This relates to Eckert v. Long Island R. R. and Terry 2 ̆ 7 s flawed theory on negligence in using hindsight to determine foresight. The cracker in the jaw of the woman (left) draws upon the legend at common law that the kind had the Chancellor <b>of</b> the <b>Writs</b> pass out crackers to those complaining about the insufficient <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trespass</b> in order to quiet the crowd, thus the Ritz cracker. General Elements: The X 2 ̆ 7 s on the central character are reflective of the battle wounds first in the stomach, then the chest, and then in the neck sustained by Justice Holmes in his service to our country. The large hand of the central character bears on each finger 2 ̆ 2 learn 2 ̆ 2, which is a tribute to Justice Learned Hand. The tress in the background are the same trees visible through the large pane glass of the Law Library, constant companions of those who spend long days devoted to their studies. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|At common law, {{the simple}} bond “was almost irresistible,” the only {{defenses}} {{available to the}} debtor being forgery or {{the production of a}} sealed acquittance in court.

Such rules could easily work hardship. What if a promisor (A) orally agreed to supply grain to a promisee (B), but failed to do so? In such a case, B would be unable to bring a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>trespass</b> due to the absence of a deed. B would instead bring debt sur contract, bringing a number of transaction witnesses. But what if A elected wager of law and simply hired his eleven oath-helpers? ...|$|E

5000|$|Over time, {{the royal}} courts {{began to take}} notice of other cases.

The royal courts were initially only concerned with complaints of wrong if the wrong involved a forcible breach of the King's Peace. Such wrongs were enforced by a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>trespass</b> vi et armis contra pacem regis. During the 14th century the royal courts gradually allowed actions which did not involve breaches of the King's Peace. Instead, the plaintiff would set out his 'special case' in an extra clause, specifying the damage sustained which justified the bringing of an action. This {{was known as a}} trespass on the case.
