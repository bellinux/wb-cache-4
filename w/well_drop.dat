In another case there were the original autograph copies of several famous works,--for example, that of Pope's Homer, written on the backs of letters, the direction and seals of which appear in the midst of [...] "the Tale of Troy divine," [...] which also is much scratched and interlined with Pope's corrections; a manuscript of one of Ben Jonson's masques; of the Sentimental Journey, written in much more careful and formal style than might be expected, the book pretending to be a harum-scarum; of Walter Scott's Kenilworth, bearing such an aspect of straightforward diligence that I shall hardly think of it again as a romance;--in short, I may as <b>well</b> <b>drop</b> the whole matter here.|$|E

60|$|Notwithstanding my misanthropy I {{had to see}} a {{few people}} on account of all these Royalist affairs which I couldn’t very <b>well</b> <b>drop,</b> and in truth {{did not wish to}} drop. They were my excuse for {{remaining}} in Europe, which somehow I had not the strength of mind to leave for the West Indies, or elsewhere. On the other hand, my adventurous pursuit kept me in contact with the sea where I found occupation, protection, consolation, the mental relief of grappling with concrete problems, the sanity one acquires from close contact with simple mankind, a little self-confidence born from the dealings with the elemental powers of nature. I couldn’t give all that up. And besides all this was related to Doña Rita. I had, as it were, received it all from her own hand, from that hand the clasp of which was as frank as a man’s and yet conveyed a unique sensation. The very memory of it would go through me like a wave of heat. It was over that hand that we first got into the habit of quarrelling, with the irritability of sufferers from some obscure pain and yet half unconscious of their disease. Rita’s own spirit hovered over the troubled waters of Legitimity. But as {{to the sound of the}} four magic letters of her name I was not very likely to hear it fall sweetly on my ear. For instance, the distinguished personality in the world of finance with whom I had to confer several times, alluded to the irresistible seduction of the power which reigned over my heart and my mind; which had a mysterious and unforgettable face, the brilliance of sunshine together with the unfathomable splendour of the night as—Madame de Lastaola. That’s how that steel-grey man called the greatest mystery of the universe. When uttering that assumed name he would make for himself a guardedly solemn and reserved face as though he were afraid lest I should presume to smile, lest he himself should venture to smile, and the sacred formality of our relations should be outraged beyond mending.|$|E
60|$|This bell--for we may as <b>well</b> <b>drop</b> our quaint personification--is {{of antique}} French manufacture, and {{the symbol of}} the cross betokens that {{it was meant to be}} {{suspended}} in the belfry of a Romish place of worship. The old people hereabout have a tradition, that a considerable part of the metal was supplied by a brass cannon, captured in one of the victories of Louis the Fourteenth over the Spaniards, and that a Bourbon princess threw her golden crucifix into the molten mass. It is said, likewise, that a bishop baptized and blessed the bell, and prayed that a heavenly influence might mingle with its tones. When all due ceremonies had been performed, the Grand Monarque bestowed the gift--than which none could resound his beneficence more loudly--on the Jesuits, who were then converting the American Indians to the spiritual dominion of the Pope. So the bell,--our self-same bell, whose familiar voice we may hear at all hours, in the streets,--this very bell sent forth its first-born accents from the tower of a log-built chapel, westward of Lake Champlain, and near the mighty stream of the St. Lawrence. It was called Our Lady's Chapel of the Forest. The peal went forth as if to redeem and consecrate the heathen wilderness. The wolf growled at the sound, as he prowled stealthily through the underbrush; the grim bear turned his back, and stalked sullenly away; the startled doe leaped up, and led her fawn into a deeper solitude. The red men wondered what awful voice was speaking amid the wind that roared through the tree-tops; and, following reverentially its summons, the dark-robed fathers blessed them, as they drew near the cross-crowned chapel. In a little time, there was a crucifix on every dusky bosom. The Indians knelt beneath the lowly roof, worshipping in the same forms that were observed under the vast dome of St. Peter's, when the Pope performed high mass in the presence of kneeling princes. All the religious festivals, that awoke the chiming bells of lofty cathedrals, called forth a peal from Our Lady's Chapel of the Forest. Loudly rang the bell of the wilderness while the streets of Paris echoed with rejoicings for the birthday of the Bourbon, or whenever France had triumphed on some European battle-field. And the solemn woods were saddened with a melancholy knell, as often as the thick-strewn leaves were swept away from the virgin soil, for the burial of an Indian chief.|$|E
60|$|I {{see myself}} {{moreover}} as somehow always alone {{in these and}} like New York flâneries and contemplations, and feel how the sense of my being so, being at any rate master of my short steps, such as they were, through all the beguiling streets, was probably the very savour of each of my chance feasts. Which stirs in me {{at the same time}} some wonder at the liberty of range and opportunity of adventure allowed to my tender age; though the puzzle may very <b>well</b> <b>drop,</b> after all, as I ruefully reflect that I couldn't have been judged at home reckless or adventurous. What I look back to as my infant license can only have had for its ground some timely conviction on the part of my elders that the only form of riot or revel ever known to me would be that of the visiting mind. Wasn't I myself for that matter even at that time all acutely and yet resignedly, even quite fatalistically, aware of what to think of this? I at any rate watch the small boy dawdle and gape again. I smell the cold dusty paint and iron as the rails of the Eighteenth Street corner rub his contemplative nose, and, feeling him foredoomed, withhold from him no grain of my sympathy. He is a convenient little image or warning of all that was to be for him, and he might well have been even happier than he was. For there was the very pattern and measure of all he was to demand: just to be somewhere--almost anywhere would do--and somehow receive an impression or an accession, feel a relation or a vibration. He was to go without many things, ever so many--as all persons do in whom contemplation takes so much the place of action; but everywhere, in the years that came soon after, and that in fact continued long, in the streets of great towns, in New York still for some time, and then for a while in London, in Paris, in Geneva, wherever it might be, he was to enjoy more than anything the so far from showy practice of wondering and dawdling and gaping: he was really, I think, much to profit by it. What it at all appreciably gave him--that is gave him in producible form--would be difficult to state; but it seems to him, as he even now thus indulges himself, an education like another: feeling, as he has come to do more and more, that no education avails for the intelligence that doesn't stir in it some subjective passion, and that on the other hand almost anything that does so act is largely educative, however small a figure the process might make in a scheme of training. Strange indeed, furthermore, {{are some of the things}} that have stirred a subjective passion--stirred it, I mean, in young persons predisposed to a more or less fine inspired application.|$|E

6000|$|Willum Lang's {{puckered}} face means business. He {{has been}} sent for by a millworker from Langholm, who, having an hour to spare, thinks he may as <b>well</b> <b>drop</b> in at the priest's and get spliced; or by an innocent visitor wandering through the village {{in search of the}} mythical smithy; or by a lawyer who shakes his finger threateningly at Willum (and might as well have stayed at home with his mother). From the most distant shores letters reach him regarding Gretna marriages, and if Willum dislikes monotony he must be getting rather sick of the stereotyped beginning [...] "I think your charges very extortionate." [...] The stereotyped ending [...] "but the sum you asked for is enclosed," [...] is another matter. It is generally about midnight that the rustics of the county rattle Willum's door off its snib and, bending over his bed, tell him to arise and marry them. His hand is crossed with silver coin, for gone are the bridegrooms whose gold dribbled in a glittering cascade from fat purses to a horny palm; and then, with a sleepy neighbor, a cold hearth, and a rattling cynic of a window for witnesses, he does the deed. Elsewhere I have used these words to describe the scene:--"The room in which the Gretna Green marriages have been celebrated for many years is a large rude kitchen, but dimly lighted by a small 'bole' window of lumpy glass that faces an ill-fitting back door. The draught generated between the two cuts the spot where the couples stand, and must prove a godsend to flushed and flurried bridegrooms. A bed--wooden and solid, ornamented with divers shaped and divers colored clothes dependent from its woodwork like linen hung on a line to dry--fills a lordly space. The monster fireplace retreats bashfully before it into the opposite wall, and a grimy cracked ceiling looks on a bumpy stone floor, from which a cleanly man could eat his porridge. One shabby wall is happily hid by the drawers in which Lang keeps his books; and against the head of the bed an apoplectic Mrs. Langtry in a blue dress and yellow stockings, reminding the public that Simon Lang's teas are the best, shudders at her reflection in the looking-glass that dangles opposite her from a string." [...] The signboard over a snuffy tavern that attempted to enter into rivalry with the Queen's Head depicts the priest on his knees going through the church marriage services, but the Langs have always kept their method of performing the ceremony a secret between themselves and the interested persons, and the artist in this case was doubtless drawing on his imagination. The picture is discredited by the scene of the wedding being made in a smithy, when it is notorious that the [...] "blacksmith" [...] has cut the tobacco plug, and caught fish in the Solway, and worked at the loom, the last, and the toll-bar, but never wielded Vulcan's hammer. The popular term is thus a mystery, though a witness once explained, in a trial, to Brougham, that Gretna marriages were a welding of heat. Now the welding of heat is part of a blacksmith's functions.|$|E

50|$|Experience {{has shown}} that {{processes}} usually do not perform {{as well in the}} long term as they do in the short term. As a result, the number of sigmas that will fit between the process mean and the nearest specification limit may <b>well</b> <b>drop</b> over time, compared to an initial short-term study. To account for this real-life increase in process variation over time, an empirically based 1.5 sigma shift is introduced into the calculation. According to this idea, a process that fits 6 sigma between the process mean and the nearest specification limit in a short-term study will in the long term fit only 4.5 sigma - either because the process mean will move over time, or because the long-term standard deviation of the process will be greater than that observed in the short term, or both.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the adsorption was {{studied in the}} range 10 – 70  °C at the initial concentration of Pb 2 + 500  mgL− 1, rpm 120, contact time 2  h, and pH 5. It was observed that initial increment in the adsorption with the increment in the temperature from 10 to 30  °C demonstrates that adsorption is endothermic nature (Fig.  5 e). However, at the temperature more noteworthy than 30  °C, a slight decrease in adsorption was observed from 40 to 70  °C. The adsorption decreases from 96 to 88.4 % {{with an increase in}} temperature from 30 to 70  °C. As we know that the physical adsorption decreases with increasing temperature, and chemical adsorption increases as the temperature increases, in solution, the molecule or adsorbate is not free like in the gas phase; it is surrounded by solvent molecules. Such molecules to be adsorbed on a surface or in a cage (silica) should break its interaction with solvent molecules; it requires energy (endothermic process). In such a case, there is the possibility that the energy required to break interactions with the solvent be higher than the energy released during its adsorption on the surface. In such a case, adsorption is favored with temperature and the whole process be endothermic (favored with temperature). While the possible reason for the decrease in adsorption at certain temperature may be because if temperatures are high and are capable of initiating a back reaction from the chemisorbed state, chemisorption will as <b>well</b> <b>drop</b> by increasing temperature. This is the case if your chemisorption process involves a covalent-reversible reaction. Basically, the elevated temperature makes the chemisorption (in a whole) a physisorption process.|$|E
