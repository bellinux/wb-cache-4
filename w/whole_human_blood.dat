Microspheres were modified using proprietary polyallylamine (PAV) and coupled with macromolecular heparin conjugates (Corline Heparin Conjugate, CHC).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research in this dissertation is to develop microsystem based separation technologies for whole cell cancer analysis using <b>human</b> <b>whole</b> <b>blood</b> as the input sample. This research work is carried out with two different approaches; one based on a miniaturized cascade magnetophoresis system and a second based on dielectrophoresis.

The design, fabrication, packaging, and characterization of several versions of the magnetophoresis and dielectrophoresis microsystems for whole cell cancer analysis in <b>human</b> <b>whole</b> <b>blood</b> sample are presented. The developed magnetophoresis systems have demonstrated improved throughput in the removal of RBC from a <b>human</b> <b>whole</b> <b>blood</b> sample and its application to the separation of tagged cancer cells based on their surface expression level of a specific protein.

The samples were treated with ultrasonic energy. Vickers surface microhardness values were compared after 4 and 180 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed after 4 days.

However, current approaches for providing this analyte are hampered by the requirement to provide external pumping or dilution of blood, which result in low effective yield, lower concentration of target constituents, and complicated functionality.

Furthermore, <b>human</b> <b>whole</b> <b>blood</b> or plasma incubated with EspP(WT) had reduced activities of coagulation factors V, VII, VIII, and XII, as well as prothrombin. EspP did not alter the activities of coagulation factors IX, X, or XI. When analyzed by whole blood TEG, EspP decreased the maximum amplitude of the clot, and increased the clot lysis. Our results indicate that EspP alters hemostasis in vitro by decreasing the activities of coagulation factors V, VII, VIII, and XII, and of prothrombin, by reducing the clot strength and accelerating fibrinolysis, and provide further evidence of a functional role for this protease in the virulence of EHEC and the development of D+HUS...|$|R
40|$|Four benzodiazepines flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam, {{have been}} {{analyzed}} from biological matrices by dual column gas chromatography using a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (NPD) and a micro-electron capture detector (m-ECD). The recoveries {{of the four}} benzodiazepines spiked into <b>human</b> <b>whole</b> <b>blood</b> and plasma were 88. 8 - 97. 9 and 90. 7 - 97. 5 %, respectively. The regression equations for the four benzodiazepines showed excellent linearity. The detection limits (LODs) were 0. 14 - 0. 95 ng/mL for whole blood and 0. 13 - 0. 93 ng/mL for plasma. The method is simple and sensitive for the determination of benzodiazepines in <b>human</b> <b>whole</b> <b>blood</b> and plasma, and {{may be useful in}} forensic science practice...|$|R
