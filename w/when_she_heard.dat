5|$|Shabazz {{was in the}} {{audience}} near the stage with her daughters. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the gunfire, she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body. When the shooting stopped, Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR. Police officers and MalcolmX's associates used a stretcher to carry him up the block to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|In the final, Australia made a poor start; Dawn Fraser almost stopped <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> {{a second}} gunshot, believing that a false start had occurred. She {{finished}} her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, two seconds {{slower than the}} world record she set in the individual 100-metre final, but with a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Nevertheless, this meant that Australia had a smaller than expected advantage. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds, with the Australian lead cut to 0.9 of a second. Even with the advantage of a flying start, Leech's leg was 0.4 of a second slower than her fastest time during the individual competition.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Miceli {{became an}} {{instructor}} at the WCW Power Plant, where she helped train women such as Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) to wrestle. Before WCW's collapse, she engaged in a brief feud with Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas, who defeated her and partner Billy Kidman at Fall Brawl in a Mixed Tag Team Scaffold match. Madusa took a big bump during this match and wasn't seen again on WCW TV. She left the company <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> that Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} World Wrestling Federation, was going to buy WCW. Because she had a previous falling-out with McMahon, she opted not to stay with the company. She retired from professional wrestling for good in 2001 because she did not like the direction in which women's wrestling was going; according to her, it was becoming less about real wrestling and more about Bra and Panties matches.|$|E

25|$|Amongst {{the first}} rescuers {{to arrive at}} the scene were Mr and Mrs Dunbar, caretakers at The Old Blacksmith's Shop, Gretna Green. Mrs Dunbar stated that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the crash, her {{immediate}} thought was that the Germans had come. Mrs Dunbar telephoned doctors in Carlisle for assistance. Mr Dunbar spent the day assisting the rescue efforts.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{made his}} last public {{appearances}} in 1994. By this point, {{he was a}} sick man who could barely leave his own house. On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound from the living room, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> no response to her calls, she went in to find him slumped over in his chair. He had suffered a stroke.|$|E
25|$|One {{afternoon}} Ondine {{was walking}} near some stables <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the familiar snoring of her husband. When {{she entered the}} stable, she saw Sir Lawrence lying {{in the arms of}} another woman. Kicking her husband awake, she cursed him such that he would have breath so long as he remained awake, but if he ever fell asleep his breath would be taken from him and he would die.|$|E
60|$|But Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed {{between the}} time <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> the voices and 5 o'clock, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had taken tea to her mistress.|$|R

25|$|When Bell briefly {{returned}} to Britain in 1925, she faced family problems and ill health. Her family's fortune {{had begun to}} decline due to the onset of post-World War I strikes by workers in Britain and economic depression in Europe. She {{returned to}} Baghdad and soon developed pleurisy. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> recovered, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> that her younger half brother Hugh had died of typhoid.|$|R
25|$|As Rebecca and her entourage {{approached}} Abraham's home, they spied Isaac from {{a distance}} {{in the fields of}} Beer-lahai-roi. The Talmud and the Midrash explain that Isaac was praying, as he instituted Mincha, the afternoon prayer. Seeing such a spiritually exalted man, Rebecca immediately dismounted from her camel and asked the accompanying servant who he was. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> that this was her future husband, she modestly covered herself with a veil. Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, married her, and loved her.|$|E
25|$|Slapp Happy {{was formed}} in 1972 in Hamburg, Germany by British {{experimental}} composer Anthony Moore. Moore had recorded two avant-garde/experimental solo LPs for Polydor Germany, but they rejected his third {{because it was not}} commercial enough. As a result of the rejection, he proposed a pop project with his girlfriend (and soon to be wife), Dagmar Krause from Hamburg, and a visiting American friend, Peter Blegvad. At the time, Krause couldn't sing because of problems with her voice, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> Blegvad's singing she agreed to sing for the group.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, after {{pleading}} {{not guilty}} at Winchester Crown Court, Nicholson was jailed for 11 years for conspiracy to blackmail during the SHAC campaign. Police obtained evidence {{to secure the}} conviction by bugging a 2007 meeting in a cottage in Moorcote, near Hook, Hampshire, attended by Nicholson and six other SHAC activists, as well as hired cars they had used. The bugging was part of Operation Achilles, a police operation against animal rights activists that led to 32 arrests in May 2007, carried out by 700 officers in England, Amsterdam and Belgium. Nicholson gave herself up to police <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> about the raids; she was arrested and denied bail.|$|E

25|$|At {{some point}} during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra {{suggests}} that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which {{may have contributed to}} their animosity. Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the sound of gunfire. Running into town {{in the direction of the}} shots, Josephine was relieved to see that Wyatt was uninjured.|$|E
25|$|Guðrún {{answered}} {{that she did}} not wish to marry Atli, but her mother responded that with Atli she would be as happy as if both Sigurd and her son Sigmund were still alive. Furthermore, if she did not marry Atli, she would live without husband {{for the rest of her}} life. Guðrún responded that her mother should not be so eager to giver her away to the Huns, and she prophesied that Atli would kill Gunnarr and tear out the heart of Högni. Grímhildr began to weep <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the prophecy and told Guðrún that she was forced to give her away to Atli.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Henry took a {{force to}} Winchester where he laid siege to the royal castle which was garrisoned by Angevins. Winchester's royal castle was located on the {{southwest}} side of the city, while an episcopal castle was on the southeast side. Only two other English cities at the time {{had more than one}} castle, London with three and York with two. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> of the bishop's incursion Empress Matilda determined to strike back. She gathered an army of her adherents and sortied from her base at Oxford around 28 July 1141. When the empress appeared before Winchester on 31 July it was a complete surprise. Bishop Henry fled the city while his soldiers retreated to Wolvesey Castle, the one belonging to the church.|$|E

25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went into {{the living room of the}} apartment to read. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E
25|$|Newkirk {{helped her}} mother {{out in the}} leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, {{stuffing}} toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother's advice that it doesn't matter who suffers, but how. She {{tells the story of}} an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog's legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, laughing as they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, and {{tried to get him to}} drink some water, but someone had packed his throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the Financial Times that it was a turning point.|$|E
25|$|Rains argued {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing that Mehserle lacked the malice necessary for a murder charge and {{that he intended to}} tase Grant. A BART officer testified, saying that Grant and his friends had yelled profanities and did not obey her orders to sit down moments before Mehserle fired at Grant. She said she was fearful <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> taunts coming from Grant, his friends, and passengers on the train. After the seven days of testimony, Judge C. Don Clay concluded that Mehserle had not mistakenly used his service pistol instead of his stun gun. The judge based this on Mehserle's statements to other officers that he thought Grant had a gun. He also noted that Mehserle had held his weapon with both hands, but he was trained to use just his left if he was firing a Taser. Mehserle faced up to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.|$|E
60|$|Laura made no {{response}} to this. She had thrilled at his achievement, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> the manager's speech, {{and it became}} still plainer {{that there was a}} certain hazard in dwelling upon his success. She could also be practical.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} in obvious, terrible distress: {{what she was}} feeling at this moment <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was taking those around her into her {{confidence}} could be as {{nothing compared to what}} she must have endured <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>heard</b> the news that her strange bridegroom had been murdered.|$|R

25|$|In 211, Cao Cao {{embarked}} on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass and the subsequent battles. Cao Cao's wife Lady Bian followed her husband and stayed at Meng Ford (孟津; present-day Mengjin County, Henan), while Cao Pi remained in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Lady Bian fell ill during that time. Lady Zhen became worried <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> about it and she cried day and night. She constantly sent messengers to inquire her mother-in-law's condition, but refused to believe them when they reported that Lady Bian was getting better, and she became filled with greater anxiety. Lady Bian later {{wrote a letter to}} her, telling her that she had fully recovered, and only then did Lady Zhen's worries disappear. About a year later, when Lady Bian returned to Ye, Lady Zhen rushed to see her mother-in-law and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy. Those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them. Lady Bian assured Lady Zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety.|$|E
25|$|As Sun Luban {{was worried}} that Sun He would take revenge against her after he became emperor, she {{frequently}} spoke ill of {{him in front of}} their father in the hope that Sun He would be deposed. On one occasion, Sun Quan could not attend a ceremony at the imperial ancestral temple because he was sick, so he ordered Sun He to take his place. Zhang Xiu, an uncle of Sun He's wife Crown Princess Zhang (張太子妃), lived near the imperial ancestral temple so he invited Sun He to stay at his residence during that period. Sun Luban sent her servants to spy on Sun He and reported to her father that Sun He was not in the imperial ancestral temple and was instead staying with his in-laws and plotting something. She also used the opportunity to further speak ill of Sun He's mother, Lady Wang, by telling Sun Quan that Lady Wang expressed glee <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> that he was sick. Sun Quan believed his daughter and became furious with Lady Wang. Lady Wang later died in distress, while Sun He lost favour with his father.|$|E

60|$|That {{visit was}} indeed nothing but pleasure, but Mrs. Ferrars had not {{calculated}} on contingencies and family punctilios.
