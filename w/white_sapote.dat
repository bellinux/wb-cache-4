40|$|Abstract: Three {{selected}} <b>white</b> <b>sapote</b> (Casimiroa edulis) clones (El- 1, El- 2 and El- 3) {{derived from}} seedlings were grown under Sohag condition during 2009 - 2011 seasons at El-Kawther region and were evaluated for fruiting characteristics and their genetic diversity via SDS-PAGE. The full bloom, harvesting date {{and number of}} fruiting days (from full bloom to harvest) was earliest in El- 3 clone and the latest in El- 1. The highest average fruit yield/tree occurred in El- 1 clone followed by El- 2, then E 1 - 3. All the studied clones were characterized by alternate bearing. As for fruit quality (fruit weight, flesh / fruit weight, seed's weight, number of seeds / fruit, TSS, acidity, TSS / Acid ratio, protein and fatty content), the highest values were found in El- 1 clone, while the lowest occurred in El- 2. Genetic diversity, viz., the number of polypeptides was 32 with their molecular weights ranging between 150 and 8 KDa. The SDS-PAGE protein patterns of the three clones showed distinct changes in eight protein bands. Generally El- 1 genotype surpassed the other <b>white</b> <b>sapote</b> clones in the fruit yield and quality and had the latest harvesting date.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} essay is to analyze the work {{performed}} at the National Medical Institute (NMI) {{with a group of}} plants remarkable for containing significant psychoactive principles. The studies on the NMI conducted up to the present time did not analyze in depth the place those substances had in the Institute’s research agenda. For that reason we sought to identify the medicinal plants studied at NMI together with their active principles, the diseases to which they were experimentally applied, and the procedures used to study them. To illustrate that process we present two particular cases: peyote (Lophophora williamsii (Lem.) J. M. Coult) and <b>white</b> <b>sapote</b> (Casimiroa edulis La Llave & Lex.) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>white</b> <b>sapote</b> (Casimiroa edulis La Llave). As {{compared}} with the study to the bean prices (see Tropicultura Vol. 1, n° 3, pp. 86 - 98), the time serie of potato prices displays seasonal moves with larger amplitudes. These variations are due to differents factors : - specific rhythm of the crop cycle - low level of commercialization - storage difficulties during the harvest period. On the other hand it has been identified a long run move in potato prices, the frequence of which is badly known. This move keeps mainly being under business cycle influence. It seems anyway that income demand elasticity of potatoes looks very high {{in such a way}} that wages moving up entail a rise in potato prices on the market of Bujumbura...|$|E
40|$|By searching deserts {{around the}} world, Israeli {{scientists}} have found six fruit and nut trees that show promise as orchard crops for arid regions. The project began in 1984 and initially yielded 27 potential trees, but these have been narrowed down to Yehib (Cordeauxia edulis), Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana), Pitahaya Agria (Stenocereus gummosus), Mongongo nuts (Ricinodendron rautaneii), <b>White</b> <b>Sapote</b> (Casimiroa edulis) and Marula (Sclerocarya birrea). Marula grows in northern South Africa and Botswana where the wild fruits are {{an important source of}} vitamin C. The flesh of the fruit is juicy and aromatic and it is eaten fresh or processed. Inside is a very tasty, small nut. <b>White</b> <b>Sapote</b> comes from Central America where it is already grown in home gardens. The fruits have a creamy white, sweet flesh which has a green-yellow skin. Mongongo nuts grow on sandy soils between latitudes 15 and 21 degrees in southern Africa, including the Kalahari Desert. The fruit has a thin, green, edible flesh covering a hard walled stone. Inside the stone is a very pleasant kernel which is particularily rich in fats and protein. Scientists from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev have been growing the fruit trees on several sites m Israel where tolerance to a range of soils, temperatures and salinity are being assessed. Germination has been difficult to achieve as most of these plants have been adapted to hostile desert conditions. Generally, the trees have seeds with low germination rates, which staggers germination over several years and so increases their chances of germinating in favourable conditions. Transplanting has been another problem as the trees develop long tap roots very quickly. However, Professor Yosef Mizrahi and his team feel that with more time and research these fruit trees may provide arid land farmers with lucrative and sustainable fruit crops.
