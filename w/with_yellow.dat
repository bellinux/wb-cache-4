5|$|One of the {{earliest}} descriptions of a virus-infected plant {{can be found in}} a poem written by the Japanese Empress Kōken (718–770), in which she describes a plant in summer <b>with</b> <b>yellowing</b> leaves. The plant, later identified as Eupatorium lindleyanum, is often infected <b>with</b> tomato <b>yellow</b> leaf curl virus.|$|R
5|$|A {{contradictory}} figure, Caion was {{equated with}} infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context, and his evidently unsubstantiated allegations against Caragiale have traditionally puzzled literary historians. In Transylvania, the word Caion {{was for a}} while synonymous <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> journalist.|$|E
5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to a boiler explosion. The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 {{to acknowledge that the}} sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded Purple Hearts to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Cirque {{has begun}} {{designing}} show-specific tents for Luzia {{which features a}} white big top <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> lines (representing the paths of planets in the solar system) and a white and silver swirl big top for Volta.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 9-10 mm. The forewings are yellow and the hindwings grey <b>with</b> <b>yellower</b> costal and distal margins.|$|R
50|$|The Antipodes Island snipe {{is similar}} to the {{nominate}} subspecies - the Auckland Island snipe - but differs in being darker above and <b>with</b> <b>yellower</b> underparts.|$|R
5|$|The bill's {{appearance}} {{is important in}} the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to black was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted {{on one side}} of the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> and black edging to cab and tender. Lettering and numerals used a sans-serif font.|$|E
5|$|Wasps RFC is an English {{professional}} rugby union team originally {{based in}} London but now playing in Coventry; the name dates from 1867 {{at a time}} when names of insects were fashionable for clubs. The club's first kit is black <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> stripes. The club has an amateur side called Wasps FC.|$|E
50|$|Adults have {{dark brown}} {{forewings}} <b>with</b> a <b>yellow</b> costa. The hindwings are <b>yellow</b> <b>with</b> a brown border.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 26 mm. The forewings are warm buff and light orange <b>yellow</b> mixed <b>with</b> ivory <b>yellow.</b> The hindwings are warm buff mixed <b>with</b> ivory <b>yellow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13 mm. The forewings are white, <b>with</b> a <b>yellow</b> median fascia and a fuscous dot on the costa. The {{terminal area}} is <b>yellow</b> <b>with</b> a white wedge-shaped costal strigula. The {{base of the}} hindwings is white <b>with</b> a <b>yellow</b> median fascia edged with fuscous scales.|$|R
5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Superman: Ultimate Flight is themed after DC Comics' Superman character. The {{track of all}} three rides is red, <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> rails and blue supports. The rides' queues are {{contained}} within each ride's footprint and contain various elements of Superman theming. The installations at Six Flags Great America and Six Flag Great Adventure have dedicated gift shops near the ride's exit that sell a variety of DC Comics merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> mercury(II) oxide. It is very soluble in water, {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make hypochlorites. It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16-18 mm. The forewings are white, the costal and terminal areas suffused <b>with</b> fulvous <b>yellow.</b> The hindwings are white, the terminal area suffused <b>with</b> fulvous <b>yellow.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Several cultivars are available: 'Citrina', <b>with</b> paler <b>yellow</b> blooms {{than the}} {{ordinary}} form; 'Dudley Neville' <b>with</b> golden <b>yellow</b> or tan-tinged blooms sometimes described as [...] "biscuit"; and 'Variegata' with cream-margined leaves.|$|R
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2014, Connie {{performed}} {{a couple of}} concerts in South Korea (Osan and Seoul). These concerts, performed shortly after the horrendous Sewol ferry tragedy, were delivered with much personal consideration by Connie {{to make sure that}} all song choices were appropriate. Connie performed <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> ribbons to show her respect for the families of the victims. The proceeds from at least one of the concerts were donated to the fundraising efforts in support of the families of the victims.|$|E
5|$|On 33 {{seconds the}} 'game' itself {{begins with the}} two player {{characters}} walking {{from left to right}} down a deserted street. As the first chorus begins several zombies enter from the right and are shot by the player characters. After 53 seconds the villain from the introduction appears and laughs before disappearing as the playing area is filled with zombies. The view changes to a cut scene showing close-ups of the two players sunglasses then pans out to show a spaceship illuminating the area <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> light.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 25 mm. The forewings are black <b>with</b> four <b>yellow</b> bands. The hindwings are <b>yellow</b> <b>with</b> a broad black border.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16.5-18 mm {{for males}} and 22-22.5 mm for females. The forewings are black, <b>with</b> a <b>yellow</b> spot and a yellow patch near the base. The hindwings are black, <b>with</b> a <b>yellow</b> subbasal band.|$|R

5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent. The colours {{of the scale}} are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue {{is caused by the}} ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in April or May, De Soto's crew began {{coming down}} <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> fever and the steamer was sent north in early June, {{arriving}} at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 16 June. As per normal practice, the warship was decommissioned {{that same day}} and the crew quarantined until the fever burned out. On 12 January 1865, De Soto was sent to Baltimore, Maryland for the installation of new boilers. She was still there {{when the war ended}} on 9 April 1865.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis can be {{distinguished}} from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites <b>with</b> <b>yellow</b> markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can {{be distinguished}} by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|E
50|$|It has varied {{coloured}} flowers. Ranging {{from white}} <b>with</b> a <b>yellow</b> crest and falls {{of a very}} pale blue, to amythest or pale bluish violet standards (with dark veins) and <b>with</b> a <b>yellow</b> crest and yellow blotch.|$|R
