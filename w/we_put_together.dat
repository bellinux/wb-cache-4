500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, what she wanted to say, where she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric B. and Rakim met in 1985 after Eric B. {{looked for}} a rapper to {{complement}} his turntable work at the New York City radio station WBLS. After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for [...] "New York's top MC", Eric B's friend and roommate Marley Marl allowed him to use his home studio. The first track they recorded, [...] "Eric B. Is President", was released as a single on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After Def Jam Recordings founder Russell Simmons heard the single, the duo were signed to Island Records and began recording the album in Manhattan's Power Play Studios in early 1987. Rakim wrote his songs in approximately one hour while listening to the beat. He then recorded his vocals in the booth by reading his lyrics from a paper. In 2006, Rakim revealed, [...] "When I hear my first album today I hear myself reading my rhymes but I'm my worst critic." [...] The duo completed the album in one week. They {{have said that they}} worked in 48-hour shifts and recorded in single takes in order complete the album within budget. In a 2008 interview with AllHipHop, Eric B. stated, [...] "o sit here and say <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> this calculated album to be a great album would be a lie. We were just doing records that felt good." ...|$|E
500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The first thing I did when I got to Island was suggest <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E

500|$|Some tracks used {{elements}} from Public Enemy's previous material, which Pete Watrous of The New York Times {{interpreted as a}} dual reference to hip hop tradition {{and the history of}} the group. Watrous described the music as [...] "the sound of urban alienation, where silence doesn't exist and sensory stimulation is oppressive and predatory", and writes that its dense textures [...] "envelop Chuck D's voice and make his rapping sound as if it is under duress, as if he were fighting against a background intent on taking him over ... Layer after layer of sounds are placed {{on top of each other}} until the music becomes nearly tactile". Chuck D called Fear of a Black Planet a record entirely of [...] "found sounds ... probably the most elaborate smorgasbord of sound that we did ... When <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> our music, we try to put together layers that complement each other, and then the voice tries to complement that, and the theme tries to complement that, and then the song itself tries to complement the album as a whole, fitting into the overall context." [...] In his essay on hip hop aesthetics, Richard Schur interpreted such layering as a motif in hip hop and as [...] "the process by which ... new meanings are created and communicated, primarily to an equally knowledgeable audience", concluding that [...] "Public Enemy probably took the ideal of layering to its farthest point".|$|E

In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker. The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear, and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover. He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with [...] "good faith" [...] in order [...] "to have more toys to play with as <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a story", and that [...] "the agreement was {{that it is very}} much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in , and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting". Sony Pictures chairman Thomas Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel. At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be Spider-Man: Homecoming, a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character [...] "coming home" [...] to Marvel and the MCU. Tony Revolori and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's, and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark.

The men of the country are very cunning and ingenious in handicraft works; but withal so very idle, that we often saw young lusty raw-boned fellows carried up and down the streets in little covered rooms by a couple of porters who are hired for that service. Their dress is likewise very barbarous, for they almost strangle themselves about the neck, and bind their bodies with many ligatures, that we are apt to think are the occasion of several distempers among them which our country is entirely free from. Instead of those beautiful feathers with which we adorn our heads, they often buy up a monstrous bush of hair, which covers their heads, and falls down in a large fleece below the middle of their backs; with which they walk up and down the streets, and are as proud of it as if it was of their own growth.|$|E
6000|$|All causes, {{social and}} natural, combine {{to make it}} {{unlikely}} that women should be collectively rebellious {{to the power of}} men. They are so far in a position different from all other subject classes, that their masters require something more from them than actual service. Men do not want solely the obedience of women, they want their sentiments. All men, except the most brutish, desire to have, in the woman most nearly connected with them, not a forced slave but a willing one, not a slave merely, but a favourite. They have therefore put everything in practice to enslave their minds. The masters of all other slaves rely, for maintaining obedience, on fear; either fear of themselves, or religious fears. The masters of women wanted more than simple obedience, and they turned the whole force of education to effect their purpose. All women are brought up from the very earliest years in the belief that their ideal of character is the very opposite to that of men; not self-will, and government by self-control, but submission, and yielding to the control of others. All the moralities tell them that it is the duty of women, and all the current sentimentalities that it is their nature, to live for others; to make complete abnegation of themselves, and to have no life but in their affections. And by their affections are meant the only ones they are allowed to have--those to the men with whom they are connected, or to the children who constitute an additional and indefeasible tie between them and a man. When <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> three things--first, the natural attraction between opposite sexes; secondly, the wife's entire dependence on the husband, every privilege or pleasure she has being either his gift, or depending entirely on his will; and lastly, that the principal object of human pursuit, consideration, and all objects of social ambition, can in general be sought or obtained by her only through him, it would be a miracle if the object of being attractive to men had not become the polar star of feminine education and formation of character. And, this great means of influence over the minds of women having been acquired, an instinct of selfishness made men avail themselves of it to the utmost as a means of holding women in subjection, by representing to them meekness, submissiveness, and resignation of all individual will into the hands of a man, as an essential part of sexual attractiveness. Can it be doubted that any of the other yokes which mankind have succeeded in breaking, would have subsisted till now if the same means had existed, and had been as sedulously used, to bow down their minds to it? If it had been made the object of the life of every young plebeian to find personal favour in the eyes of some patrician, of every young serf with some seigneur; if domestication with him, and a share of his personal affections, had been held out as the prize which they all should look out for, the most gifted and aspiring being able to reckon on the most desirable prizes; and if, when this prize had been obtained, they had been shut out by a wall of brass from all interests not centering in him, all feelings and desires but those which he shared or inculcated; would not serfs and seigneurs, plebeians and patricians, have been as broadly distinguished at this day as men and women are? and would not all but a thinker here and there, have believed the distinction to be a fundamental and unalterable fact in human nature? ...|$|E
