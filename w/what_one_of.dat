25|$|While the Aitareya deals almost {{exclusively}} with the Soma sacrifice, the Kaushitaka, {{in its first}} six chapters, treats of the several kinds of haviryajna, or offerings of rice, milk, ghee, etc., whereupon follows the Soma sacrifice in this way, that chapters 7–10 contain the practical ceremonial and 11–30 the recitations (shastra) of the hotar. Sayana, {{in the introduction to}} his commentary on the work, ascribes the Aitareya to the sage Mahidasa Aitareya (i.e. son of Itara), also mentioned elsewhere as a philosopher; and it seems likely enough that this person arranged the Brahmana and founded the school of the Aitareyins. Regarding the authorship of the sister work we have no information, except that the opinion of the sage Kaushitaki is frequently referred to in it as authoritative, and generally in opposition to the Paingya—the Brahmana, it would seem, of a rival school, the Paingins. Probably, therefore, it is just <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the manuscripts calls it—the Brahmana of Sankhayana (composed) in accordance with the views of Kaushitaki.|$|E
