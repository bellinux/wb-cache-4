5000|$|Brad DeLong, Deputy Treasury Secretary for the Clinton {{administration}} at the time, argues that Magaziner's failures stemmed {{from having a}} background in management consulting instead of policy: [...] "A management consultant's principal goal is to win a debate {{in front of his}} employer ... by making intellectual arguments, controlling the flow of information..., and <b>walling-off</b> potential adversaries from the process ... You develop a policy by forming a large coalition ... Then you have a large group of people who are enthusiastic about the proposal: they will go out and make your arguments for you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{property}} {{in question is}} located along Faria Beach in Ventura County, which, {{at the time was}} sparsely developed (in contrast to the 35 ft, three-story homes along the Malibu beaches where development of the [...] "psychological impediment to public access" [...] argument first occurred). Article X, Section 4 of the California Constitution guaranteed access to the beaches, but a prospective beach-goer might have difficulty seeing the beach or finding public access to it. The <b>walling-off</b> effect, the argument went, created a psychological impediment to public access ensuring that no members of the public would be able to utilize a public resource (access to which is guaranteed by the state constitution). The development pattern, in effect, took a public resource supposedly available to anyone and turned it into the private enclave of the wealthy property owners whose houses lined the beach.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of wound-associated wood {{has been relatively}} well studied in beech, but only a little information about the occurrence of extractives and particular classes of compounds in these tissues is available. We examined the content of total phenols and variability in their distribution in sapwood, wound-wood and the reaction zones <b>walling-off</b> typical red heart and xylem altered by wounding in two beech trees, using spectrophotometric method. Significant differences in total phenols in different types of beech wood, as well as differences between trees, were confi rmed. Concentrations of total phenols were markedly lower in red heart than in reaction zones and sapwood extracts. The content of total phenols was highest in extracts of the reaction zones formed as a direct response of sapwood to wounding. Differences {{in the content of}} total phenols in reaction zones <b>walling-off</b> typical red heart and directly wounded xylem indicate differences in their formation process, in alterations to surrounding tissues and in the characteristics of individual trees...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several years we have been {{concerned}} with definition of the origins of adaptive immunity among the lower vertebrates (1, 2), using the term "adaptive immunit/ ' to refer to capacity to form specific antibody, to develop delayed allergy, to reject homografts of skin or other tissues, to show responsive proliferation of lymphoid cells upon antigenic stimulation, and to demonstrate immunologic memory. Extensive prior studies (3 - 9) had established that invertebrates deal with infection by means of non-specific bactericidal substances in their body fluids, phagocytosis, inflammation, and a fibrous <b>walling-off</b> process. Although Phillips et al. (10, 11) and Osawa and Yabuubhi (12) have presented evidence of processes in the invertebrates which they interpret as immunologic in nature, incontrovertible evidence of their specificity has not been presented. Our earlier studies (1, 2, 13, 14) of the California hagfish, perhaps the most primitive of the vertebrates, failed to reveal evidence of gamma globulin formation, clearance of a variety of antigens, antibody synthesis, or follicula...|$|E
40|$|Toxicant baiting {{systems are}} {{effective}} at population suppression against both the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, and the Eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar). However, trap shyness (i. e., station abandonment) is often quoted as a confounding factor affecting their success. We observed that C. formosanus field colonies occasionally abandoned established research field monitors when disturbed. We hypothesized that inadvertent trauma caused by trap disturbance {{could be a}} contributing factor to this abandonment phenomenon. We investigated {{the effects of the}} presence of physically-traumatized workers and soldiers on the consumption of food sources by C. formosanus and R. flavipes in a laboratory choice assay. Feeding was significantly reduced on food sources in contact with dead termites in laboratory trials with both termite species. Our results suggest that there is a continuum of behavioral interactions with dead nest mates, starting with anti-feedant effects and eventually, abandonment and <b>walling-off</b> of the dead termites and the source of mortality. Baiting protocols need to minimize disturbances that could cause trauma and subsequent avoidance of field monitors and baits...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} {{qualitative and}} histoquantitative investigations of tissue restoration after implanting polyglycolide (PGA), polydioxanone (PDS), polylevolactide (PLLA), {{and stainless steel}} pins in the intramedullary canal of rabbit femurs. The effect of bioabsorbable devices on healing of a cortical bone defect was also assessed. The cortical bone defect {{was created in the}} right femur of 80 rabbits. Bioabsorbable and metallic pins in 60 and two metallic pins alone were implanted in 20 intramedullary canals; 80 left femurs served as intact controls. Follow-up times were 3, 6, 12, 24, and 52  weeks. At all time points, collagenous connective tissue, including bone trabeculae, surrounded the implant at the tissue–implant interface, replacing hematopoiesis and fat of the intramedullary canal. The groups did not differ in the area and trabecular bone area fraction of the resulting callus. Residual fragments of PGA and PDS were observed at 24  weeks, and complete degradation occurred within 52  weeks. PGA, PDS, PLLA, and metallic implants induced a bony and fibrous <b>walling-off</b> response in the intramedullary cavity. No inflammation was observed. Complete tissue restoration did not occur within the follow-up, even after complete degradation of PGA and PDS, which had shorter degradation times than PLLA. The cortical bone healing effect was not different between bioabsorbable pins and metallic wires. Thus, these polymers had no specific osteostimulatory or osteoinhibitory properties compared to stainless steel. Within the follow-up period, {{there were no significant differences}} in biocompatibility between the implants and no adverse inflammatory foreign-body reactions...|$|E
