5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a <b>waffle.</b> They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E

5|$|Preliminary {{scouting}} {{was well}} underway {{by the time}} Fargo was renewed. Principal photography began in Calgary, Alberta on January 19, 2015, and took 85 days. The city's central business district and Kensington neighborhood doubled for Kansas City, Sioux Falls, and Luverne. Production crew constructed the <b>Waffle</b> Hut set on the CL Ranch in neighboring Springbank. Elsewhere in the area, shooting took place in Didsbury, High River, and Fort Macleod. Initially, the weather posed a challenge for the production {{because it was too}} warm for snow. To solve this problem, the production crew brought snow to the set from nearby mountains.|$|E
5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much time is spent on her interaction with the computer TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the <b>Waffle</b> Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E
5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special <b>waffle</b> recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E

5|$|After {{a show in}} Indianapolis, Insane Clown Posse's {{tour bus}} stopped at a <b>Waffle</b> House in Greenfield, Indiana. When a {{customer}} began to harass Spaniolo and Bruce, a fight broke out between the customer {{and all of the}} bands' members. Months later on June 4, 1998, Bruce and Utsler pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges (reduced from battery) in an Indiana court and were fined $200 each. Members of Twiztid, Myzery, and Psycho Realm were charged with battery. The group's tour was briefly derailed in January 1998, when their tour bus drifted off a highway and down an embankment, leaving Frank Moreno of Psycho Realm with a concussion. As a result of the accident, Insane Clown Posse postponed two shows scheduled for Cleveland, Ohio, on January 22 and 23, but honored their promise to perform on January 25 and 26. They face a lawsuit over alleged sexual harassment.|$|E
5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's <b>waffle</b> iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E
25|$|The Liège <b>waffle</b> is a richer, denser, sweeter, and chewier <b>waffle.</b> Native to {{the greater}} Wallonia region of Eastern Belgium – and {{alternately}} known as gaufres de chasse (hunting waffles) – they are an adaptation of brioche bread dough, featuring chunks of pearl sugar which caramelize {{on the outside of}} the <b>waffle</b> when baked. It is the most common type of <b>waffle</b> available in Belgium and prepared in plain, vanilla and cinnamon varieties by street vendors across the nation.|$|E

5000|$|Men Are Like <b>Waffles</b> — Women Are Like Spaghetti is a 2001 {{book written}} by Bill and Pam Farrell, co-directors and founders of {{relationship}} counseling organization Masterful Living. It {{is based on}} an analogy comparing men to <b>waffles</b> and women to spaghetti. In this analogy, the walled boxes that together constitute <b>waffles</b> symbolize men's psychological compartmentalization while the overlapping nature of spaghetti symbolizes women's favoring of psychological interconnectedness.|$|R
25|$|The {{dispute over}} the <b>Waffle</b> led to the {{disbanding}} of the Ontario NDP's youth wing in 1972, which was not revived until 1988. The federal NDP also disbanded the New Brunswick NDP for a period in late 1971 after a local <b>Waffle</b> group gained control of it. Mel Watkins and even Elie Martel {{have argued that the}} NDP lost a generation of volunteers and members due to the way the <b>Waffle</b> was handled.|$|E

25|$|Stroopwafels {{are thin}} waffles with a syrup filling. The stiff batter for the waffles {{is made from}} flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium-sized balls of batter are put on the <b>waffle</b> iron. When the <b>waffle</b> is baked {{and while it is}} still warm, it is cut into two halves. The warm filling, made from syrup is spread in between the <b>waffle</b> halves, which glues them together. They are popular in the Netherlands and Belgium and sold in pre-prepared {{packages}} in shops and markets.|$|E

25|$|The media {{attention}} that the <b>Waffle,</b> and its candidate, James Laxer, received, {{before and during}} the vote, partially explains the closest federal NDP leadership election up to that time. Lewis' perceived heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the <b>Waffle</b> at this and previous conventions had made him enough enemies to make the leadership campaign interesting. As well, Lewis was involved in most of the internal conflicts within the CCF/NDP during the previous 36 years, so the many members that felt his wrath as the party disciplinarian during this period, plotted their revenge against him. At his first press conference after winning the leadership, Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the <b>Waffle,</b> as they were soundly defeated on the floor, and he made no promises to them. He also took on the party's Quebec wing, stating that they could continue to theorize about possible self-determination resolutions, but come election time, they must pledge themselves to the party's newly confirmed federalist policy. He did not purge the <b>Waffle</b> from the NDP, instead leaving it to his son Stephen to do in June 1972, when the party's Ontario wing resolved to disband the <b>Waffle,</b> or kick its members out of the party if they did not comply with the disbanding order.|$|E

25|$|By the 16th century, {{paintings}} by Joachim de Beuckelaer, Pieter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel clearly depict the modern <b>waffle</b> form. Bruegel's work, in particular, not only shows waffles being cooked, but fine detail of individual waffles. In those instances, the <b>waffle</b> pattern {{can be counted}} as a large 12x7 grid, with cleanly squared sides, suggesting {{the use of a}} fairly thin batter, akin to our contemporary Brussels waffles (Brusselse wafels).|$|E

25|$|A radical {{left wing}} group nicknamed The <b>Waffle</b> had gained prominence, {{with one of}} its leaders, James Laxer, winning one-third of the vote when he ran to be leader of the federal NDP in 1971.

25|$|Liège waffles, {{the most}} popular {{contemporary}} Belgian <b>waffle</b> variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of Liège. However, there are no German, French, Dutch, or Belgian cookbooks that contain references to them in this period – by any name – nor are there any <b>waffle</b> recipes that mention the Liège waffle's distinctive ingredients, brioche-based dough and pearl sugar. It is not until 1814 that Antoine Beauvilliers publishes a recipe in l'Art du Cuisiner where brioche dough is introduced as {{the base of the}} <b>waffle</b> and sucre cassé (crushed block sugar) is used as a garnish for the waffles, though not worked into the dough. Antonin Carême, the famous Parisian pastry chef, is the first to incorporate gros sucre into several <b>waffle</b> variations named in his 1822 work, Le Maitre d'Hotel Français. Then, in 1834, Leblanc publishes a complete recipe for gaufres grêlées (hail waffles), where gros sucre is mixed in. A full Gaufre de Liège recipe does not appear until 1921.|$|E
25|$|American waffles vary significantly. Generally denser {{and thinner}} than the Belgian <b>waffle,</b> {{they are often}} made from a batter leavened with baking powder, which is {{sometimes}} mixed with pecans, chocolate drops or berries and may be round, square, or rectangular in shape. Like American pancakes they are usually served as a sweet breakfast food, topped with butter and maple syrup, bacon, and other fruit syrups, honey, or powdered sugar. They are also found in many different savory dishes, such as fried chicken and waffles or topped with kidney stew. They may also be served as desserts, topped with ice cream and various other toppings. A large chain (over 2,100 locations) of <b>waffle</b> specialty diners, <b>Waffle</b> House, is ubiquitous in the southern United States.|$|E

Louis decided to start the restaurants on the New Jersey Coast Line because [...] "he liked the communities". In February 2011 Zanias decided to open his first place of business in the Stockton Farmers Market. Now this is not considered the first restaurant because it was a shop. At the Stockton Farmers Market, they made pastries and <b>waffles.</b> On May 5, 2012 Nina's <b>Waffles</b> opened in New Hope, Pennsylvania.The second Nina's location opened in Doylestown,Pa in April 2014.|$|R
