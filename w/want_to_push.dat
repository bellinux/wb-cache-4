He has been touted several times as a potential Atlantic Canadian minister in the cabinets of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin. He expressed some interest in running in the 2004 federal election but announced he would not do so {{because of the lack of}} an available riding in the Moncton, New Brunswick, area. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> aside any incumbent Liberal member of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tree}} wasp, {{as in other}} Hymenoptera species, males are {{produced}} from unfertilized haploid eggs, while females are from fertilized diploid eggs. This is a method of sex determination known as haplodiploidy. This leads to sisters having a relatedness of 0.75 because all sperm produced are identical and they receive half of their mother’s genes while brothers have a relatedness of 0.5. However, the diploid mother is related by 0.5 to both sons and daughters. In these species, there is often conflict between the queen and workers over the sex ratio because workers are more related to sisters then either brothers or their own daughters, meaning they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the sex ratio {{so that there are}} more females than males. At the same time it is most beneficial for the queen to keep the ratio 1:1 because she is equally related to both. The tree wasp police the male eggs laid by workers to keep the ratio more in favor of females, but they rarely interfere with the queens eggs. It is likely that this species is only able to distinguish queen eggs from worker eggs, but is unable to distinguish male and female eggs. As such, there is too much of a risk of destroying female eggs to interfere with queen laid eggs. This helps to keep the worker-queen conflict under control.|$|E
25|$|At the lap five restart, Félix da Costa ran in Ilott's {{slipstream}} {{and turned}} {{right to the}} outside lane to overtake {{him for the first}} position going into Lisboa corner. Yamashita attempted to pass Russell in a manoevure that drew him alongside Russell at Mandarin corner; although he went sideways, he regained control of his car. Félix da Costa attempted to pull away from Ilott but was unable to establish an advantage over the British driver with the pair trading fastest lap times but were able to draw clear from Sette Cãmara. Ilott went wide at the final corner at the event's midway point and dropped back from Félix da Costa because he scared himself and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> harder after the moment. Ilott slightly gained on Félix da Costa and observed him avoiding impact with the Lisboa corner barrier when the Portuguese driver went slightly wide and elected to not take risks to reach the end of the race. Piquet passed MacLeod and Beckmann around the outside and under braking for Lisboa corner to move into twelfth on lap eight. Yamashita overtook Russell for fourth place on the ninth lap. Ilott recorded the qualification race's fastest lap on the same lap, completing a circuit of two minutes and 11.445 seconds. Félix da Costa maintained the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to win. Ilott finished second, 0.850 seconds behind with Sette Camara in third, Yamashita fourth and Russell fifth. Rosenqvist drove conservatively to secure sixth place. Juncadella, Ticktum, Sims and Hughes rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E

500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and they all <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one.

500|$|On Folie à Deux, Fall Out Boy {{continued}} its pattern of musical experimentation that {{began on the}} band's previous album, Infinity on High. Singer/guitarist Patrick Stump was once again the primary composer, and attempted to create compositions that echoed the themes discussed in Wentz's lyrics. As the lyrical content shifted in new directions from the group's previous works, the musical style employed by the other band members evolved as well. On this topic, Trohman commented [...] "It's not like we said, 'We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the envelope,' It's not that at all. We just wanted to try cooler things. The album still sounds like Fall Out Boy. It has big choruses. But you can't {{do the same thing}} every record." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Travolta's earlier statements, {{plans for}} a sequel never came to fruition. According to James Robert Parish's Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, the {{disastrous}} performance of Battlefield Earth {{and the collapse of}} Franchise Pictures made it very unlikely that a live-action sequel will be made. In a 2001 interview, Travolta stated that a sequel was not planned: [...] "Ultimately the movie did $100million when you count box office, DVD sales, video, and pay per view… But I don't know what kind of number it would have to do to justify filming {{the second part of the}} book. And I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> any buttons in the press and stir anybody up about it now." [...] Author Services announced in 2001 that Pine Com International, a Tokyo-based animation studio, would produce 13one-hour animated television segments based on the book and rendered in a manga style. The plans appear to have fallen through, and according to Parish, [...] "little has been heard of the series since." ...|$|E

In May 2014, she posted three photos on her Instagram account, which revealed she was working the producer. She called him [...] "a slave driver" [...] in the studio. Diplo commented that he met Madonna because of her kids and then she invited him to a party, and they ended up writing seven songs together.

Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E

Work on the games at [...] "crunch time" [...] involved 80-hour weeks and stretches without sleep maxing out at 72 hours. Staten worked alongside three other staff writers at Bungie, each with their own separate role: Frank O'Connor developed Halo 3s combat dialogue, Rob McLees focused on Halo canon and working with licensing partners, Luke Smith interacted with the fans online, and Staten developed the cinematics and missions scripts. Staten {{said in an interview that}} he considered it challenging to write for the games, as [...] "first person shooters [...] all about writing 'between the bullets'"—relating plot information to the players in between action sequences. [...] "You need to be efficient and clever to give players the story—the context—they need. But you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> too hard or they'll reject it." [...] During his work on the games he read science fiction works by Iain Banks, Robert A. Heinlein, and Vernor Vinge.
