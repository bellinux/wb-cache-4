Finite element analyses were carried out to further study the influence of the variation of the main weld parameters such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius and <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> length on the stress concentration factors (SCF). Fatigue test results were presented by both a nominal stress based approach and a more refined structural stress based approach for the as-welded joints.

Three experiments are performed and it is examined that typical collapse modes develop in the section of tube and associated Von-Mises stresses (distortion energy) are compared with the analytical method and numerical simulations. The comparisons with the experimental results are satisfactory. The validated numerical model is used to study the Von-Mises stresses with variation in the leg lengths of weld (2 mm, 3 mm leg lengths). The strength of fillet welded connections is investigated for different leg lengths. The ultimate strength of weld metal is determined by considering the forces acting on the welds. The effect of different leg lengths on the strength of welds is investigated by numerical methods and compared with analytical calculations which show that they are in agreement.

Analytical results had demonstrated that the socket <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> size configuration can have an important effect on its high cycle fatigue resistance, with longer legs along the pipe side of the weld greatly increasing its predicted fatigue resistance. Other potentially important factors influencing fatigue life include residual stress, weld root and toe condition, pipe size, axial and radial gaps, and materials of construction. The second phase of the program tested 27 additional socket weld specimens of various designs by bolting them to a vibration shaker table and shaking them near their resonant frequencies to produce the desired stress amplitudes and cycles.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have focused {{their efforts on}} fatigue failures occurring on weld toes. In recent years, more and more fatigue failures occur on weld roots. Therefore, {{it is important to}} explore the behaviour of weld root fatigues. This paper investigates numerically the Magnification factors (Mk) for types of semi-elliptical cracks on the weld root of a T-butt joint. The geometry of the joint is determined by four important parameters: crack depth ratio, crack shape ratio, <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> ratio and weld angle. A singular element approach is used to generate the corresponding finite element meshes. For each set of given four parameters of the semi-elliptical root crack, the corresponding T-butt joint is numerically simulated and its Mk at the deepest point of the weld root crack is obtained for the respective tension and shear loads. The variation range of the four parameters covers 750 cases for each load, totaling 1500 simulations are completed. The numerical results obtained are then represented by the curve to explore the effects of four parameters on the Mk. To obtain an approximate equation representing Mk {{as a function of the}} four parameters for each load, a multiple regression method is adopted and the related regression analysis is performed. The error distributions of the two approximate equations are compared with the finite element data. It is confirmed that the obtained approximate functions fit very well to the database from which they are derived. Therefore, these two equations present a valuable reference for engineering applications in T-butt joint designs...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the trends}} in ship {{building}} is {{the building of}} larger and faster ships. However, increasing demand for speed has forced the ship designers to search for alternative materials to reduce {{the weight of the}} ship without compromising strength. Aluminium alloys, once properly designed, can achieve this goal by reducing the weight of structural components by over 50 % compared to those made of normal carbon steel. Another advantage of aluminium alloys is that its corrosion resistance. In a sea environment, steel has been found to corrode about 100 times faster than aluminium alloys under the same corrosive environment. As the size of aluminium ship increases, fatigue {{has become one of the}} main design criteria. In order to effectively make use of the high strength/weight ratio of aluminium alloys, the cross section of the structural components as well as the joint design should be optimized to provide sufficient fatigue strength while still maintain acceptable fabrication cost. Extruded hollow stiffeners have been proven to be able to provide excellent light and stiff panels for aluminium ships. Box stiffener is such a cross section profile investigated in the present study. The box stiffener is usually oriented longitudinally by interacting with a large number of web frames by fillet welds. These welded joints may be exposed to larger fatigue damage due to its significant stress variations experienced during the service of the ships. In addition, welding of these joints is quite costly since there are a lage amount of them and it is difficult to apply automatic welding due to complex profile. Any simplification in the welding procedure would cause a significant benefit to the ship builders. Three similar web frame/box stiffener connections are considered in these studies, by varying the opening shape on the web fame and accordingly the welding procedure. The objective is to achieve sufficient fatigue strength while still maintaining an economically efficient joint. The first connection (denoted as Alt- 1) tries to make a relatively larger opening on the web frame for easy assembling and more space for welding. The second and third alternatives (denoted as Alt- 2 and Alt- 3) are identical in the opening on the web frame while differs on welding procedure only. Interrupted welding is performed for Alt- 2 to save both the human resource and weld material while continuous welding is required for Alt- 3 for a simple welding procedure. Alt- 3 also provides a water tight solution due to the continuous welding. It is found that the change of cutting shapes on the web frame as well as the corresponding weld procedure has great impact on both the static and fatigue properties of the joints. Extra welding around the web frame may cause a high stress concentration at the weld toe and therefore imply an unacceptable fatigue damage. However, a simple weld can be a good candidate to achieve sufficient fatigue strength. Butt weld is usually used to join two pre-fabricated units to obtain sufficient overall strength of the joined single piece structure. However, difficulty may arise for such units when the box stiffeners are presented as the longitudinal stiffeners due to relatively large shrinkage and distortion introduced in the fabrication process including welding in the adjacent area. A special type of lap joint, denoted as box stiffener lap joint is designed to provide a joining solution for the box stiffeners. By enabling the inside profile of the lapping plate to be identical to the outside profile of the box stiffener, the joining of two box stiffeners is just to weld the intersection lines between the lapping plate and box stiffener. Only the wide flanges of the box stiffener require a conventional weld. Cracking from the weld root should be avoided to ensure sufficient fatigue strength. Good fatigue performance is observed for the box stiffener lap joint. The <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> length is found to be a determining factor that affects both the fatigue strength and fatigue crack initiation site. <b>Weld</b> <b>leg</b> length between 6. 0 and 7. 5 mm is suggested to avoid high stress concentration at the weld toe. Moreover, this design reduces the likelihood of fatigue cracks to initiate from the most complex manual welding area. Information about fatigue analysis of welded aluminium structures is quite limited in the open literature. This thesis deals with fatigue assessment methods of welded aluminium plate structures based on both numerical analysis and experimental tests. Various stress based fatigue assessment methods such as the nominal, structural and notch stress approaches have been applied to the investigated joints. The nominal stress range approach can not provide a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength of novel welded joints because the local geometrical details including structural geometry and weld geometry are implicitly embedded in the nominal design SN curves. Laboratory tests would hence be needed to establish nominal stress approaches. More refined local approaches including the structural stress range approach and the notch stress range approach have been developed for a more accurate assessment of the fatigue strength. The main challenge for these local approaches is to find suitable stress calculation methods in the vicinity of the weld and thereby the uncertainties that determine the fatigue strength of the joint can be quantitatively reflected in a local stress concentration factor. Several of these methods are applied in the study of novel types of welded aluminium joints in this thesis. The choice of design SN curves must be consistent with the way by which the design stress range is calculated. Fatigue test data support the use of a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 40 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium fillet welded in-plane bracket connections when the structural stress has been derived from the extrapolation methods. It has been shown that a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 44 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium lap joints can be used. Another important issue is to investigate the effect of the local weld geometry such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius, and <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> length on the value of the structural/notch stress and accordingly on fatigue behaviour. The weld parameters of the joints have been measured in the laboratory and the statistical measured values are used in the numerical finite element models (FEM). Improving fatigue strength of critical joints is found to be necessary late in the design process or during the service time of a structure to extend the whole service life of the structure. The effect of weld toe grinding on the stress concentration at the weld toe is studied by finite element analysis (FEA). Fatigue tests show that the fatigue life in terms of number of cycles to failure is nearly doubled by simply grinding the weld toe of the joint. However, the standard deviations are not so much affected as the fatigue strength. The effect of weld parameters such as the grinding depth has been found to play a decisive role in fatigue life improvement. </p...|$|E
30|$|A {{large number}} of studies on the stress {{intensity}} factor of welded joints have been done by scholars using numerical methods [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Al-Mukhtar et al. [7] evaluated the stress intensity factor of load-carrying cruciform welded joints using 2 D finite element method, considering the effects of weld size and plate thickness ratio. The {{results show that the}} weld size has a major effect on the stress intensity factor, while the plate thickness ratio {{has nothing to do with}} the stress intensity factor. The comparisons between FE solutions and analytical solutions show a good agreement. Chung et al. [8] analyzed the effects of lack-of-penetration crack size, <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> size, and main plate thickness on mixed-mode stress intensity factors of load-carrying fillet welded cruciform joints using the finite element method and the least-squares method, and the general formulae of modes I and II stress intensity factors obtained from numerical results were verified by experimental results. Pasca et al. [9] determined the 3 D stress intensity factors along the crack growth path of quarter-elliptical corner cracks for T joint using FRANC 3 D in tension and bending loadings; crack growth paths were obtained from Paris’ law based on the maximum tensile stress criterion. Pang et al. [10] studied the 3 D stress intensity factor and weld toe magnification factor of a semielliptical weld toe crack for T-butt joint using the three-dimensional extended finite element method. They investigated the modeling of fatigue crack growth of weld toe semielliptical surface cracks for initial surface cracks with crack depth to plate thickness ratio (a/T) of 0.01 and three different crack aspect ratios (a/c) of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0. The above studies did not consider the effect of corrosion damages on the stress intensity factor. Ghidini et al. [11] simulated corrosion-damaged areas of the specimen surface using a single semielliptical surface crack and a single through edge crack. Cerit [12] modeled the corrosion pit as a semielliptical notch based on the finite element analyses. Generally, corrosion pits can be modeled as cracks or notches in numerical simulation. In all the aforementioned research, however, the effects of corrosion and complex stress fields on the stress intensity factor were studied separately. To date, the stress intensity factor of welded steel joints has never been studied with the simultaneous presence of prior corrosion and complex stress fields.|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} high {{technology}} welded constructions will be characterised by higher strength materials and improved weld quality {{with respect to}} fatigue resistance. The expected implementation of high quality high strength steel welds will require that more attention {{be given to the}} issues of crack initiation and mechanical mismatching. Experiments and finite element analyses were performed within the framework of continuum damage mechanics to investigate the effect of mismatching of welded joints on void nucleation and coalescence during monotonic loading. It was found that the damage of undermatched joints mainly occurred in the sandwich layer and the damageresistance of the joints decreases with the decrease of the sandwich layer width. The damage of over-matched joints mainly occurred in the base metal adjacent to the sandwich layer and the damage resistance of the joints increases with thedecrease of the sandwich layer width. The mechanisms of the initiation of the micro voids/cracks were found to be cracking of the inclusions or the embrittled second phase, and the debonding of the inclusions from the matrix. Experimental fatigue crack growth rate testing showed that the fatigue life of under-matched central crack panel specimens is longer than that of over-matched and even-matched specimens. Further investigation by the elastic-plastic finite element analysis indicated that fatigue crack closure, which originated from the inhomogeneousyielding adjacent to the crack tip, {{played an important role in}} the fatigue crack propagation. The applicability of the J integral concept to the mismatched specimens with crack extension under cyclic loading was assessed. The concept of fatigue class used by the International Institute of Welding was introduced in the parametric numerical analysis of several welded joints. The effect of weld geometry and load condition on fatigue strength of ferrite-pearlite steel joints was systematically evaluated based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. Joint types included lap joints, angle joints and butt joints. Various combinations of the tensile and bending loads were considered during the evaluation with the emphasis focused on the existence of both root and toe cracks. For a lap joint with asmall lack-of-penetration, a reasonably large <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> and smaller flank angle were recommended for engineering practice in order to achieve higher fatigue strength. It was found that the fatigue strength of the angle joint depended strongly on the location and orientation of the preexisting crack-like welding defects, even if the joint was welded with full penetration. It is commonly believed that the double sided butt welds can have significantly higher fatigue strength than that of a single sided welds, but fatigue crack initiation and propagation can originate from the weld root if the welding procedure results in a partial penetration. It is clearly shown that the fatigue strength of the butt joint could be improved remarkably by ensuring full penetration. Nevertheless, increasing the fatigue strength of a butt joint by increasing the size of the weld is an uneconomical alternative...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in Canada to balance fillet welds on angle members about the projection of the centroidal axis on the <b>welded</b> <b>leg.</b> In some instances, however, due to certain design restrictions, {{there is no room}} to place a balanced weld and the designer is forced to use an unbalanced weld. The Canadian Standards Association, as well as the American Specification and the British Standard, has approved this type of unbalanced connections. This approval was based on research carried out on tension members by Gibson and Wake in 1942. As a result of this research it has been assumed that the same conclusion applies to compression members. In order {{to determine the effects of}} the weld patterns on the behaviour of angle compression members, a series of ultimate compression tests and finite element analysis were performed. The experimental procedure consisted of applying a compressive load on two 50. 8 x 50. 8 x 6. 35 mm (i. e. 2 x 2 x 1 / 4 in.) angle members connected at the ends to HSS 2 ̆ 7 s with balanced and unbalanced weld patterns. Two different column heights were used which resulted in slenderness ratios that fall in the 2 ̆ 2 slender 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 intermediate 2 ̆ 2 range. The load was applied gradually until failure occurred in the specimen. The effect of unbalanced welds seems to be beneficial for slender angles but has a detrimental effect on the load carrying capacity of intermediate range angles. As the weld pattern changes from balanced to an unbalanced weld, the flexibility of the angle increases. The experimental failure loads are compared with the results from a finite element model. The welded angles were also designed as beam-columns according to CAN/CSA S 16. 1 -M 89 and the results were compared with the experimental failure loads. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|For {{the fatigue}} {{assessment}} of welded structures, several design methods are {{described by the}} design codes of IIW, Eurocode 3 and DNV. The relation between the stress range and cycles to failures were derived from experiments: the SN curves. With the increased accessibility of finite element software to engineers, a more flexible approach emerged: the so-called hot spot stress method. Particularly suitable for welded structures, it assesses {{the influence of the}} geometric discontinuity on the stress distribution. A stress extrapolation procedure is required to overcome the high stresses computed by FEA at the notch. Normal stresses at the surface, perpendicular to the weld, are to be used. For curved welds and surfaces, e. g. in case of tubular joints, these stresses are complex to determine from FEA output. A method that automates the hot spot stress calculation as a post processor to FEA output would facilitate the process. Such an automated subroutine would further enable a study on the finite element modelling aspects, including the use of shell and solid elements and the inclusion of the weld profile, in relation to conducted fatigue experiments. This report describes the development of a subroutine as post-processor for FEA output to calculate the hot spot stresses. Read out points for stress extrapolation are located independently of the finite element mesh. In addition, for each weld node the local coordinate system is to be determined and subsequently the corresponding stress transformation is to be performed. Equivalent stresses at the read out points are determined by means of interpolation from a triangle-shaped plane formed by three element nodes. Cut-out specimens of an orthotropic bridge deck were tested against fatigue and strain gauges were used to measure the strains. This report shows that FEA stresses corresponded well with the measurements. Inclusion of the weld profile is important; ignoring the weld underestimates the stress levels by 10 %. Use of shell elements resulted in 4 % lower nominal stresses than solid elements, however in the weld region only the solid element model accurately reproduced the stress distribution. An alternative method for the fatigue classification described in EC 3 is proposed, which represents better the observed stress levels for the crack initiation point at the weld root. Finally, this report considers stress concentration factors of tubular joints as recommended by CIDECT design guide. The FEA results are compared to the SCFs from parametric formulae. Good correspondence was found between the FEA and CIDECT results. A validation analysis of the boundary and loading conditions was performed, from comparing the joint model with the entire truss structure for shell elements. A correction function is derived to cover the small observed differences. Additionally, strain gauge measurements from experiments on large scale tubular joints in a marine environment are compared to the FEA results. Good correspondence was found between the measured and numerically computed strains. For solid element models, the <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> size is found to be important for the hot spot stresses; each millimetre shift of the weld toe affected the stress levels by 3 %.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, an {{investigation}} of the fatigue life benefits emerging from fillet weld geometries optimization has been carried out. At first, an introduction to ageing mechanisms, corrosion and especially fatigue, acting on operating marine structures has been made. Residual stresses at weld toes, stress modes, and types, geometrical factors (weld angle, toe radius, leg length), welding techniques selected, post-welding treatment and plate‟s material are some of the principal factors affecting the fatigue life of a fillet weld joint. Especially, the accuracy of various approaches in fatigue life estimation of specific geometries under pre-set types and levels of stress is studied. It is evident so far that even the notch stress concept is the most accurate method based on S-N curves, the Fracture Mechanics approach can offer more accurate solutions of a crack development through the material. Towards this, a literature review on crack evolution aspects in welded and non-welded plates under bending and tension was performed; substantial parameters were determined and finally implemented in the LEFM model which was used for the simulation purposes of Chapter 6. As far as the crack aspect ratio evolution is concerned, an extensive reference is available in literature since many researchers have investigated its contribution to the determination of geometrical paths, commonly known as “Preferred Propagation Paths”. Their significance is related with our ability to determine accurate SIF solutions leading to precise fatigue life estimations. A typical fillet weld joint 2 -D model has been developed in CAE Abaqus software and a Finite Element Analysis of subject T-profile has been carried out. Through this analysis, the fillet weld angle, the <b>weld</b> <b>leg</b> length, the weld toe curvature radio ρ and the carrying load plate thickness are examined for their impacts on the maximum surface stress. Finally, a number of stress mitigating measures are proposed and their effects are analyzed. Undoubtedly, the notch stress concept today is gradually gaining more and more acceptance among other fatigue analysis practices, hence the need for an estimation of the actual surface stresses along fillet weld toes, has become imperative. Towards this, different 2 -D geometries are tested against stress concentration factors developed at weld toes, which are calculated on the basis of maximum in-plane principal stresses over nominal stresses in mode I pure bending and pure tension respectively. Moreover, validation with corresponding results from literature is provided. Finally, three different concepts for reducing the maximum surface stresses are presented. The first one proposes grinding of the weld toe area and formulation of an artificial U-notch or a part- circular profile. The second one applies to non-penetrating welds and assumes the existence of a root gap of a specific geometry which is related to the fatigue life and stress concentration factor of the fillet weld joint. Last but not least, the relatively recent concept of the variable radius notch is discussed, even though it is applicable mostly to notched bodies, not weld joints. Afterwards, a Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics analysis of reference 2 D fillet weld model is demonstrated. A number of geometrical parameters considered at previous stage for their impact on surface Stress Concentration levels at the weld toe region, have been correlated to fatigue life benefits in terms of increased number of stress cycles till failure. An extensive analysis of 9 different T-butt weld joint geometries has been provided in order to investigate how positively a possible SCF reduction can affect the fatigue life of a weld joint. Essential geometric variations (weld angle, length, toe radius, root slot) were considered in the 2 D model. All calculated benefits both in pure bending and pure tension cases have been reported accordingly. Based on a linear interpolation of the points scatter (SCF, N-cycles) both in banding and tension, it was observed that a surface stress mitigation of 1 % could lead to 1, 33 up to 2, 5 % fatigue life benefit in the range of SCF= 2 – 2, 5. It is evident so far that the geometrical optimization of a weld joint in respect of notch stress mitigation can be a powerful tool both in shipbuilding and maintenance practice in the future. However, technically wise their application may incur high initial costs of improved tools of welding and post welding treatment and robots even though it would consist a cost effective solution in a medium/long term basis. Finally, the above process is followed by a reliability analysis of the most critical geometrical parameters affecting the fatigue life of a fillet weld joint. Reliability assessment results concerning medium, high and low cycle fatigue are provided and a comparative analysis of each factor‟s impact on fatigue life has been carried out...|$|E

Design for Repurposing, presents a new strategy for incorporating the concept of repurposing in product design, which aims to extend the longevity of products by intentionally designing features or details that facilitate repurposing. Repurposing is the transformation of products or their components to suit a second purpose after their first has expired. For example, an old truck’s wheel rim is transformed into a grill by <b>welding</b> iron <b>legs</b> onto it. I explored the concept of designing for repurposing by interviewing, photographing and observing how people in developing countries, such as Mexico, transform existing products into different objects for other uses. I translated these observations into a detailed artifact analysis with reflections on what makes certain objects attractive or suitable to those who repurpose them. Design for repurposing converts consumers into engaged users who invest time to transform and customize products, thus easing the amount of waste in landfills and saving energy, money and the environment. The new purposes assigned to products can be classified into three categories: planned, coached and open-ended. These categories share a common goal: to extend the longevity of an object’s use. Repurposing also happens at different scales, such as batch production, and individual level (Do it Yourself: DIY).

It is found that the neural network model presented an excellent correlation to predict the <b>weld</b> quality; the <b>leg</b> size is enhanced with the increase of amperage and reduced with the increase of the travel speed and voltage. The relationship of all variables is explained. The neural model can be used to test initial welding conditions of voltage, amperage and travel speed. The model can predict quality characteristics without repeat the experimental measurements, so it can be used as an inverse model taking the desired conditions of the welds as inputs and give the voltage, amperage and travel speed as outputs...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{study of}} bearing {{capacity}} of samples of two series performed by semiautomatic welding in CO 2 on the axis, and by robotic welding machine in mixture (CO 2 + Ar), is presented. Welds of constant cross section, <b>welds</b> with extended <b>leg</b> on end sections, and welds {{in the form}} of two dowels on end sections were performed. Efficiency of pilot samples of the first series (with extended leg on end sections by way of a smooth transition) defined by the ratio of weld metal volume to a crushing load reaches 28 % relative to samples with a leg constant as per length. Samples of the first series with an extended leg on end sections also showed efficiency increased to 17 %. According to the second series samples test results, the exceeding of bearing capacity of the samples performed with an extended leg on end sections by 24 % in comparison with the samples with a leg of constant cross section was determined. Samples of the second series performed {{in the form of}} two dowels on end sections demonstrated the exceeding of the relative bearing capacity by 42 % in comparison with the samples with a continuous leg of constant cross-section...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn an {{accident}} in southwest Iowa, USA in 2012, an anhydrous ammonia nurse tank vented its entire cargo of 5500 L (1500 gallons) of liquid ammonia to the atmosphere. Follow-up {{study of the}} failed tank revealed a through-crack along a weld used to connect the tank to its running gear. Side-angle ultrasound examinations were performed on 532 used anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks to measure the locations, sizes, and orientations of flaw indications. The tanks examined had manufacture dates ranging from 1952 to 2011. A total of 83 indications were found {{in or near the}} <b>leg</b> <b>welds</b> of 50 of these 532 tanks. Several factors suggest that these indications are fatigue cracks, not the stress corrosion cracks more commonly detected in nurse tanks. These findings suggest that roughly 9 % of the 200, 000 nurse tanks in the U. S. nurse tank fleet may contain leg-weld fatigue cracks. Nurse tanks are the only large, pressurized packages for hazardous cargo that do not contain manways; thus, their interior walls cannot be inspected for flaws with magnetic particle or fluorescent dye penetrant methods. Since the tank interior is inaccessible, side-angle ultrasound is the only detection method capable of detecting cracks in nurse tanks initiating at both interior and exterior tank surfaces. For this reason, the authors recommend that side-angle ultrasound be considered for use in periodic nurse tank inspections...|$|R
40|$|An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{model has}} been applied to the {{prediction}} of key weld geometries produced using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) with alternating shielding gases. This is a recently developed method of supplying shielding gases to the weld area in which the gases are discretely supplied at a given frequency. The model can be used to predict the penetration, leg length and effective throat thickness for a given set of weld parameters and alternating shielding gas frequency. A comparison between the experimental and predicted geometries matched closely and demonstrates the effectiveness of this software approach in predicting weld outputs. The model has shown that the application of alternating shielding gases increases the penetration and effective throat thickness of a fillet <b>weld</b> whilst the <b>leg</b> length is reduced. A sensitivity analysis was performed which showed that the travel speed is the most influential input parameter when predicting weld geometries, this is to be expected for any given welding set-up due to the influence of the travel speed on the heat input. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the shielding gas configuration had the lowest influence on the output of the model. The output from the model has demonstrated that the use of alternating shielding gases during GMAW results in a step change in the weld metal geometry. This suggests that, in the case of alternating shielding gases, an increased travel speed is required to produce a similar weld geometry to that of the conventional Ar/ 20 %CO 2 technique...|$|R
40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, the Purple team {{developed}} a walker which allows users to rise from a seated position by folding down to provide a set of handles which the user can push off of {{to aid in the}} standing process. The walker relies on a unique geometry and a joint that allows the walker to transition between the standing and kneeling positions. Several members of the team decided to continue the project in attempts to create a beta prototype that improved upon the flaws of the old design in attempts to create a patentable product. My area of focus in the redesign was creating the exterior of the joint including the locking pin interface, the alignment of the legs in relation to the joint, and the integration of the joint into the frame. After deliberating {{the costs and benefits of}} each feature, it was decided that the joint would have and axial pin, inline legs, and would be <b>welded</b> to the <b>legs</b> of the walker. These features were then used to create a new joint design. The design process was completed by analyzing the new joint for deflection, optimizing it for weight limitations and material costs, and looking at for design for manufacturing and assembly considerations. Overall, the goal of creating a new joint that could be implemented into a future iteration of the walker was achieved. by Garth S. Grove. Thesis (S. B.)
