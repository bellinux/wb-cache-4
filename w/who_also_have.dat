5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit in Prime, in which the latter was previously unlocked by connecting the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, <b>who</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a copy of Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number {{as opposed to a}} separate Friend Code. Save files from the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made to the source code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but is limited to a local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the difficulty of the encounters was lowered.|$|E

In 2008, the Swiss Hornet component reached the 50,000 flight hour milestone.

The two pairs of slabs that form the north part of the frieze share the same general figural pattern. A male and female pair, divine or mortal, dominate the left slab. On the right slab, a female and centaur are placed at left and a centaur and hoplite at right. This repetition highlights the contrasting movements in each pair away from the central axis.|$|E
