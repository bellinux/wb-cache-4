5|$|Nolan {{was born}} on 4 January 1818 to Babington and Elizabeth Nolan, in York County, Upper Canada. Following his father's {{dismissal}} from his minor diplomatic post at the British consulate in Milan, Nolan was accepted into the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where {{he was known as}} Ludwig by his fellow cadets. His father's desire to see him given a chance to enter a prestigious branch of the armed forces meant that Nolan was regularly transferred to other cadet schools {{to learn more about the}} military. Enthusiastic about the cavalry, he was noted as an excellent horseman and student of military theory, as well as history. With the multi-lingual nature of Austro-Hungary, he also studied languages, including Hungarian. Other subjects studied there included fortification, <b>water</b> <b>engineering,</b> mathematics, fencing, swimming and bridge-building. Nolan graduated from the Pioneer School a year early in May 1835, probably following a recommendation from Prince Liechtenstein, and was made a subaltern in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment.|$|E
25|$|The 20th Century {{began with}} an {{important}} institutional development in Peru's irrigation sector {{with the creation of}} the Mining and <b>Water</b> <b>Engineering</b> Body (1904) and the Hydrological Service (1911). However, {{it was not until the}} 1920s that the first large-scale State irrigation projects were launched. Public investment in irrigation in 1905 accounted for 8.7% of the total, reaching 18.62% in 1912, a trend that continued in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Walter Lewthwaite {{was one of}} the {{original}} Christchurch City Council employees supporting the joint Steering Committee. Lewthwaite had 30 years experience in <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> and 14 years experience in managing irrigation projects. In November 2005, Lewthwaite was a Senior Environmental Engineer employed by URS New Zealand Limited, and the project manager and co-author of the application for resource consents lodged with Canterbury Regional Council. By June 2006, Lewthwaite was an Associate of URS New Zealand Limited. In September 2006, Lewthwaite also prepared information to support the applications to Selwyn District Council.|$|E

25|$|Since rain falls {{only in the}} winter, {{and largely}} in the {{northern}} part of the country, irrigation and <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> is vital to the country's economic survival and growth. Large-scale projects to direct water from rivers and reservoirs in the north, to make optimal use of groundwater, and to reclaim flood overflow and sewage have been undertaken. The largest such project was a national water distribution system called the National Carrier, completed in 1964, flowing from the country's biggest freshwater lake, the Sea of Galilee, to the northern Negev desert, through huge channels, pipes and tunnels. The Ashkelon seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant was the largest in the world at the time it was built. The project was developed as a BOT (build-operate-transfer) by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies and Elran.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Israel are intricately {{linked to the}} historical development of Israel. Because rain falls only in the winter, and largely {{in the northern part of}} the country, irrigation and <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> are considered vital to the country's economic survival and growth. Large scale projects to desalinate seawater, direct water from rivers and reservoirs in the north, make optimal use of groundwater, and reclaim flood overflow and sewage have been undertaken. Among them is the National Water Carrier, carrying water from the country's biggest freshwater lake, the Sea of Galilee, to the northern Negev desert through channels, pipes and tunnels. Israel's water demand today outstrips available conventional water resources. Thus, in an average year, Israel relies for about half of its water supply on unconventional water resources, including reclaimed water and desalination. A particularly long drought in 1998–2002 had prompted the government to promote large-scale seawater desalination.|$|E
2500|$|The Central Plains Water {{enhancement}} scheme {{has had a}} {{small but}} influential group of supporters, {{some of whom have}} been involved as steering committee members, trustees and company directors. The supporters have included development-minded council politicians, council staff with <b>water</b> <b>engineering</b> backgrounds, [...] directors of council-owned companies, farmer representatives and consultants. The advancement of the scheme appears to have coincided with career moves and business interests of some of these supporters.|$|E
