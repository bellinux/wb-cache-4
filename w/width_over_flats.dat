40|$|In this contribution, Cramer-Rao {{lower bound}} (CRLB) for {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) estimation from linear modulation signals <b>over</b> <b>flat</b> Rayleigh fading channel is addressed. Therefore, we derive the analytical expressions of Fisher information matrix entries that assess the optimal variance of any unbiased SNR estimator. Based on statistical Monte Carlo computing method, simulation results {{are drawn from}} several constellation densities and observation window sizes. For the linear modulation schemes used here, it is shown that the lower bound is as higher as the modulation order increases. The derived bound provides an efficient standard for evaluating the performance of any unbiased non-data aided (NDA) SNR estimator from linear modulation signals <b>over</b> <b>flat</b> Rayleigh fading channel (FRFC) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of turbulence closure models for large-eddy simulation (LES) has primarily been per-formed <b>over</b> <b>flat</b> terrain, where comparisons with theory and observations are simplified. The authors have previously developed improved closure models using explicit filtering and reconstruction, {{together with a}} dynamic eddy-viscosity model and a near-wall stress term. This dynamic reconstruction model (DRM) is a mixed model, combining scale-similarity and eddy-viscosity components. The DRM gave improved results over standard eddy-viscosity models for neutral boundary layer flow <b>over</b> <b>flat</b> but rough terrain, yielding the expected logarithmic velocity profiles near the wall. The results from the studies <b>over</b> <b>flat</b> terrain are now extended to flow over full-scale topography. The test case is flow over Askervein Hill, an isolated hill in western Scotland, where a field campaign was conducted in 1983 {{with the purpose of}} capturing wind data representing atmospheric episodes under near-neutral stratification and steady wind conditions. This widely studied flow provides a more challenging test case for the new turbulence models because of the sloping terrain and separation in the lee of the hill. Since an LES formulation is used, a number of simulation features are different than those typically used in the Askervein literature. The simulations are inherently unsteady, the inflow conditions are provided by a separate turbulent flow database, and (uniquely herein) ensembl...|$|R
