40|$|Progress is {{reported}} on the mission support plan and those support activities envisioned to be applicable and necessary during premission and postmission phases of the Spacelab program. The purpose, role, and requirements of the contamination control operations {{for the first two}} missions of the Spacelab equipped Space Transportation System are discussed. The organization of the contamination control operation and its relationship to and interfaces with other mission support functions is also discussed. Some specific areas of contamination to be investigated are treated. They are: (1) <b>windows</b> and <b>viewports,</b> (2) experiment equipment, (3) thermal control surfaces, (4) the contaminant induced atmosphere (as differentiated from the normal ambient atmosphere at the orbit altitude), and (5) optical navigation instruments...|$|R
50|$|CAVELib is the {{original}} application programmer's interface (API) developed for the CAVE(TM) system created at the Electronic Visualization Lab at University of Illinois Chicago. The software was commercialized in 1996 and further enhanced by Mechdyne Corporation. The CAVELib is a low level VR software package in that it abstracts for a developer <b>window</b> and <b>viewport</b> creation, viewer-centered perspective calculations, displaying to multiple graphics channels, multi-processing and multi-threading, cluster synchronization and data sharing, and stereoscopic viewing. Developers create all of the graphics for their environment and the CAVELib makes it display properly. The CAVELib API is platform-independent, enabling developers to create high-end virtual reality applications on Windows and Linux operating systems (IRIX, Solaris, and HP-UX are no longer supported). CAVELib-based applications are externally configurable at run-time, making an application executable independent of the display system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel sensor is {{described}} {{for the detection}} of the lightning current through the fuselage of an aircraft. The sensor relies on the penetration of the magnetic field through fuselage openings and can be embedded in a window inside the aircraft. The sensor combines good sensitivity with sufficient bandwidth to record the lightning transient current. Guidelines for the position are derived from a mathematical analysis for a circular window. Index Terms—Aircraft, inductive sensor, lightning, <b>viewport,</b> <b>window.</b> I...|$|R
50|$|In 3D {{computer}} graphics, {{the image}} plane is that {{plane in the}} world which is identified with {{the plane of the}} monitor. It is also referred to as screen space. If one makes the analogy of taking a photograph to rendering a 3D image, the surface of the film is the image plane. In this case, the viewing transformation is a projection that maps the world onto the image plane. A rectangular region of this plane, called the viewing <b>window</b> or <b>viewport,</b> maps to the monitor. This establishes the mapping between pixels on the monitor and points (or rather, rays) in the 3D world. The plane is not usually an actual geometric object in a 3D scene, but instead is usually a collection of target coordinates or dimensions that are used during the rasterization process so the final output can be displayed as intended on the physical screen.|$|R
50|$|A scrollbar is an {{interaction}} technique or widget in which continuous text, pictures, {{or any other}} content can be scrolled in a predetermined direction (up, down, left, or right) on a computer display, <b>window,</b> or <b>viewport</b> so {{that all of the}} content can be viewed, even if {{only a fraction of the}} content can be seen on a device's screen at one time. It offers a solution to the problem of navigation to a known or unknown location within a two-dimensional information space. It was also known as a handle in the very first GUIs. They are present in a wide range of electronic devices including computers, graphing calculators, mobile phones, and portable media players. The user interacts with the scrollbar elements using some method of direct action, the scrollbar translates that action into scrolling commands, and the user receives feedback through a visual updating of both the scrollbar elements and the scrolled content.|$|R
2500|$|The bonnet {{is usually}} a copper shell with {{soldered}} brass fittings. It covers the diver's head and provides sufficient space to turn the head to look out of the glazed faceplate and other <b>viewports</b> (<b>windows).</b> The front port can usually be opened for ventilation and communication when the diver is on deck, by being screwed out or swung to the side on a hinge. The other lights (another name for the viewports) are generally fixed. Viewports were glass on the early helmets, {{with some of the}} later helmets using acrylic, and are usually protected by brass or bronze grilles. [...] The helmet has fittings to connect the air line and the diver's telephone.|$|R
40|$|Content on {{computer}} screens is often inaccessible to users be-cause it is hidden, e. g., occluded by other <b>windows,</b> outside the <b>viewport,</b> or overlooked. In search tasks, the efficient retrieval of sought content is important. Current software, however, only provides limited support to visualize hidden occurrences and rarely supports search synchronization crossing applica-tion boundaries. To remedy this situation, we introduce two novel visualization methods to guide users to hidden content. Our first method generates awareness for occluded or out-of-viewport content using see-through visualization. For content that is either outside the screen’s viewport or for data sources not opened at all, our second method shows off-screen indica-tors and an on-demand smart preview. To reduce {{the chances of}} overlooking content, we use visual links, i. e., visible edges, to connect the visible content or the visible representations of the hidden content. We show the validity of our methods in a user study, which demonstrates that our technique enables a faster localization of hidden content compared to traditional search functionality and thereby assists users in information retrieval tasks...|$|R
50|$|The Glovebox {{facility}} perhaps {{proved to}} be the most versatile new space laboratory equipment introduced in the last few years. The Glovebox offers crew members the opportunity to manipulate many different kinds of test activities and demonstrations and materials (even toxic, irritating, or potentially infectious ones) without making direct contact with them. The Glovebox has a <b>viewport</b> (<b>window)</b> into a clean workspace, built-in gloves for manipulation of samples and equipment, a negative air pressure system, a filter system, and an entry door for passing materials and experiments {{into and out of the}} work area. The primary use of the Glovebox was to selectively mix protein crystals and monitor their growth. The Glovebox allowed crew members to periodically change compositions to optimize the growth, a first for space. Other tests conducted inside the Glovebox included studies on candle flames, fiber pulling, particle dispersion, surface convection in liquids, and liquid/container interfaces. Sixteen tests and demonstrations in all were conducted inside the Glovebox. The Glovebox also provided crew members the opportunity to perform backup operations on the Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus which were not planned.|$|R

Later helmets include a non-return valve where the airline is connected, which prevents potentially fatal helmet squeeze if the pressure in the hose is lost.The difference in pressure between the surface and the diver can be so great that if the air line is cut at the surface and there is no non-return valve, the diver would be partly squeezed into the helmet by the external pressure, and injured or possibly killed.|$|R
40|$|Strokes on the cat’s tail, for example, do {{not conform}} to any precise 3 D surface, but are painted in space to give the tail its rough, stylized look. We present a {{technique}} to generalize the 2 D painting metaphor to 3 D that allows the artist to treat the full 3 D space as a canvas. Strokes painted in the 2 D <b>viewport</b> <b>window</b> must be embedded in 3 D space in a way that gives creative freedom to the artist while maintaining an acceptable level of controllability. We address this challenge by proposing a canvas concept defined implicitly by a 3 D scalar field. The artist shapes the implicit canvas by creating ap-proximate 3 D proxy geometry. An optimization procedure is then used to embed painted strokes in space by satisfying different ob-jective criteria defined on the scalar field. This functionality allows us to implement tools for painting along level set surfaces or across different level sets. Our method gives the power of fine-tuning the implicit canvas to the artist using a unified painting/sculpting metaphor. A sculpting tool can be used to paint into the implicit canvas. Rather than adding color, this tool creates a local change in the scalar field that results in outward or inward protrusions along the field’s gradient direction. We address a visibility ambiguity in-herent in 3 D stroke rendering with a depth offsetting method that is well suited for hardware acceleration. We demonstrate results with a number of 3 D paintings that exhibit effects difficult to realize with existing systems...|$|R
5000|$|The Bridge. The Bridge of Galactica {{is located}} {{near the front of}} the ship, in a {{projection}} above the hull. The Bridge is the location from which the ship is directed. It houses Core Command, which coordinates Viper operations and resource allocation for the Fleet; sensor, weapons and communications controls; and the ship's helm. [...] The Commander and his executive officer occupy a rotating platform at the center-rear of the bridge, along with a Bridge Officer who controls the helm. The bridge's rear is dominated by a large star chart, featuring glowing schematic representations of celestial bodies and their orbits on a clear substrate. The chart has the ability to display a red dot highlighting any given point, which a briefing officer can move simply by pointing his finger. A battlestar's bridge is unlike those of other starships in science fiction in that it has no one [...] "command chair" [...] where its Commander would sit. The forward upper area of the bridge is dominated by a wide rectangular <b>viewport</b> <b>window</b> through which the ship's path can be observed. A heavy two-part (upper and lower halves) reinforced [...] "shield" [...] closes over this viewport to protect it during times of attack (seen in various episodes throughout the series including the first episode in which the Battlestar Atlantia either failed to deploy this shield, or it suffered catastrophic failure as the pressure in the ship is seen to rush out through the viewport seconds before Atlantia explodes). The shield normally serves well enough for Galactica, but it does have its weaknesses.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} hardware {{that can}} be used for the interior illumination of these large metallic chambers. There are several ways to light the interior of these larger hyperbaric chambers. The most obvious way is to use <b>viewport</b> <b>windows</b> to let in natural light or to arrange viewports so that artificial light can be shined through them. Since viewports are used extensively in hyperbaric chambers to provide the operators with a view of the occupants, it is often convenient to use them for interior illumination of the chamber. If the chamber is used outdoors, a sufficient number of viewports can be provided to give adequate illumination during the daylight hours by natural light. However, many chambers are not outside, nor are they used exclusively during the day. Therefore, provision must be made for obtaining artificial lighting through chamber viewports or by some other means. Two translucent materials are readily available for the manufacture of hyperbaric chamber windows. Glass was originally used, either tempered or laminated. The advantage of glass is that it is a familiar optical material with excellent light transmission properties. Numerous glass compositions such as borosilicate glass and soda lime glass exist and could be used to manufacture windows. In general, the greatest disadvantage of glass is, that because of its brittle nature, the structural behavior of glass can be unpredictable. For the safety of chamber occupants, it is absolutely critical that the integrity of the pressure boundary, including viewports, be maintained while the chamber is in service. For this reason, glass windows are not currently approved for man-rated hyperbaric chambers by recognized safety standards such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Safety Standard for P [...] ...|$|R
