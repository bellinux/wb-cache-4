2500|$|Senator Dorgan {{was one of}} {{only eight}} members of the Senate to vote against the repeal of key {{provisions}} of the Glass-Steagall Act (contained in the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) in 1999. During debate on that 1999 legislation, in a speech on the Senate floor, he said that, [...] "it will in my judgement raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts" [...] (cited in John Lanacaster, Whoops, London, 2010, p.161). On September 26, 2008, against a backdrop of growing economic turmoil caused by the Credit Crunch, David Leonhardt of The New York Times singled out a quotation made by Dorgan in 1999 during the US Senate's repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act. [...] "I think we will look back in 10 years’ time and say we should not have done this, but we did because <b>we</b> <b>forgot</b> the lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{best known}} and most {{successful}} {{production of the}} play in England was directed by Peter Brook for the RSC at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1955, starring Laurence Olivier as Titus, Maxine Audley as Tamora, Anthony Quayle as Aaron and Vivien Leigh as Lavinia. Brook had been offered the chance to direct Macbeth but had controversially turned it down, and instead decided to stage Titus. The media predicted that the production would be a massive failure, and possibly spell the end of Brook's career, but on the contrary, {{it was a huge}} commercial and critical success, with many of the reviews arguing that Brook's alterations improved Shakespeare's script (Marcus' lengthy speech upon discovering Lavinia was removed and some of the scenes in Act 4 were reorganised). Olivier in particular was singled out for his performance and for making Titus a truly sympathetic character. J.C. Trewin for example, wrote [...] "the actor had thought himself into the hell of Titus; <b>we</b> <b>forgot</b> the inadequacy of the words in the spell of the projection." [...] The production is also noted for muting the violence; Chiron and Demetrius were killed off stage; the heads of Quintus and Mutius were never seen; the nurse is strangled, not stabbed; Titus' hand was never seen; blood and wounds were symbolised by red ribbons. Edward Trostle Jones summed up the style of the production as employing [...] "stylised distancing effects." [...] The scene where Lavinia first appears after the rape was singled out by critics as being especially horrific, with her wounds portrayed by red streamers hanging from her wrists and mouth. Some reviewers however, found the production too beautified, making it unrealistic, with several commenting on the cleanness of Lavinia's face after her tongue has supposedly been cut out. After its hugely successful Royal Shakespeare Theatre run, the play went on tour around Europe. No video recordings of the production are known, although there are many photographs available.|$|E

60|$|Free {{speech is}} an idea which has at present all the unpopularity of a truism; so that <b>we</b> tend to <b>forget</b> {{that it was not}} so very long ago that it had the more {{practical}} unpopularity which attaches to a new truth. Ingratitude is surely the chief of the intellectual sins of man. He takes his political benefits for granted, just as he takes the skies and the seasons for granted. He considers the calm of a city street a thing as inevitable as the calm of a forest clearing, whereas it is only kept in peace by a sustained stretch and effort similar to that which keeps up a battle or a fencing match. Just as <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> where <b>we</b> stand in relation to natural phenomena, so <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> it in relation to social phenomena. <b>We</b> <b>forget</b> that the earth is a star, and <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> that free speech is a paradox.|$|R
