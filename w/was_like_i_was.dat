5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
25|$|I {{used to have}} {{to punch}} a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E

Like Scarface or {{any one of those}} films, you take the good out of it, and you can see it as an inspiring film." ...|$|E

I do {{want to know who}} he <b>is</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so glad it is not he that <b>was</b> hurt. Oh! <b>I</b> did so want to have brought him up to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Alick." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{favourite}} for the race, Bjorn Daehlie of Norway won {{the gold}} medal, but {{instead of going to}} the podium to collect it, he was informed that Boit was still racing – the only competitor left on the course, down in 92nd place. Daehlie waited for Boit to finish, welcoming him as he passed the finish line. Boit was amazed by the crowd's reaction as he arrived, [...] "They were shouting 'Kenya GO!, Philip GO!' It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> winning a medal even though I was last." [...] As he crossed the line some 20 minutes after Daehlie, the Norwegian hugged the Kenyan – while Boit later said that he immediately thanked Daehlie, the gold medallist insisted that Boit instead remarked that he would beat him at the next Olympics. The incident received worldwide attention.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} Stanley Kubrick's {{death and}} the Columbine High School massacre occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing A Clockwork Orange, Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, {{he realized he was}} headed down the same path as the shooters. [...] "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking in the mirror and I didn't want the same fate for myself," [...] Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 grade point average and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] by his peers. He studied film at Emerson College and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.|$|E

500|$|Oakley, Inc. {{provided}} the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized {{version of the}} company's own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection-moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, which looked remarkable, says Gordon Smith, {{but at the last}} minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added 6 hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. [...] There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, [...] "I had almost no contact {{with the rest of the}} cast; it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 26, 2005, mere {{days before}} his death from {{pancreatic}} cancer, Gray spoke about the Watergate scandal {{for the first time}} in 32 years. When asked about Mark Felt's claim to being Deep Throat, Gray told ABC's This Week that he was in [...] "total shock, total disbelief," [...] noting, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hit with a tremendous sledgehammer." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling {{him what to}} do". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for {{young men and women}} who want to strive for a [...] "new world order" [...] and this was a campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E

After the fight Khan said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> against two people, the referee and Lamont himself. I was the cleaner fighter; he was so wild. The referee wasn't giving me a chance. I heard the referee give me a warning , {{but there was nothing}} I could do. He kept coming in with his head. There hasn't been [...] boxing in D.C. for the last [...] years because this is what happens." [...] Khan earned a base purse of [...] $1.1 million, while Peterson earned a career-high $650,000 purse.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Canadian tech-metal band Out of Your Mouth {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Music" [...] as their debut single. Vocalist Jason Darr commented, [...] "I absolutely love her, I've bought her records {{and when she}} came out with that song it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hit over the head with it". In 2007, The Dynamics {{released a}}n eight-minute soul cover on their album Versions Excursions. French metal band Eths added a cover of the song as a bonus track on their third studio album III (2012). In addition, remixed eurodance cover versions of the song have appeared on the Dancemania series albums, including an uptempo cover remix by Nancy And The Boys on the 2001 album Dancemania Speed 6.|$|E
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E

After he suddenly died in 2008, Casey experienced a [...] "tsunami of grief" [...] that she says she couldn't escape from. She wondered if de Faria could help heal her grief. She met him twice and later stated, [...] "Three hours went by like 20 minutes, and it was blissful--it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> floating." [...] Casey claims she was able to speak with her dead father. [...] "It was very real," [...] she says. [...] "More of a vision than I had ever had before. ...

I am satisfied. Also to tell you, that you had best seek that home of yours, with all speed, and hide your head among those excellent people who are expecting you, and whom your money will console. When it's all gone, you can believe, and trust, and love again, you know! I thought you a broken toy that had lasted its time; a worthless spangle that was tarnished, and thrown away. But, finding you true gold, a very lady, and an ill-used innocent, with a fresh heart full of love and trustfulness--which you look like, and is quite consistent with your story!--I have something more to say. Attend to it; for what I say I'll do. Do you hear me, you fairy spirit? What I say, I mean to do!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I Certainly {{should not}} have volunteered for this work, Bullen, if I had known what it <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad at {{not being able to}} go out to the Cape, and as my {{regiment}} was, like yours, stationed in India, there was no chance of getting away from there, if I had once returned. Of course, I knew all about the expeditions of Wolseley and Scott; but I forgot that these were carried on in the dry season, and that we should have to campaign in the wet season, which makes all the difference in the world. We are wet through, from morning till night--and all night, too--and at our camping places there is no shelter. The low-lying land is turned into deep swamps, the little streams become great unfordable torrents, and the ground under our feet turns into liquid mud. It is really horrible work, especially as we get very little food and less drink. It is not work for dogs." ...|$|E

Why, it was one of 'em, and with such black eyes and jewels on her neck, and Battens and ermine like a duchess, I tell you--it was one of 'em at Paris that swept off {{the best part of the}} {{thousand}} pound as I went off with. Didn't I ever tell you of it? Well, I don't mind. At first I was very cautious and having such a lot of money kept it close and lived like a gentleman--Colonel Altamont, Meurice's hotel, and that sort of thing--never played, except at the public tables, and won more than I lost. Well, sir, there was a chap that I saw at the hotel and the Palace Royal too, a regular swell fellow, with white kid gloves and a tuft to his chin, Bloundell-Bloundell his name was, as I made acquaintance with somehow, and he asked me to dinner, and took me to Madame the Countess de Foljambe's soirees--such a woman, Strong!--such an eye! such a hand at the pianner. Lor bless you, she'd sit down and sing to you, and gaze at you, until she warbled your soul out of your body a'most. She asked me to go to her evening parties every Toosday; and didn't I take opera-boxes and give her dinners at the restauranteur's, that's all? But I had a run of luck at the tables, and it was not in the dinners and opera-boxes that poor Clavering's money went. No, be hanged to it, it was swept off in another way. One night, at the Countess's, there was several of us at supper--Mr. Bloundell-Bloundell, the Honourable Deuceace, the Marky de la Tour de Force--all tip-top nobs, sir, and the height of fashion, when we had supper, and champagne you may be sure in plenty, and then some of that confounded brandy. I would have it--I would it go on at it--the Countess mixed the tumblers of punch for me, and we had cards as well as grog after supper, and I played and drank until I don't know what I did. I <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> last night. I was taken away and put to bed somehow, and never woke until the next day, to a roaring headache, and to see my servant, who said the Honourable Deuceace wanted to see me, and was waiting in the sitting-room. 'How are you, Colonel?' says he, a coming into my bedroom. 'How long did you stay last night after I went away? The play was getting too high for me, and I'd lost enough to you for one night.'" ...|$|E
