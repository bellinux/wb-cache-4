5|$|Lasker <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> 50s when he {{lost the}} world {{championship}} to Capablanca, and he retired from serious match play afterwards; his only other match was a short exhibition against Frank James Marshall in 1940, which Lasker lost. After winning the New York 1924 chess tournament (1½ points ahead of Capablanca) and finishing second at Moscow in 1925 (1½ points behind Efim Bogoljubow, ½ point ahead of Capablanca), he effectively retired from serious chess.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau's first {{recording}} was for Hollyday's The Natural Moment in 1991; {{his first}} tour of Europe was {{also with the}} saxophonist that year. Mehldau's interest in classical music returned when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> twenties, and spurred him into developing his left-hand playing. He led his own trio from at least 1992, when he played at New York's Village Gate. Mehldau also played as sideman {{with a variety of}} musicians around this time. His performances with saxophonist Perico Sambeat included a tour of Europe early in 1993, and Mehldau's first released recordings as co-leader, from a May concert in Barcelona. Mehldau also toured for 18 months with saxophonist Joshua Redman. This association began in 1993, but they had played together for a short period the previous year. Redman and his band attracted attention, with their 1994 album Moodswing also aiding Mehldau's profile. They also played together for the soundtrack to the 1994 film Vanya on 42nd Street, for which Redman wrote the music.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within {{the first and second}} floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Ivan Shishman was proclaimed emperor {{after the}} death of his father on 17 February 1371, when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> 20s. Ivan Shishman {{inherited}} only parts of his father's realm: he ruled the lands between the Iskar River and Silistra, the valley of Sofia, parts of the Rhodope mountains and northern Thrace. To the west, the areas centred around Vidin recognised Ivan Sratsimir as emperor of Bulgaria, while to the east, the Principality of Karvuna, encompassing the coastal strip between the Danube Delta and Cape Emine and under the rule of despot Dobrotitsa, did not recognise the authority of the emperor of Tarnovo either. Contemporary chroniclers such as Johann Schiltberger speak of three regions, all of which were called Bulgaria. Thus, the country was divided on the eve of the Ottoman invasion, despite Ivan Shishman's claims in his royal charters. In these, he styled himself as a primary emperor in an attempt to emphasise the existence of a hierarchy among the rulers of the three Bulgarias. However, that hierarchy remained only in paper; to further assert their independence from Tarnovo, both Ivan Sratsimir and Dobrotitsa separated their dioceses from the Bulgarian Patriarchate in Tarnovo. According to Fine, immediately {{after the death}} of Ivan Alexander, Ivan Sratsimir tried to conquer the whole of Bulgaria. He was able to capture Sofia and managed to hold the city for one or two years. The rivalry between the two brothers for Sofia had a strong tradition in the Bulgarian historiography since the time of Konstantin Jireček, but it has been dismissed by many modern Bulgarian historians.|$|E

25|$|He began {{training}} in 1925, {{when he was}} forty, under Harada Daiun Sogaku, a Sōtō Rōshi who had studied Zen under both Sōtō and Rinzai masters. Two years later he attained kensho, as recognized by his teacher. He finished his koan study when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> fifties, and received Dharma transmission from Harada in 1943, at age fifty-eight. He was head of a training-hall, but gave this up, preferring instead to train lay-practitioners.|$|E

Dement held the federal Receiver of Public Moneys post with U.S. Government Land Office under five different presidential administrations. During the 1832 Black Hawk War, Dement commanded a battalion in combat at the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove. Sauk war chief Black Hawk later commented on the valor displayed by Dement during the battle. Dement died in 1883 at his home in Dixon, Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Shah was, however, {{brought back}} for the ODI series, {{including}} two Twenty20 Internationals. While making little contribution with the bat in the first match, in which England were defeated, Shah hit a match winning 55 off 35 deliveries in the second, with England drawing the Twenty20 series 1–1. He was later made man of the match. He has changed his game somewhat in recent times, and is not the classical batsman that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> years; however, he still possesses {{a wide range of}} shots, with the pull shot and the fierce slap through extra cover being the most prominent.|$|E

25|$|Anxious to curb further {{disorders}} in the region, the United States began to urge Carías {{to step aside}} and allow free elections when his current term in office expired. Carías, who by then <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> seventies, ultimately yielded to these pressures and announced October 1948 elections, {{in which he would}} refrain from being a candidate. He continued, however, to find ways to use his power. The PNH nominated Carías's choice for president—Juan Manuel Gálvez, who had been minister of war since 1933. Exiled opposition figures were allowed to return to Honduras, and the PLH, trying to overcome years of inactivity and division, nominated Zúñiga Huete, the same individual whom Carías had defeated in 1932. The PLH rapidly became convinced that it had no chance to win and, charging the government with manipulation of the electoral process, boycotted the elections. This act gave Gálvez a virtually unopposed victory, and in January 1949, he assumed the presidency.|$|E
25|$|Based on her account, {{claiming}} to have been raped by several black men, the police quickly arrested Frank Hairston, Jr. and Booker Millner. Four more suspects were arrested that night, {{based in part on}} the first two men's confessions. By the next morning, all the men in custody had signed confessions. The last to be arrested, Joe Hampton, was taken into custody on January 10. All but one man <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> 20s. After being held by police overnight, the first six all signed confessions, implicating themselves and each other. All admitted to being present at the crime, including Joe Hampton, although not all took part in rape. Only one of the accused had a prior criminal record, and most of the men were employed. When the NAACP appealed their convictions, its defense team noted that the police had questioned the men who had been drinking for some time, and without allowing them to consult with lawyers or their families.|$|E
25|$|The tale told in Sverre's saga is the {{official}} version. Historians have questioned the veracity of it, {{especially with regard to}} Sverre's alleged paternity. Some historians have considered his claim to be King Sigurd's son to be false, as did many of his contemporaries. Others have believed the paternal claim to be true, while most historians have found that the paternal question can not be given a definite answer. Although the fact that kings fathered illegitimate sons was taken for granted, other facts indicate that Sverre <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> thirties when he came to Norway, such as the age of his own sons and nephews. It has been cited against Sverre's claim that according to Canon law, one had to be at least 30 years old to be eligible for the priesthood. If Sverre was 30 years old when he became a priest, this would place his birth no later than 1145, making his paternal claim impossible, as Sigurd Munn was born in 1133. This particular objection has lost credence as it has become clear that this age limit was routinely ignored in Scandinavia at the time. However, other objections remain, such as the fact that Sverre consistently refused to undergo an ordeal by fire to prove his claims. At the time, such a trial was routine for new claimants to the throne, and belief in its efficacy seems to have been universal; yet Sverre refused to undergo it. If Sverre's claim was false, however, he would lack royal legitimacy, dooming his plans to failure. Regardless, his motivation is clear: to capture the throne of Norway, whether he could prove royal blood or not. After all, Norway had seen other claimants, since Harald Gille, whose paternity was equally questionable.|$|E

500|$|Obsidian Entertainment {{was founded}} by Feargus Urquhart, Chris Avellone, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan and Chris Jones. Prior to the {{establishment}} of Obsidian, they worked for Interplay Entertainment's subsidiary Black Isle Studios. At Black Isle they created several role-playing games including Icewind Dale, , and Fallout 2, and collaborated with BioWare on Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and Baldur's Gate II. Most of these games were critically and commercially successful, but Interplay's financial situation was poor and the studio lost its license to produce Dungeons & Dragons-based games. This led to the cancellation of [...] Urquhart and most of the staff members were dissatisfied and frustrated with the cancellation, as the game had already been under development {{for a year and a}} half. Urquhart became convinced that staying in Black Isle was no longer a [...] "viable option" [...] for the team, and decided to leave the company. He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> thirties at the time, and thought that if he did not start a new company soon, he may become too old to do so. Urquhart officially left Interplay in 2003 with Avellone, Parker, Monahan, and Jones, and founded Obsidian Entertainment with them the same year.|$|E
