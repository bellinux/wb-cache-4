5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> with signal flags (during daylight) and signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured {{in a wooden}} case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E

60|$|She nestled {{her head}} down close at Mary's feet as she spoke those words, and said no more. I once or twice thought she had fallen asleep, but {{whenever}} I looked at her her heavy eyes were always wide open. She never changed her position an inch till the church clocks struck six; then she gave one little squeeze to Mary's feet with her arm, and shuffled {{out of the room}} without <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> or two after, I heard her down below, lighting the kitchen fire just as usual.|$|R
25|$|The first {{system that}} didn't require skilled {{technicians}} to operate was Sir Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where {{the letters of}} the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Wheatstone further {{invented the}} {{automatic}} transmitter, {{in which the}} signals of the message are first punched out on a strip of paper, which is then passed through the sending-key, and controls the signal currents. By substituting a mechanism for the hand in sending the message, {{he was able to}} telegraph about 100 <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> or five times the ordinary rate. In the Postal Telegraph service this apparatus is employed for sending Press telegrams, and it has recently been so much improved, that messages are now sent from London to Bristol at a speed of 600 <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and even of 400 <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> between London and Aberdeen. On the night of 8 April 1886, when Mr. Gladstone introduced his Bill for Home Rule in Ireland, no fewer than 1,500,000 words were dispatched from the central station at St. Martin's-le-Grand by 100 Wheatstone transmitters. The plan of sending messages by a running strip of paper which actuates the key was originally patented by Bain in 1846; but Wheatstone, aided by Mr. Augustus Stroh, an accomplished mechanician, and an able experimenter, was the first to bring the idea into successful operation. This system {{is often referred to as}} the Wheatstone Perforator and is the forerunner of the stock market Ticker tape ...|$|E

60|$|Stephen {{suddenly}} {{shifted his}} position from {{her right hand}} to her left, where there was just room enough for a small ottoman to stand between the piano and {{the corner of the}} room.

So long and so earnestly gazed he, that her cheek deepened to a more and more crimson tint as each line was added to her song.

60|$|The truth was, that Raymond {{had just}} begun to go to a singing school, and he was taking this {{opportunity}} to rise and fall the notes, as he called it.

60|$|May's three-keyed machine, by the way, did not {{actually}} send forth the electricity. It only punched holes in a long tape of white paper, which holes, according to their relative arrangement, represented the alphabet. Having punched a message by playing on the keys, she transferred her tape to the electric machine at her elbow and passed it through. This transmitting machine was automatic or self acting. It required only to be fed with perforated tapes. In Ireland the receiving-machine presented its messages {{in the form of}} dots and dashes, which, according to arrangement, became alphabetic. You don't understand this, reader, eh? It would be surprising if you did! A treatise on electric telegraphy would be required to make it clear-- supposing you to have a mechanical turn of mind. Suffice it to say that the Wheatstone telegraph instrument tapes off its messages at the rate of 100 <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E

Peter, in the deep easy-chair before the fire, sat long into the night. Elizabeth, liking quiet company, purred softly. Out of the shadows crept to Peter Hope an old forgotten dream--the dream of a wonderful new Journal, price one penny weekly, of which the Editor should come to be one Thomas Hope, son of Peter Hope, its honoured Founder and Originator: a powerful Journal that should supply a long-felt want, popular, {{but at the same time}} elevating--a pleasure to the public, a profit to its owners.

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--You {{will have}} no letter at all this month and it is really not my fault. I have been saving my hand as much as {{possible}} for Davy Balfour; only this morning I was getting on first rate with him, when about half-past nine there came a prick {{in the middle of the}} ball of my thumb, and I had to take to the left hand and two <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> I fear I slightly exaggerate the speed of my left hand; about a word and a half in the minute--which is dispiriting to the last degree. Your last letter with the four excellent reviews and the good news about The Wrecker was particularly welcome. I have already written to Charles Baxter about the volume form appearance of The Beach of Falesá. In spite of bad thumbs and other interruptions I hope to send to Baxter by this mail the whole first part (a good deal more than half) of David Balfour ready for press. This is pretty satisfactory, and I think ought to put us beyond the reach of financial catastrophe for the year.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Isaac D.

Mr. Worthington went on to outline the duty of citizens of the present day, as he conceived it, and in this connection referred, with becoming modesty, to the Worthington Free Library. He had made his money in Brampton, and it was but right that he should spend it {{for the benefit of the}} people of Brampton. The library, continued Mr. Worthington when the applause was over, had been the dream of a certain delicate youth who had come, many years ago, to Brampton for his health. (It is a curious fact, by the way, that Mr. Worthington seldom recalled the delicate youth now, except upon public occasions.) ...|$|E

A busy, commonplace, soft-armed, pleasant, good little thing she was; glancing at them through eye-glasses {{attached}} to a gold chain over her ear, not much impressed now, slightly ashamed by the delight she took in winning their attention by brilliant recitations.... She decided that most of them were earnest-minded but intelligent serfs, not much stronger than the girls who were taking stenography for want of anything better to do. They sprawled and looked vacuous as they worked in rows in the big study-hall, with its hard blue walls showing the marks of two removed partitions, its old iron fireplace stuffed with rubbers and overshoes and crayon-boxes. As a provincial, Una disliked the many Jews among them, and put down their fervor for any sort of learning to acquisitiveness. The rest she came to despise for the clumsy slowness with which they learned even the simplest lessons. And to all of them she--who was going to be rich and powerful, directly she was good for one hundred <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> at stenography!--felt disdainfully superior, because they were likely to be poor the rest of their lives.|$|E

6000|$|We {{lost our}} way, of course. I always {{do in the}} country, and it does make me so wild, because it is no use asking {{direction}} {{of any of the}} people you meet. One might as well inquire of a lodging-house slavey the way to make beds as expect a country bumpkin to know the road to the next village. You have to shout the question about three times before the sound of your voice penetrates his skull. At the third time he slowly raises his head and stares blankly at you. You yell it at him then for a fourth time, and he repeats it after you. He ponders while you count a couple of hundred, after which, speaking at the rate of three <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> he fancies you [...] "couldn't do better than--" [...] Here he catches sight of another idiot coming down the road and bawls out to him the particulars, requesting his advice. The two then argue the case for {{a quarter of an hour}} or so, and finally agree that you had better go straight down the lane, round to the right and cross by the third stile, and keep to the left by old Jimmy Milcher's cow-shed, and across the seven-acre field, and through the gate by Squire Grubbin's hay-stack, keeping the bridle-path for awhile till you come opposite the hill where the windmill used to be--but it's gone now--and round to the right, leaving Stiggin's plantation behind you; and you say [...] "Thank you" [...] and go away with a splitting headache, but without the faintest notion of your way, the only clear idea you have on the subject being that somewhere or other there is a stile which has to be got over; and at the next turn you come upon four stiles, all leading in different directions! ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{the real}} venom that lurks hid within notes from {{dictation}} {{does not appear}} until the time for examination arrives. Then you find yourself {{face to face with}} sixty or seventy closely and badly written pages of a note-book, all of which must be learnt by heart if you would aspire to the dizzy heights of half-marks. It is useless to tell your examiner that you had no chance of getting up the subject. 'Why,' he will reply, 'I gave you notes on that very thing myself.' 'You did, sir,' you say, as you advance stealthily upon him, 'but as you dictated those notes at the rate of two hundred <b>words</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and as my brain, though large, is not capable of absorbing sixty pages of a note-book in one night, how the suggestively asterisked aposiopesis {{do you expect me to}} know them? Ah-h-h!' The last word is a war-cry, as you fling yourself bodily on him, and tear him courteously, but firmly, into minute fragments. Experience, which, as we all know, teaches, will in time lead you into adopting some method by which you may evade this taking of notes. A good plan is to occupy yourself with the composition of a journal, an unofficial magazine not intended for the eyes of the profane, but confined rigidly to your own circle of acquaintances. The chief advantage of such a work is that you will continue to write while the notes are being dictated. To throw your pen down with an air of finality and begin reading some congenial work of fiction would be a gallant action, but impolitic. No, writing of some sort is essential, and as it is out of the question to take down the notes, what better substitute than an unofficial journal could be found? To one whose contributions to the School magazine are constantly being cut down to mere skeletons by the hands of censors, there is a rapture otherwise unattainable in a page of really scurrilous items about those in authority. Try it yourselves, my beamish lads. Think of something really bad about somebody. Write it down and gloat over it. Sometimes, indeed, it is of the utmost use in determining your future career. You will probably remember those Titanic articles that appeared at the beginning of the war in The Weekly Luggage-Train, dealing with all the crimes of the War Office--the generals, the soldiers, the enemy--of everybody, in fact, except the editor, staff and office-boy of The W.L.T. Well, the writer of those epoch-making articles confesses that he owes all his skill to his early training, when, a happy lad at his little desk in school, he used to write trenchantly in his note-book on the subject of the authorities. There is an example for you. Of course we can never be like him, but let, oh! let us be as like him as we're able to be. A final word to those lost ones who dictate the notes. Why are our ears so constantly assailed with unnecessary explanations of, and opinions on, English literature? Prey upon the Classics if you will. It is a revolting habit, but too common to excite overmuch horror. But surely anybody, presupposing a certain bias towards sanity, can understand the Classics of our own language, with the exception, of course, of Browning. Take Tennyson, for example. How often have we been forced to take down from dictation the miserable maunderings of some commentator on the subject of Maud. A person reads Maud, and either likes it or dislikes it. In any case his opinion is not likely to be influenced by writing down at express speed the opinions of somebody else concerning the methods or objectivity and subjectivity of the author when he produced the work.|$|E

40|$|What is logology, {{otherwise}} known as recreational linguistics? There appear to be two ways to define it: subjectively, as an intellectual quest that stimulates and beguiles its devotees, and objectively, as a body of organized knowledge. The advent of the computer has sharpened this debate. Consider this example: in the old days, a fourteen-letter pair isogram (each letter appears exactly twice in the word) such as TAENIODONTIDAE could be found only by lengthy dictionary-searching, and its publication in Word Ways in August 1971 was a celebration of human persistence. However, {{since the publication of}} Levine 2 ̆ 7 s computer-generated pattern word lists, one can look this <b>word</b> up in <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so.
