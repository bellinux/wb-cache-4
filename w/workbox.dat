25|$|When a man {{proposed}} to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed {{to him by}} her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a <b>workbox,</b> a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for {{the back of the}} hand, leggings and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many yomeiri marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.|$|E
2500|$|... "Anne was... {{the apple}} of her proud father's eye, his {{favourite}} child, {{he confessed to}} [...] Fox. More {{than any of the}} other children she treated him with a spontaneous affection that touched him deeply; she liked to smooth his hair and pat his clothes into shape, and was by nature self-absorbedly neat and tidy, cutting out delicate bits of paper to put away in her <b>workbox,</b> threading ribbons, and sewing small things for her dolls and make-believe worlds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See, here's the <b>workbox,</b> little wife, [...] That I made of {{polished}} oak." [...] He was a joiner, of village life; [...] She came of borough folk.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the period}} {{immediately}} following the First World War, Number 42 was the workplace or head office of the [...] "Soldiers' Embroidery Industry". Textile bags and <b>workboxes</b> were labelled thus, including the words [...] "Made by the Totally Disabled", i.e. disabled veterans doing rehabilitation work.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{from what}} was casually dropped, I think Mrs. Manston had a few {{articles}} of furniture she didn't want, {{and when she was}} leaving they were put in a sale just by. Amongst her things were two <b>workboxes</b> very much alike. One of these she intended to sell, the other she didn't, and Mr. Brown, who collected the things together, took the wrong one to the sale.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She looks {{quite like}} a maid," [...] {{continues}} the lady. [...] "She has hard hands, {{and she called}} me mum always. I was quite disappointed in her." [...] And she subsides into a novel, with many of which kind of works, and with other volumes, and with <b>workboxes,</b> and with wonderful inkstands, portfolios, portable days of the month, scent-bottles, scissor-cases, gilt miniature easels displaying portraits, and countless gimcracks of travel, the rapid Kuhn has covered the tables in the twinkling of an eye.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Higgins had lately pawned the <b>workbox</b> {{with other}} useless {{articles}} of lumber, she said. Edward bought the duplicate of her, and {{went downstairs to}} the pawnbroker's.|$|E
60|$|She took {{a letter}} from the lid of her <b>workbox,</b> and handed it to him. Knight took the missive abstractedly, but struck by its {{appearance}} murmured a few words and left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, never: {{we might}} do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her <b>workbox,</b> and turn her drawers inside out; {{and she was so}} good-natured, she would give us {{anything}} we asked for." ...|$|E
50|$|In Tonbridge (near to Tunbridge Wells), George Wise (1703-1779) {{is known}} to have had a {{business}} in 1746. It continued with his son Thomas, and Thomas's nephew George (1779-1869), who took over in 1806. In its early years the company made articles such as <b>workboxes</b> and tea caddies with prints of popular views; later items had pictures created from mosaics. Their workshop in Tonbridge, Wise's Tunbridge Ware Manufactory, was next to the Big Bridge over the Medway; the building was demolished in 1886 to widen the approach to the bridge.|$|R
60|$|The parlour {{was rather}} a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table {{was like a}} looking-glass. A few strange, antique portraits {{of the men and}} women of other days {{decorated}} the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of <b>workboxes</b> and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn and well saved.|$|R
25|$|Burials {{reflecting}} this Final Phase exhibit {{an increasing}} polarity of grave wealth. While most Final Phase burials contain grave goods, {{there are fewer}} artefacts interned with the graves than {{was seen in the}} Early Anglo-Saxon period. The artefacts included as grave goods also differ from those typically found in earlier centuries. Brooches and long strings of beads become less common in female graves, while weapons become less common in male graves. Men's graves often include small buckles, knives, and sometimes shoelace tags. Women's graves typically consist of pins, chatelaines with such accessories as purse-mounts and <b>workboxes,</b> and necklaces containing small, monochrome beads, gold pendants, and slip-rings made of silver or bronze.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have always}} said [...] "No" [...] hitherto,' replied the woman, 'considering I could say no more if put upon my oath, as I {{expected}} to be. But speaking in a common everyday way now the occurrence is past, I believe a few things of some kind (though I doubt if they were papers) were left in a <b>workbox</b> she had, because she talked about it to Mr. Brown, and was rather angry at what occurred--you see, she had a temper by all account, and so I didn't like to remind the lady of this <b>workbox</b> when she came the other day with her husband.' ...|$|E
60|$|Manston {{now knew}} {{that there had been}} {{photographs}} of some kind in his wife's <b>workbox,</b> and though he had not been near enough to see them, he guessed whose they were. The least reflection told him to whom they had been sent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{you put it}} in your pocket," [...] {{cried the}} chaplain. [...] "I saw you take it out and pay at the toy-shop a bill for a gold thimble and <b>workbox</b> for one of your young ladies. Of course you have asked there, sir?" ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of James I and the {{accession}} of Charles I, elaborately embroidered clothing faded from popularity under the dual influences of rising Puritanism and the new court's taste for French fashion with its lighter silks in solid colours accessorised with masses of linen and lace. [...] In this new climate, needlework was praised by moralists as an appropriate occupation for girls {{and women in the}} home, and domestic embroidery for household use flourished. [...] Embroidered pictures, mirror frames, <b>workboxes,</b> and other domestic objects of this era often depicted Biblical stories featuring characters dressed in the fashion of Charles and his queen Henrietta Maria, or after the Restoration, Charles II and Catherine of Braganza.|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{was a huge}} {{man with}} a large expanse of good-natured visage, and a {{tendency}} to make all his statements with the solemnity of an oracle. Big and little men, like large and small dogs, have usually a sympathetic liking for each other. Dick Moy's chief friend on board was little Jack Shales, who was {{the life of the}} ship, and was particularly expert, as were also most of his mates, in making, during hours of leisure, beautiful <b>workboxes</b> and writing-desks with inlaid woods of varied colours, which were sold at a moderate price on shore, in order to eke out the monthly wage and add to the comforts of wives and little ones at Ramsgate. It may be added that Jack Shales was unquestionably the noisiest man on board. He had a good voice; could sing, and did sing, from morning till night, and had the power of uttering a yell that would have put to shame the wildest warrior among the Cherokee savages! ...|$|R
6000|$|Clive, in the avuncular gig, {{is driven}} over the downs to Brighton to his {{maternal}} aunt there; {{and there he}} is a king. He has the best bedroom, Uncle Honeyman turning out for him sweetbreads for dinner; no end of jam for breakfast; excuses from church on the plea of delicate health; his aunt's maid to see him to bed; his aunt to come smiling in when he rings his bell of a morning. He is made much of, and coaxed, and dandled and fondled, {{as if he were a}} young duke. So he is to Miss Honeyman. He is the son of Colonel Newcome, C.B., who sends her shawls, ivory chessmen, scented sandalwood <b>workboxes</b> and kincob scarfs; who, as she tells Martha the maid, has fifty servants in India; at which Martha constantly exclaims, [...] "Lor', mum, what can he do with 'em, mum?" [...] who, when in consequence of her misfortunes she resolved on taking a house at Brighton, and letting part of the same furnished, sent her an order for a hundred pounds towards the expenses thereof; who gave Mr. Honeyman, her brother, a much larger sum of money at the period of his calamity. Is it gratitude for past favours? is it desire for more? is it vanity of relationship? is it love for the dead sister--or tender regard for her offspring which makes Mrs. Martha Honeyman so fond of her nephew? I never could count how many causes went to produce any given effect or action in a person's life, and have been for my own part many a time quite misled in my own case, fancying some grand, some magnanimous, some virtuous reason, for an act of which I was proud, when lo! some pert little satirical monitor springs up inwardly, upsetting the fond humbug which I was cherishing--the peacock's tail wherein my absurd vanity had clad itself--and says, [...] "Away with this boasting! I am the cause of your virtue, my lad. You are pleased that yesterday at dinner you refrained from the dry champagne? My name is Worldly Prudence, not Self-denial, and I caused you to refrain. You are pleased because you gave a guinea to Diddler? I am Laziness, not Generosity, which inspired you. You hug yourself because you resisted other temptation? Coward! it was because you dared not run the risk of the wrong. Out with your peacock's plumage! walk off in the feathers which Nature gave you, and thank Heaven they are not altogether black." [...] In a word, Aunt Honeyman was a kind soul, and such was the splendour of Clive's father, of his gifts, his generosity, his military services, and companionship of the battles, that the lad did really appear a young duke to her. And Mrs. Newcome was not unkind: and if Clive had been really a young duke, I am sure he would have had the best bedroom at Marble Hill, and not one of the far-off little rooms in the boys' wing; I am sure he would have had jellies and Charlottes Russes, instead of mere broth, chicken, and batter-pudding, as fell to his lot; and when he was gone (in the carriage, mind you, not in the gig driven by a groom), I am sure Mrs. Newcome would have written a letter that night to Her Grace the Duchess Dowager his mamma, full of praise of the dear child, his graciousness, his beauty, and his wit, and declaring that she must love him henceforth and for ever after as a son of her own. You toss down the page with scorn, and say, [...] "It is not true. Human nature is not so bad as this cynic would have it to be. You would make no difference between the rich and the poor." [...] Be it so. You would not. But own that your next-door neighbour would. Nor is this, dear madam, addressed to you; no, no, we are not so rude as to talk about you to your face; but if we may not speak of the lady who has just left the room, what is to become of conversation and society? ...|$|R
60|$|Whether the {{deceased}} {{might not have}} been better off if he had emigrated in his bachelor days, was a question which his relict did not stop to consider; for Kate entered the room, with her <b>workbox,</b> in this stage of her reflections; and a much slighter interruption, or no interruption at all, would have diverted Mrs Nickleby's thoughts into a new channel at any time.|$|E
60|$|Edward in the {{meantime}} had reached the auction-room. He found some difficulty, {{on account of the}} inertness of those whose only inducement to an action is a mere wish from another, in getting the information he stood in need of, but it was at last accorded him. The auctioneer's book gave the name of Mrs. Higgins, 3 Canley Passage, as the purchaser of the lot which had included Mrs. Manston's <b>workbox.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As for Fanny, that Hebe bent {{her head}} {{suddenly}} over her work-basket, and thrust her face into it as if searching with microscopic intensity for something that positively refused to be found. All that we can safely affirm in regard to her is, that if her face bore any resemblance to the scarlet of her neck, {{the fact that her}} <b>workbox</b> did not take fire is little short of a miracle! ...|$|E
60|$|Katie had a well-worn, {{well-known}} little <b>workbox,</b> which, {{in years}} now long past; {{had been given}} to her either by Alaric or Harry. Doubtless she had now work-boxes grander both in appearance and size; but, nevertheless, whether from habit or from choice, her custom was, in her daily needlework, to use this old friend. Often and often had Charley played with it many wicked pranks. Once, while Katie had as yet no pretension to be grown up, he had put a snail into it, and had incurred her severe displeasure. He had stuffed it full of acorns, and been rewarded by being pelted with them round the lawn; and had filled it with nuts, for which he had not found it so difficult to obtain pardon. He knew every hole and corner in it! he was intimate with all her little feminine nicknacks--her silver thimble, her scissors, her bit of wax, and the yard-measure, which twisted itself in and out of an ivory cottage--he knew them all, as well as though they were his own; and he knew also where the <b>workbox</b> stood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Vincent, what offer do {{you make}} for the letter? Well, we won't tease you," [...] Annie went on as Vincent gave an {{impatient}} exclamation. [...] "Another time we might do so, but as you have just come safely back to us I don't {{think it would be}} fair, especially as this is the very first letter. Here it is!" [...] and she took out of the <b>workbox</b> before her the missive Vincent was so eager to receive.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' {{returned}} Mrs. Sparsit. 'I {{hope you}} may be happy, Mr. Bounderby. Oh, indeed I hope {{you may be}} happy, sir!' And she said it with such great condescension {{as well as with}} such great compassion for him, that Bounderby, - far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her <b>workbox</b> at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug, - corked up the smelling-salts tight in his pocket, and thought, 'Now confound this woman, who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way!' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{a sort of}} <b>workbox</b> in {{the window}} of this {{subterranean}} breakfast-room sat an elderly lady with a singularly high colour and almost startling silver hair. She had, as if designedly to relieve these effects, a pair of Mephistophelian black eyebrows and a very neat black dress. The glare of the gas lit up her piquant hair and face perfectly against the brown background of the shutters. The background was blue and not brown in one place; at the place where Rupert's knife had torn a great opening in the wood about an hour before.|$|E
60|$|On {{his return}} {{he took up}} the <b>workbox</b> again to examine it more leisurely. He then found {{there was also a}} small cavity in the tray under the pincushion, which was movable by a bit of ribbon. Lifting this he {{uncovered}} a flattened sprig of myrtle, and a small scrap of crumpled paper. The paper contained a verse or two in a man's handwriting. He recognized it as Manston's, having seen notes and bills from him at his father's house. The stanza was of a complimentary character, descriptive of the lady who was now Manston's wife.|$|E
60|$|Being left alone, Paulina and I kept {{silence for}} some time: we both took out some work, and plied a mute and diligent task. The white-wood <b>workbox</b> of old days was now {{replaced}} by one inlaid with precious mosaic, and furnished with implements of gold; the tiny and trembling fingers that could scarce guide the needle, though tiny still, were now swift and skilful: {{but there was}} the same busy knitting of the brow, the same little dainty mannerisms, the same quick turns and movements--now to replace a stray tress, and anon to shake from the silken skirt some imaginary atom of dust--some clinging fibre of thread.|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MIDGETINA,--Don't suppose, because I {{have not}} written, that [...] Fanny is a monster, though, in fact, she is. I have often thought [...] of you--with your stars and knick-knacks. And of course your [...] letters have come. My thanks. I can't really answer them now [...] because I am trying {{at the same}} time to scribble this note and to [...] correct 'composition' papers under the very eyes of Miss [...] Stebbings--the abhorred {{daughter}} of Argus and the eldest Gorgon. [...] Dear me, I almost envy you, Midgetina. It must be fun to be like [...] a tiny, round-headed pin in a pin-cushion and just mock at the [...] <b>Workbox.</b> But all things in moderation.|$|E
6000|$|Occasionally {{when she}} had [...] "business" [...] to transact, Mrs Bowater would be off to London. There she would {{purchase}} for me any little trifle required for the replenishment of my wardrobe. Needing so little, I could afford the finest materials; my sovereign was worth at least sixty shillings. Rather than [...] "fine," [...] Mrs Bowater preferred things [...] "good"; and for this [...] "goodness," [...] I must confess, she sometimes made rather alarming sacrifices of appearance. Still, I was already possessed of a serviceable stock of clothes, and by aid {{of one of my}} dear mother's last presents to me, a shiny Swiss miniature <b>workbox</b> with an inlaid picture of the Lake of Geneva on the lid, I soon became a passable needlewoman.|$|E
60|$|The {{attendant}} showed {{all these}} things to the visitors, and many more, which I have not time now to describe. Among the rest {{was a piece of}} embroidery set in the top of a <b>workbox,</b> which Mary herself worked. The top of the box was formed of a plate of glass; the embroidery was placed underneath it, so that it could be seen through the glass. It was old and faded, and the boys did not think that it was very pretty. It was, however, curious to see it, since Mary had worked it with her own hands; especially as she did it when she was a child; for the guide said she embroidered it when she was only about twelve years old.|$|E
60|$|The countess not unnaturally {{thought that}} the {{despatch}} had come from Castle Richmond, and smiled graciously as Clara put out her hand for the missive. Lady Desmond again let her eyes drop upon the book which she was reading, as though to show that she was by far too confiding a mamma to interfere in any correspondence between her daughter and her daughter's lover. At the moment Lady Clara had been doing nothing. Her work was, indeed, on her lap, and her <b>workbox</b> was at her elbow; but her thoughts had been far away; far away as regards idea, though not so as to absolute locality; for in her mind she was walking beneath those elm-trees, and a man was near her, with a horse following at his heels.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Stanhope {{gave her}} {{daughter}} {{much of the}} family silver and jewelry, and also a full supply of table and other linen. From Captain Putnam came a handsome morris chair, and Songbird sent in a beautifully-bound volume of household poetry, with a poem of his own on the flyleaf. The students of Brill sent in a fine oil painting in a gold frame, and the girls at Hope contributed an inlaid <b>workbox</b> with a complete sewing outfit. From Dan Baxter, who had been invited, along with the young lady to whom he was engaged, came two gold napkin rings, each suitably engraved. Dan had written to Dick, saying {{he would come to}} the wedding if he had to take a week off to get there, he being then in Washington on a business trip.|$|E
60|$|Norman, on {{returning}} to the fancy fair, found the world in all the ardour of raffles. Lady Leonora's contributions were the chief prizes, which attracted every one, and, of course, the result was delightfully incongruous. Poor Ethel, who had been persuaded to venture a shilling to please Blanche, who had spent all her own, obtained the two jars in potichomanie, and was regarding them with a face worth painting. Harvey Anderson had a doll, George Rivers a wooden monkey, that jumped over a stick; and, if Hector Ernescliffe was enchanted at winning a beautiful mother-of-pearl inlaid <b>workbox,</b> which he had vainly wished to buy for Margaret, Flora only gained a match-box of her own, well known always to miss fire, but which had been decided to be {{good enough for the}} bazaar.|$|E
60|$|Repairing to the drawing-room--in which {{calm and}} {{decorated}} apartment she {{was fond of}} being alone, and where she could be implicitly trusted, for she fingered nothing, or rather soiled nothing she fingered--I found her seated, like a little Odalisque, on a couch, half shaded by the drooping draperies of the window near. She seemed happy; all her appliances for occupation were about her; the white wood <b>workbox,</b> a shred or two of muslin, an end or two of ribbon collected for conversion into doll-millinery. The doll, duly night-capped and night-gowned, lay in its cradle; she was rocking it to sleep, {{with an air of}} the most perfect faith in its possession of sentient and somnolent faculties; her eyes, at the same time, being engaged with a picture-book, which lay open on her lap.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bolton {{was perhaps}} rather shy and {{suspicious}} about these advances; but Mr. Pen's good-humour was inexhaustible, {{he could not}} see that he was unwelcome. He looked about the premises for a seat, and none being disengaged, for a dish-cover was on one, a <b>workbox</b> on the other, and so forth, he took one of the children's chairs, and perched himself upon that uncomfortable eminence. At this, the children began laughing, the child Fanny louder than all--at least, she was more amused than any of them, and amazed at His Royal Highness's condescension. He to sit down in that chair--that little child's chair!--Many and many a time after, she regarded it: haven't we almost all, such furniture in our rooms, that our fancy peoples with dear figures, that our memory fills with sweet smiling faces, which may never look on us more? ...|$|E
60|$|My {{mother was}} gentle with me, and had need to be; and I was happier in her company {{than one might}} think {{possible}} {{in a world of}} such fleetingness. I would sit beside her <b>workbox</b> and she would softly talk to me, and teach me my lessons and small rhymes to say; while my own impulse and instinct taught me to sing and dance. What gay hours we shared. Sewing was at first difficult, for at that time no proportionate needles could be procured for me, and I hated to cobble up only coarse work. But she would give me little childish jobs to do, such as arranging her silks, or sorting her beads, and would rock me to sleep with her finger to a drone so gentle that {{it might have been a}} distant bee's.|$|E
