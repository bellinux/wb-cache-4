5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. <b>When</b> <b>our</b> mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently <b>when</b> <b>our</b> love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E

25|$|Lt. Col. Donovan {{personally}} led the assaulting wave in {{an attack}} upon a very strongly organized position, and <b>when</b> <b>our</b> troops were suffering heavy casualties he encouraged all near him by his example, moving among his men in exposed positions, reorganizing decimated platoons, and accompanying them forward in attacks.

25|$|We create karma {{in three}} {{different}} ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, <b>when</b> <b>our</b> motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we experience will accord {{with the quality of}} our actions.|$|E

25|$|If Xerxes {{chose not}} to rush into a naval encounter, but instead kept his ships close to the shore and either stayed there or moved them towards the Peloponnese, victory would be his. The Greeks can't hold out against him for very long. They will leave for their cities, because they don't have food in store on this island, as I have learned, and <b>when</b> <b>our</b> army will march against the Peloponnese they who have come from there will become worried {{and they will not}} stay here to fight to defend Athens.|$|E
25|$|The {{document}} offers “a {{confession of}} sin to Palestinians in the State of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the diaspora and {{in refugee camps}} in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria,” saying that American Christians “bear responsibility for failing to say 'Enough!' <b>when</b> <b>our</b> nation’s ally, the State of Israel, violates international law.” The organization also acknowledges with “deep remorse” the role of Christians in “the historic persecution of the Jewish people,” which “betrayed the teaching and example of the one we claim to follow,” and promises to act with greater “faithfulness, compassion and justice” in the future.|$|E

25|$|Recall that {{vertical}} coordinate {{lines in}} our chart represent the world {{lines of the}} dust particles, but despite their straight appearance in our chart, the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually twisting about each other. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that <b>when</b> <b>our</b> observer looks radially outwards, he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another.|$|E
25|$|Light rays bend {{when they}} travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is {{determined}} by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), so immersion effectively eliminates the cornea's focusing properties. <b>When</b> <b>our</b> eyes are in water, instead of focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Tebbit gave an {{interview}} to John Mortimer for The Spectator where he said of Thatcher: It's a question of her leadership <b>when</b> <b>our</b> aims aren't clearly defined. When people understand what she's doing there's {{a good deal of}} admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't agree with her. Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't seem so attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.|$|E

25|$|Having {{delivered}} Our Secrets Are the Same to Chrysalis, Simple Minds {{then found}} themselves {{caught up in}} record company politics while Chrysalis, EMI and other companies attempted to merge with each other. Originally due for release in late 1999, the album remained unreleased after the band mired themselves in lawsuits with Chrysalis. In 2000, the situation became even more complicated <b>when</b> <b>Our</b> Secrets Are the Same was leaked on the internet. Discouraged with their label's failure to resolve the problems, and with both momentum and potential album sales lost, the band once again went on hiatus. Eddie Duffy, Mark Taylor and Mark Kerr all {{moved on to other}} projects. Jim Kerr moved to Sicily and took up a part-time career as a hotelier, although both he and Burchill continued working together on various business interests and kept the idea of the band alive.|$|E
25|$|Describing the {{original}} Palestinian Kairos document as “a heartfelt, sober, prayerful, urgent {{cry for help}} to end the U.S.-backed Israeli occupation,” the Kairos USA “response” began “with a confession of sin to Palestinians in the State of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the diaspora and in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.” The authors of the “response” said that “As U.S. Christians we bear responsibility for failing to say 'Enough!' <b>when</b> <b>our</b> nation's ally, the State of Israel, violates international law.” Saying that “the 'peace process' has continued {{to be no more}} than a means for the ongoing colonization of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the imprisonment of Gaza and the continuation of the structures of oppression,” the authors expressed remorse for the history of Christian anti-Semitism and pledged to “work and even suffer for peace, filled with a heart of love for both Israelis and Palestinians.” They then proceeded to describe Israel as “pursuing a course that is fruitless and corrupting, both morally and politically.” Citing the gospels of Matthew and Luke, the authors call for BDS and nonviolent direct action against Israel.|$|E
