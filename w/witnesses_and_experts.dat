Later that day, pro-Palestinian <b>witnesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> from Israel and the West Bank testified.

25|$|Each bill {{goes through}} several stages in each house {{including}} consideration {{by a committee}} and advice from the Government Accountability Office. Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month. Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must {{be open to the}} public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting. A committee might call for public hearings on important bills. Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> can present their case for or against a bill. Then, a bill may go to what's called a mark-up session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called clean bill with a new number. Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{disparate}} treatment of perceptual (‘‘fact’’) <b>witnesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> <b>witnesses</b> in the legal system.

We propose considering a court mediated system for compensating fact witnesses so as to encourage witnessing of legally impor-tant events. We construct a simple model of <b>witness</b> incentives, <b>and</b> simulate the effects of several possible payment mechanisms. Although it is possible that any system that offers a financial incentive will induce some unreliable witness testi-mony, we argue that the current system also provides incentives for biased testi-mony, so {{it is not clear that}} a payment system would lower the quality of witness testimony. 1...|$|R

50|$|Prosecutors are {{involved}} in the whole trial process, from the investigations, to trial proceedings and the execution of punishment. At the investigation stage, the prosecutor supervises the police’s investigations. The prosecutor only personally investigates cases when there are special crimes, such as corruption. Once the police complete investigations, they hand the evidence to the prosecutor. If the evidence is satisfactory, the prosecutor will prosecute the offender at an appropriate court. He will prepare a Bill of Indictment for the judge to begin the trial proceedings. During the trial proceedings, the prosecutor must ensure that the defendant, <b>witnesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> are all present. The prosecutor must also present all evidence concerning the crime. In practice, the prosecutor usually presents three or more pieces of legal evidence to support the defendant’s guilt. After the judge has passed judgment on the case, the judge’s clerk will send a copy of the execution of punishment to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will then execute the punishment.|$|E

40|$|The {{criminal}} justice system generally assumes that jurors have a base {{knowledge and understanding of}} the issues surrounding memory evidence. On some occasions, however, experts are brought in to testify and explain these issues to jurors. Though jurors (along with judges and attorneys) like to believe they are knowledgeable about the variables that may affect eyewitness memory, the reality is that they have a very limited understanding. However, there is little research on what misperceptions exist among laypeople regarding eyewitness memory. This is problematic because expert testimony may be more useful if it specifically addresses common misperceptions rather than just providing jurors with textbook information. This study investigates the influence specific expert testimony has on mock jurors.
