5000|$|Many mid- and rear-engined {{vehicles}} use a {{transverse engine}} and transaxle, {{similar to a}} front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> Others use a longitudinal engine and transaxle like Ferrari's 1989 Mondial t which used a [...] "t" [...] arrangement with a longitudinal engine connected to a transverse transaxle, a design the company continues to this day. Front-wheel drive versions of modern Audis, from the A4 upwards, along with their related marques from the Volkswagen Group (which share the same automobile layout) also use a similar layout, but with the transaxle also mounted longitudinally.|$|E

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid drive line concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic drive lines in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> hydrid <b>drive</b> line with <b>wheel</b> hub motors realises reductions of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> line topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> line is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC <b>drive</b> <b>units,</b> which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid drive lines are given...|$|R

40|$|Passenger car fuel {{consumption}} {{is a constant}} concern for automotive companies and the contribution to {{fuel consumption}} from aerodynamics is well known. Several studies have been published on the aerodynamics of wheels. One area of wheel aerodynamics discussed {{in some of these}} earlier works is the so-called ventilation resistance. This study investigates ventilation resistance on a number of 17 inch rims, in the Volvo Cars Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel. The ventilation resistance was measured using a custom–built suspension with a tractive force measurement system installed in the <b>Wheel</b> <b>Drive</b> <b>Units</b> (WDUs). The study aims at identifying wheel design factors that have significant effect on the ventilation resistance for the investigated wheel size. The results show {{that it was possible to}} measure similar power requirements to rotate the wheels as was found in previous works. The magnitude of the measured ventilation resistance confirms the conclusion that this effect should be taken into account when designing a wheel. It was found that some of the rim design factors have greater influences on the ventilation resistance than others. It was also shown that one of the investigated rims had lower ventilation resistance than measured for the fully-covered wheel configuration...|$|R
50|$|An {{optional}} {{steering assembly}} with a sulky seat and wheels {{was available in}} 1949 to convert the Model W transmission into a riding unit. The BesRo tractor utilized a similar transmission and <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> as the Model-W Garden King. The idea of the Model W BesRo was developed from Herbert Roths design of an ornamental tractor patent(D146,947). This original tricycle design {{was known as the}} BesRo Model W and was precursor to the BesRo Model R. The Model R BesRo used four <b>wheels</b> with the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> mounted in the rear. The riding frame was attached {{to the front of the}} transmission. The BesRo tractor was phased out of production by the mid-1950s and replaced with the Roths Country Boy.|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) A {{hydromechanical}} {{traction system}} for a wheeled vehicle is being examined in order to generate information that will be applicable {{to the design of}} the drive system controller. The functional analysis of the drive system leads to the description of the system and component properties. A design methodology is proposed by which the system components could be dimensioned and the system layout constructed by taking into account the specified functional requirements concerning the system performance. An explicit description of power flow and manipulation of power flow in the drive system is given. The mechanisms by which the hydraulic machines are adjusted to manipulate power flow, are examined in detail so that their contribution to the dynamic behaviour of the total drive system can be described., Experimental measurements are used to obtain a reliable description of the dynamic response of the adjustment mechanisms. An analytical model of the dynamic behaviour of the drive system is presented in block diagram format. The inherent multiple-input-multiple-output characteristic of the drive system with secondary controlled hydraulic motors is discussed. The block diagram is simplified to create linearized transfer functions that will depict the input-output-relationships. The effect of an accumulator on the dynamic response of the system is also given. Digital simulation programmes are constructed from the analytical model. The requirements of a vehicle traction system are interpreted and used as guidelines to conduct a functional design of the control system layout. The delivery of torque and the restriction of wheel spin for each of the <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>units,</b> which is realised by secondary controlled hydraulic motors, are described in detail. A hypothetical drive system is considered and quantitive control system design information is generated, using the simulation programmes. Some aspects of the dynamic response of the system are discussed and it is shown that the adjustment mechanism has a big influence on the overall dynamic response of the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{versatility}} {{of current}} rovers and exploratory vehicles {{is limited by}} a single drive system. The Variable Drive Vehicle (VDV) employs a actuated systemcapable of switching between <b>wheeled</b> and tracked <b>drive</b> modes. This allows the vehicle to travel quickly and efficiently over smooth terrain and to traverse more arduous terrain by switching between these two systems. The small scale prototype built {{over the course of}} this project is equipped with two modular <b>wheel</b> <b>driven</b> track <b>units</b> to demonstrate the viability of the system. Electric linear actuators and servo motors allow for simple control and a smooth transition between each drive system. These devices allow the modular tracks to be rotated out from under the wheels, and stowed on the vehicle when not in use. Finite element analysis ensured that the VDV’s switchingmechanism maintains safe loading at its most critical points during a drive system transition. The VDV was tested on smooth concrete to determine its maximum wheel speed, track speed, and how fast the drive system could be switched. Experiments yielded a top speed of 11. 5 mph in the wheel mode, 0. 8 mph in the track mode, and a switching time of 6. 4 seconds. The vehicle’smaximumobstacle clearance, 1 inch in track mode and 2 inches in wheel mode, and slope, 5 degrees in track mode and 22 degrees in wheel mode, fell short of expected values. These shortcomings resulted from a poor frictional power transfer when attempting to power the tracks using the wheels. However, this prototype provides a proof of concept for a variable drive system successfully incorporating two drive systems, and future improvements may yield a promising platformfor future robotics research...|$|R
