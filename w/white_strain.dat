40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Crystal Violet (CV) reaction, a trait which has been related to biotype, source and pathogenicity in Staphylococcus aureus, was investigated in agar and broth studies. White reactions could be converted to purple and vice versa by altering the incubation conditions on agar. Broth reactions examined macroscopically and by spectrophotometry revealed that both white and purple human biotype strains take up CV but the former then progressively modify the dye more quickly than the latter. A cell-associated product of CV was detected in <b>white</b> and purple <b>strains</b> by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography of methanol extracts. <b>White</b> <b>strains</b> appear to produce a second additional product from CV. The white reaction was not inhibited by chloramphenicol or azide but did depend on viable cells with a nutrient source. CV MICs and MBCs for 10 white and 10 purple reactors showed no gross differences in susceptibility, while a standardized assay for the rate of CV modifying activity (52 strains) demonstrated that the two categories comprise discrete populations which alter CV at different rates. Although most <b>white</b> <b>strains</b> belong to either or both of phage-typing groups V and II, purple strains with this pattern of susceptibility and <b>white</b> <b>strains</b> without it both occur. The capacity to modify CV slowly or rapidly appears to subdivide human biotype strains independently of their phage group and is associated in the former case with their capacity to produce hospital-acquired and invasive infections...|$|R

Here, a population of A. benhamiae wild strains from the same geographical area (Switzerland) was studied by comparing their morphology, assessing their molecular variability using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28 S rRNA gene sequencing, and evaluating their interfertility. Sequencing of the ITS region and of part of the 28 S rRNA gene revealed the existence of two infraspecific groups with markedly different colony phenotypes: white (group I) and yellow (group II), respectively. For all strains, the results of mating type identification by PCR, using HMG (high-mobility group) and α-box genes in the mating type locus as targets, were in total accordance {{with the results of}} mating type identification by strain confrontation experiments.

If strains of class 3 were furnished with MBC plus 2 -methyl- 3 -amylpyrrole (MAP), the other immediate precursor of prodigiosin, the pigment synthesized was characteristic of prodigiosin.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are {{reported on the}} use of both synthetic and natural zeolites in the diets of two strains of laying hens (56 weeks old). The synthetic zeolite, sodium zeolite A (SZA) was added to layer diets at four levels of inclusion (O. O%, O- 75 %, 1. 125 %; 1. 5 %). SZA did not improve or adversely effect layer performance as measured by several parameters. The incidence of egg shell defects as measured by four major categories were not influenced by the inclusion of SZA in the diet. Shell quality measured by conventional methods was not influenced by dietary treatment. The use of three aluminium silicates (natural zeolite 23, sodium bentonite, kaolin) included at two levels (2. 5 % and 5. 0 %) did not improve or adversely affect layer performance. The inclusion (5 %) of the natural zeolite 23 and kaolin improved feed efficiency when corrected for dilution. Shell defects and shell quality were not influenced by these aluminium silicates. In both experiments there was a significant strain effect on the usual production paremeters. Dietary treatment gave the same production and shell quality parameters for the two strains.

The optimal culture {{conditions for the}} vegetative growth of brown and white strains of H. marmoreus were investigated to obtain suitable farming condition. Temperature suitable and unsuitable for vegetative growth was obtained at 20 and 35 ℃, respectively. The both strains of H. mermoreus love medium temperature and the mycelial growth was well developed at 20 – 25 ℃. This mushroom prefer pH ranging 6 – 8 for mycelial growth. The highest and lowest mycelial growth was found at pH 7 and 5 of both strains, respectively. Among 5 different carbon sources, sucrose was the best, whereas, maltose and lactose were the worst. The most suitable nitrogen sources were CaNO 3 (in brown strain 65. 6 mm and in <b>white</b> <b>strain</b> 56. 3 mm) and the most unsuitable was NH_ 4 H_ 2 PO_ 4 (in brown strain 44. 02 mm and in <b>white</b> <b>strain</b> 40. 2 mm). Five different culture media were used to screen the optimal mycelial growth of H. marmoreus. PDA and YM (yeast–malt extract) were the most suitable and Czapek dox and Hennerberg were the most unfavorable for vegetative growth, whereas, glucose peptone was moderately suitable. The highest and lowest vegetative growth was observed in media prepared with mango (Mangifera indica) and koroi (Albizia procera) sawdust, respectively. However, for both strains, 3 weeks were required to complete mycelium running in mango sawdust, whereas, 4 weeks were spent to get 100 % mycelium running in mahagoni (Swietenia mahagoni) and koroi sawdust.

40|$|Background Infections {{due to the}} zoophilic dermatophyte Arthroderma benhamiae {{are being}} more {{frequently}} diagnosed in Belgium since a few years. The most common source of infection is guinea pigs. This species which is referred to the Trichophyton species of A. benhamiae can cause tinea capitis, tinea corporis, tinea manus and more frequently tinea faciei. These strains appear with a bright yellow thallus in culture and do not easily sporulate making them difficult to identify. Sequencing of these strains reveals “Arthroderma benhamiae”. At the contrary <b>white</b> <b>strains</b> of T. mentagrophytes complex are identified by sequencing as “T. mentagrophytes variety interdigitale” or T. interdigitale. The aim {{of the study is}} the evaluation of the genetic heterogeneity of these two subtypes of the T. mentagrophytes complex by using the DiversiLab® system. Material and methods 32 strains were collected by the National Reference Center for mycoses between 2012 and 2015. The fungal strains were identified by microscopy or ITS sequencing. All <b>strains</b> appearing <b>white</b> with a yellow pigment in culture and being identified as “A. benhamiae” by DNA sequencing were included as well reference strains. Some selected <b>strains</b> appearing <b>white</b> in culture and being identified as “T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale” by DNA sequencing were also included. The genotypic analysis was performed by the DiversiLab® system (bioMérieux) by DNA fingerprinting generation. Results Both groups showed huge differences in DNA fingerprints. The similarity calculated by the DiversiLab® tool between the two groups was 70 %. This reflects a high genotypic heterogeneity regarding the two types of strains analyzed. This is surprising given that both groups belong to the same species complex. The comparison of these two distinct DNA fingerprints with the mold database of bioMérieux generated identification as “T. mentagrophytes” for both groups. We noticed that the library contained two distinct patterns of DNA fingerprints (profile 1, strains MK 55 - 60 and profile 2, strains MK 138 - 143). Yellow strains were highly similar to profile 1 and <b>white</b> <b>strains</b> were highly similar to profile 2. Unfortunately, no additional information regarding the subspecies implicated could be obtained from the manufacturer. However, this study demonstrates that it may represent respectively “yellow strains types Trichophyton species of A. benhamiae” and “ <b>white</b> <b>strains</b> types T. interdigitale”. Conclusion This study highlights the genotypic differences between two types of strains belonging to the T. mentagrophytes species complex. Yellow strains which incidence is increasing in Belgium are clearly different from other strains previously characterized and the DiversiLab® method shows a high efficiency for discriminating between these two species difficult to separate by microscopy.
