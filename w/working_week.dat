After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The wage {{reform was}} linked to a program that reduced {{the length of the}} overall <b>working</b> <b>week</b> in the Soviet Union, and in 1958, the <b>working</b> <b>week</b> was reduced from 48 hours to 41. This was to apply to all Soviet workers, and by 1961, 40 million Soviet workers (approximately two thirds of the workforce) were working a 41-hour week. It was planned to {{decrease}} this further to 40 hours in 1962, but this was eventually not carried out. Khrushchev had stated a longer-term aim of giving Soviet workers the shortest working hours in the world, aiming for a 30- to 35-hour week by 1968. He had spoken previously of the reduction of working hours as a basic goal of a communist movement and had hoped that communism would eventually achieve a working day of 3–4 hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of sales was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume {{for the whole}} year was estimated to reach about 400units.

In the following month, over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting diesel engines. The economy improved in 1959.|$|E
40|$|For the Time-Use survey {{conducted}} by Insee in 1999 data was gathered from seven-day diaries in which working people noted their working hours for one week. Different types of <b>working</b> <b>weeks</b> were categorized by applying a two-stage optimal matching method, firstly for working days, then for simplified weeks using day types. The days differ greatly according to socio-professional category, the type of job, sector, but also gender. Pronounced regularities also emerge at a weekly level. Generally speaking, the better ones position in the economic system, the more independent time-management one has and the more <b>working</b> <b>weeks</b> are standard or long. Meanwhile, less skilled workers have <b>working</b> <b>weeks</b> which are shorter on average, but have staggered and fragmented schedules and a very low degree of control over their working time. For couples less independent time-management leads to their work schedules becoming more desynchronized and this creates new inequalities between households.

25|$|Before the First World War, the {{standard}} <b>working</b> <b>week</b> was 54 hours.

A Joint Committee of shop stewards, members of the Scottish TUC and Clyde Workers' Committee however proposed a campaign to limit working hours to 30 per week, which was altered to 40 per week after the Glasgow Trades Council became involved. It was, however, opposed by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and most other unions.|$|E

25|$|A regular weekly {{rest period}} {{is a period of}} at least 45 {{consecutive}} hours. An actual <b>working</b> <b>week</b> starts {{at the end of a}} {{weekly rest period}}, and finishes when another weekly rest period is commenced, which may mean that weekly rest is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday–Sunday) week. This is perfectly acceptable – the <b>working</b> <b>week</b> is not required to be aligned with the ‘fixed’ week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced weekly rest period of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent period of rest taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question. The compensating rest must be attached to a period of rest of at least 9 hours – in effect either a weekly or a daily rest period.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{the track}} has {{received}} considerable maintenance in parts, including complete track and ballast removal and replacement. It was informally thought locally by Network Rail staff that replacement signalling, controlled from Upminster, was planned for Christmas 2010, {{leading to the}} closure of the three signal boxes (staffed 24-hours a day, at least during the <b>working</b> <b>week).</b> However, financial constraints within Network Rail have now delayed this timescale.|$|E

40|$|Flexible work {{practices}} spreading work times {{across the}} entire week have reduced the time to engage in leisure activities and for some have compounded the problem {{of a lack of}} defined break between work weeks. This study examines time spent outside of the workplace through a multiple case study of working time and leisure in the construction industry. A framework of synchronous leisure is used to examine the interplay of work and non-work arrangements. The effects of changing work arrangements to deliver a longer break between <b>working</b> <b>weeks</b> and the consequent impact on leisure activities are analysed. Interviews and focus groups across four construction sites revealed that while leisure is important to relieve fatigue and overwork, a work schedule allowing a long break between <b>working</b> <b>weeks,</b> specifically on a weekend, enables workers to achieve synchronous time, particularly with family, and improves work-life balance satisfaction. It was found that a well-defined break across a weekend also offers the opportunity to synchronize schedules with others to spend time away on short breaks. ...|$|R

25|$|Through a {{retrospective}} analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the <b>working</b> <b>week</b> and on weekends. The odds of death were 44% and 82% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This “weekday effect” has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{commenced}} at Broken Hill, NSW in 1885, initially {{for lead}} {{in the form of}} galena and then the ore deposit was found to contain silver & zinc. As well as the mine at Broken Hill, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) had also established smelter operations at Port Pirie in South Australia. In 1892 there was a strike by miner's at Broken Hill that was precipitated by a decision to terminate the 1889 and 1890 agreements that prevented the introduction of a contract system for ore excavation and reduced the <b>working</b> <b>week</b> from 48 hours to 46. The strike was abandoned after 16 weeks when several strike leaders were imprisoned for 'unlawful conspiracy and inciting riots'. As a result of the defeat of the strike, there was a 10% reduction in wages, the <b>working</b> <b>week</b> went back up to 48 hours and contract mining continued. The defeat of this and other strikes of the 1890s, the maritime dispute and the shearers' strike, have been seen as the cause of the creation and electoral support for the Australian Labor Party. Not all historians accept this thesis with some doubting the simple causal relationship between the strike and the formation of the Labor party.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{financial}} crisis and rise of fascism, the bonds between IFTU and the Labour and Socialist International were strengthened.

The appeal was signed by 14 million people.|$|E

The shortfall in terms of wages earned would be made up through reform in the social welfare system; specifically, by the implementation of a universal basic income.|$|E
25|$|He {{is thought}} to have coined the term, Sunday neurosis. The term refers to a form of anxiety {{resulting}} from an awareness in some people of the emptiness of their lives once the <b>working</b> <b>week</b> is over. Some complain of a void and a vague discontent. This arises from an existential vacuum, or feeling of meaninglessness, which is a common phenomenon and is characterised by the subjective state of boredom, apathy, and emptiness. One feels cynical, lacks direction, and questions the point of most of life's activities. (see noogenic neurosis).|$|E
