5|$|I went to New York and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{studio and}} came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} of the teenage movie. Teenage reality. So we said here’s what’s {{going to be}} weird about the world of our movie: No one’s {{going to be over}} 30. The world is a high school, essentially. And Tom Cody will be the football hero. And Willem Dafoe is the greaser. Remember: You had John Hughes at the time, and then you had Coppola making two high school movies: The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. So Walter said we’re going to make a high school movie that’s also going to be a comic book and also going to be a musical.|$|E

500|$|The next night, rioting again {{surrounded}} Christopher Street; participants remember differently which {{night was}} more frantic or violent. Many {{of the same}} people returned from the previous evening—hustlers, street youths, and [...] "queens"—but they were joined by [...] "police provocateurs", curious bystanders, and even tourists. Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: [...] "From going to places where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets." ...|$|E
500|$|Work on {{the album}} was {{interrupted}} by the recording of [...] "Spectre", which Radiohead wrote for the James Bond film of the same name.

We stopped doing {{what we were doing}} and had to concentrate on that for a while since we were told it was something that was going to come to fruition ...

500|$|Lucinda Dalton was {{the fourth}} wife of Charles Wakeman Dalton, and {{they were married in}} 1868. Lucinda resented the {{expectation}} that she be meek and obedient in her marriage. Charles assured her that husbands have obligations to their wives as wives do to their husbands. She {{came to the conclusion that}} she should marry Charles because of a spiritual witness they experienced together: [...] "I felt that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of the hosts of heaven; and a direct incontrovertible testimony was given me that it was the will of God and not my will that I should accept this man for my yokefellow." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wannabe" [...] was {{completed}} in thirty minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a [...] "sudden creative frenzy." [...] During the session, Brown and Bunton {{came up with the}} idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio and it all came together in this song." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie himself remembered {{almost nothing}} of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, [...] "I know it was in LA because I've read it was". The singer {{was not alone in}} his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, [...] "if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke... the coke use is driven by the inspiration." [...] Like Bowie, Earl Slick had {{somewhat}} vague memories of the recording: [...] "That album's a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons! <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio and it was nuts—a lot of hours, a lot of late nights." ...|$|E

500|$|The believability of the song's lyrics, which conveys love testaments {{as well as}} its {{timeless}} endurance, sung on sensual vocal arrangements by Beyoncé, who additionally {{adopts a}} sneering attitude, demonstrates her alter ego Sasha Fierce. Lyrically, [...] "Radio" [...] explores the relationship between Beyoncé as the female protagonist and the songs played on the radio, shown in the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that Papa allowed in my room with the door closed / We'd be alone / And Mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom / 'Cause she knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zone". Amy Linden of Vibe magazine felt that [...] "Radio" [...] could make an ideal [...] "valentine" [...] song because of its lyrical content.|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, {{emerged in}} part as a {{reaction}} against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition". The leading Britpop bands, [...] "Blur and Oasis exist as reactionary forces to [...] eternal downcast glare." [...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I felt like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." ...|$|E

Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to say, but I appreciate the fact at least to some degree that something like this was made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Bu Thiam, Def Jam Vice-President of A, {{was with}} West and Jay-Z {{throughout}} the recording process and saw how the duo {{came up with}} several of the Watch the Throne tracks.

500|$|Several {{breaking}} {{practitioners and}} pioneers tend {{to side with}} the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira. B-boy Crazy Legs states: [...] "We didn't know what the f-ck no capoeira was, man. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ghetto!" [...] According to Pabon, [...] "Unlike the popularity of the martial arts films, capoeira was not seen in the Bronx jams until the 1990s. Top rockin' seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally, leaving space for growth and new additions, until it evolved into a codified form." [...] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: [...] "Despite of [...] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance." [...] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: [...] "In '78 I started [...] and I didn't see it [...] til '92 ... I was around, too—I was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, I went around and I didn't see it. What we saw was Kung Fu—we saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... when we did the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it up and we put this B-boy flavor into it..." ...|$|E

500|$|Flight 367 {{departed}} from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30p.m., {{where it was}} taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. [...] "As it was late, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight." [...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her [...] stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during World War II and was able to keep her alive until rescuers arrived at the scene.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
