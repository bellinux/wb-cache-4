About 73% {{of the population was}} living in poverty <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck. Hurricane Mitch set back the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they had improved throughout the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two were <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the south-southwest, which was the strongest ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average wind speed of 45mph (72km/h), along with a wind gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak wind speed) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E

A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Morgan City and Intracoastal City. When forecasts indicated a landfall {{east of the}} state, the hurricane watch was canceled and the hurricane warning amended to a tropical storm warning. By September29, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 1953, {{an unusually}} {{long-lasting}} upper-level low persisted across Mexico and Central America. On May 25, a weak warm-core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua. It {{moved around the}} upper-level low, bringing it to the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America. The system weakened over land, but it re-intensified over the western Caribbean Sea, moving over western Cuba as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm on May 31.

5|$|On September29, {{shortly after}} Keith formed, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Yucatán peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and {{a tropical storm}} warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Dean formed, the {{government}} of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> weakened and ultimately dissipated, the warnings were canceled. The remnants of Dean produced unsettled conditions across Bermuda, including a wind gust of 41mph (66km/h) and light rainfall of 0.31inches (8mm). The passage of Dean resulted in the coldest day of August 2001 on the island. Dean produced wind gusts peaking at 63mph (103km/h) in Newfoundland, along with rainfall up to 4.2inches (107mm) in eastern Newfoundland. On land, wave heights reached 30feet (9.3m), while a buoy offshore reported a peak wave height of 47feet (14.4m).|$|E
5|$|The system {{developed}} on January13 between the Philippines and Guam. Moving west-northwest for its duration, Mekkhala passed north of Yap State on January14 while slowly intensifying due to moderate wind shear. Conditions became more favorable on January16, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> quickly strengthened to peak winds {{of at least}} 110km/h (70mph); a ragged eye prompted the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to upgrade it to a typhoon. The storm weakened slightly and made landfall on the Philippine island of Samar on January17. Mekkhala weakened further over land, dissipating on January21 east of Luzon.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{declaration}} of Tropical Storm Erika on September1, tropical storm watches were issued for St. Maarten, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Martin and Saint Barthélemy. The following day, all of the watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings as Erika neared the Lesser Antilles. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> entered the Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm warning was issued for Dominica and tropical storm watches were for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Early on September3, the tropical storm watches were upgraded to warnings as Erika drifted through the eastern Caribbean. Later that day, the warnings for Dominica and Guadeloupe were discontinued. Shortly thereafter, all remaining warnings were canceled.|$|E
5|$|Well {{in advance}} of Vera's landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} ahead of the typhoon occurred across the Tōkai region of Japan starting on September23, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> reached peak intensity over open waters. In Nagoya, rainfall totals reached 10cm (4in). In {{other parts of the}} Tōkai region, nearly 20cm (8in) of rain was reported. The precipitation caused flooding along several river basins in the swath of rain. Steady rainfall occurred throughout Vera's passage of Honshu, though the worst of the rain-induced flooding occurred well after the typhoon's initial landfall. In Kawakami, Nara, a landslide killed 60people after crushing 12homes.|$|E
5|$|When {{the motion}} of Juliette turned to the northeast, some {{computer}} models predicted it to continue northeastward and strike Baja California Sur. As a result, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch as a precautionary measure for portions of the state. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> weakened rapidly and turned from the coast, the watch was canceled. Juliette remained away from land masses for its lifetime, {{and as a result}} there were no reports of damage or deaths. In southern California, however, the hurricane produced high waves that created dangerous surfing conditions. These waves wiped out a fishing derby. The remnants of Hurricane Juliette moved into New Mexico and western Texas, producing scattered showers and thunderstorms.|$|E

5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{turned the}} cyclone to the southeast, and Francesca quickly developed a well-defined eye. It rapidly strengthened into an intense tropical cyclone, and reached peak winds of 185km/h (115mph) on February4, according to MFR. The JTWC estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 215km/h (135mph) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was located about 1065km (660mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. Shortly after peaking, Francesca began weakening, losing its eye, until being a minimal tropical cyclone on February7. That day, it re-intensified slightly and redeveloped an eye, {{although it was}} short-lived. Increasing shear again weakened Francesca, and on February9 the cyclone deteriorated to a tropical storm. Cooler waters caused further weakening, which diminished convection over the center. On February11, Francesca became extratropical, and the remnants turned to the southwest, dissipating on February14.|$|E
5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day.

High winds and waves damaged ports in Pass Christian and Long Beach. Several boats were damaged along the coast, and the seafood industry suffered losses. Beach erosion damaged coastal roads, leaving debris and marsh grass behind <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> passed. The total storm cost in the state was estimated at $776,000. In neighboring Alabama, Juan only produced wind gusts of , which caused little damage, but the storm's rainfall contributed to Mobile recording its wettest October on record. The rains caused flooding along streets and low-lying areas, but property generally escaped unscathed. The flooding did cause locally heavy crop damage; some farmers lost 50% of their soybean crop, and the pecan crop was damaged after earlier being affected by Hurricane Elena.
