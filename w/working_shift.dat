40|$|Background People {{with type}} 1 {{diabetes}} may find diabetic control more difficult when <b>working</b> <b>shifts.</b> Aims To investigate the proportion of people with {{type 1 diabetes}} in employment undertaking shift work and diabetic control as assessed by glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) among individuals undertak-ing shift work compared to those not doing so. Methods A postal questionnaire sent to all those aged 16 – 65 attending two city hospitals for type 1 diabetes care. HbA 1 c results {{were used to assess}} diabetic control. Results Twenty-two per cent (296 of 1370 eligible patients) responded. Sixty-seven (23 %) respondents were involved in shift work. Shift workers had higher mean HbA 1 c values than non-shift workers (9. 02 versus 8. 35; P <  0. 01). Conclusions Poorer control of diabetes was associated with <b>working</b> <b>shifts</b> in this study.

5000|$|Watt {{determined}} that a pony could lift an average 220 lbf kN 100 ft per minute over a four-hour <b>working</b> <b>shift.</b> [...] Watt then judged a horse was 50% more powerful than a pony and thus arrived at the 33,000 ft·lbf/min figure. Engineering in History recounts that John Smeaton initially estimated that a horse could produce 22,916 foot-pounds (31,070 N·m) per minute. John Desaguliers had previously suggested 44,000 foot-pounds (59,656 N·m) per minute and Tredgold 27,500 foot-pounds (37,285 N·m) per minute. [...] "Watt found by experiment in 1782 that a 'brewery horse' could produce 32,400 foot-pounds N·m per minute."

40|$|Background Associations between {{shift work}} (SW) schedules, mental {{distress}} and job satisfaction {{have never been}} completely described. Aims To examine gender-specific associations of SW with mental distress and job satisfaction in nurses in Hebron District, Palestine, in 2012. Methods Detailed information on work schedules (day versus shift), socio-demographic status, mental distress (General Health Questionnaire, GHQ- 30) and job satisfaction (Generic Job Satisfaction Scale) in nurses employed in Hebron District, Palestine, was obtained through a questionnaire survey. Associations of SW and outcomes were examined by linear regression analysis. Results Of 372 nurses eligible for the study, 309 and 338 completed surveys regarding mental distress and job satisfaction, respectively. The sample comprised 62 % women and 38 % men. After adjusting for covariates, women <b>working</b> <b>shifts</b> reported {{significantly higher levels of}} mean mental distress [β coefficient 3. 6; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 3 – 7. 0] compared with women <b>working</b> regular day <b>shifts.</b> Men <b>working</b> <b>shifts</b> reported significantly lower levels of job satisfaction (– 3. 3; 95 % CI – 6. 2 to – 0. 5) than men <b>working</b> regular day <b>shifts.</b> Women reported higher levels of mental distress than men, but this was unrelated to work schedule. Conclusions In this study, nurses <b>working</b> <b>shifts</b> reported higher levels of mental distress and lower levels of job satisfaction, although these associations were weaker when adjusted for potential covariates.

5000|$|In the 1920s the GWR {{began to}} examine the cost base of rural branch lines; in 1925 {{receipts}} on the line were £22,609 against costs of £7,587. A GWR report recommended closure of the passenger service and limiting the branch activity to handling goods during a single <b>working</b> <b>shift,</b> and heavily reducing facilities on the line. The report was not acted on, and conversely a new halt, Coldharbour, was opened in January 1929. Later in 1929 it was agreed to spend money improving facilities on the branch, and in particular making it fit for standard rolling stock. The original loading gauge had been somewhat limited. However [...] "main line" [...] coaching stock was never used, and the imperative for {{this may have been}} the foreseen introduction of six-wheel milk tank wagons, then being trialled elsewhere on the GWR. These were introduced on the branch in 1932. The tanks were glass-lined and cork-insulated; the Dairy Company owned the tank and the GWR owned the underframe and running gear.|$|E
50|$|Bulgarian {{legislation}} {{provides for}} the possibility for different duration of working time - normal working hours, longer working hours, shorter working hours and part-time work. The normal working hours is determined in Art. 136 of the Labour Code: the standard working day is eight hours long and the work week - 40 hours. This is also the maximum period allowed under the applicable law. In accordance with Art. 136a of the Labour Code extended working hours shifts can be established in the company given that the production process requires it and provided that the legal limitations are met.

40|$|Objectives: To see {{if there}} is any change in blood {{concentrations}} of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and fibrinogen during a <b>working</b> <b>shift</b> in tunnel construction workers. Methods: 12 Tunnel construction workers were followed up during a 24 hours period after returning from a 9 day work free period. The first blood sample was taken on Monday afternoon before starting the shift. Another was taken around midnight after 8 hours of work, and another the next afternoon after about 12 hours of rest. Exposure to respirable dust was measured by personal samplers. Results: The exposure of the workers to respirable dust, in terms of an 8 hour time weighted average, varied between 0. 3 and 1. 9 mg/m 3. For IL- 6, there was an increase in the median serum concentra-tion from 1. 14 ng/l before starting the shift to 4. 86 ng/l after 8 hours of work (p= 0. 002). For fibrino-gen, there was an increase in the median concentration from 3. 40 g/l before entering the shift to 3. 70 g/l 24 hours later (p= 0. 044). There was a positive correlation between values of IL- 6 {{at the end of the}} <b>working</b> <b>shift</b> and the fibrinogen concentrations the next afternoon (Pearson’s R= 0. 73, p= 0. 007). The observed increase in IL- 6 was significant for both smokers and non-smokers.

40|$|Lung {{function}} {{was measured by}} spirometry in 66 workers in a sisal ropemaking factory, and in their matched controls. The major atmospheric contaminant was the lubricant (or a component part thereof) used to soften the fibre. The concentration of airborne matter was generally less than 1 mug m [...] 3. There {{was no difference in}} lung function between the two groups {{before the start of the}} <b>working</b> <b>shift,</b> that is, the mixture of softening lubricant and sisal caused no long-term effects. Although there was no change in lung function over the <b>working</b> <b>shift</b> in the group making sisal rope, the control group did show a significant increase in lung function over the same period. This suggests that an effect attributable to the lubricant and sisal dust did exist. In previous studies little mention has been made of the softeners used in the processing of sisal fibre. These additives may exert a significant effect on ventilatory capacity and may act in conjunction with sisal dust...|$|E

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess whether salivary human {{herpesvirus}} (HHV) - 6 acted as a new sensitive stress marker, providing a reliable indicator of stress among shift work nurses. Salivary HHV- 6, immunoglobulin (Ig) A and mood states were compared among nurses who worked day shifts only and nurses who worked different numbers of night shifts. MethodsParticipants included 56 female nurses working in Japanese general hospitals. The 56 subjects were categorized into three groups: Group A (n = 7), which consisted of nurses who only worked day shifts; group B (n = 29), which consisted of nurses <b>working</b> <b>shifts</b> with £ 8 night shifts per month; and group C (n = 20), which consisted of nurses <b>working</b> <b>shifts</b> with 3 9 night shifts per month. Mood was assessed using the Profile of Mood States Short Form Japanese version (POMS-SFJ). Salivary biomarker levels and mood were compared among the three groups. ResultsAlthough the salivary HHV- 6 level was significantly higher in group C than in group A (p <. 05), salivary IgA and mood levels were not significantly different among the three groups. ConclusionSalivary HHV- 6 level may be a more sensitive stress marker than salivary IgA or mood for assessing chronic fatigue in nurses <b>working</b> <b>shifts.</b> Improvement to shift assignments using assessment by salivary HHV- 6 is required...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the modeling {{problem for the}} human-operator functional activity. Productivity is selected as the main indicator of his function during the <b>working</b> <b>shift.</b> The problem is solved {{in the class of}} additive interval piecewise polynomial time views. Real labor productivity of human-operator is suggested to be formed by three interrelated processes: warming-up, tiredness and functionality restoration. Recreational interval for restoration {{during the first half of}} the <b>working</b> <b>shift</b> after cumulative tiredness over the first half-shift is considered by the authors as a system-related factor. The model takes into account: interval character of the human-operator individual properties. This gives the possibility to describe more fully and adequately the functional activity of the human-operator. Piecewise polynomial representation made it possible to describe adequately his performance, without complex approximation representations that accumulate errors of final grades for the human-operator performance. Obtained interval additive piecewise polynomial time operation model of human operator activity in the quasi-static environment has given the possibility to analyze and predict functional measures for performance management of human-operator functional activity in manufacturing static environment...|$|E
