It {{has been tested}} on phenol as a model refractory compound. At 30 MPa and 250 °C, <b>wet</b> air <b>oxidation</b> batch experiments led to a phenol degradation of 97 % and a total organic carbon removal of 84 %. This total organic carbon was mainly due to acetic acid. To study the interest of coupling processes, <b>wet</b> air <b>oxidation</b> effluent was treated in a biological treatment process.

After biological treatment, phenol and total organic carbon removal was 99 and 97 % respectively. Thanks to parameters from literature, previous studies (kinetic and thermodynamic) and experimental data from this work (hydrodynamic parameters and biomass characteristics), both treatment steps were modelled. This modelling allows the simulation of the coupling process.

50|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{oxidation}}: dry oxidation and <b>wet</b> <b>oxidation.</b> During dry oxidation, dry oxygen is {{introduced into the}} process tube where it reacts with silicon. Dry oxidation is a slow process that grows films at a rate between 140 and 250 Ǻ/hour. It is typically only used to grow thin oxides (<1000 Å).During <b>wet</b> <b>oxidation,</b> water vapor is introduced into the heated oxidation tube. Because water molecules form hydroxyl structures, they diffuse faster in silicon dioxide and the oxide growth rate increases. The <b>wet</b> <b>oxidation</b> growth rate is 1000 to 1200 Ǻ/hour, so <b>wet</b> <b>oxidation</b> is the preferred method to grow thick oxides.

A model was obtained for each response with multiple regression analysis and then was refined. Analysis of variance revealed that the models developed were adequate. The validity of the models was also verified by experimental data. Analysis of response surface showed that total organic carbon removal and Isophorone conversion were significantly affected (P <= 0. 01) by reaction time, temperature and their interactions, and affected (P <= 0. 05) by the square of reaction time. The point of zero charge of Ru/TiZrO 4 catalyst was about 1. 72. The total organic carbon removal and Isophorone conversion had a great association with the zeta potential of Ru/TiZrO 4 catalyst. Finally, the degradation pathway of Isophorone in catalytic <b>wet</b> air <b>oxidation</b> was proposed. Within 410 h, the total organic carbon removal remained above 95 %, indicating that the Ru/TiZrO 4 catalyst had a good stability. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
