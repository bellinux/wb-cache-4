Currently it is highly competitive or end-user of metal workings fluid to reduce cost and improve productivity.

This study investigates the flank wear behavior of coated Titanium Carbonitride (TiCN) coated tools in dry and <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> of T 6061 Aluminum alloy with the aim of obtaining the optimum cutting speed for dry and <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> respectively. By using specific depths of cut 0. 2 and 0. 6 mm with feed rates of 0. 4 and 0. 8 mm/rev respectively, the wear was investigated for 3 different high cutting speeds; 290, 360 and 446 mm/min.

However, {{the life of}} a cutting tool for machining sintered steel is generally much shorter than for carbon steel and thus, finish machining increases the manufacturing cost of sintered products. For this reason, wear characteristics of several grades of cutting tools in turning sintered steel were investigated under different lubrication conditions. As a result, it is found that a P 10 grade of cermet and an S 01 grade of AlTiN coated carbide are recommended for dry machining. When cutting fluid is necessary for chip control and disposal, air jet assisted <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> with a K 10 uncoated cemented carbide and <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> with a P 10 cermet are recommended.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for energy saving {{are presented in}} this paper for turning and milling TiAl 6 V 4 workpieces. The major outcome of the cutting trials with the internally cooled turning tool is that the tool wear under dry cutting conditions is in between dry and <b>wet</b> <b>machining,</b> whereas the combination of the internally cooled turning tool with <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> leads to strongly increased tool lifetimes. In contrast to this, the energy demand under dry cutting conditions is much lower than under wet cutting conditions. With respect to the environmental protection, the best tool cooling is dry cutting combined with the internally cooled tool. To achieve higher productivity rates or increased tool lifetimes, the combination of <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> and the internally cooled turning tool is the best solution. In comparison to conventional milling, the average effective power consumption of the machine tool under trochoidal cutting conditions is increased by 6 %. Nevertheless, the amount of used energy is decreased by 15 % and the process time is reduced by 35 %. The reasons for this are higher material removal rates, {{due to the fact that}} the cutting time per edge and revolution can be reduced to a minimum. The heat-up phase and the cutting temperatures are small. By increasing the cutting parameters, e. g. cutting speed or feed, it is possible to improve the material removal rate. This enables a higher energy productivity and lower process time. The milling tool was used for both milling strategies.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThe {{metal cutting}} process, known as {{conventional}} machining process, utilizes cutting fluids to provide lubrication, cooling and easy chip removal. The {{long-term effects of}} cutting fluids disposal into the environment are becoming increasingly evident. Research has also proven the health hazards on manufacturing workers who come {{in direct contact with}} cutting fluids. The formulation of stringent rules and restrictions on use and disposal of cutting fluids has increased the cost associated with cutting fluids use to between 7 % and 17 % of total manufacturing cost. The dry machining process considered in this thesis, using diamond-coated tools for the machining of aluminum eliminates cutting fluids from the cutting process.

40|$|Materials {{which are}} both lighter and {{stronger}} have faced an increased demand {{over the past}} decades to fulfil the requirements {{across a range of}} industrial applications. More specifically, demands for titanium alloys have increased significantly due to its high strength to weight ratio which is particularly attractive for increasing fuel efficiency in aircrafts and cars and is also used in biomedical implants. Despite the increasing demand for titanium made products, machining titanium alloys remains a significant challenge. High material strength and hardness lead to excessive heat generation at the cutting zone which accumulates and results in high cutting temperatures due to the poor thermal conductivity. The high cutting temperatures together with inherent material properties of titanium are responsible for short tool life and poor surface finish. Despite the environmental and health drawbacks, a generous amount of cutting fluids is commonly used to control the cutting temperature in machining titanium alloys. However, conventional cutting fluids evaporate at high cutting temperatures which isolate the cutting zone by forming a vapour cushion resulting in further increases in cutting temperatures. This research investigates the effects of cryogenic cooling on machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy in CNC milling as compared to conventional dry and <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> environments. Two literature reviews were conducted and a methodology has been developed and implemented consisting of three experimental stages of i) design and manufacture of a cryogenic cooling system, ii) comparative study of cryogenic cooling with dry and <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> and iii) optimisation of cutting parameters for cryogenic machining. The major contribution of this research can be summarised as design, realisation and assessment of a novel cryogenic cooling system for CNC milling, termed cryogenic shower, which is retrofitable to an existing CNC machining centre.

40|$|Nowadays {{industries}} {{desire to}} obtain parts with better accuracy (dimensional and form) and surface finish at low cost. These factors (accuracy, cost and productivity) {{are used to}} evaluate the performance of machining processes. When material removal rate increases, the higher tool temperature is anticipated and therefore, better cooling is required. To reduce the heat effects on cutting tools and therefore improve the life, an efficient and cost effective application of the cutting fluid is required. Also, to cope with environmental and occupational safety issues, new cooling and lubricating methods such as minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and minimum quantity cooling (MQC) have been proposed. The use of near dry or minimum quantity cooling lubrication (MQCL) considerably decreases cutting fluid consumption as compared to conventional flood cooling and it increases the machinability when compared with dry machining. The surface roughness, heat generation in cutting tool, generated dust and aerosol emission can be known as machining quality index which are highly influenced by cutting conditions. The presented research work investigates the effects of lubrication mode (dry, wet and MQC) and cutting conditions (feed rate, cutting speed, air and liquid flow rates) on surface roughness, cutting tool temperature, aerosol and dust emission during turning of aluminum alloy 6061 -T 6.

Topographical, mechanical, metallurgical, chemical and thermal changes happen in the surface and sub-surface layer of material during machining which influences the functional performance of component. The study focuses on the effect of coating and cooling technique on surface integrity during machining of Nimonic C- 263. Surface and sub-surface alteration such as surface damages, grain refinement, microstructural alteration, white layer and work-hardened layer during machining was examined using Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X ray diffraction (XRD) system, XRD texture measurement and micro hardness tester. The effect of cutting speed and feed rate on surface integrity under these environments also has been analysed. The research demonstrated significant improvement in surface integrity with the use of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and flood environment during machining at low and medium cutting condition. High tool wear of uncoated tool and less cooling and lubricating efficiency of MQL and flood together deteriorate surface integrity at high cutting speed and feed. The PVD multilayer coated tool even under dry machining condition has given comparable result and sometimes even better than <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> with uncoated tool. Surface damages in the form of micro cracks, voids, grooves, cavity and material transfer mainly observed in the surface. Deformed zones were intrinsic for all process conditions whereas their intensity and thickness increases with increases in tool wear and cutting parameter. The increase of feed rate had more influence on the plastic deformation. Overall it can be recommended that dry machining can be more beneficial than <b>wet</b> <b>machining</b> when PVD multilayer coated tool vii used under high cutting speed and feed. This is particularly important for higher productivity in sustainable manner...|$|R
