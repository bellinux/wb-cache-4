500|$|The first interracial kiss on {{television}} {{is a much}} debated topic concerning who the first two persons of different races to kiss {{on television}} were. For a time, it was understood to have occurred during an episode of the British soap opera Emergency– Ward 10 in 1964. However, in November 2015, a Granada Play of the <b>Week,</b> <b>You</b> in Your Small Corner, was uncovered which was broadcast in June 1962; that quickly led to the rediscovery of another play featuring the same young Jamaican actor, Hot Summer Night, televised in Britain on 1 February 1959. The first interracial kiss on U.S. television was broadcast in a 1960 episode of Adventures in Paradise, [...] "Makaha Surfing", also known as [...] "The Big Surf", between star Gardner McKay and Filipina Pilar Seurat. Competing claims have also been made in favour of I Love Lucy.|$|E
500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each <b>week,</b> <b>you</b> know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E
500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} <b>week</b> <b>you</b> might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E

500|$|The episode's main antagonist, {{the field}} mushroom, {{was met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics, with a few detractors. Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the [...] "giant underground mushroom thingie" [...] among the [...] "best" [...] monster-of-the-week, describing it as [...] "too crafty to end up on a pizza". Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! Voices named [...] "The Giant Mushroom" [...] as one of [...] "The Best X-Files Monsters of the Week", writing, [...] "In the X-Files episode Field Trip things are simply not what they seem. [...] But when I claim that a giant mushroom {{is one of the}} most memorable X-Files monsters of the <b>week,</b> <b>you</b> can bet I'm being serious". Not all reviews were so positive. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the mushroom one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "Mulder and Scully conquer this mycological nightmare by jointly fighting it during a drug trip — some real astral plane shit, brah. Love the 1990s CGI".|$|E
500|$|Lawrence {{had not yet}} {{discovered}} that she was dying from liver cancer, and her weakened condition was exacerbated by the demands of her role. At the age of 52, she was required to wear dresses weighing [...] while walking or dancing a total of [...] during a 3½ hour performance eight times a week. Lawrence {{found it hard to}} bear the heat in the theatre during the summer months. Understudy Constance Carpenter began replacing her in matinee performances. Later in the year Lawrence's strength returned, and she resumed her full schedule, but by Christmas she was battling pleurisy and suffering from exhaustion. She entered the hospital for a full week of tests. Just nine months before her death, the cancer still was not detected. In February 1952, bronchitis felled her for another week, and her husband Richard Aldrich asked Rodgers and Hammerstein if they would consider closing the show for Easter week to give her a chance to recover fully. They denied his request, but agreed to replace her with the original Ado Annie from Oklahoma!, Celeste Holm, for six weeks during the summer. Meanwhile, Lawrence's performances were deteriorating, prompting audiences to become audibly restive. Rodgers and Hammerstein prepared a letter, never delivered, advising her that [...] "eight times a <b>week</b> <b>you</b> are losing the respect of 1,500people". In late August, Lawrence fainted following a matinee and was admitted to the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. She slipped into a coma and died on September 6, 1952, aged 54. Her autopsy revealed liver cancer. On the day of her funeral, the performance of The King and I was cancelled. The lights of Broadway and the West End were dimmed; she was buried in the ball gown she wore during Act 2.|$|E
500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every <b>week,</b> <b>you</b> stop trusting your instincts, because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts and go with what has worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E

2500|$|In 1945, the pocketbook The Atomic Age heralded the {{untapped}} atomic {{power in}} everyday objects and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused. One science writer, David Dietz, wrote {{that instead of}} filling the gas tank of your car {{two or three times}} a <b>week,</b> <b>you</b> will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill. Glenn T. Seaborg, who chaired the Atomic Energy Commission, wrote [...] "there will be nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles, nuclear powered artificial hearts, plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers, and much more".|$|E
2500|$|Despite heavy {{lobbying}} {{in favor}} {{of one of the}} existing projects, it soon became apparent that private industry could not turn out a car for only 990 RM. [...] Thus, Hitler chose to sponsor an all-new, state-owned factory using Ferdinand Porsche's design (with some of Hitler's design constraints, including an air-cooled engine so nothing could freeze). The intention was that ordinary Germans would buy the car by means of a savings scheme (""– [...] "Five marks a <b>week</b> <b>you</b> must put aside, if you want to drive your own car"), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into. However, the entire project was financially unsound, and only the Nazi party made it possible to provide funding.|$|E
2500|$|Billboard critics commented {{at the end}} of the year, [...] "twenty years ago, a {{conscious}} rap record wouldn't have penetrated the mainstream in the way Kendrick Lamar did with To Pimp A Butterfly. His sense of timing is impeccable. In the midst of rampant cases of police brutality and racial tension across America, he spews raw, aggressive bars while possibly cutting a rug," [...] while Pitchfork editors noted it [...] "forced critics to think deeply about music. It's an album by the greatest rapper of his generation." [...] Producer Tony Visconti stated David Bowie's album Blackstar (2016) was influenced by Lamar's work, [...] "we were listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar [...] we loved the fact Kendrick was so open-minded and he didn't do a straight-up hip-hop record. He threw everything on there, and that's exactly what we wanted to do." [...] Visconti also stated this about Lamar while talking about [...] "rule-breakers" [...] in music. “His album ‘To Pimp A Butterfly’ broke every rule in the book and he had a number one album glued to the top of the charts. You’d think certain labels would learn form that. But they take somebody who is out there and say, ‘That’s what people want.’ No, people want that for one <b>week.</b> <b>You</b> don’t want the same song every single day of your life.”Lamar won five Grammys at the 58th ceremony, including Best Rap Album for To Pimp a Butterfly. Other nominations included Album of the Year and Song of the Year. At the ceremony, Lamar performed a medley of [...] "The Blacker the Berry" [...] and [...] "Alright". It was ranked by Rolling Stone and Billboard as the best moment of the night, with the latter writing [...] "It was easily one of the best live TV performances in history." ...|$|E
