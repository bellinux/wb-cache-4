25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the <b>way</b> <b>my</b> throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

He prefers to employ a 4–3–3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not going to change the <b>way</b> <b>my</b> teams play, the systems. I've not even had a thought about that".|$|E

During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt {{that her husband was}} vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that [...] "Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That's the <b>way</b> <b>my</b> husband is." ...|$|E

500|$|Tyler {{attended}} the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, {{before returning to}} New York City with her mother at age 12. She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked about the way she spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the <b>way</b> <b>my</b> life has gone." ...|$|E
500|$|Idol was keen {{to share}} his ideas {{regarding}} the future of Cyberculture {{and its impact on}} the music industry, and was noted for his enthusiastic speculation in the future of computers throughout the promotion of the album. [...] "You're using very sort of extreme and raw ideas, but with very high level technology... it's probably whats going to be happeningor in fact, it is what is happening nowbecause that's how we made this album, Cyberpunk." [...] Some of the predictions Idol made for the future of the internet, computers, and musicians, was that it would allow for cheap and efficient recording from home; that musicians could record their music and send it to producers and fellow band members from great distances, perhaps while on tour; and that musicians would be able to directly communicate with their fans and critics. Idol also hoped that the rapid ability to do whatever he desired with the production would allow raw forms of rock music to remain relevant after the Grunge movement swept America in the early 90s. [...] " [...] can do anything... If you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a <b>way</b> <b>my</b> sort of answer to grunge. I know there's a way of using this modern technology to bring a lot of rawness back." ...|$|E

[...] She performed the song as she opened for Rascal Flatts on several dates, from October 19 to November 3, 2006, included on the Me and My Gang Tour (2006–07). Swift performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the concert's penultimate performance. She dressed in a black, knee-length dress and red cowboy boots with a design of a skull and cross bones across it, playing an acoustic guitar. Swift requested for the audience to raise their cell phones in order to simulate a sky filled with stars, when the song reached the lyrics [...] "He said the <b>way</b> <b>my</b> blue eyes shined / Put those Georgia stars to shame that night / I said that's a lie." [...] She also performed the song when she served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's 2007 United States tour, and selected dates for Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour in 2007. During mid-2007, Swift engaged as the opening act on several dates for Tim McGraw's and Faith Hill's joint tour, Soul2Soul II Tour (2006–07), where she again performed [...] "Tim McGraw". Swift performed the song while she was again opening for Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want that to be the <b>way</b> <b>my</b> record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site {{were not going to be}} included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E

The campaign was marred by allegations that Householder's staff had improperly tried to obtain Niehaus's withdrawal from the race and that Householder had told Niehaus's supporters to donate money to Schmidt's campaign. In the initial count of the Republican primary vote on March 2, 2004, she led by just 62 votes. A recount was automatically ordered, which reversed the outcome. Schmidt ultimately lost by just 22 votes: 17,076 (49.9%) to Niehaus's 17,098 (50%). She told The Cincinnati Enquirer on election night [...] "This is the <b>way</b> <b>my</b> whole life has been—one tough race after another." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Action Reports of {{the patrol}} {{were met with}} {{positive}} reviews, General Abrams formally approved the operation. The success of the operation was more valuable than just {{the destruction of the}} enemy, because it allowed Colonel Barrow to request that continued operations in Laos be approved.

Barrow noted, [...] "I put a final comment on my message, which said, quote, [...] "Put another <b>way,</b> <b>my</b> forces should not be here if ground interdiction of Route 922 not authorized." [...] The message finally reached General Abrams via General Stilwell, who had adopted the Colonel's recommendation.

Lake's track [...] "From the Beginning", released on Trilogy in 1972, had no particular source of inspiration; [...] "I just felt an inspiration to do it, and it flowed through me in a natural <b>way.</b> <b>My</b> hands fell upon these very unusual chords...
