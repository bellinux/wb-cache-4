25|$|A notable {{concern is}} that despite {{a great deal of}} rhetoric, there is no real {{consistent}} behavioral theory yet. Behavioral economics scholars also have no unified theory. Until that happens, it is a collection of loosely related or unrelated observations. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> is a foundational behavioral theory that can be tested in many domains as a competitor to neoclassical theory.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{pigments}} reflect {{light in}} a very specific way that cannot be precisely duplicated by the discrete light emitters in a computer display. However, by making careful measurements of pigments, close approximations can be made. The Munsell Color System provides a good conceptual explanation of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>missing.</b> Munsell devised a system that provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions: hue, value (or lightness), and chroma. Computer displays in general are unable to show the true chroma of many pigments, but the hue and lightness can be reproduced with relative accuracy. However, when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value, the hue is also systematically biased.|$|E

Tracy discovers many EGOT-ers have been composers and aspires to write the most popular song of all time. The [...] "EGOT" [...] necklace originally belonged to Philip Michael Thomas of Miami Vice. After failing to combine five popular musical styles into one song, he seeks help from Whoopi Goldberg, an EGOT title holder. Tracy sings his song to Angie and she is so moved she agrees to have another child.|$|E
500|$|Sumit Bhattacharya of Rediff gave {{a rating}} of 2.5 out of 5, saying that [...] "Rockstar is {{what is called a}} {{one-time}} watch", and highlighted that the film [...] "is more Devdas than Jim Morrison". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV too gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, and said [...] "Rockstar has a Sufi soul. If only it had been set free and allowed to go the whole hog!" [...] Komal Nahta of Koimoi again gave the film 2.5 out of 5, and said, [...] "Rockstar will meet with a mixed response: one section of the audience (mainly youngsters in the cities) will love it while another section (mainly the single-screen audience and public of smaller cities) will find it ordinary." [...] Kaveree Bamzai of India Today gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and said [...] "AR Rahman's music is the soul of the film. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> is the spine, leaving just a jelly in place." [...] Yahoo! gave the film 1 star out of 5, and said [...] "Rockstar drives home an unscientific hypothesis that people who’ve endured sufferings/heart break etc will reach their creative best."

500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

2500|$|Result: Both {{teams had}} many suggestions; in Atomic, Lewis came up a seaside-based game {{where they had}} to stop seagulls eating food, Hayley {{came up with a}} looking-after-horse game, and Lizzie came up with a puzzle game where they had to stare at a room for a few seconds and find <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>missing.</b> Atomic were {{originally}} going to go for the puzzle game, but James came up with an office-based game, and despite the market research finding that more people would play the puzzle game, James decided to stick with the office game, calling it [...] "Crazy Cabinet". In Kinetic, the team decided to do a game with an animal in it. (Mahamad wanted a zombie game, {{but the rest of the}} team disagreed.) Haya came up with the character of a pig (since she was a vegetarian), which the rest of the team agreed. Along with the pig, they created an evil butcher, calling their game [...] "Piggy Panic". The next day, the teams launched their viral ads in front of Lord Sugar and an audience of gaming experts. Both teams gave both good viral ads and presentations and the experts were impressed. In the boardroom, Lord Sugar thought James's game was better placed for future add-on revenue, though also believed that Zara's game had more merchandising potential.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of pre-existence {{within the}} poem {{contains}} {{only a limited}} theological component, and Wordsworth later believed that the concept was [...] "far too shadowy a notion to be recommended to faith." [...] In 1989, Gene Ruoff argued that the idea was connected to Christian theology in that the Christian theorist Origen adopted the belief and relied {{on it in the}} development of Christian doctrine. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> in Origen's platonic system is Wordsworth's emphasis on childhood, which could be found in the beliefs of the Cambridge Platonists and their works, including Henry Vaughan's [...] "The Retreate". Even if the idea is not Christian, it still cannot be said that the poem lacks a theological component because the poem incorporates spiritual images of natural scenes found in childhood. Among those natural scenes, the narrator includes a Hebrew prayer-like praise of God for the restoration of the soul to the body in the morning and the attributing of God's blessing to the various animals he sees. What concerns the narrator is that he is not being renewed like the animals and he is fearful over what he is missing. This is similar to a fear that is provided at the beginning of The Prelude and in Tintern Abbey. As for the understanding of the soul contained within the poem, Wordsworth is more than Platonic in that he holds an Augustinian concept of mercy that leads to the progress of the soul. Wordsworth differs from Augustine in that Wordsworth seeks in the poem to separate himself from the theory of solipsism, the belief that nothing exists outside of the mind. The soul, over time, exists in a world filled with the sublime before moving to the natural world, and the man moves from an egocentric world to a world with nature and then to a world with mankind. This system links nature with a renewal of the self.|$|E
