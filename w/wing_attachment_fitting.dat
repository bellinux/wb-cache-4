This removed {{much of the}} cadmium plating, leading to in-service superficial rusting of some bolt ends and nuts. The OEM and chemical manufacturer became concerned about possible {{hydrogen embrittlement}} of the bolts owing to exposure to the paint stripper. The OEM recommended tensile and stress durability hydrogen embrittlement testing {{of some of the}} bolts before continuing to fly with the rest.

A tubular collet having flexible finger projecting from its forward end is arranged in the fastener body to be shifted forwardly by an elongated expander member coaxially arranged within the tubular collet for advancing the collet fingers into the opening in the <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting.</b> Biasing means are arranged between the elongated expander member and a rotatable actuator which is threadedly mounted within the tubular collet {{so as to be}} rotated for urging the expander member into engagement with the collet fingers. A first coupling member is arranged on the rotatable actuator to be accessible from outside of the fastener so that a second coupling member on the distal end of a flexible shaft can be introduced into the fastener body and coupled to the first coupling member to enable a typical actuating tool coupled to the shaft outside of the fastener body to be operated for advancing the outwardly-enlarged ends of the collet fingers into the opening in the <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting</b> and thereafter rotating the actuator member to expand the fingers to that <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting.</b> Upon expansion of the collet fingers, the biasing means impose a biasing force on the expander to releasably retain the fingers in their latching positions...|$|R
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting.</b> This meant that the pylon <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting</b> had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R

40|$|An {{aluminum}} platform {{serves as}} a storage shelf for experiments transported on the space shuttle. This platform {{is attached to the}} shuttle storage area through several supports, each consisting of an <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting,</b> a monoball bearing, a clevis pin and a support strut.

The overall conductance of the monoball bearing was determined by an experimental method of heating the outer ring with a nichrome resistance wire and cooling the inner ball with propylene glycol. Temperature differences across the bearing were measured for various heat fluxes. The overall conductance is 0. 42 Watts/C (0. 80 BTU/hr F), This yields a 16 watt loss for a 38 C temperature difference across the bearing...|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the steel}} {{guardrail}} and the steel guard pipe, the GHG emissions {{of the steel}} guard pipe were 127  % of the GHG emissions of the steel guardrail, which was significantly higher. There are two likely reasons for this. First, the guard pipe has a narrower support post spacing (3  m), and therefore uses {{a larger number of}} support posts with an attendant increase in the emissions associated with the raw material procurement and production of support posts, as well as their construction. Second, the guard pipe is installed in three tiers of beams, which increases the number of <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings.</b> While the GHG emissions from raw material procurement and production of <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings</b> for the steel guardrail were 1.36  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, the equivalent emissions for the steel guard pipe were 6.00  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{teardown}} {{and inspection}} of aircraft, which have completed a significant period of service, {{is a central}} requirement of many Aircraft Structural Integrity Management Plans (ASIMP). The reasons for this include a need to inspect for the potential onset of wide spread fatigue damage and {{to assess the impact}} of corrosion and in-service mechanical damage. Furthermore, service life data from fleet aircraft are required to confirm laboratory fatigue test results and substantiate the assumptions made during safe-life calculations or probabilistic risk and reliability studies. A teardown and inspection of the fracture critical F/A- 18 <b>wing</b> <b>attachment</b> bulkheads (or centre barrel- CB) has been initiated to achieve these goals for the RAAF’s F/A- 18 fleet. Use is being made of ex-service CBs supplied from the Canadian Forces and U. S. Navy (USN) CB replacement programs. Investigations suggest that the largest “likely ” cracks in the critical bulkheads will be less than 1 mm deep at the time a CB is replaced. Since the detectable crack depth threshold for current NDI (using high frequency eddy current (HFEC) detection) is 1. 0 mm or greater, these cracks may not be found. To significantly improve the probability of detecting cracks that are below the lower threshold of NDI, an increase in their size by accelerated fatigue testing of the CBs has been implemented. Cyclic loads (using the mini-FALSTAFF spectrum) are applied to the <b>wing</b> <b>attachment</b> lugs of ex-service CBs in a test rig t...|$|R
