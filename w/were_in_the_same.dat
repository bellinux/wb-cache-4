5|$|In the past, rivalries also {{emerged with}} Severnside rivals Cardiff City {{known as the}} Severnside derby. Rovers most recent meeting against Cardiff was a League Cup match on 11 August 2016, which Rovers won 1–0 with Chris lines scoring the winner. The last time Cardiff and Bristol Rovers <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> league was in the 1999–2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Another of Margate's rivals is Dover Athletic. Despite meeting {{rarely in}} {{competitive}} games over recent years, both teams {{were in the}} Conference in the 2001–02 season. In that season, the last season the two teams <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> division, the two games between Margate and Dover were watched by a combined total of over 6,000 spectators. The game played at Margate's Hartsdown Park stadium drew a crowd of 3,676, and 2,325 were in attendance for the game at Dover's Crabble stadium.|$|E
5|$|During its brief history, the AAFC, {{who would}} merge into the NFL for the 1950 season, used an {{identical}} playoff format to the NFL from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 (its last year), the AAFC would merge its two conferences {{when one of}} its teams folded, and use a four-team playoff system. In 1948, the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into play when the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record; they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conference as the 14–0 Cleveland Browns, who {{would go on to}} win the Western Conference and then the AAFC's championship game against the 7–7 Buffalo Bills (AAFC).|$|E

5|$|Historically, Albion's {{greatest}} rivals {{have always}} been Aston Villa from nearby Birmingham. The two clubs contested three FA Cup Finals between 1887 and 1895 (Villa winning two and Albion one). More recently, however, most Albion fans have begun to see Wolverhampton Wanderers as their main rivals, particularly between 1989 and 2002, when Albion and Villa were never in the same division but Albion <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons. With Albion and Villa being in different divisions for so many years, however, the rivalry became less heated and Aston Villa supporters now consider Birmingham City as their main local rivals and not Albion despite geographical distance between the two clubs. A less-heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final, {{as well as a}} semi-final in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Standish {{called all}} of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The {{following}} day, several natives including the local chief, Pecksuot, were at Wessagusset. Historical sources give different accounts of the killings. In some manner, four of the natives, including the local chief, <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> room as Standish {{and several of his}} men. One source, from the 1880s, suggests that it was the natives that arranged to be alone with Standish to allow them to attack the colonist. Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives into the situation on peaceful pretenses. When four of them, including the local chief, were in a room within the village, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other natives in the village were attacked next; only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native's head was cut off, to be displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2013, La Sombra {{defeated}} Volador Jr. {{to win the}} 2013 Reyes del Aire tournament. Following their clash {{over the}} Reyes del Aire trophy Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament, defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya Jr. and Negro Casas, La Máscara and Averno, and Shocker and Mr. Niebla {{to qualify for the}} finals of the tournament. On March 15, at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Altantis and Último Guerrero to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles. The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the next time the two rivals <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ring. On February 17, 2013 La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and Místico II against Volador Jr., Euforia and Último Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, La Sombra and Volador Jr. defeated Atlantis and Último Guerrero in a Relevos Suicidas match and thus advanced to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas against each other. In the end, La Sombra was victorious, forcing his rival to unmask.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, 2012, Volador Jr. {{formed the}} Los Depredadores del Aire ("The Predators of the Air") group {{alongside}} Black Warrior and Mr. Águila. Two days later, Los Depredadores del Aire defeated Los Reyes de la Atlantida (Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr.) {{to win the}} Mexican National Trios Championship. For July 29, Volador Jr. traveled to Tokyo, Japan, {{in an attempt to}} regain the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship from Prince Devitt, but would eventually fail in his title challenge. The following month, Volador Jr. started a rivalry with Mr. Niebla, for which he was positioned as a tecnico even though still being a part of rudo stable Los Invasores. On October 30, Los Depredadores del Aire lost the Mexican National Trios Championship back to Los Reyes de la Atlantida. On January 22, 2013, Volador Jr. survived a torneo cibernetico to advance to a final match for the vacant CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against the other survivor, Rey Escorpión. On January 29, Volador Jr. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Escorpión. Following their clash over the Reyes del Aire trophy, Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya, Jr. and Negro Casas, La Máscara and Averno and finally Shocker and Mr. Niebla to qualify for the finals of the tournament.
