5|$|The {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> {{a decisive}} Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command {{and the birth}} of heroic tales in Israel. However, Syria made a small territorial gain and certain actions were criticized within Israel, such as the retreat from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] <b>is</b> sometimes <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> both sweet and salty. It <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated sodium-ion receptor.|$|R

5|$|DragonFly {{originally}} {{used the}} FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but {{starting with the}} 1.4 release switched to NetBSD's pkgsrc system, which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a way of lessening {{the amount of work}} needed for third-party software availability. Eventually, maintaining compatibility with pkgsrc proved to require more effort than was initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{elections}} of 1970, Tydings faced criticism from both parties for his actions as senator. In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left stemmed from his support of a crime bill for the District of Columbia, which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at the bill for writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E
5|$|Solidifying his {{reputation}} as a hard-driving and assertive leader, Shoup rose through the senior leadership of the Marine Corps, overhauling fiscal affairs, logistics, and recruit training. He was selected as commandant by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and later served in the administration of John F. Kennedy. He reformed the Corps, emphasizing combat readiness and fiscal efficiency, against what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> politicking among its officers.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, a 2010 study {{published}} in the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication indicated that Asian Americans <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> most likely to be nerds, followed by White Americans, while non-White Hispanics and Black Americans <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> least likely to be nerds. These stereotypes stem from concepts of Orientalism and Primitivism, as discussed in Ron Eglash's essay Race, Sex, and Nerds: From Black Geeks to Asian American Hipsters. Among Whites, Jews <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the most nerdy and are stereotyped in similar ways to Asians.|$|R

5|$|Around this time, {{tensions}} {{began to}} arise between what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, {{identified with a}} left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge of SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> serious.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1939, Orizaba was {{chartered}} to United States Lines {{as one of}} five ships {{added to}} increase what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a slow rate of return of US citizens fleeing war-torn Europe.

5|$|Infuriated by what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> {{yet another}} affront to British {{prestige}} after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, {{members of the}} British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait {{in spite of the}} Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss of rights to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E

In 1901, he represented Russia at the funeral of Queen Victoria and was given the Order of the Bath. The following year he was made a Knight of the Garter in King Edward VII's coronation honours. In June 1902, Michael transferred to the Blue Cuirassier Regiment and moved to Gatchina, where the regiment was based. Since coming of age, Michael had assumed financial independence. His assets included the largest sugar refinery in the country, capital amounting to millions of roubles, a collection of motor vehicles, and country estates at Otrovo in Russian Poland and Brasovo near Orel.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular {{commerce}} began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians.
