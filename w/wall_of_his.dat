5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head against the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E
5|$|Rabi {{suggested}} to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven {{might be a}} model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science {{as a way of}} inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home office.|$|E
5|$|When Giuliano della Rovere {{was elected}} Pope Julius II in 1503, {{he issued a}} bull annulling any papal {{election}} brought about by simony, and defrocking and excommunicating any cardinal who sold his vote. Although the twenty-six day reign of Pope Pius III intervened between Alexander VI and Julius II, the alleged unscrupulousness of the Borgia pope was still firmly in the institutional memory of the Roman Curia. While Cardinal {{during the reign of}} Alexander VI, Julius II had been assailed politically and often militarily outside the sturdy <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Castle of Ostia.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E
5|$|After some time, the king's {{designated}} successor, Andriambonimena, {{launched a}} retaliatory {{attack against the}} prince's half-brother Andrianentoarivo at Ambohipotsy and successfully chased him from his fief. Andriantomponimerina {{recognized the need to}} take more dramatic action to consolidate his grip on power and sent a messenger to the Sakalava king requesting his support. The Sakalava reaffirmed their loyalty to Andriamasinavalona, however, and threatened to attack the prince if the rightful king was not released from his captivity. According to one version of the oral history, having failed to use the king as a pawn to gain power, the prince decided to ransom his father for 7,000 piastres to increase his personal wealth. Every citizen of Imerina was obligated to contribute, and those who had no money sold their children or themselves into slavery in order to raise the necessary funds. The money was placed in seven baskets and transported by dugout canoe to the prince at Ambohidratrimo, who released the king. According to another version of the story, Prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana of Ambohimanga sent two hunters of the Tsimahafotsy clan to free the king by digging an escape passage under the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heavily guarded enclosure. After returning to Antananarivo, Andriamasinavalona sent a messenger who announced that the king had decided to hand power to Andriantomponimerina and invited the prince to the capital to be enthroned. The prince hurried to the palace, and throughout the city he was greeted with cheers, singing and dancing. When Andriamasinavalona received him, however, he publicly condemned the prince and stripped him of his rank and power.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 {{the family}} {{returned}} to San Francisco.

Shortly afterward, he completed his first mural commission, for the Palo Alto Medical Clinic in Palo Alto (where {{he had been a}} patient) in August of 1932. The unveiling of this mural caused a traffic jam and some controversy, in part because the mural showed a doctor examining a female patient whose bare breasts were at eye-level. Like his other works in the Bay Area, the murals were frescoes.|$|E

25|$|The same year, Duchamp also {{attended}} {{a performance of}} a stage adaptation of Raymond Roussel's 1910 novel, Impressions d'Afrique which featured plots that turned in on themselves, word play, surrealistic sets and humanoid machines. He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Work on The Large Glass continued into 1913, with his invention of inventing a repertoire of forms. He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas on the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apartment.|$|E
25|$|On May 2, 1843, Gay {{voted with}} the {{prevailing}} {{party at the}} last of the Champoeg Meetings. The 52-50 vote established the Provisional Government of Oregon that would last until the Oregon Territory's government superseded it in 1849. Gay’s home would serve as one of the markers of the boundaries within the government. The south <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house marked the boundary line between the Yamhill and Champooick districts, and though the house is no longer standing, the location of that wall currently marks the line between Yamhill and Polk counties. In 1848, he went south to the California Gold Rush and mined for a time before returning to Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Wes Craven {{began writing}} A Nightmare on Elm Street's {{screenplay}} around 1981, {{after he had}} finished production on Swamp Thing (1982). He pitched it to several studios, but {{each one of them}} rejected it for different reasons. The first studio to show interest was Walt Disney Productions, although they wanted Craven to tone down the content to make it suitable for children and pre-teens. Craven declined. Another early suitor was Paramount Pictures; however the studios passed on the project due to A Nightmare on Elm Streets similarity to Dreamscape (1984), a film they were producing at the time. Universal Studios also passed; Craven, who was in desperate personal and financial straits during this period, later framed their rejection letter on the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> office.|$|E

25|$|Roger Mortimer of Wigmore was a {{powerful}} Marcher lord, married to the wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, {{and the father of}} twelve children. Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323, making a hole in the stone <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice {{to get down to the}} River Thames, across the river and then on eventually to safety in France. Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella might have helped Mortimer escape and some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E
