5|$|Since its premiere, 2001: A Space Odyssey {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and interpreted by professional film critics, amateur writers and science fiction fans, {{virtually all of}} whom have mentioned its deliberate ambiguity. Questions about 2001 range from uncertainty about its deeper philosophical implications about humanity's origins and final destiny in the universe, to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes such as the meaning of the monolith, or the final fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in the greed and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} transformative force, leads people to understand and respect nature which is portrayed as welcoming, spiritual, and restorative for those who enter it peacefully.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit on the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes {{and patterns of}} lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface {{and returns to the}} baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E

25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson's {{theory on}} <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> {{democracy}} {{is rooted in}} their prior game theoretic work, including a paper in The American Economic Review, titled A Theory of Political Transition. This paper models mathematically the reasons for oscillations between non-democracy and democracy based {{on the history of}} democratization of Western Europe and Latin America. The paper emphasizes the roles of the threat of revolution and social unrest in leading to democratization and of the desires of the elites to limit economic redistribution in causing switches to nondemocratic regime.|$|E

McNutt criticized Nellie Bertram, noting that, despite the character's potential, the show [...] "places her into the series as a blind antagonist without any sense of <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> her to these actions." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times argued that the producers of The Office seemed to be using her only because British people are ridiculous and are completely different to Americans. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics, on the other hand, praised Catherine Tate's acting and her character, writing, [...] "Tate's first appearance last season was intriguing, and her stint as head honcho down in Florida was entertaining, but in [...] "Get the Girl" [...] {{it became obvious that}} Nellie Bertram as branch manager could be exactly what The Office needs to stay afloat." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Chevelle {{entered a}} studio in Nashville, Tennessee with {{producer}} Brian Virtue. Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "We {{have spent a lot}} of time making these songs something different from past records without losing the core of our passion. We are a hard rock, melodic band and it's still <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> us as musicians." [...] The new album, titled Sci-Fi Crimes was released on August 31, 2009, peaking at No.6 on the Billboard 200 album chart with sales of about 46,000, the highest entry onto the chart to date for the band., The album was praised by Jared Johnson of Allmusic for taking a step in a new direction in regards to the lyrics. Pete Loeffler normally wrote lyrics about personal subjects, however on Sci-Fi Crimes, he wrote of stories including apparitions, conspiracy theories, and erratic sleeping conditions. The tour following the release of Sci-Fi Crimes was in the Fall of 2009. Opening for Chevelle on this tour was Halestorm, Adelitas Way, and After Midnight Project.|$|E
500|$|Miličević {{explained}} that when making music {{his passion for}} the creative process is <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> his works and allows to constantly reinvent his style. Rod Lockwood from The Blade described his work as [...] "propulsive and energetic, with a big, anthemic sound that draws on U2, The Cure, and classic rock for its aural infrastructure". Artistdirect complimented the [...] "beautifully complex guitars" [...] featured on the album A Beautiful Lie. A writer from the Chicago Music Guide commended the [...] "imaginative effects" [...] on This Is War, while Guitar Edge stated that the guitar work on the album is [...] "in a class of its own", noticing [...] "rich atmospheres" [...] and [...] "masterful guitar tone". Miličević experimented with different instruments and drew influences from a varied range of styles in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. In addition to the guitar and violin, Miličević is also a fluent player of bass instruments, keyboards and percussion, and supplies backing vocals during concerts.|$|E
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> you." ...|$|E

500|$|Present-day {{reviews from}} critics, however, are mostly positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that [...] "none {{of the girls}} have great voices, but they do exude {{personality}} and charisma, which is <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> bouncy dance-pop like 'Wannabe,' with its ridiculous 'zig-a-zig-ahhh' hook, into pure pop guilty pleasure." [...] Dan Cairns of The Sunday Times said that the song [...] "leaves a bad taste in the mouth: [...] the true legacy of Girl Power is, arguably, a preteen clothing industry selling crop tops and other minimal garments to young girls," [...] but added that it [...] "remains the same two minutes and 53 seconds of pop perfection that it ever was." [...] In a review of their Greatest Hits album, IGN said that after ten years it [...] "still sound reasonably fresh," [...] while Digital Spy's Nick Levine said that [...] "Wannabe" [...] still remained an [...] "exuberant calling card."

500|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. Based on 85 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} a [...] "Rotten" [...] rating from critics, with 19% positive reviews and an average rating of 3.7 out of 10. The site's consensus reads [...] "The inevitable Fatal Attraction comparisons aside, Obsessed is a generic, toothless thriller both instantly predictable and instantly forgettable." [...] Another review aggreatator, Metacritic, gave the film a weighted mean score of 25 out of 100, based on ten reviews from mainstream critics. A common complaint about the film was that, unlike most [...] "deranged stalker"-themed films, Obsessed did not explain why Lisa was so determined to seduce Derek, who showed no interest in her at all. Variety John Anderson and The Hollywood Reporter Kirk Honeycutt criticized Lisa's lack of motive and backstory. Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy called the film predictable and blamed the well-defined morality of the characters. She wrote, [...] "Unlike the bunny-boiling '80s classic Fatal Attraction, the characters are drawn in 2D. They are either good or bad, and {{there is absolutely no}} attempt to understand <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> them either way." [...] Liz Braun from Jam! lambasted the lack of character development in Obsessed and called it [...] "a chemistry-free movie". Jason McKiernan of Filmcritic.com described the film as [...] "so steeped in the formula of the psycho-sexual suspense flick that it works as both a thriller and a comedy" [...] and [...] "very good trash".|$|E
500|$|... "Adrift" [...] was {{produced}} {{as part of}} its own production block: block seven. Filming of the episode was [...] "double banked" [...] with block five, which consisted of the episodes [...] "From Out of the Rain" [...] and [...] "Fragments". This accounted for the lack of availability of some of the regular cast members. Unlike the rest of the episodes in the series, this episode was not solely produced by regular series Richard Stokes but by guest producer Sophie Fante. Discussing the premise of the story writer Chris Chibnall states that [...] "the issue of loss" [...] is <b>what</b> <b>drives</b> the narrative and that he had [...] "always wanted to write a story about people who go missing". Director Mark Everest noted that [...] "people go missing all the time" [...] and that to tackle this theme was [...] "a brave thing to do". Executive producer Russell T Davies felt it provided good drama to have a story that would also examine elements of [...] "paranoia" [...] and [...] "fear" [...] and [...] "mistrust" [...] between Gwen and Jack as result of her realising she does not know the full extent of his work within Torchwood. Davies later stated in his book The Writer's Tale that [...] "Adrift" [...] was one of the scripts that [...] "paved the way" [...] for the third series of the show; his intention being to write Torchwood characters as [...] "real people" [...] with [...] "families, feuds, aches and pains". The episode underwent less rewriting than any other script from the first two series with the final version being essentially a second draft. Gwen was initially referred to by her husband's surname, Williams, but Eve Myles vetoed this idea as she believed that an independent professional woman would want to keep her maiden name. A change made in the editing of the episode was the cutting of a short scene hinting at a possible romance between Nikki and Andy. This scene is included in the deleted scenes included in the series two boxset.|$|E
