60|$|And {{the next}} moment <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that room and in the cab and moving quick.|$|R
60|$|Within a {{few minutes}} afterwards, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the canal, and in the Ohio river again.|$|R
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. Well, I {{think you}} might at least drop them until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> mourning.|$|R
60|$|He glanced {{round to}} make sure <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> earshot, then sunk his voice to a whisper.|$|R
60|$|She looked round cautiously. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{plantation}} now, {{in the open}} park, where eavesdropping was impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!' I commenced, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house. 'You are not {{dreaming of}} it, are you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} a strategist," [...] Forrest remarked grimly. [...] "Do as she says, Cecil. The sooner <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this, the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Into the bedchamber of the Lady Letitia Mandeleys!" [...] {{he proclaimed}} triumphantly. [...] "Keep your voice low, boy. Remember <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> doors." ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Turning on him, sarcastically.] I'm glad someone's feeling good. [Wearily.] Gee, I sure wish <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this dump {{and back}} in New York.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Makarooroo, quick march, and don't draw rein till {{we reach}} the cave," [...] said Jack when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of the canoe.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{the night}} began to shut in, however, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, and Darius {{said as we}} hauled in the drags for the last time: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear papa and all, good-bye. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{sight of}} land. Three years, and keep {{up a good}} heart. I shall soon be all right.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{sight of}} land {{without a single}} {{celestial}} body to guide us! Even the pendent world was not visible from our position! ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain {{dropped his}} gun upon the ground. [...] "Miss Markham!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Mrs. Cliff! I truly believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all danger--that we--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that!" [...] Mr. Hethcote said, as {{the fire}} ceased and the boats headed for a light hung up to direct then.|$|R
6000|$|A certain added {{brightness}} {{came into}} Ann's face. [...] "Nobody won't {{be able to}} come leaving cards on us, Artie, now, any more. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that!" ...|$|R
60|$|Turning as {{he spoke}} and making an easy way for us, he stopped when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the press in a corner behind a great red curtain.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{live or die}} {{together}} this day," [...] said he; [...] "keep but fast hold till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the press, and then my horse is yours." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} {{him from the}} room, and when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing on the stoep inquired what he thought. I {{did not like the}} look of that leg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank goodness, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that at last!" [...] exclaimed Matt, as {{the road}} finally {{appeared}} in sight. [...] "Now {{to see if any}} damage has been done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let us hurrah until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the woods," [...] added Dick soberly. [...] "We are in {{the hands}} of a desperate gang, to my way of reasoning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the woods}} or not," [...] said {{the owner of}} the launch. [...] "Where there is one bob cat there are often more." ...|$|R
6000|$|These words {{caused the}} Englishman to glance back apprehensively, and hurry on faster than ever. [...] "It's a beastly woods," [...] he said. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall ask no {{questions}} till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the harbour, {{or you will}} be running foul {{of one of those}} colliers--a tribute with which the Fair Unknown may dispense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing, but <b>we</b> {{saw them}} at it, {{and walked up}} and down till Lance got tired out, and Willie and I stayed to make it proper.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Let me {{take you}} to Winks and Pinks,” she said as soon as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the building: “they’ve got such lovely shades of blotting-paper—pearl and {{heliotrope}} and momie and crushed—” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do? I'd rather take my chances on the Sally, even if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of land, than stay here another minute. This brig has got ghosts aboard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] he replied. [...] "If the Abati go anywhere, it's to hell, {{where they}} haven't {{whitewashed}} walls and four-post beds. Oliver, wake up. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that cave, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ugh! I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this!" [...] muttered Matt, as {{he tried}} in vain to pierce the gloom ahead. [...] "You must find the road, Billy, for I can't see it----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{less than}} an hour they'll have force enough to do as they please. It's time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this; you go home to tell Joe, and I'll see Mr. Wright if possible." ...|$|R
5000|$|Virgin Forest is a {{collection}} of twelve related essays about how we think about and treat nature. The collection was published by the University of Georgia Press, and is loosely tied together by a theme: the importance of history to an ecological understanding. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in nature, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> also <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in time, and the two kinds of exile are related." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{acknowledged}} that he understood what this meant, by a very unprofessional choice of words. [...] "We are in a mess," [...] he began, [...] "and the sooner <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it the better." ...|$|R
60|$|I put up {{the tiller}} and eased the sheet, and the salmon boat ran off five or six points. Big Alec watched us till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range, when he {{returned}} to his work.|$|R
6000|$|Arthur <b>was</b> silent till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing. Then {{he said to}} himself, almost inaudibly, [...] "Where two {{or three}} are {{gathered}} together in my name, there am I {{in the midst of}} them." ...|$|R
60|$|TIM. Well, I see {{you have}} a mind to go a-fooling too; but take heed in time, and <b>be</b> wise. While <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> danger, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> out; but when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the cave}} {{in one way}} but not in another,” {{observed}} Dave, as {{he stood on the}} dry rocks and gazed about. “It’s going to be a stiff climb to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here.” ...|$|R
