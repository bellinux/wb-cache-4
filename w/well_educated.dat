5|$|Spending on Edward's {{personal}} household {{increased as}} he grew older, and in 1293 William of Blyborough took over as its administrator. Edward was probably given a religious education by the Dominican friars, whom his mother invited into his household in 1290. He was assigned one of his grandmother's followers, Guy Ferre, as his magister, {{who was responsible for}} his discipline, training him in riding and military skills. It is uncertain how <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> Edward was; there is little evidence for his ability to read and write, although his mother was keen that her other children were <b>well</b> <b>educated,</b> and Ferre was himself a relatively learned man for the period. Edward likely mainly spoke Anglo-Norman French in his daily life, in addition to some English and possibly Latin.|$|E
5|$|Sources make {{no mention}} of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's {{knowledge}} of the Bible, so Augustine was evidently <b>well</b> <b>educated.</b> Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews {{as well as being}} pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial {{government}} {{wanted to}} reform the church and appointed a series of <b>well</b> <b>educated,</b> reforming bishops.

Boys at the orphanage would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. This was so the boys were <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers {{when they left the}} orphanage.|$|E
5|$|Canberrans are {{relatively}} young, highly mobile, and <b>well</b> <b>educated.</b> The median age is 35 years, and only 12.7% {{of the population}} is aged over 65 years.

5|$|During the 11th century, {{political}} rivalries divided {{members of}} the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> and eligible for state service.|$|E
5|$|Haynes married Bertha Lanterman in October 1887 after {{a ten-year}} relationship. The {{ceremony}} {{was held at}} her parents' Portland home and the couple honeymooned in Cincinnati. Their first child, Marie, was born on January 28, 1889, but she soon succumbed to illness and died when six months old. Their second child, a son born in 1890, also died in infancy. The deaths saddened the family and caused them to turn more to their religion. Haynes became increasingly active in the Presbyterian church and became an elder. In December 1892, the Haynes' third child, Bernice, was born. A second son, March, was born 1896. The two children were <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> and grew up to assist their father in his enterprises.|$|E
5|$|Hosius {{brought to}} Poland the Jesuits and founded for them a college in Braniewo in 1564.

Jesuit priests were carefully selected, <b>well</b> <b>educated,</b> of both noble and urban origins. They had soon become highly influential with the royal court, while working hard within all segments of the society. The Jesuit educational programs and Counter-Reformation propaganda utilized many innovative media techniques, often custom-tailored for a particular audience on hand, as well as time-tried methods of humanist instruction. Preacher Piotr Skarga and Bible translator Jakub Wujek count among prominent Jesuit personalities.|$|E

5|$|In the original, 7th-century charter {{recording}} this grant, Reculver {{is referred}} to as a civitas, or city, but this is probably a reference to either its Roman past or the church's monastic status, rather than a large population centre. In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald was elected Archbishop of Canterbury, from which position he probably offered Reculver patronage and support. Bede, writing no more than 40 years later, described Berhtwald as having been <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs, but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be <b>well</b> <b>educated,</b> quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become <b>well</b> <b>educated.</b> Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students could choose to enroll in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E

Both of his parents were <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E
5|$|Plans for Arthur's {{marriage}} began {{before his}} third birthday; he was installed as Prince of Wales two years later.

At the age of eleven, Arthur was formally betrothed to Catherine of Aragon, a daughter of the powerful Catholic Monarchs in Spain, {{in an effort to}} forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France. Arthur was <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> and, contrary to some modern belief, was in good health for the majority of his life. Soon after his marriage to Catherine in 1501, the couple took up residence at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire, where Arthur died six months later of an unknown ailment.

5|$|When he took vows as a cleric is unrecorded, but Nigel held a prebend, an ecclesiastical {{office in}} the cathedral, in the see of London before holding one of the offices of archdeacon in the diocese of Salisbury, {{although}} which archdeaconry he held is unclear. Most modern historians believe that Nigel was brother to Alexander of Lincoln, later Bishop of Lincoln, but this relationship is not specifically attested in the sources, which merely state that both were Roger's nephews. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, considered both Alexander and Nigel to be <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> and diligent. Nigel attended the consecration of Bernard as Bishop of St David's at Westminster in 1115, and may have returned to England from Laon by 1112.

5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, <b>well</b> <b>educated,</b> successful, and if anything, of higher social standing.

5|$|Japan {{is one of}} the top-performing OECD {{countries}} in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The Japanese populace is <b>well</b> <b>educated</b> and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.|$|E
