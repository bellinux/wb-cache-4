500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E

It is {{a summary of}} the singer's personal experience of fame, exemplifying the thoughts in lines like [...] "I got exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for [...] Running, rushing back for more [...] And now I find, I've changed my mind". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna noted the track ended with the line [...] "This is my religion", indicating the spiritual thoughts and themes present in Ray of Light. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , the lyrics touched upon Madonna's own desire for fame and how it ultimately ruined her personal relationships, thereby [...] " [...] the tone for the album". Madonna explained in an interview with Q in 1998 that the lyrics showed her ambivalence towards fame and love. At one hand {{she did not want to}} denounce fame from her life, but on the other hand understood its negative and materialistic aspects.|$|E

The president approached Webb later and asked him, [...] "How's your boy?", referring to Webb's son, a Marine serving in Iraq.
