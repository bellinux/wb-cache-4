5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse from last year and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon {{made it clear that}} he would do whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E
5|$|When {{writing for}} Vince the writers blanked {{out all of}} the {{characters}} swearing like it is done on the show, {{but when it came to}} recording the programme the swear words had to be put in for Kaye to read them. During read-throughs of the scripts, a toy horn was honked whenever Kaye swore to give an idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> sound like during the programme.|$|E
5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Over twenty skulls {{have been}} found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, {{elaborate}} bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} {{to create the}} racing modes of the game had been present {{from the start of}} the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. The game did not start out as a Mario series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide on incorporating Mario series characters into the game until two or three months after the start of development. The choice was made after the development team, when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> look like with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah Mr. Sapsea!” exclaimed {{the young}} man. “Disguise from you is impossible. You know already that I come from somewhere, and am going somewhere else. If I was to deny <b>it,</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> avail me?” ...|$|R

25|$|Martin Winter {{says that}} the idea that many commentaries about the {{widespread}} use of Greek myths throughout Western culture {{does not take into account}} the vast difference between what a modern viewer takes from the story and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have meant to an ancient Greek.|$|E
25|$|The main {{elements}} {{that have been}} used are television replays, technology that tracks the path of the ball and predicts <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have done, microphones to detect small sounds made as the ball hits bat or pad, and infra-red imaging to detect temperature changes as the ball hits bat or pad.|$|E

25|$|Dirty Politics was {{released}} at Unity Books in Wellington on 13 August 2014, with {{a crowd of}} approximately 150. Prior {{to the release of}} the book, details of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be about were the subject of substantial speculation, as the topic of the book was kept secret in order to avoid it being blocked from release by a court injunction.|$|E
25|$|Dennett {{finds that}} many people find it {{difficult}} to see this, so he uses the case of RoboMary to further illustrate <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like for Mary to possess such a vast knowledge of the physical workings of the human brain and color vision. RoboMary is an intelligent robot who, instead of the ordinary color camera-eyes, has a software lock such that she is only able to perceive black and white and shades in-between.|$|E
25|$|A {{slightly}} different {{edition of the}} fragment of the Thalia from De Synodis is given by G.C. Stead, and served {{as the basis for}} a translation by R.P.C. Hanson. Stead argued that the Thalia was written in anapestic meter, and edited the fragment to show <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> look like in anapests with different line breaks. Hanson based his translation of this fragment directly on Stead's text. Here is Stead's edition with Hanson's translation.|$|E

25|$|For positronium, {{the formula}} uses the reduced mass also, {{but in this}} case, it is exactly the {{electron}} mass divided by 2. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is half <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be for a single electron moving around a heavy nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The civil {{authorities}} were often asked to accumulate information, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be used for; in August 1940 {{a list of}} aliens showed 407 in Guernsey. In October 1940, they produced {{a list of all}} German, Austrian and Italian people. A census was held of all civilians in August 1941. In September 1941, the census was used to make a lists of all British-born people. This list identified people for deportation to camps in Germany in 1942 and 1943.|$|E
25|$|Shoji {{lives with}} a bar hostess, {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be like to}} have a child with her and whether the child would grow up as a Napoleon or Hitler. Their apartment is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill it because it is pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place. When Shoji visits her bar, he tells her that none of the rat's six babies came out like Hitler, and leaves her.|$|E
