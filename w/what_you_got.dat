500|$|Often {{credited}} with using fighting and intimidation as a tactic, Shero never coached players to fight. He valued team toughness {{and insisted that}} players take the body and follow through with their checks. When it came to fighting Shero {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I swear I have never told a player to attack another player. In fact, I have told my players if they ever hear me saying something like this, they can break a stick over my skull. I ask only that they play aggressively." [...] In an interview in the HBO documentary Broad Street Bullies Shero states that he had a team that liked fighting so he let them fight. Demonstrating his personal coaching philosophy that [...] "You have to learn to win with <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> or you don't win at all." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Job" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur. It was {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis, who had, around the same time, directed The Office actor John Krasinski in the 2007 film License to Wed. Script reading for the episode took place on a beach during the filming of the season's twenty-third episode, [...] "Beach Games". Actress Kate Flannery remarked that [...] "we were so excited that we almost had another hot dog eating contest. Not. It's a great script. Lots of questions answered. Lots. The Office fans have been anxiously awaiting a one-hour episode, and guess <b>what?</b> <b>You</b> <b>got</b> it." [...] The original cut of the episode was an hour and twelve minutes long, {{and had to be}} edited down to forty-two minutes of screentime. It was the second Office episode to fill the entire hour timeslot; the first was the third-season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas".|$|E

500|$|Hendrix toured {{with the}} Isleys {{during much of}} 1964, but {{near the end of}} October, after growing tired of playing the same set every night, he left the band. Soon afterward, Hendrix joined Little Richard's touring band, the Upsetters. During a stop in Los Angeles in February 1965, he {{recorded}} his first and only single with Richard, [...] "I Don't Know <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> (But It's Got Me)", written by Don Covay and released by Vee-Jay Records. Richard's popularity was waning at the time, and the single peaked at number 92, where it remained for one week before dropping off the chart. Hendrix met singer Rosa Lee Brooks while staying at the Wilcox Hotel in Hollywood, and she invited him to participate in a recording session for her single, which included the Arthur Lee penned [...] "My Diary" [...] as the A-side, and [...] "Utee" [...] as the B-side. Hendrix played guitar on both tracks, which also included background vocals by Lee. The single failed to chart, but Hendrix and Lee began a friendship that lasted several years; Hendrix later became an ardent supporter of Lee's band, Love.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the study of}} memory recall was Endel Tulving's proposition of two kinds of memory: episodic and semantic. Tulving described episodic memory as a memory about a specific event that occurred at a particular time and place, for example <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> for your 10th birthday. Semantic memories are abstract words, concepts, and rules stored in long-term memory. [...] Furthermore, Endel Tulving devised the encoding specificity principle in 1983, which explains the importance of the relation between the encoding of information and then recalling that information. To explain further, the encoding specificity principle means that a person is more likely to recall information if the recall cues match or are similar to the encoding cues.|$|E

2500|$|While {{posing as}} Pan Am First Officer [...] "Robert Black", Abagnale forged a Harvard University law transcript, passed the Louisiana bar exam, {{and got a}} job at the Louisiana State Attorney General's office at the age of nineteen. He told a flight {{attendant}} he had briefly dated that he was also a Harvard Law School student, and she introduced him to a lawyer friend. Abagnale was told the bar needed more lawyers and was offered a chance to apply. After making a fake transcript from Harvard, he prepared himself for the compulsory exam. Despite failing twice, he claims to have passed the bar exam legitimately on the third try after eight weeks of study, because [...] "Louisiana, at the time, allowed you to take the Bar over and over as many times as you needed. It was really a matter of eliminating <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{featured}} in the film are two Ratt songs ("Round and Round" [...] and [...] "I'm Insane"), the Quiet Riot song [...] "Metal Health" [...] (which is Randy's entrance song except for the last match), the FireHouse song [...] "Don't Walk Away", the Slaughter song [...] "Dangerous", the Scorpions song [...] "Animal Magnetism", [...] "Balls to the Wall" [...] by Accept, [...] "Soundtrack to a War" [...] by Rhino Bucket and the Cinderella song [...] "Don't Know <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> (Till It's Gone)". The two Ratt tunes are actually recordings by Rat Attack, a project featuring Ratt lead singer Stephen Pearcy and guitarists George Lynch (Dokken) and Tracii Guns (L.A. Guns). The Madonna song [...] "Jump" [...] is played in the bar scene. The Birdman and Lil Wayne song [...] "Stuntin' Like My Daddy" [...] {{can be heard in}} the strip club. Also in the film is a song called [...] "Let Your Freak Out" [...] by independent Toronto singer-songwriter Deesha which can be heard during the strip club scene where Marisa Tomei's character is having an emotional conversation with Mickey Rourke's character.|$|E
2500|$|Remarking on Eysenck's alleged right-wing connections, Buchanan writes: [...] "For {{those looking}} to {{thoroughly}} demonize Eysenck, his links with far right groups revealed his true political sympathies." [...] According to Buchanan, these harsh critics interpreted Eysenck's writings as [...] "overtly racist". Furthermore, Buchanan writes that Eysenck's fiercest critics {{were convinced that}} Eysenck was [...] "willfully misrepresenting a dark political agenda". Buchanan footnotes this observation with an emotive, derogatory quote from William Tucker who described Eysenck as [...] "Jensen's dark doppelganger." [...] Buchanan, however, disagrees with this stark interpretation: [...] "Yet the tip-of-the-iceberg metaphor implicit in this accusation appears to be seriously misleading in Eysenck's case. More than most, what you saw was <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>got.</b> He spread himself too thin to be harbouring much beneath the surface." [...] Buchanan goes on to argue that Eysenck's research was thinly spread across numerous domains to conclude that [...] "There appeared to be no hidden agenda to Hans Eysenck. He was too self-absorbed, too preoccupied with his own aspirations as a great scientist to harbor specific political aims." ...|$|E
