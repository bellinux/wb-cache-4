The Veda mentions only well-style irrigation, where kupa and avata wells once dug are stated to be always full of water, from which varatra (rope strap) and cakra (<b>wheel)</b> <b>pull</b> kosa (pails) of water. This water was, state the Vedas, led into surmi susira (broad channels) and from there into khanitrima (diverting channels) into fields.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} Surya temple is the Konark temple, a World Heritage Site in Orissa.

Some of the wheels are 3 meters wide. Only six of the seven horse still stand today. The temple fell into disuse after an envoy of Jahangir desecrated the temple in the early 17th century.

By the 2nd century AD, during the Han Dynasty, the Chinese also used chain pumps that lifted water from a lower elevation to higher one. These were powered by manual foot pedal, hydraulic waterwheels, or rotating mechanical <b>wheels</b> <b>pulled</b> by oxen. The water was used for public works of providing water for urban residential quarters and palace gardens, but mostly for irrigation of farmland canals and channels in the fields.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} go over a {{vertical}} obstacle face, the front wheels are forced against the obstacle by the center and rear wheels. The rotation of the front wheel then lifts {{the front of the}} vehicle up and over the obstacle. The middle wheel is then pressed against the obstacle by the rear <b>wheels</b> and <b>pulled</b> against the obstacle by the front until it is lifted up and over. Finally, the rear <b>wheel</b> is <b>pulled</b> over the obstacle by the front two wheels. During each wheel's traversal of the obstacle, forward progress of the vehicle is slowed or completely halted. This is not an issue for the operational speeds at which these vehicles have been operated to date.|$|R

I don't know whether you ever saw a bath-chair, madam, but it's a comfortable little cab on three <b>wheels,</b> <b>pulled</b> by a man.

30|$|Our aim is {{to focus}} on the {{trajectory}} of the slider. However, we must here mention previous results obtained concerning the anisotropic friction. At the microscopic scale, the possibility to measure the normal and the components of the force applied the AFM tip [11] made the latter an appropriate tool to study the friction at the atomic level [12]. In the case of an anisotropic surface, the tip is subjected to a transverse force which can be also measured by considering the torsion of the cantilever [13]. At the macroscopic scale, measurements of the frictional force showed that the “maximum energy release rate” criterion should apply but the two components of the force were not obtained indepently [14]. Another interesting effect of the transverse frictional force is the torque applied to a <b>wheel</b> <b>pulled</b> along its axis across the surface [15, 16].|$|R
