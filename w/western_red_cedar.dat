5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as <b>western</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and <b>Western</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and <b>Western</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or {{sometimes}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground or}} on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and <b>western</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar.</b> The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B.mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B.mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.|$|E
50|$|Forests of large, {{coniferous}} trees (<b>Western</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedars,</b> Douglas-firs, <b>Western</b> hemlocks, firs, pines, spruces, and others) dominate {{most of the}} Cascade Range.

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as <b>western</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{landscape}} {{cover in the}} Great Plains are resulting from the range expansion and invasion of eastern <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> (Juniperus virginiana). By altering the landscape and local vegetation, <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> is changing the structure and function of habitat for small mammals. We examined effects of invasion by eastern <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> on small mammals in 3 plant communities (tallgrass prairie, old field, and cross-timbers forest) in the cross-timbers ecoregion in Oklahoma. We sampled small mammals seasonally from May 2001 to August 2002 by using Sherman live traps and mark–recapture techniques on 3. 24 -ha, 450 -trap grids in each plant community. We sampled vegetation in two hundred twenty-five 12 x 12 -m cells within each grid. The structure of the small-mammal community differed among the 3 habitat types, with higher species diversity and richness in the tallgrass-prairie and old-field sites. Overall, the small-mammal community shifted along a gradient of increasing eastern <b>red</b> <b>cedar.</b> In the old-field and tallgrass-prairie plots, occurrence of grassland mammals decreased with increasing <b>red</b> <b>cedar,</b> whereas only 1 woodland mammal species increased.
