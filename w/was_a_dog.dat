25|$|These {{dogs were}} of the lowland or steppe type, also called kalagh, and are less heavily coated. The second strain {{was a group of}} dogs from a kennel in Kabul owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925.

Her Ghazni strain were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} any white terrier <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> named Pitch, who {{was owned by}} Colonel Thomas Thornton in 1790. The dog {{was the subject of}} a painting by Sawrey Gilpin, who created a portrait of it while it was still alive. An engraving of this painting, made prior to 1810, was accompanied by the text, [...] "It would be necessary to notice Colonel Thorton's terriers if they were only on account of his justly celebrated Pitch, from whom are descended most of the white terriers in the kingdom." [...] Dog writers of the early 20th century suggested that Pitch was a terrier-greyhound cross, which was how the colour was introduced into the breed.|$|E
500|$|From the 16th century, it was {{the fashion}} for ladies to carry small toy-sized spaniels as they {{travelled}} around town. These dogs were called [...] "Comforters" [...] and given the species biological classification of Canis consolator by 19th-century dog writers. By the 1830s, this practice {{was no longer in}} vogue, and these types of spaniels were becoming rarer. [...] "Comforter" [...] was given as a generic term to lapdogs, including the Maltese, the English Toy and Continental Toy Spaniels, the latter of which was similar to the modern Phalène. It was once believed that the dogs possessed some power of healing: in 1607 Edward Topsell repeated Caius' observation that [...] "these little dogs are good to asswage the sickness of stomach, being oftentimes thereunto applied as a plaister preservative, or bourne in the bosum of the diseased and weak person, which effect is performed by their moderate heat." [...] By the 1840s, [...] "Comforter" [...] had dropped out of use, and the breed had returned to being called Toy Spaniels. The first written occurrence of a ruby coloured toy spaniel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> named Dandy, owned by a Mr Garwood in 1875.|$|E

500|$|Leonard Maltin {{awarded the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, {{describing}} it a [...] "weird, almost incoherent crime story." [...] Celluloid Dream's Simon Hill commented that the writing was a disappointment, musing that it did however feature [...] "glimpses of director Raimi would become". A scene in a dentist office reminded him of a scene from Spider-Man 2, a film also directed by Raimi. He commented that [...] "even in his small part Campbell is the most memorable character in the film", also praising the performance of the two exterminators. Campbell also criticized the film, describing it as a [...] "lesson about abject failure", writing [...] "no matter how you slice it, the film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> and everyone involved can pretty much line up and take forty whacks. As filmmakers, we failed to execute a misguided concept and our studio refused us the benefit of any doubt." [...] The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film. In one of the few positive notices, MTV writer Adam Rosenberg described the film as [...] "criminally underrated". Rosenberg disagreed with the consensus about the film, labeling it as a [...] "hard-to-find classic". Kim Newman also called the film underrated, writing that the film [...] "revels" [...] in its slapstick nature, taking influence from everything from horror comics to The Three Stooges.|$|E
