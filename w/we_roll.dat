25|$|Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened (2016): Documentary from {{original}} Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along {{cast member}} Lonny Price. It tells the bittersweet {{story of the}} 1981 Sondheim-Furth-Prince flop Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along using both film footage taken during rehearsal for the original Broadway production, and new interviews with its cast and creators.|$|E

60|$|Next moment Hans, the Hottentot, {{screamed at}} the oxen {{in the usual}} fashion, and <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> away through the gate.|$|R
60|$|The {{next was}} Dunbar. If <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> past that, then all was lost. We {{could never get}} married. I trembled and hugged myself.|$|R
25|$|While {{some critics}} have argued that some of Sondheim’s musicals lack {{commercial}} appeal, others have praised their lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, {{as well as the}} interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along) and the above-mentioned Anyone Can Whistle, in which the first act ends with the cast informing the audience that they are mad.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the failure}} and scathing {{critical}} reception of Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along in 1981 (it closed after 16 performances), Sondheim announced {{his intention to}} quit musical theatre. Lapine persuaded {{him to return to}} the theatrical world after the two were inspired by A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. They spent several days at the Art Institute of Chicago studying the painting. Lapine noted that one major figure was missing from the canvas: the artist himself. This observation provided the springboard for Sunday and the production evolved into a meditation on art, emotional connection and community.|$|E
25|$|Following her graduation, Ellis became first {{understudy}} to Marti Webb in a UK concert tour of The Magic of the Musicals in 1998, {{required on}} several occasions in Webb's absence, yet took a hiatus in 1999 to board cruise ship MS Voyager of the Seas, employed as lead vocalist in the ship's entertainment staff. After nine months traveling across the Caribbean, she left the ship in Los Angeles, spent three months travelling across the US until her visa ran out, {{and then returned to}} understudy in the UK concert tour. By November 1999, she had made her first television appearance on Children in Need for their special Pudsey the Musical and was featured in a jingle for Capital FM. Following this, she appeared as the title role in a Gary Griffin-directed workshop production titled Helen of Troy and played the role of Mary in Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre.|$|E
60|$|The {{others were}} not slow to follow. Then Farmer Decker chirruped to Billy, and <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> {{out of the}} farm yard and down the road.|$|R
60|$|About {{five o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> into Darbyville. While crossing the Pass River the sun had burst through the clouds, and now all was as bright and fresh as ever.|$|R
60|$|A general cheer greeted this sentiment. The stout lady, now {{regarded}} as a would-be blighter of love's young dream, was hustled into the back seat, the whip cracked, and away <b>we</b> <b>rolled.</b>|$|R
500|$|Parker was the {{inspiration}} {{for a number of}} fictional characters in several plays of her day. These included [...] "Lily Malone" [...] in Philip Barry's Hotel Universe (1932), [...] "Mary Hilliard" [...] (played by Ruth Gordon) in George Oppenheimer's Here Today (1932), [...] "Paula Wharton" [...] in Gordon's 1944 play Over Twenty-one (directed by George S. Kaufman), and [...] "Julia Glenn" [...] in the Kaufman-Moss Hart collaboration Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along (1934). Kaufman's representation of her in Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along led Parker, once his Round Table compatriot, to despise him. She also appeared as [...] "Daisy Lester" [...] in Charles Brackett's 1934 novel Entirely Surrounded. She is mentioned in the original introductory lyrics in Cole Porter' song [...] "Just One of Those Things" [...] from the 1935 Broadway musical Jubilee, which have been retained in the standard interpretation of the song when it became part of the Great American Songbook.|$|E
500|$|In May 2006, Reso {{made two}} {{appearances}} for the Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion as [...] "Christian Cage". His first appearance was on May 12, 2006 at ROH's How <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> event in a tag match with Colt Cabana against Bryan Danielson and Christopher Daniels, which Cabana and he won. His second appearance was {{a loss to}} Christopher Daniels at ROH's Generation Now event on July 29, 2006.|$|E

60|$|The whole {{household}} {{gathered in}} force on its outer sill to wish us good luck as we took the street, and threw sayonaras ("if it must be so") after us as <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|If {{you could}} have heard the Story Girl's [...] "bur-r-r-r!" [...] Not old Mr. Forbes himself could have {{invested}} it with more of Doric scorn. <b>We</b> <b>rolled</b> over in the cool grass and screamed with laughter.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> swiftly along, {{the whole}} {{sweeping}} range was dotted with cattle, and farther on, {{within a few}} miles of town, there were droves of horses that brought enthusiastic praise from Miss Sampson and her cousin.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2012 it was {{announced}} that Sondheim would collaborate on a new musical with David Ives, and he had [...] "about 20–30 minutes of the musical completed". The show, tentatively called All Together Now, was assumed to follow the format of Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along. Sondheim described the project as [...] "two people and what goes into their relationship... We'll write for a couple of months, then have a workshop. It seemed experimental and fresh 20 years ago. I have a feeling it may not be experimental and fresh any more". On October 11, 2014, it was confirmed the Sondheim and Ives' musical would be based on two Luis Buñuel films (The Exterminating Angel and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie) and would reportedly open (in previews) at the Public Theater in 2017, under the working title Bunuel.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Joshua Sondheim ( [...] ; born March 22, 1930) is an American {{composer}} and lyricist known {{for more than}} a half-century of contributions to musical theatre. Sondheim has received an Academy Award, eight Tony Awards (more than any other composer, including a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre), eight Grammy Awards, a Pulitzer Prize, a Laurence Olivier Award, and a 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom. He has been described by Frank Rich of The New York Times as [...] "now the greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater." [...] His best-known works as {{composer and}} lyricist include A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Pacific Overtures, , Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along, Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, Assassins, and Passion. He also wrote the lyrics for West Side Story and Gypsy.|$|E
2500|$|Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – if you can call it that, though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E
60|$|His story being {{ended with}} his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his {{forehead}} against mine, and blowing out the light, <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> over from each other, {{this way and}} that, and very soon were sleeping.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>rolled</b> the {{creature}} off him somehow and poured a little brandy down his throat, {{which had a}} wonderful effect, for {{in less than a}} minute he sat up, grasping like a dying fish, and asked for more.|$|R
6000|$|... "You were quick-witted, Walmsley," [...] he {{admitted}} as <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> {{away in the}} car, [...] "quick-witted, I'll admit that; but you were dead clumsy with your fingers! I could see {{what you were doing}} from the back of my head." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{designing}} the game, Avalanche Software focused {{not only on}} the inclusion of the NFC-enabled Marvel figurines, but improving the Toybox mode (especially for younger players) as well. Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney Interactive Studios stated [...] "we wanted to take everything that worked so well and make it epic." [...] Each character was picked based on how they would fit in the game, as said by TQ Jefferson, [...] "what you're going to see as <b>we</b> <b>roll</b> out and reveal more characters, is that they're going to be more characters that you've known forever and they make sense," [...] Jefferson said. [...] "And the other characters, you may not know them as well, but once you see them in-game, you're going to understand why we made the choices that we made. These characters bring a certain narrative strength with them and, just as important, they bring a unique bit of gameplay with them ... characters that are the most fun to play ... that have the most impact on story. Once you see the full spectrum of characters, it's not just an Avengers game. It's very much a Marvel super heroes game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kennedy Center held a Sondheim Celebration, {{running from}} May to August 2002, {{consisting}} of six of Sondheim's musicals: Sweeney Todd, Company, Sunday in the Park With George, Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Roll</b> Along, Passion and A Little Night Music. On April 28, 2002, {{in connection with}} the Sondheim Celebration Sondheim and Frank Rich of the New York Times had a conversation. They appeared in four interviews, entitled [...] "A Little Night Conversation with Stephen Sondheim", in California and Portland, Oregon in March 2008 and at Oberlin College in September. The Cleveland Jewish News reported on their Oberlin appearance: [...] "Sondheim said: 'Movies are photographs; the stage is larger than life.' What musicals does Sondheim admire the most? Porgy and Bess tops a list which includes Carousel, She Loves Me, and The Wiz, which he saw six times. Sondheim took a dim view of today's musicals. What works now, he said, are musicals that are easy to take; audiences don't want to be challenged". Sondheim and Rich had additional conversations on January 18, 2009 at Avery Fisher Hall, on February 2 at the Landmark Theatre in Richmond, Virginia, on February 21 at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia and on April 20 at the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. The conversations were reprised at Tufts and Brown University in February 2010, at the University of Tulsa in April and at Lafayette College on March 8, 2011. Sondheim had another [...] "conversation with" [...] Sean Patrick Flahaven (associate editor of The Sondheim Review) at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach on February 4, 2009, in which he discussed many of his songs and shows: [...] "On the perennial struggles of Broadway: 'I don't see any solution for Broadway's problems except subsidized theatre, as in most civilized countries of the world.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] {{cried the}} Yellow Hen. [...] "We're {{not afraid of}} the Nomes. If <b>we</b> <b>roll</b> a few of our eggs down the tunnel they'll run away back home {{as fast as they can}} go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Asinine--absolutely asinine!' said Mr. Wontner, with folded {{arms from}} his lively chair. But he drank in the flattery and the {{fellowship}} of it all with quite a brainless grin, as <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> and stamped round him, and wiped the tears from our cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Down {{the stony}} {{steps of the}} house-fronts white <b>We</b> <b>rolled</b> rich puncheons of Spanish grape, Till at length, with the fire of the wine alight, I saw at a doorway a fair fresh shape - [...] A woman, a sylph, or sprite.|$|R
6000|$|We subjugated England and Wales; <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> {{over the}} Cheviots {{with a special}} {{adaptation}} containing eleven per cent. of absolute alcohol; [...] "Tono-Bungay: Thistle Brand." [...] We also had the Fog poster adapted to a kilted Briton in a misty Highland scene.|$|R
6000|$|Or if, as ancient sages ween, [...] Departed spirits, half-unseen, [...] Can {{mingle with}} the mortal throng; [...] 'Tis when from heart to heart <b>we</b> <b>roll</b> [...] The deep-toned music of the soul, [...] That warbles in our Scottish song.|$|E
60|$|Away {{in front}} three girls in brown costume are {{walking along the}} side of the white high-road, going with panniers towards a village up a slight incline. They hear us, turn round, and {{instantly}} go off their heads, exactly like chickens in the road. They fly towards us, crossing the road, and swifter than any rabbits they scuttle, one after another, into a deep side-track, like a deep ditch at right angles to the road. There, as <b>we</b> <b>roll</b> past, they are all crouched, peering out at us fearfully, like creatures from their hole. The bus mate salutes them with a shout, and <b>we</b> <b>roll</b> on towards the village on the low summit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Past {{that we are}} safe, Big Brother," [...] he said. [...] "The white devils never dare it, {{for there}} are rocks <b>we</b> <b>roll</b> down on their heads, {{and there is no}} other path. Always do they stop here and shoot when we cross the rock. Come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|On our way I {{tried to}} cheer her up by {{pointing}} {{out some of the}} children of the Great Mother before alluded to, but she only shut her eyes as <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> down the long avenues, and murmured, [...] "Oh, these cruel, cruel distances!" ...|$|R
60|$|Out <b>we</b> <b>rolled,</b> on {{our last}} Sardinian drive. The morning was of a bell-like beauty, blue and very lovely. Below on the right {{stretched}} the concave valley, tapestried with cultivation. Up into the morning light rose the high, humanless hills, with wild, treeless moor-slopes.|$|R
60|$|It was {{six o'clock}} in the evening when <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> into the station at Jersey City, and alighted. I was a little stiff from the long ride, but not near as much so as I {{would have been had}} I {{travelled}} in the ordinary cars.|$|R
