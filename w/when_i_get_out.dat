2500|$|Within Indiana Reformatory and Indiana State Prison, from 1924 to 1933, Dillinger {{began to}} become {{embroiled in a}} {{criminal}} lifestyle. Upon being admitted to the prison, he is quoted as saying, [...] "I will be the meanest bastard you ever saw <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here." [...] His physical examination upon being admitted to the prison showed that he had gonorrhea. The treatment for his condition was extremely painful. He became embittered against society because of his long prison sentence and befriended other criminals, such as seasoned bank robbers like Harry [...] "Pete" [...] Pierpont, Charles Makley, Russell Clark, and Homer Van Meter, who taught Dillinger {{how to be a}} successful criminal. The men planned heists that they would commit soon after they were released. Dillinger studied Herman Lamm's meticulous bank-robbing system and used it extensively throughout his criminal career.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the dead}} {{silence of the}} aristocratic street at evening, I stood a moment and listened.
