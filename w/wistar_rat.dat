50|$|In <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats,</b> it {{was found}} that cell size is the crucial {{property}} in determining neuronal recruitment. Motor neurons of different sizes have similar voltage thresholds. Smaller neurons have higher membrane resistance and require lower depolarizing current to reach spike threshold.

Experiments were done on 1- to 7-day-old <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> and 20- to 30-day-old <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> as well.

In the mPFC, <b>Wistar</b> and sNP <b>rats</b> showed similar serotonin increases after two vanilla sugar meals, while sP rats, which had low serotonin basal levels, did not show a serotonergic response.

50|$|Stegenga et al. {{set out to}} {{establish}} the stability of spontaneous network bursts {{as a function of}} time. They saw bursts throughout the lifetime of the cell cultures, beginning at 4-7 days in vitro (DIV) and continuing until culture death.

This analysis yielded the conclusion that, in their culture of <b>Wistar</b> <b>rat</b> neocortical cells, the AWSR has long rise and fall times during early development and sharper, more intense profiles after approximately 25 DIV. However, the use of BPs has an inherent shortcoming; BPs are an average of all network activity over time, and therefore only contain temporal information. In order to attain data about the spatial pattern of network activity they developed what they call phase profiles (PPs), which contain electrode specific data.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince {{modifications}} {{in the growth}} hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 (GH/IGF- 1) axis and/or caloric restriction {{are involved in the}} ageing process, GH secretory profiles, total IGF- 1, ghrelin, and leptin plasma levels and expression of genes implicated in somatotrope axis and food intake regulation in hypothalamus and pituitary were compared in 3 -, 12 -, and 24 -month-old male Lou C/Jall rats and their parent strain, the <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> The Lou C/Jall strain may appear as a healthy ageing model, since it does not become obese with age and maintains its caloric intake at 2 years of age. The GH pulsatile secretion decreased from 3 months in Wistar, but only after 12 months in Lou C/Jall rats. The IGF- 1 levels were lower in Lou C/Jall rats and decreased more steeply with ageing as compared with <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> The total ghrelin levels were higher in young Lou C/Jall <b>rats</b> than in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats,</b> but increased similarly with age in both strains. The leptin concentrations increased with ageing only in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> By semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, pituitary GH secretagogue receptors and GH mRNA levels were more abundant in Lou C/Jall rats, and the latter decreased with ageing in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> only. Hypothalamic growth-hormone-releasing hormone and GH secretagogue receptor mRNA levels were similar in both strains and transiently increased only in middle-aged <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> Agouti-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, and orexin mRNA levels were more abundant in the Lou C/Jall rat hypothalamus, and the two former tended to further increase with age only in this strain.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{restenosis}} after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is recognized worldwide, especially for diabetic patients. Interleukin- 1 /Toll-like receptor (IL- 1 /TLR) signaling {{is involved in}} innate and adaptive immune responses, but whether and how the IL- 1 /TLR-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway plays key roles in intimal formation is unclear. The underlying mechanism of intima hyperplasia was investigated with a model of carotid balloon injury in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> and with lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Elastic-van Gieson staining showed the medial area peakedon Day 3 post-injury and decreased by Day 7 post-injury in both GK and <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> The N/M at Day 7 in GK rats {{was significantly higher than}} in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> (p< 0. 001). The percent of 5 -ethynyl- 2 '-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining-positive cells on Day 3 post-injury was greater than seen on Day 7 post-injury in GK and <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> The percent of EdU-positive cells on Days 3 and 7 post-injury in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> was less than that found in GK rats (p< 0. 01; p< 0. 05).

The mean live weight of the <b>Wistar</b> <b>rat</b> {{was found to be}} 140. 625 ± 3. 078 g. The average kidney weight was 0. 605 ± 0. 012 g. The right kidney, with a mean weight of 0. 632 ± 0. 012 g, was significantly (p< 0. 05) heavier than the left (0. 596 ± 0. 022 g). The male kidneys were larger than those of the female and the values obtained were 0. 633 ± 0. 091 g and 0. 572 ± 0. 132 g, respectively. The relative thickness of the medulla was 5. 6. This value (5. 6) indicates a high index for the length of the loop of Henle, which acts as a counter current multiplier system and directly increases the ability of the kidney to produce hypertonic urine.

40|$|RATIONALE: Ventricular {{enlargement}} is {{a robust}} phenotype of the chronically dependent alcoholic human brain, yet {{the mechanism of}} ventriculomegaly is unestablished. Heterogeneous stock <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> administered binge EtOH (3 g/kg intragastrically every 8 h for 4 days to average blood alcohol levels (BALs) of 250 mg/dL) demonstrate profound but reversible ventricular enlargement and changes in brain metabolites (e. g., N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline-containing compounds (Cho)). OBJECTIVES: Here, alcohol-preferring (P) and alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) rats systematically bred from heterogeneous stock <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> for differential alcohol drinking behavior were compared with <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats</b> to determine whether genetic divergence and consequent morphological and neurochemical variation affect the brain's response to binge EtOH treatment. METHODS: The three rat lines were dosed equivalently and approached similar BALs. Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy evaluated the effects of binge EtOH on brain. RESULTS: As observed in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats,</b> P and NP rats showed decreases in NAA. Neither P nor NP rats, however, responded to EtOH intoxication with ventricular expansion or increases in Cho levels as previously noted in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> Increases in ventricular volume correlated with increases in Cho in <b>Wistar</b> <b>rats.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The latter finding suggests that ventricular volume expansion is related to adaptive changes in brain cell membranes in response to binge EtOH. That P and NP rats responded differently to EtOH argues for intrinsic differences in their brain cell membrane composition. Further, differential metabolite responses to EtOH administration by rat strain implicate selective genetic variation as underlying heterogeneous effects of chronic alcoholism in the human condition...|$|R
