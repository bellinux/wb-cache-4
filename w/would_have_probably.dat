5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> {{acted as}} the living space for Laurence of Ludlow {{when he first}} moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by {{external}} steps. The wood panelling and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E
5|$|There is a postern gate in {{the eastern}} wall, added in the 1450s, and a further gateway in the {{north-eastern}} corner, which gave access to Castle Point and Gull Crag below. Along {{the inside of the}} curtain walls are the foundations of a yard, 200-foot by 100-foot (61 m by 30 m), and a large rectangular building, usually identified as a grange or a barn. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> supported the administration of the Embleton estates, and have included the auditor's chamber and other facilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} to be the French Snecma M88, the same engine used in the Rafale. Most of the weapons it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> carried <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> been either French weapons, or built with French assistance.|$|R

5|$|Whitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia {{under the}} 1923 {{constitution}} were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers {{were intended to}} protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, {{it would have been}} extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.|$|E
25|$|Noel Odell {{believed}} {{that he had seen}} Mallory and Irvine ascend the Second Step, but eventually changed his story to say it was the First Step. Towards the end of his life, however, he reaffirmed his original view. Recent observations taken from Odell's vantage point by other climbers suggest that Odell <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> seen the men at the Second Step as he had initially reported.|$|E
25|$|From the SCR the radial {{motorway}} {{would have}} first followed the railway line south-east past Herne Hill and Brockwell Park to Tulse Hill, West Norwood and Crystal Palace station {{where it would}} have turned and headed south along the line towards South Norwood Country Park, which in the 1960s was a sewage works. From here the route is uncertain but it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> crossed Addiscombe and Shirley to reach Addington and Ringway 3.|$|E

25|$|Eigtved had {{the luck}} {{to come into}} a rich {{architectural}} environment, which {{was influenced by the}} presence of French immigrants such as Jean de Bodt and Zacharias Longuelune. Some of Pöppelmann’s assignments in those years, on which Eigtved <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> participated, were the Augustus Bridge (Augustusbruecke) in Dresden (1728), the extension of the Japanese Palace in Dresden (1727), drafts for the three-king church in Dresden new city (1723–1739), and a new large lock for the Saxon dynasty (c. 1730).|$|E
25|$|The game ended 1–0, with Brooking stooping to {{head home}} a goal he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> more easily scored with his feet, {{as the second}} {{division}} side more than held its own. Young Paul Allen became the youngest player to appear in a Wembley cup final, {{and at one point}} looked set to score what would have been a goal by the youngest player also, until a professional foul from Willie Young brought him down whilst clean through in behind the defence. This 1980 FA Cup is still West Ham's most recent major trophy.|$|E
25|$|The company <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> {{survived the}} trade {{depression}} of the late 1870s {{were it not for}} the untimely intervention of one of the old Llynvi company's Debenture Holders, probably George Moffatt, former chairman of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co Ltd. Moffatt decided to withdraw his large debenture holding in December 1877, a move which would have resulted in bankruptcy proceedings with disastrous consequences for the debenture holders. As a result, the holders opted for the lesser evil of voluntary liquidation. The merger of 1871–2 proved to be disastrous for the Brogdens as they forfeited effective control over their Welsh enterprises, and expanded their exposure to iron, at a time when the south Wales wrought iron trade was about to enter a period of terminal decline.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued {{by a number of}} historians, {{contemporary}} and modern, that the preparations for British withdrawal from India had already begun before World War II started, and the INA or the movements arising out of it achieved nothing. Others have however argued that although the will to relinquish the Raj may have existed already, but the events of the Red Fort trials, the Bombay mutiny and destabilisation within the armed forces were a principal reason for the hasty end to the Raj {{even in the face of}} dismal political scene. The INA has also been criticized since a military success by the INA and its allies, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> led to bondage for India and the rest of South East Asia to Japan.|$|E
25|$|When Attenborough {{resigned}} from his administrative duties {{to return to}} programme making {{at the start of}} 1973, planning for the proposed series resumed. It was another three years before the resourcing and financing were agreed, the outline episode scripts written (by Attenborough) and a production team in place. Parsons would serve as series producer and share production duties for the individual episodes with Richard Brock and John Sparks. Filming took place in 39 countries, featured over 650 different species and involved over 1 million miles of travel. Attenborough himself has said that {{if it had not been}} for computerised airline schedules, the series <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> been impossible to undertake. When it was finally broadcast in 1979 on BBC 1, Life on Earth drew an audience of 15 million people in the UK and was eventually seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide.|$|E
25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, who was never one to know the full ins and outs of the music business, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E

25|$|England headed over to India in 2008 for {{the final}} tour of the year. Optimism was high {{following}} the demolition of South Africa in the ODI series, as much was expected ahead of Kevin Pietersen's first full Test series as captain. The tour started with seven ODI's. England were heavily defeated in the first match, with India posting 387/5 in their 50 overs. England could only manage 229 and the result lead to criticism due to {{the manner of the}} defeat. England improved in the second match although they still lost by 54 runs, although this time they had restricted India to 292. England narrowly lost the third ODI, losing on the DL Method by 16 runs. England lost the fourth ODI on the DL Method again, this time by 19 runs. Both results were controversial as England looked to be in control in both games and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> gone on to win. However, England were now 4-0 down with just three games left to play, meaning they had lost the series. The fifth ODI, resulted in a six wicket defeat for England. After England had posted 270/4, India chased it down within 44 overs. The final two games of the series were cancelled following the 2008 Mumbai attacks.|$|E

500|$|Washington {{anticipated}} that General Howe and his troops would either flee {{or try to}} take the hill, an action that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> been reminiscent of the Battle of Bunker Hill, which was a disaster for the British. [...] If Howe decided to launch an attack on the heights, Washington planned to launch an attack against the city from Cambridge. [...] As part of the preparations, he readied two floating batteries and boats sufficient to carry almost 3,000 troops. Washington's judgment of Howe's options was accurate; they were exactly the options Howe considered.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the castle was a huge motte, or {{artificial}} mound, sunk into a deep surrounding ditch, and protected on the north site by two sets of complex ramparts, which were probably part of the original Iron Age fortifications of the site. At [...] high - [...] {{from the base of the}} ditch - and [...] wide across the base, this is the second largest man-made mound in England. The castle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> included a large timber keep on top of the motte, and a rectangular bailey fortification, approximately , stretched away from the motte, exploiting the former Iron Age fortifications on one side. [...] The new castle would have loomed over, and dominated, the former Saxon town.|$|E
500|$|Okehampton Castle {{was built}} along a long, thin rocky outcrop, rising {{up from the}} {{surrounding}} countryside. The stream that runs around {{the north side of}} the castle would have been more substantial in the medieval period and provided additional protection on that side, while the south side of the castle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> overlooked water-logged fields. The castle was mostly built from local stone, with aplite from nearby Meldon and some beerstone from south-east Devon; the interior and exterior stonework would have originally been rendered with lime plaster. The castle's final design involved a visitor entering from the barbican in the north-east, along a long passageway up the hill, into the bailey. On the south-west side of the bailey lay the motte, mounted by the keep.|$|E
500|$|The {{corridors}} {{were reduced}} in width and included angled bulkhead dividers, with exposed conduits {{added to the}} ceiling to convey a claustrophobic feel reminiscent of the submarine film The Hunt for Red October. Narita changed the bright, smooth look of the Enterprise bridge that had been created by Zimmerman for The Final Frontier by lighting the set as spottily as possible. [...] "I didn't want to use too much smoke on the Enterprise, because I didn't want it to end up looking too much like the Klingon starship. For that reason I decided to keep {{the look of the}} Enterprise pretty clean, but with a little more contrasty lighting," [...] Narita said. Meyer acknowledged that had he been the creator of the franchise, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> designed a much more claustrophobic world because it's much more dramatic." ...|$|E
