5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense <b>with</b> <b>activity.</b> The game features high contrast between darks and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E
5|$|The 1933 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the second}} most active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} on record, with 20storms forming in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, breaking the record set by 1887. The season ran through the summer and {{the first half of}} fall in 1933, <b>with</b> <b>activity</b> as early as May and as late as November. A tropical cyclone was active for all but 13days from June 28 to October 7. The year was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005 season, which broke the record with 28storms. Tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes, especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. Compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation, one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, <b>with</b> <b>activity</b> peaking during the 1920s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract TOP Study Design. Prospective {{study of}} {{patients}} making primary care visits for back pain. Objective. To examine {{the content of}} primary care visits for back pain in patients with little interference of pain <b>with</b> <b>activities</b> at the visit and 1 month later; high interference of pain <b>with</b> <b>activities</b> at the visit but not 1 month later; and high interference of pain <b>with</b> <b>activities,</b> both at the visit and 1 month later. Summary of Background Data. Advice about resumption of activities may be therapeutic for patients with back pain, but {{little is known about}} the extent to which primary care providers assess and respond to limitation of activities in patients. Methods. Audiotapes of primary care visits for back pain were coded for content. Patients indicated their goals for the visit and completed measures of pain and the pain's interference <b>with</b> <b>activities,</b> just before the visit and 1 month later. Results. In most visits, providers did not assess functional limitations related to pain and did not discuss how to resume normal activities, although this was a highly rated goal for most patients. Providers did not appear to assess or respond to patients differently according to how much pain interfered <b>with</b> their <b>activities.</b> However, in patients with high interference of pain <b>with</b> <b>activities,</b> ther...|$|R

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{occurred during}} World War II, <b>with</b> <b>activity</b> from a German U-boat {{expected in the}} Gulf of Mexico. As a result, ship reports were silenced. At the time, the Weather Bureau relied primarily on ship and land weather station observations for issue storm warnings. Additionally, advisories had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, causing them to be released hours late; moreover the advisories contained no forecast information, which would have allowed for preparation before the storm struck. The news media after the hurricane was heavily censored by the government due to national security, as information could not be leaked to the Axis powers {{about the loss of}} production of war materials. Reportedly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down a telegraph office in La Porte after a telegram was sent containing information about damage from the hurricane. The only news of this storm was published in Texas and Louisiana. After the loss of life in this storm, the Government of the United States has never censored hurricane advisories again.|$|E
5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication <b>with</b> <b>activity</b> against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E
