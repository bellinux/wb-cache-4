5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} <b>write</b> <b>something</b> easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
5|$|Setting out to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> on an epic scale, Martin {{projected}} to write three books of 800 manuscript {{pages in the}} very early stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E

25|$|As {{her life}} became so wildly reported, Kowerski/Kennedy asked their mutual friend, W. Stanley Moss, to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> definitive; {{a series of}} four {{illustrated}} articles by Moss were published in Picture Post in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Software {{developer}} Michael Abrash {{was inspired}} by Snow Crash's Metaverse and its networked 3D world. He left Microsoft for Id Software to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> in that direction, the result being Quake. The story for the 3DO game Immercenary was also heavily influenced by Snow Crash.|$|E
25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And I really wanted to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> which did speed up, and took the emotion and the {{adrenaline}} with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that was the idea of it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E

25|$|Goldman {{returned}} to novels, writing The Thing of It Is... (1967). He went {{to teach at}} Princeton, and wanted to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> but could {{not come up with}} an idea for a novel. So he decided to write his first original screenplay, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which he had been researching for eight years. He sold it for $400,000, then the highest price ever paid for an original screenplay. The resulting movie was a massive critical and commercial success and earned Goldman an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} at Jorasanko {{was filled with}} literature, music, painting and theatre. They had their own education system. In the earlier days, the women {{did not go to}} school but they were all educated at home. Swarnakumari Debi has recalled how in her early days the governess would <b>write</b> <b>something</b> on a slate which the girls then had to copy. When Debedranath discovered this, he at once stopped such a mindless and mechanical method and brought in a better teacher, Ajodhyanath Pakrashi – a male outsider in the women's quarters... Some of the sons like Ganendra, Gunendra and Jyoitrindra set up their own private theatre. To start with men played in the role of women, but {{over a period of time}} even the women joined. The environment in the family played a major role in the development of its members. Even Rabindranath Tagore who went to win the Nobel Prize in literature had very little formal education.|$|E
25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or <b>write</b> <b>something</b> in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E

500|$|Siege, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, were {{influenced}} by classic American hardcore (Minor Threat, Black Flag, Void) and by British groups like Discharge, Venom, and Motörhead. Siege's goal was maximum velocity: [...] "We would listen to the fastest punk and hardcore bands we could find and say, 'Okay, we're gonna deliberately <b>write</b> <b>something</b> that is faster than them, drummer Robert Williams recalled.|$|E
500|$|Opeth {{returned}} to Sweden after touring {{in support of}} Blackwater Park, and began writing for the next album. At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: [...] "I wanted to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> heavier than we'd ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't {{want to go to}} waste." [...] Jonas Renkse of Katatonia, a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.|$|E
500|$|The song {{came about}} when Adams was {{approached}} to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> by {{the producers of}} the upcoming Kevin Costner film, , and was asked {{to work on a}} theme song. He was provided a tape of orchestration written by the composer of the film score, Michael Kamen. With this, he and Lange used a section of Michael's orchestration and created [...] "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", which was then placed deep into the closing credits of the film when it opened on June 14, 1991.|$|E

500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I knew she {{did a lot of}} characters and voices, so I wanted to incorporate that ... I wanted to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You have to believe that he believes his own rap. When he speaks, he's just explaining that 'this is the way it is' – and that's when it gets very scary." [...] The name [...] "Vernon" [...] comes from cult leader David Koresh's real name, and [...] "Ephesian" [...] is taken from one of the books of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} co-designed and {{illustrated}} by Mark Crowe, creator of the Space Quest series, and co-programmed by Ken Williams. An accomplished jazz musician (The Lounge Lizards being a jazz band's name), Lowe also wrote the main theme music (called [...] "For Your Thighs Only"), {{and some of his}} compositions appear in later entries of the series. The theme, inspired by Irving Berlin's 1929 song [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band", was composed within 20 minutes. Lowe said it [...] "sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most computer game music, that I decided to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> with the same pep, simplicity, humor, and out-of-sync attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the central theme—the violence of institutions against the people outside the norms—Bolognesi felt {{the necessity of a}} parallel, [...] "complementary" [...] discussion. First, he tried to put Neto in a love story, but he could not <b>write</b> <b>something</b> satisfying. Making it a story of love and hate, Bolognesi decided to explore another theme he considered a taboo: the father-son relationship. He based the [...] "atmosphere" [...] of the relation on Franz Kafka's Letter to His Father. He used words from a letter by Lupicínio Rodrigues to a woman to open the film, as he wanted its feelings to guide the story.|$|E

Then she thinks, and <b>writes</b> <b>something</b> down. She puts the quill back in its container and she looks satisfied. Then the paper shows that she has written and scratched out [...] "Let them eat shit" [...] and [...] "Let them eat pussy", and the last line says [...] "Let them eat cake." ...|$|R

500|$|Although The Viceroy of Ouidah {{received}} good reviews, it did {{not sell}} well. Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book. In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer Chatwin said he [...] "decided to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> about people who never went out." [...] His next book, On the Black Hill (1982), is a novel of twin brothers who live all {{of their lives in}} a farmhouse on the Welsh borders. For this book Chatwin won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel, even though he considered his previous book, The Viceroy of Ouidah, a novel. It was made into a film in 1987.|$|E
500|$|Stephenson {{incorporates}} 17th century sentence {{structure and}} orthography throughout Quicksilver, most apparent in {{his use of}} italicization and capitalization. He adapts a combination of period and anachronistic language throughout the books, mostly to good effect, while allowing diction from modern usage, such as [...] "canal rage" [...] an allusion to road rage. Stephenson chose not to adapt period language for the entire text; instead he allowed such language to enter his writing when it was appropriate, often turning to modern English and modern labels for ideas familiar to modern readers. Stephenson said [...] "I never tried to entertain the illusion that I was going to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> that had {{no trace of the}} 20th or the 21st century in it." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like this {{is a good way to}} allow themselves room to <b>write</b> <b>something</b> new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately." [...] Isler had trouble rating the finale, noting that he had to see how the events are explained in the fourth season before he can make a complete judgment.|$|E
