5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of the Earth <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E

Mainly {{the concept of a}} preorder has to be mentioned. A preorder is a relation that is reflexive and transitive, but not necessarily antisymmetric. Each preorder induces an equivalence relation between elements, where a is equivalent to b, if a ≤ b and b ≤ a. Preorders can be turned into orders by identifying all elements that are equivalent <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> relation.|$|E

25|$|A useful {{idea from}} {{mechanics}} {{is that the}} energy gained by a particle {{is equal to the}} force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: dU = -PdV. The pressure P {{can be viewed as a}} force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while dVis the displacement (with units of distance times area). We may say, <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.|$|E

Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E

500|$|The general {{opinion of}} Fountain of the Great Lakes was {{positive}} with some describing it as a cultural achievement for Taft and Chicago. The detractors conceded that as a figural composition, it was ideal in an Old World way. [...] Critics voiced concern over the sculpture's confusion and decorum. [...] One of the basic problems for the critics was the propriety of the symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water. [...] There had for some time been discussion of the depictions representing relative elevations and the flows of the waters as they seem to do. There were grumblings for closer association of the figures to the lakes by use of physical features, directional orientation and definite contours. [...] Harriet Monroe, a general supporter of Taft's artistic efforts, was disappointed in the lack of representative geographic configuration {{and the lack of}} spirit of the lakes as inland seas. [...] <b>With</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> specific piece she had gone from being an ardent supporter who felt the model was [...] "stupendous" [...] to finding herself in [...] "doubt" [...] about the work. [...] Taft's human form depictions of the lake failed to capture the imagery of contemporary literature as it related to the power and fury of nature and the heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of Hamlin Garland, Charles Eugene Banks, Willa Cather, or Robert Morss Lovett. [...] Taft's representations of Lakes with quiet trickling water was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture. [...] On the day of the dedication the Chicago Daily News expressed this point with a photomontage juxtaposition of Taft's fountain and Lake Michigan in all its fury.|$|E
