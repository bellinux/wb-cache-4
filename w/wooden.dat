5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white <b>wooden</b> label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double <b>wooden</b> entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical <b>wooden</b> panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double <b>wooden</b> doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone and convert {{existing}} timber designs. This was initially a slow process, picking up speed towards {{the second half of}} the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature of <b>wooden</b> fortifications, the limited life of timber in <b>wooden</b> castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many <b>wooden</b> castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some <b>wooden</b> castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E
5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} <b>wooden</b> poles used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe <b>wooden</b> logs set into the beaches of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean to disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these <b>wooden</b> defenses too weak to stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} wide, flat frieze. The building's southern elevation has <b>wooden</b> windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by <b>wooden</b> double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three <b>wooden</b> eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single <b>wooden</b> six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five <b>wooden</b> 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two <b>wooden</b> four-over-four sash windows.|$|E
5|$|The front façade of {{the house}} faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays wide, with the front {{entrance}} at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double-hung <b>wooden</b> sashes on the first story and five six-over-six double-hung <b>wooden</b> sashes on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted <b>wooden</b> shutters and white-painted <b>wooden</b> lintels and sills.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with <b>wooden</b> pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small <b>wooden</b> pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small <b>wooden</b> step; the altar is accented by a large <b>wooden</b> backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with <b>wooden</b> crown molding. <b>Wooden</b> swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash <b>wooden</b> windows, the doorway's <b>wooden</b> casing, and the transom window. The <b>wooden</b> pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{is used to}} {{construct}} carts, farm implements, boats, dugout canoes and in shipbuilding. It is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes, ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs, brooms, shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs, <b>wooden</b> screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs, oars, skis, <b>wooden</b> spoons, sports equipment and <b>wooden</b> balls.|$|E
5|$|A new <b>wooden</b> {{door was}} {{installed}} {{during the reign}} of al-Hakim in 1009. In 1125, al-Amir installed a new <b>wooden</b> mihrab. An additional dome was constructed {{during the reign of}} al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. He additionally ordered the creation of a fourth arcade around the courtyard and had a porch built on the western end of the sahn.|$|E
5|$|A {{substantial}} number of Evans' original engraved <b>wooden</b> blocks are held at the St Bride Printing Library in London.|$|E
5|$|According to Adam of Bremen and the Saxo Grammaticus, Roskilde {{was founded}} in the 980s by Harald Bluetooth. On high ground above the harbour, he built a <b>wooden</b> church consecrated to the Holy Trinity {{as well as a}} royal {{residence}} nearby. Although no traces of these buildings have been discovered, in 1997 archaeologists found the remains of Viking ships in the Isefjord, the oldest of which is dated to 1030. At the time, there were also two churches in the area: St Jørgensbjerg, an early stone church, and a <b>wooden</b> church discovered under today's St Ib's Church. Harald was buried in the <b>wooden</b> church he had built on the site of today's Roskilde Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, <b>Wooden</b> Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although <b>Wooden</b> Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. <b>Wooden</b> Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, <b>Wooden</b> Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E
5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on <b>wooden</b> stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. <b>Wooden</b> structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 {{identified the}} site as a chambered long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have {{been defined as}} having long earthen mounds with <b>wooden</b> internal structures, whereas chambered tombs, while also being covered by a long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows with <b>wooden</b> internal structures {{have been identified in}} southeast Wales, perhaps because long barrows were usually built where there was no suitable stone.|$|E
5|$|Burial 195 {{was flooded}} with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered <b>wooden</b> objects that had {{completely}} rotted away {{by the time the}} tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K'awiil, the <b>wooden</b> originals long gone.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, all of Marquis' {{works were}} out of print. However, the <b>Wooden</b> Leg {{narrative}} was reprinted as <b>Wooden</b> Leg: A Warrior Who Fought Custer in 1962 by the University of Nebraska Press. In 1967 Marquis' daughters published his collected pamphlets as Custer on the Little Bighorn. Part of his Cheyenne book was published as The Reminiscences of Four Indians and a White Soldier in 1973, and Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was reprinted in 1974.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Besakana, Mahitsy and {{one other}} <b>wooden</b> house (presumably the last <b>wooden</b> Masoandro) were the only {{remaining}} examples of an estimated twenty ancient aristocratic houses that had occupied the Rova site {{during the reign of}} Andrianampoinimerina. By 1975, this unidentified third house—said to be the oldest original structure on the grounds—was no longer standing.|$|E
5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily <b>wooden</b> motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a <b>wooden</b> tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a <b>wooden</b> bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E
5|$|Dickie Jones as Pinocchio, a <b>wooden</b> puppet {{carved by}} Geppetto, {{and turned into}} a living puppet by the Blue Fairy.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's <b>wooden</b> {{model of}} the plan is still in existence, {{and is in the}} care of the Cheshire Museum Service.|$|E
5|$|His {{first meeting}} was with Iron Teeth, {{said to be}} the oldest woman in the tribe. Next was <b>Wooden</b> Leg, a government-appointed tribal judge and another ex-scout. <b>Wooden</b> Leg had fought with the Cheyenne at the Battle of the Little Big Horn at the age of 18. In November, Marquis met James Tangled Yellow Hair.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, The <b>wooden</b> {{floor and}} {{platform}} {{around the perimeter}} of the Sacristy were replaced with stone.|$|E
5|$|In August 1898 a {{temporary}} <b>wooden</b> bridge was moved into place alongside the existing bridge, and {{the demolition of}} the old bridge began.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Nuremberg and Augsburg {{were the}} early clockmaking centers, and the Black Forest came to {{specialize}} in <b>wooden</b> cuckoo clocks.|$|E
5|$|In total, the <b>wooden</b> stakes caused about 300 {{casualties}} in the 1st Airborne Task Force.|$|E
5|$|Later {{developments}} in the composite bow included siyahs made of separate pieces of wood, attached with a V-splice to the <b>wooden</b> core of the bow, rather than strengthened by external reinforcement. Mediaeval and modern bows generally have integral <b>wooden</b> siyahs and lack stiffening laths.|$|E
5|$|Louise Nevelson (September 23, 1899 – April 17, 1988) was an American {{sculptor}} {{known for}} her monumental, monochromatic, <b>wooden</b> wall pieces and outdoor sculptures.|$|E
5|$|Mackenzie Crook as Ragetti: A pirate {{aboard the}} Black Pearl, Pintel's buddy, with a <b>wooden</b> eye that {{never seems to}} stay in place.|$|E
5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting of no more than a single <b>wooden</b> platform, which cost £170 to build, two <b>wooden</b> benches and running in board together with the obligatory oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by <b>wooden</b> trestles.|$|E
5|$|Over these centuries, {{the city}} {{suffered}} numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story <b>wooden</b> pagoda at Hwangnyongsa. During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield, and Japanese forces burned the <b>wooden</b> structures at Bulguksa. Not all damage {{was due to}} invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, {{a great deal of}} damage was done to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off statuary.|$|E
5|$|Placed symmetrically in {{the north}} and south sides of the church are two nine-over-six double-hung sash <b>wooden</b> windows. Between the two windows on the church's north {{elevation}} is an exterior concrete block chimney. The layout of the east-facing rear elevation of the church is also symmetrical, and features three nine-over-six double-hung sash <b>wooden</b> windows, with the center window placed above and between the other two windows. The church's windows have been repaired using materials consistent with original construction.|$|E
5|$|Re di Portogallo saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She engaged several Austrian <b>wooden</b> vessels in the melee, {{including}} ship of the line , which rammed Re di Portogallo but inflicted no significant damage. The ship's career after the war was very limited; in 1871, she was converted into a training ship. By 1875, her <b>wooden</b> hull {{was found to have}} deteriorated badly, and so she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Roller {{coasters}} are amusement rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of <b>wooden</b> sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first roller coasters, where {{the train was}} attached to a <b>wooden</b> track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s. Although <b>wooden</b> roller coasters are still being produced, steel roller coasters are more common {{and can be found}} on every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Six Flags Fiesta Texas {{announced}} in August 2012, {{that they would}} be revamping their <b>wooden</b> coaster, The Rattler, into a steel track coaster, to be called Iron Rattler. The renovation would be performed by Rocky Mountain Construction and would feature the I-Box steel track on some of the original <b>wooden</b> coaster supports, Rattler-themed trains supplied by Gerstlauer, and a barrel roll. The new ride would open for the 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the graves}} {{are marked by}} plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end. These are not carved or inscribed with names as in Christian cemeteries, but are similar to markers found in pagan cemeteries. Some graves are interrupted by stakeholes cut into them, possibly indicating the presence of <b>wooden</b> poles that might have served as markers or supported <b>wooden</b> structures within the graves. This is unusual {{in the north of}} England, though comparable examples have been found in Kent in the south-east.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by <b>wooden</b> galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the <b>wooden</b> galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the <b>wooden</b> form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E
5|$|The Gatehouse {{is reached}} across a <b>wooden</b> bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a <b>wooden</b> defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
