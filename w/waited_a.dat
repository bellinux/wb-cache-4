5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven bullet holes were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production. On the second, the cast and crew were driving from the set, and a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was a possibility that rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E

I <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, {{was sent}} against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused {{to abandon the}} holy city and insisted on meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of Muhammad, like {{restoring}} the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, he <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{few days before the}} ditch and repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a few doors over the ditch and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 15, 1832, Captain Snyder and his men were in Kellogg's Grove when Native Americans were {{discovered}} in the area, during the night a horse was stolen. The next day, June 16, Snyder and his men pursued the Native Americans to the southwest; they came upon four natives and killed them. During the ensuing skirmish, Private William B. Mecomson was fatally wounded. The militia men put the wounded man on a litter and began to carry {{him back to the}} Kellogg cabin, along the way Mecomson asked that the group stop to rest. The group stopped and some of the men went for water while the rest waited with Mecomson. As they <b>waited,</b> <b>a</b> large group of Native Americans came upon them; a short battle followed and two more militia members were killed. After the short skirmish, the natives left the area and the militia men returned to the Kellogg cabin and buried their dead the next day.|$|E
25|$|With the Astros and Dodgers having <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{combined}} 84 {{years for}} a championship (the Dodgers last won the World Series in 1988, and the Astros had never won since their 1962 formation), this was the third straight {{year in which the}} World Series teams had <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> combined 50 years or more to win a World Series, following 2015 at 59 years and 2016 at 176 years. Both teams had not lost at home this postseason leading to the World Series. The two teams did not meet in interleague play during the regular season. This was also the third consecutive World Series to extend into November, although the 2015 World Series did not go up to Game 7.|$|E

25|$|The {{letters were}} ignored, and Linzee's forces were too few and inadequately {{equipped}} to effectively blockade the rocky inlets of the Corsican coast from which smugglers routinely sailed to Italy. Linzee therefore determined to attack San Fiorenzo, on the northwestern coast of Corsica {{at the southern}} end of Cap Corse. San Fiorenzo was strategically important for its large sheltered bay, defended by fortifications at Torra di Mortella and Torra di Fornali. On 19 September Linzee sent Nemesis and Lowestoft to attack Torra di Mortella, which was abandoned by its garrison undamaged after three broadsides from Lowestoft. British sailors landed and entered the tower, but returned to their ships the next day. Linzee then <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> week before attacking Torra di Fornali, a much stronger position protected by coastal batteries.|$|E
25|$|Clark <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{month before}} {{striking}} again. Meanwhile, Bundy was still infatuated with Jack Murray. She would go see him sing {{and after a}} few drinks, her conversation would turn to things she and Clark were doing. Murray was alarmed and implied that he might tell the police. In order to avoid this from happening, in August 1980, Bundy lured Murray into his van after a show to have sex. Once they were inside, she shot him and decapitated him. She left various clues behind, however, such as the fact {{that the two of them}} were seen together in the bar, and she had left shell casings in the van. Bundy couldn't take the pressure and two days later she confessed to her co-workers that she had killed Murray. They called the police and she began to give them a full and to-the-point confession about her and Clark's crimes.|$|E
25|$|Heraclius later {{moved on}} to the Great Palace of Dastagird only to {{discover}} that Khosrau II had fled his Palace. In a fit of rage, Heraclius ordered that everything be burnt to the ground. Moving on, he soon found that Khosrau no longer commanded the loyalty of his subjects— as they refused to rally to defend Ctesiphon. Heraclius <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> week or two before marching his army back. Khosrau's son Siroes took power as Kavadh II and had his father shot to death with arrows. Later, the formation of a peace treaty favourable to the Byzantines led to the restoration of the pre-war boundaries. As an added bonus, all captives and Christian relics that had been captured by the Persians were returned. Thus, it was {{at the head of the}} True Cross that Heraclius entered the Capital on September 14, 628 triumphant. Leading a procession which included four elephants, the True Cross was placed high atop the altar of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

25|$|Morlot led about 4,000 men in six battalions at the Battle of Tudela on 23 November 1808. That morning Marshal Jean Lannes had {{his troops}} on the road at dawn. Reaching Tudela at 9 AM the French caught the Spanish army unprepared. Seeing the half-unmanned defenses, Lannes sent his leading {{division}} under Morlot directly into the assault. The 6,500 soldiers of the Spanish 5th Division arrived {{just in time to}} blunt the attack on the Cerro de Santa Barbara. Before resuming the attack, Lannes <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few hours for all his troops to reach the battlefield. Then he launched the divisions of Morlot and Maurice Mathieu at the Spanish positions. Morlot's front line brigade suffered heavy losses, but he sent one battalion up a ravine that the defenders neglected to watch. Noting that the battalion had gained a foothold on the crest, he pushed forward reinforcements and soon the Spaniards were fleeing in rout.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} portion of Toole's {{military}} career {{one of his}} primary motivations for advancement was to acquire a private office. Privacy was a significant luxury on the island {{with some of the}} men renting rooms in nearby hotels so they could have some solitude. Toole's army buddy David Kubach, also an aspiring writer, lent him a green Swedish-made Halda typewriter for use in his office. The barracks consisted solely of college educated English professors, which gave it a different makeup from usual army companies. In contrast to almost all other army barracks where gays kept their sexual orientation a secret, there was an openly gay contingent which flaunted their homosexuality. The gay men reserved a portion of the barracks for themselves and as they did not proposition any of the straight instructors, they were left alone. However, this particular group of gay men drank significantly more {{than the rest of the}} group and eventually began to exhibit a loud, rowdy, and vulgar brand of behavior that made the straight men uncomfortable. Toole's response was to ignore their behavior and it lost him the respect of some of the men in the barracks. The problem came to a head when a gay instructor attempted suicide by overdosing on APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) tablets after being spurned by another soldier. When Toole found the man he <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> half-hour to call for help, hoping he would awaken on his own. His friend Kubach stated that this was because it would look bad for the soldier and that he would most likely get himself court martialed for a suicide attempt. Some of his fellow soldiers were livid and held a meeting deciding whether to report Toole's negligence. Ultimately, they did not report his behavior and the army never filed any charges but his relationships with many of the men were irrevocably changed.|$|E
