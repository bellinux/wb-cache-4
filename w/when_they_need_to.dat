25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a Goa'uld host is a brief glowing of the eyes. This occurs when the Goa'uld first takes control and upon its death, {{as well as in}} moments of extreme emotion or to add emphasis or intimidation. A Goa'uld-occupied host typically speaks in an eerily flanged, deepened register. However, the voice is not necessary, and Goa'uld can speak in a normal tone if they choose, usually <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> deceive someone. The Goa'uld instill their hosts with superhuman strength, perfect health, and accelerated healing. The host's life is also lengthened into centuries, which the Goa'uld extend even further using a sarcophagus. However, repeated use of the sarcophagus has severe psychological consequences, and is believed to be a main factor in the Goa'uld's evil. Being host to a Goa'uld {{has been described as a}} living nightmare, and those humans who have been hosts for thousands of years are widely suspected to have gone insane.|$|E
500|$|Lim Kit Siang {{attributed}} the opposition's defeat to Mahathir's liberalism and the government's {{adoption of the}} DAP's stance on issues like [...] "language, culture and education". Some, however, doubted Mahathir's sincerity. One UMNO Youth official suggested that [...] "The Barisan government's flexible move... only shows that we are enjoying {{the highest level of}} tolerance purely based on the level of confidence in terms of political and economic position of the Malays. We share the political power with the Chinese. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase their political support from their community it is very important for them to serve the main concerns of the Chinese.

Similarly we UMNO Youth have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests.... However, those finished agendas that we have done, such as Islam, Bahasa Melayu [...] and the special status of the Malays, should not be questioned in any circumstance because these are very sensitive issues." ...|$|E

500|$|Slow lorises {{produce a}} {{secretion}} from their brachial gland (a scent gland {{on the upper}} arm near the axilla) that is licked and mixed with their saliva. In tests, three predators—binturongs, clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), and sun bears—retreated or showed other signs of displeasure when presented with cotton swabs anointed {{with a mixture of}} the toxic secretion and the saliva, whereas the toxic secretion alone generated mild interest. Before stashing their offspring in a secure location, female slow lorises will lick their brachial glands, and then groom their young with their toothcomb, depositing the toxin on their fur. When threatened, slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite their aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wounds. Slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite, which is likely to maximize the transfer of toxins. [...] This toxic bite is a rare trait among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. It may also be used for defense against other slow lorises and parasites. According to Nekaris, this adaptation—along with vocalizations, movement, and coloration patterns similar to those of true cobras—may have evolved through Müllerian mimicry to protect slow lorises <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> move across the ground due to breaks in the canopy.|$|E
500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting {{that it is an}} interesting meditation on the concept of change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn’t moving fast enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a self-contained unit made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> change is the best thing you can do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fund {{governance}} providers {{range from}} limited-resourced, proprietorships of part-time directors (or so-called ‘boutique’ firms) to fully resourced professional services firms of full-time directors, “organized similarly to large law or accounting firms”. In {{many parts of}} the world, serving as a fund director remains a cottage industry [...] where proponents argue that fund governance is different from the other services provided to the fund and not adaptable to the professional firm approach. [...] This mindset appears to be supported by the law in several jurisdictions that mandate that only “natural persons” provide director services. Opponents [...] of the proprietor approach argue that boards should not be “dominated by part-timers at a time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be vigilant about avoiding future crises” and that professional funds “would never buy legal services or management advice from people only willing to spare a few hours a month”.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{children}} {{no longer}} wear diapers when past {{two to four}} years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. [...] However, it is becoming increasingly common for children as old as five to still be wearing diapers because of their parents' neglect or the child's opposition to toilet training. [...] This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. [...] Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom. [...] The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes. [...] "uper-comfortable diapers" [...] have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go to the toilet. [...] Paediatric nurse June Rogers claims that the attitude of parents {{plays a major role in}} the problem, and that toilet training is simply not a priority for many of them.|$|E
