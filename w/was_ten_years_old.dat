5|$|Kenyatta's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, as birth records were not {{traditionally}} kept by the Kikuyu. It is known that he was probably born sometime in the 1890s.

The older members of Kenyatta's age group are believed to have been born around 1890. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested that his year of birth was likely 1890, although a fuller analysis performed by Jeremy Murray-Brown concluded that he was likely born circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock. When he <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition away from childhood.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously {{infected}} with boils and, {{while under the}} care of a Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before the end of the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a peptic ulcer. At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, until she <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay.|$|E

5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother and {{siblings}} to Berlin when he <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.|$|E
