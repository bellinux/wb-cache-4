By mid-June, it was back up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E

5|$|After his {{promotion}} was confirmed, Saunders {{returned to}} New Guinea and, {{although it was}} contrary to policy, rejoined his old battalion.

5|$|An {{event of}} grave {{embarrassment to the}} Soviet Union came in October 1981 when one of its {{submarines}} ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. As this was a militarily sensitive location, Sweden took an aggressive stance on the incident, detaining the Whiskey-class sub for two <b>weeks</b> <b>as</b> they awaited an official explanation from Moscow. Eventually it was released, but Stockholm refused to accept Soviet claims that this was merely an accident, especially since numerous unidentified submarines had been spotted near the Swedish coast. Sweden also announced that radiation had been detected emanating from the submarine and they believed it to be carrying nuclear missiles. Moscow would neither confirm nor deny this and instead merely accused the Swedes of espionage.|$|E

5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 <b>weeks</b> <b>as</b> opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for <b>weeks</b> <b>as</b> the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{weeks of}} {{principal}} photography commenced on 1 July 1968 at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire; shooting wrapped on 16 October having run alongside that for Joe 90.

Filming in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire used the exterior of Neptune House (now part of the BBC's Elstree Studios) as a double for EUROSEC Headquarters in Portugal. Heatherden Hall (part of the Pinewood complex) appears as the old Webb's nursing home.|$|E

5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 <b>weeks.</b> <b>As</b> the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
