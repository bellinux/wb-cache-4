After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. Witherspoon was raised as an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the [...] "definitive Southern upbringing" [...] which she received. She said that it gave her [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected {{as a model for}} a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. Witherspoon received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself [...] "a big dork who read loads of books." [...] On mentioning her love for books, she said, [...] "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything." [...] She {{has been described as a}} [...] "multi-achiever" [...] and was given the nickname [...] "Little Type A" [...] by her parents. Witherspoon attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader. She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major, [...] but left the school prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.|$|E

Perhaps with that in my heart and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> yours, we may meet and pass and meet again and pass, and do one another no harm. Is that finished?" ...|$|E
50|$|Harvey (1996) {{explains}} {{that when you}} experience a loss or a depletion of resources, you may need some time to sort out <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the first place, what was given up in the breakup, and <b>what</b> remains for <b>you</b> to rely on, cherish or use.

6000|$|... "Yes, of the {{tremendous}} pull he really has. It's all very well to talk--he HAS it. But of course I don't mean I don't know"--and as with the effect of his nervous sociability he shifted his position. [...] "I perfectly see that you're NOT afraid. I perfectly know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your head. I should never in the least dream of accusing you--as far as HE is concerned--of the least disposition to flirt; any more indeed," [...] Vanderbank pleasantly pursued, [...] "than even of any general tendency of that sort. No, my dear Nanda"--he kindly kept it up--"I WILL say for you that, though a girl, thank heaven, and awfully MUCH a girl, you're really not on the whole more of a flirt than a respectable social ideal prescribes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well." [...] He {{stood up}} briskly, {{went to his}} pack, and began unstrapping. [...] "I shall need help. Bring his brother in. Bring them all in. Boiling water--let there be lots of it. I've brought bandages, but let me see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> that line.--Here, Daw, build up that fire and start boiling all the water you can.--Here you," [...] to the other man, [...] "get that table out and under the window there. Clean it; scrub it; scald it. Clean, man, clean, as you never cleaned a thing before. You, Mrs. Strang, will be my helper. No sheets, I suppose. Well, we'll manage somehow.--You're his brother, sir. I'll give the anæsthetic, but you must keep it going afterward. Now listen, while I {{instruct}} you. In the first place--but before that, can you take a pulse?..." ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{you will}} say, {{all this is}} fault-finding; let us hear <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the way of {{positive}} suggestion. Then I am bound to tell you that, if I could make a clean sweep of everything--I am very glad I cannot because I might, and probably should, make mistakes,--but if I could make a clean sweep of everything and start afresh, I should, in the first place, secure that training of the young in reading and writing, and {{in the habit of}} attention and observation, both to that which is told them, and that which they see, which everybody agrees to. But in addition to that, I should make it absolutely necessary for everybody, for a longer or shorter period, to learn to draw. Now, you may say, {{there are some people who}} cannot draw, however much they may be taught. I deny that in toto, because I never yet met with anybody who could not learn to write. Writing is a form of drawing; therefore if you give the same attention and trouble to drawing as you do to writing, depend upon it, there is nobody who cannot be made to draw, more or less well. Do not misapprehend me. I do not say for one moment you would make an artistic draughtsman. Artists are not made; they grow. You may improve the natural faculty in that direction, but you cannot make it; but you can teach simple drawing, and you will find it an implement of learning of extreme value. I do not think its value can be exaggerated, because it gives you the means of training the young in attention and accuracy, which are the two things in which all mankind are more deficient than in any other mental quality whatever. The whole of my life has been spent in trying to give my proper attention to things and to be accurate, and I have not succeeded as well as I could wish; and other people, I am afraid, are not much more fortunate. You cannot begin this habit too early, and I consider there is nothing of so great a value as the habit of drawing, to secure those two desirable ends.|$|E
