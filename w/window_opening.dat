5|$|Renovations {{included}} {{adding a}} new roof, creating a new entrance, adding an elevator, among other changes. Creating a new entrance involved removing hand quarried stone from the walls to enlarge a <b>window</b> <b>opening.</b> The remodeling also brought the building up to modern seismic codes and {{to comply with the}} Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). City officials hoped to maintain the character of the original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing for the center came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} {{is characterized}} by the combined use of neo-gothic and Spanish-Colonial elements. The body of the church is buttressed between the <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> along the north and south facades. The transept rises only one storey in height and its gables are oriented along a north–south axis. The exterior walls are void of any ornamentation as well, and the composition is capped by a ceramic tile roof typical of mission-style churches.|$|E

The majority of this elevation is smooth limestone veneer with punched <b>window</b> <b>openings.</b> The projecting glass and steel curtain wall accents the northeast corner, and the solid limestone shaft with curved elevator penthouse accents the northwest corner. The building's vaulted metal roof crowns the tower.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} {{conventional}} surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap {{is made in}} the scleral wall of the eye, and a <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble {{on the surface of the}} eye.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower is}} of three stages. The lower stages might {{be part of}} an 11th-century {{previously}} unbuttressed tower, and contains at its west side an early 15th-century chamfered reveal <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> with pointed arch surrounded by a hood mould with label stops in human form. The inset Perpendicular window is of three lights of panel tracery below, and six above. The panels are headed with trefoils, the lower within ogee heads. A church clock is just below the belfry stage. Between the window and clock is a hooded slit window, a repeat slit window is on the north and south sides. The Belfry stage was added in the 13th century and is defined at its base by a string course with repeating dentils. Central to each side of the belfry stage is a chamfered <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> with a plain hood mould following a semi-circular head. Within the opening are louvered and pointed twin-lights, these separated by a central octagonal shaft with a trefoil opening above in the north and south windows. The roof line is defined by a further string course with repeated grotesque bosses, and pairs of gargoyle drains on each side. An embattled roof parapet with crocketed corner pinnacles sits above. The tower is partially clasped at the north and south by the church aisles, and on the north side by an ashlar three-stepped angled buttress against the lower stages.|$|E
25|$|In the 2008–09 {{transfer}} window, Tottenham {{experienced a}} relatively quiet transition {{over the course}} of January. With the transfer <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> {{on the first day of}} the month, transfer speculation was mostly rebuffed by manager Harry Redknapp for the majority of the month, however Tottenham managed to secure the arrival of two players in the window. On 28 January, experienced forward Eiður Guðjohnsen joined the club on loan from Monaco on a deal effective until the season's end. Two days later saw the return of another former player in Younès Kaboul, re-signed from Portsmouth for a fee believed to be around £5million in what was Tottenham's only permanent signing of the window.|$|E

25|$|In {{his most}} famous exploit, Nicholas aided a poor man who had three daughters, but could not afford a proper dowry for them. This meant that they would remain {{unmarried}} and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, would have to become prostitutes. Even if they did not, unmarried maidens in those days would have been assumed as being a prostitute. Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), {{he went to the}} house under the cover of night and threw three purses (one for each daughter) filled with gold coins through the <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> into the house.|$|E
25|$|The church south porch is 15th-century. It is a gabled {{structure}} with a cross finial at the centre, and crocketed pinnacles at each corner of its south face. It {{is set on}} a plinth which runs over diagonal buttresses at the south corners. A string course runs into a hood mould surrounding a blocked pointed <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> at both {{the east and west}} side. The pointed doorway arch is hood moulded, and has a continuous chamfered surround meeting a flat reveal, which in turn holds a further roll mould arch ending at the spring with capitals unsupported by piers.

25|$|Beneath the lunettes are {{the four}} panels {{of the upper}} {{register}}. The two outer panels of the middle register show the Annunciation to Mary, with the Archangel Gabriel {{on the left and}} the Virgin Mary on the right. Both are dressed in white robes, and occupy what appear to be the opposite ends of the same room. Gabriel and Mary's panels are separated by two much narrower images showing unoccupied domestic interior scenes. The back wall in the left-hand image has a <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> onto a view of street and city square, while that in the right-hand image has a niche. Some art historians have attempted to associate the street with an actual location in Ghent, but it is generally accepted that it is not modeled on any specific place. The sparseness of these narrow panels seem anomalous in the overall context of the altarpiece; a number of art historians have suggested that they were compromises worked out by Jan as he struggled to accommodate his design within the original framework set out by Hubert.|$|E
25|$|The 1448 south chapel {{sits on a}} moulded plinth {{which runs}} over two twin-stepped buttresses, one angled and central to the south wall, the other {{diagonal}} on the south-east corner. The buttresses are topped by square-based pinnacles with blind cusped panels, crocketed above gables at each side, the pinnacle at the south-east finished with a finial. The parapet is embattled with moulded coping, which runs as a gable end at the east end and includes a central cross above. At the roof line {{at the base of}} the parapet and the buttress tops runs a moulded cill band—angled projection that allows water to flow from a building face—which continues around the east side and follows the line of the gable end. Either side of the south wall buttress is a three light window with cinquefoil heads, with six panels above with trefoil heads, enclosed in a moulded surround, and set with stained glass. The <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> has a flattened arch above the spring with a following hood mould. The 1460–70 north chapel also sits on a moulded plinth.

2500|$|Outside {{the major}} {{metropolitan}} cities, few stores {{could afford to}} serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations {{that would allow them}} to separate wealthier customers from the [...] "riff raff." [...] One technique was to have a <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> out onto the street from which customers could be served. [...] This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack. The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.|$|E
