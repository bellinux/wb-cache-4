25|$|The unrecognised {{time that}} Anquetil set {{that day was}} {{nevertheless}} broken by the Belgian rider Ferdinand Bracke. Anquetil was hurt that the French government had never sent him a telegram of congratulations but sent one to Bracke, who was not French. It was {{a measure of the}} unacceptability of Anquetil's arguments, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was quietly dropped from future French teams.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Selleck {{played the}} lead role of Murray in a Broadway revival of Herb Gardner's comedic play A Thousand Clowns. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly {{negative}} about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of Jason Robards, Jr., who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character {{on the stage and}} in a movie version. (It remains the role with which Robards is most identified.) Playwright Gardner, however, actually preferred Selleck to Robards in the part, and even said that Selleck <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had always envisioned Murray.|$|E
25|$|Mascis {{listened to}} classic rock {{artists such as}} the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, {{elements}} of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr.'s members also combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock in their songs, which often featured {{a large amount of}} feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wanted the album to sound. To accentuate their use of volume, the band employed and popularised the quiet–loud change of dynamic in many of its songs, a technique that would be later popularised by Pixies, Nirvana and alternative rock in general during the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Jenny Uglow, {{writing in}} The Guardian, notes that [...] "An added delight <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> filled the blank spaces with 'tail-pieces', tiny, witty, vivid scenes of {{ordinary}} life." [...] She describes {{the importance of}} Birds in Jane Eyre, and ends [...] "He worked with precision and insight, {{in a way that}} we associate with poets such as Clare and Wordsworth, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Elizabeth Bishop. To Bewick, nature was the source of joy, challenge and perpetual consolation. In his woodcuts of birds and animals as well as his brilliant tail-pieces, we can still feel this today." [...] However, in her biography of Bewick, she adds that [...] "The country might be beautiful but it also stank: in his vignettes men relieve themselves in hedges and ruins, a woman holds her nose as she walks between the cowpats, and a farmyard privy shows that men are as filthy as the pigs they despise." ...|$|E
500|$|The SIS {{building}} was positively critiqued by Deyan Sudjic in The Guardian in 1992 who {{described it as}} an [...] "epitaph for the [...] architecture of the eighties". Sudjic wrote that [...] "It's a design which combines high seriousness in its classical composition with a possible unwitting sense of humour. The building could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple {{or a piece of}} clanking art deco machinery", and added that the most impressive thing about Farrell's design <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had not [...] "confined himself to a single idea" [...] as the building [...] "grows and develops as you move around it". In their 2014 Guide to London's Contemporary Architecture, Kenneth Allinson and Victoria Thornton wrote that [...] "Some see this building as Farrell's most controlled and mature building – a rich diet, certainly, but not a cacophony of rhetorical features, nor without the unselfconscious virtuosity which can uplift and excite. But it is undoubtedly too Gotham City for the taste of many. Farrell's many critics and opponents...would call it a nightmare: a secret service fortress, provided by a private speculator, designed by an avowed populist, and sited on a most prominent river location. Indubitably, it is a bizarre phenomenon".|$|E

2500|$|Jaisimha was a {{right-handed}} batsman who {{was noted}} for his style {{on and off}} the field. He bowled medium pace, often opening the bowling for India, and off-breaks, and was a brilliant fielder. But it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> went about things that caught the eye. Partab Ramchand wrote after Jaisimha's death that [...] "his slim figure, which he maintained till his last day, the boyish good looks, the inimitable gait, the trademark silk shirt and scarf, the sleeves buttoned at the wrist or the collar turned up – all these attracted immediate attention."

I wasn't interested in just being straight-up bad guy who was killing people willy-nilly.

2500|$|Ismail's father {{believed}} {{strongly in}} the benefits of education, unlike many Malays of the time, and ensured his children received the best education possible. Two of his sons became lawyers and another an economist. In 1939, the British General Adviser W.E. Pepys lamented that [...] "the only Johore Malay who has got a university degree is Encik(Mr.) Suleiman bin Abdul Rahman, the son of Dato Abdul Rahman, State Treasurer, Johore." [...] Ismail himself went on to obtain a degree at the King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore. In 1945, {{he became the first}} Malay to obtain a MBBS from University of Melbourne, Australia. Ismail's son later said that his education in Australia greatly impacted his worldview: [...] "He was on his own and a member of a minority there. He didn’t have other Malays to prop him up and he had a sense of loneliness. He felt that he was treated as an equal and that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would want to treat other people as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008 fellow Slipknot {{band member}} Sid Wilson {{introduced}} Shawn Crahan to Michael Pfaff, {{along with a}} few other musicians they had a jam session together. Crahan himself said that during the session he could only focus on Pfaff and how they both played together, explaining that; [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was throwing his shapes, to my shapes." [...] Shortly after meeting with Pfaff, Crahan introduced guitarist Ty Fury to the project. Crahan had previously worked with Fury on a band he was a part of in Denver, but recruited him for Dirty Little Rabbits. Around the same time, Pfaff brought bassist Jeff Karnowski in to the band. After this they realized that they would need a vocalist, after going through a couple of other singers Crahan recruited Stella Katsoudas who was living in Los Angeles. Crahan and Katsoudas had known each other for [...] "a long, long time," [...] and met up [...] "just as friends" [...] but Crahan revealed that he wanted her to be in the band.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the two}} {{remaining}} warriors from the ravine was Charging Bear, who later became a U.S. Army Indian Scout. [...] They had 24 cartridges remaining among them, and bodies had been used as shields. [...] Finerty wrote that [...] "the skull of one poor squaw was blown, literally, to atoms, revealing the ridge of the palate and presenting a most ghastly and revolting spectacle. [...] Another of the dead females was so riddled with bullets that {{there appeared to be}} no unwounded part of her person left." [...] Crook ordered the remaining bodies removed from the cave. [...] "Several soldiers jumped at once into the ravine and bore out the corpses of the warrior killed by Pourier and three dead squaws." [...] "The old Indian Big Bat Pourier had killed was unceremoniously hauled up by what hair remained and a leather belt around the middle. The body had stiffened in death in the posture of an old man holding a gun, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> shot. [...] He was an old man, and his features wore a look of grim determination." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{principal}} photography {{began on}} March 22, 1976 in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems. Lucas fell behind schedule {{in the first}} week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns. Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, [...] "you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur." [...] Given this situation, Lucas requested for heavy filtration, which Taylor rejected, who said: [...] "I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ... But George saw it differently, so we tried using nets and other diffusion. He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together. I told him it wouldn't work, but he said that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wanted to do the entire film, all diffused." [...] This difference was later settled by 20th Century Fox executives, who backed Taylor's suggestion.|$|E
