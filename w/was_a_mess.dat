Turpin was in the pantry of the wardroom when the explosion occurred, and felt the ship [...] "heave and lift" [...] before all went dark. He worked his way aft and climbed out of the wardroom on the captain's ladder and up onto the deck. He dove overboard and was rescued by a motor launch. Turpin was one of 90 out of the 350 officers and men aboard Maine that night to survive the explosion.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that the plot was predictable, {{describing}} Riker being written as [...] "so paint-by-numbers the color is practically dripping off the screen". He praised the relationship between Q and Picard, stating that de Lancie was having such [...] "fun with the role that the episode itself is also fun despite its flaws". He gave [...] "Hide and Q" [...] a score of five out of ten. Zack Handlen re-watched the episode for The A.V. Club, and thought it was an example of where TNG avoided characterisation in favour of a morality play. He thought that the episode <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> with the highlights being Picard reciting Shakespeare and the Napoleonic monsters. He rated the episode as a C-.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} despite being {{based on a}} musical theater concept [...] "that {{periodically}} makes no sense", Green Day [...] "makes the journey entertaining enough". It described some of the songs as forgettable, though, arguing the album focuses more on lyrics than music. Rolling Stone said the album could have been, and <b>was,</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> but that the [...] "individual tunes are tough and punchy enough {{to work on their}} own". The Guardian called American Idiot a mess—"but a vivid, splashy, even courageous mess". Slant Magazine described it as a [...] "pompous, overwrought," [...] but nonetheless [...] "glorious concept album". Uncut was more critical and wrote in a mixed review that although the album was heavily politically focused, [...] "slam-dancing is still possible". In a negative review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called the album a [...] "dud" [...] and asserted that Armstrong's lyrics eschew [...] "sociopolitical content" [...] for [...] "the emotional travails of two clueless punks—one passive, one aggressive, both projections of the auteur", adding that [...] "there's no economics, no race, hardly any compassion." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Coulter met Jamie Babbington, {{a builder}} from Gold Coast who was aged 23 at the time. They started [...] "dating seriously" [...] after about a year. Coulter and Babbington married at a secret {{location}} in Canungra, Queensland on 7 September 2007. Coulter took her husband's last name and became Ricki-Lee Babbington. The couple had their honeymoon in the Maldives for five weeks. The following year, on 18 October 2008, Coulter's publicist issued a statement that they had separated due to [...] "distance and time apart". In an interview with Herald Suns Jonathan Moran, {{three years after the}} marriage ended, Coulter revealed that she had experienced depression during her relationship with Babbington. [...] "I was living my dream but behind closed doors my personal life <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess.</b> [...] I felt alone, I bottled it all up and it made things worse. I wanted to give up everything. I wouldn't leave the house for days at a time. I'd sit in the house all day and do nothing".|$|E
500|$|The album's title Meddle is {{a play on}} words: a medal, and to interfere. [...] Storm Thorgerson of the art-design group Hipgnosis {{originally}} {{suggested a}} close-up shot of a baboon's anus for the album cover photograph. [...] He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have [...] "an ear underwater". [...] The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. [...] The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson has expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: [...] "I think Meddle {{is a much better}} album than its cover". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shares his sentiments, saying: [...] "Meddle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess.</b> [...] I hated that cover. [...] I don't think we did them justice with that at all; it's half-hearted." [...] The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band (Floyd's last until 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason).|$|E
500|$|Gareth McLean, who {{reviewed}} {{a preview}} screening for The Guardians TV and radio weblog, appreciated the episode's use of [...] "the disaster movie template" [...] {{and came to}} a favourable overall conclusion: [...] "For the most part, The Voyage of the Damned is absolutely smashing." [...] Its main flaw, in his view, was the [...] "blank and insipid" [...] acting of Kylie Minogue. James Walton of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a positive review, summarising it as [...] "a winning mixture of wild imagination and careful writerly calculation". Alex Clark of The Observer commented that the death toll was rather high, but she still thought the episode was [...] "an oasis of cheeky nonsense and careless invention". Harry Venning of The Stage concluded his positive review of the episode by stating it [...] "was well up to Doctor Whos impeccably high standards". Doctor Who Magazine placed two of the deaths in the episode in its list of the top 100 deaths {{in the history of the}} show. Bannakaffalatta's death, a self-sacrifice to save the Doctor's party, was placed in the [...] "top 20 tearjerkers" [...] category. Astrid's death was given the title of [...] "Doctor Whos all-time greatest death scene", commenting it [...] "ticks boxes in all of our main categories [...] ", and [...] "her death would truly make a glass eye cry." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times gave the episode a negative review, stating that [...] "It was boring, despite the endless dashing about and CGI flimflam." [...] The Daily Mirror commented the episode had [...] "some brilliant psychedelic Pink Floyd-esque imagery", [...] "great baddies", and [...] "neat jokes", but lamented that [...] "the plot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> consisting mostly of one hi-tech chase scene after another, and it descended into noise and bluster." ...|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{named the}} area [...] "Paradise Ranch" [...] to {{encourage}} workers {{to move to}} a place that the CIA's official history of the U-2 project would later describe as [...] "the new facility in the middle of nowhere"; the name became shortened to [...] "the Ranch". [...] On 4 May 1955, a survey team arrived at Groom Lake and laid out a , north-south runway on the southwest corner of the lakebed and designated a site for a base support facility. [...] "The Ranch", also known as Site II, initially consisted of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team. In a little over three months, the base consisted of a single, paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and rudimentary accommodations for test personnel. The base's few amenities included a movie theatre and volleyball court. Additionally, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> hall, several water wells, and fuel storage tanks. By July 1955, CIA, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began arriving. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955 from Burbank on a C-124 Globemaster II cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a Douglas DC-3. Regular Military Air Transport Service flights were set up between Area 51 and Lockheed's Burbank, California offices. To preserve secrecy, personnel flew to Nevada on Monday mornings and returned to California on Friday evenings.|$|E
2500|$|On {{returning}} to New York City in January 1937, Schneider {{claimed he was}} never paid in full. Spain claimed that they were paid in full, and were not owed any money. Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said [...] "This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess...</b> and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where we did not know who we were fighting and why, and you can say that we are damn glad to be back." [...] The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never forsworn allegiance to America.|$|E
2500|$|The Post Office, {{better known}} as the Stock Exchange (Dunedin Stock Exchange building), was Mason's {{greatest}} achievement. It was described at the time as the finest building in the colony and was a notable aesthetic success. A two story stone building it was tendered at 22,960 pounds, occupied most of a city block and was another palazzo, arcaded and with a 120-foot high clock tower above the central entrance. It was symmetrical in plan and overall design and was described as [...] "Palladian with Italian and Grecian features". There was a central hall with a highly decorated interior. Its street elevations appeared effortlessly noble. Recessed columns in the arcades, elaborate stone carving in the spandrels and the rhythmic alternation of deep arches and heavily rusticated pilasters contributed to the effect, as did the recession of the first floor from the ground floor's arcade. As a consequence the first floor was set like a temple atop a mighty, balustraded plinth to which the first floor's lofty pediments added a crowning, glorious note. The cosmopolitan assurance of the design was almost startling in the context. But the building's outstanding success seems to have contributed to its demise. Transferred to the university, for which purpose it wasn't suited, it became the premises of the Colonial Bank, and then the Stock Exchange suffering unfortunate modifications along the way. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of ill-considered additions when it was demolished in 1969.|$|E
