Walker, {{assisted}} by Tim Matthewson of Champion Cycles, {{to provide a}} marketable bicycle concept that would appeal to commuters and people wishing to have a practical alternative to the mountain bike and road bike without the complication of derailleurs, and above all, made in the U.S. The bicycles sold for $500- $1000, depending on hubs, and options chosen by the customer.50 framesets were originally fabricated by Tri-Angle Metal Fab in Milton, Vermont, and 50 more were made by Waterford Precision cycles of Waterford, Wisconsin, {{under the guise of}} Richard Schwinn (great grandson of Ignaz Schwinn) and Mark Muller. After that, the CBC built their own in a factory on 363 W. Erie in Chicago, Illinois. The Design of the bicycles was carried out cooperatively between the Team in Vermont and the Team in Chicago. Industrial Designers Mr. Patrick Ege, and Mr. Joe Ryan both based in Chicago at the time worked to develop the frame geometries in CAD, <b>welding</b> <b>jig</b> setups, and completed most of final prototyping and testing. Mr. Ryan also served as the shop foreman and oversaw fabrication at the facility in Chicago including milling operations, welding, and powder coating. Master Bicycle Technician Mr. Vincent Delfini oversaw the buildup of the frames from custom components selected by customers. Approximately 100 or more were made before the company went out of business in 1997.|$|E

25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset <b>welding</b> <b>jigs</b> in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to “rectify the weld cracks by the fabrication of customized jig plates”. In the engine section of the industry, there were frequent rejections of the catalytic converters due to weld cracks. When the catalytic converter assembly line was inspected, tiny cracks in the weld were found visually. Then they were tested through bench magnifiers and dye penetration test for confirmation and it was confirmed to have cracks in the weld. The crack was found in the casting to shell joint of the catalytic converter. Then the casting was tested for its contaminants which could also cause cracks in the weld. The DED (double end drive) <b>welding</b> <b>jig</b> plate setup was also checked thoroughly for any defects. In order to check whether the type of welding used gives better penetration and strength, weld penetration test was done. Finally, after several inspections of the welding process it was found that the crack was due to the biasing of the axis of jig plates. Then, finally the biasing was avoided by fabricating a new jig plate. Thus the entire defect is drastically reduced by minimizing the cracks and thus maintaining the efficiency of the engine...|$|E
40|$|Laser welding {{trials were}} {{performed}} on thin walled cylindrical Grade 250 maraging steel tubes to determine its suitability as a joining process for rocket motor casings. Bead-on-plate (BOP) and butt welded samples were produced utilising a 5 kW Trumpf TLF 5000 HQ CO 2 laser (M 2 = 1. 82) with a 5 -axis TLC 1005 Lasercell and 200 mm focal length off axis parabolic mirror welding head. The samples were subjected to tensile testing after an aging {{post weld heat treatment}} was performed at 480 ºC for 3 hours. Acceptable results were obtained although some concerns emerged regarding the ability of the <b>welding</b> <b>jig</b> to ensure repeatability of joint fit-up and alignment of the laser beam with respect to the seam. Alternative techniques such as dual focus (twin spot), scanner welding, addition of filler material and pulsed Nd:YAG welding were investigated to increase the operating window compared to autogenous single spot laser welding by making the process less sensitive to fit up and alignment. Metallurgical investigations were also performed to compare the microstructures produced by the various welding techniques. Twin spot and pulsed Nd:YAG welding increased the tolerance with regards to laser beam offset to 0. 5 mm compared to 0. 2 mm for single spot autogenous welding. The higher heat input of twin spot resulted in a higher fraction of reverted austenite after PWHT at 480 ºC for 3 h and reduced mechanical properties compared to pulsed Nd:YAG welding. The presence of contamination and misalignment has been found to have a profound impact on weld integrity. Pulsed Nd:YAG welding is the preferred process due to the large operating window, small amount of reverted austenite and excellent weld geometry...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the advancements {{of the application}} of thermal tensioning techniques to different weld geometries in order to eliminate buckling distortion. The main goal of this work is to better understand these techniques through experimental and numerical investigation and increase their technological maturity to aid industrial implementation. The thermal tensioning techniques investigated in this work are Thermal Tensioning by Cooling and Thermal Tensioning by Heating. The investigation for both techniques encompasses thermal source characterisation, application to different weld geometries and residual stress measurements and analysis of both butt and fillet welded samples. A detailed technology transfer study of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling {{was carried out in}} which different aspects of the application of TTC to arc welding (Gas Metal Arc Welding and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) was examined. This study focused on the influence of both the liquid CO 2 delivery system installation and <b>welding</b> tooling and <b>jigging</b> on the effectiveness of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. Experimental and numerical cooling source characterisation was also carried out in the Thermal Tensioning by Cooling work to investigate the characteristics of the cooling source under different cooling conditions. The Thermal Tensioning by Cooling work was then concluded with welding trials and residual stress measurement and analysis. The results of the Thermal Tensioning by Cooling study show that the installation of the liquid CO 2 delivery system as well as the <b>welding</b> tooling and <b>jigging</b> has a major influence on the effectiveness of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. The cooling source characterisation work reveals that the most important parameter of the cryogenic nozzle delivery system used in this work is the Air Entrainment Gap. A description of a control system of Thermal Tensioning by Cooling is suggested based on controlling the Air Entrainment Gap. The residual stress analysis shows a reduction in the Applied Weld Load and minor changes in the tensile peak of the residual stress distribution of both butt and fillet welded panels. The Thermal Tensioning by Heating investigation includes heat source characterisation, application of Thermal Tensioning by Heating on butt and fillet welds, utilisation of alternative heat sources and residual stress analysis. The results of these investigation show that Thermal Tensioning by Heating is also highly effective in eliminating buckling distortion in butt, fillet and overlapped panels. The applied heating temperature in this work is typically in the range of 160 - 250 °C but not greater than 330 °C. The residual stress measurements reveal that the additional heating of Thermal Tensioning by Heating generates a positive stress gradient at the location of heating...|$|R
50|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{manufacturing}} of aluminium boats was to cut out the hull skins and the other sheet metal parts such as the seats using templates under a radial arm router. Sections were then formed by a brake press and swaging, to form the gunwales and hull folds. Stiffening of sheet metal panels was {{by means of a}} 3,000 ton rubber press. Extruded gunwale, keel and strake sections of the hull were initially formed in a half-hard condition for ease of working and drop hammering, later being placed in a curing oven to bring them to full-hard condition. The skin sections were <b>welded</b> on wooden <b>jigs</b> on which the seats, gunwales, decks and extruded sections were positioned and riveted into position. The boat was then tested in a pressure tank to reveal any water leaks. The finished craft was then painted in a temperature-controlled paint shop. de Havilland also produced the polyurethane flotation material used in the boats which shaped and fitted into position. The company was noted for its use of rivets to join sections of the craft, together with the more common use of welding. In its advertisements, de Havilland Marine referred to this riveting process by the Sealomatic name.|$|R
