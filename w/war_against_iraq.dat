25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, the two Bushehr {{reactors}} {{were damaged}} by multiple Iraqi air strikes {{and work on}} the nuclear program came to a standstill. Iran notified the International Atomic Energy Agency of the blasts, and complained about international inaction and the use of French made missiles in the attack. In late 2015, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani revealed that Iran considered pursuing weapons of mass destruction during the <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
25|$|Various {{branches}} of the British military have operated Gazelles in other theatres, such as during the 1991 Gulf <b>War</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> and in the 1999 intervention in Kosovo.

These pictures are still alive in our memory, and our accounts capture indelibly what we went through.|$|E
50|$|The party's {{manifesto}} {{claims the}} necessity {{for the development of}} a new and genuinely socialist movement against a Conservative Party government which functions as the political tool of the super-rich.

50|$|The service {{then turned}} its {{attention}} eastward; Iraq and Jordan became the next targets of Nasser's anti-colonial rhetoric and broadcasts. In an effort rid the Arab world of any Western influence, Voice of the Arabs launched a propaganda <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq's</b> then-Prime Minister Nuri as-Said, criticizing Iraq's {{participation in the}} Baghdad Pact. It also appealed directly to Jordanian citizens, calling them to campaign against Jordan's potential participation in the Baghdad Pact. This continued until the 1958 Iraqi Revolution overthrew the Iraqi monarchy, and Iraq subsequently withdrew its participation from the organization.|$|R

The last time this was invoked was in 1942, to send an expeditionary force to the Philippines, after war was declared against Germany and Japan, following the sinking of two Mexican ships by U-boats. In 1990, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked {{the permission of the}} Congress to send troops to the Gulf War, but it was refused, since there was no declaration of <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E

During his tenure Powell oversaw the 1989 United States invasion of Panama to oust General Manuel Noriega and the 1990 to 1991 Gulf <b>War</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq.</b> General Powell's four-year term as Chairman ended in 1993.|$|E

25|$|As {{the main}} {{presence}} {{of the federal government}} in Portland, it is often the site of protests against the government. These protests have included marchers against U.S. aid given to Israel in February 1988, veterans protesting the lack of funding for medical services provided by the Veterans Administration in January 1989, to those marching for a ban on testing nuclear weapons in August 1989. Other groups have rallied to end homelessness, as well as the Gulf <b>War</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 1991 when nine protesters were arrested at the building. The bombing of Iraq in December 1998 led to further demonstrations, as did the invasion of Iraq in 2003 when seven protesters were arrested in March.|$|E
25|$|The Iraq War (2003–2011) {{began with}} the {{invasion}} of Iraq on March 20, 2003. The government of Canada did not at any time officially declare <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Nevertheless, the country's participation and relationship with the US was redefined at various points in that war. The Canadian Forces were involved in ship escort duties, and expanded their participation in Task Force 151 to free up American naval assets. About a hundred Canadian exchange officers, on exchange to American units, participated in the invasion of Iraq. There were numerous protests and counter-protests related to the conflict in Canada, and some United States Military members sought refuge in the country after deserting their posts to avoid deployment to Iraq.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} {{stages of the}} Cold War, the Royal Navy was reconfigured with three anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{aircraft}} carriers and a force of frigates and destroyers. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic. There were also mine countermeasures and submarine forces as well as support ships. As the Cold War ended, the Royal Navy fought in the Gulf <b>War</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq,</b> with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles sinking {{a large proportion of}} the Iraqi Navy. The WRNS was amalgamated with the RN in 1991. The RN also carried out many mine countermeasures operations. However, the end of the Soviet threat brought about a very large reduction in the strength of the Navy. All its diesel-electric submarines were decommissioned in 1992 and more surface combatants left the fleet.|$|E

However, information obtained by the UK Liberal Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq {{in the second half of}} 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6tons in September – before Congress' 11 October authorization of the invasion.|$|E

He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice."
