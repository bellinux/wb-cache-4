The {{reason is that}} the arising <b>web</b> <b>tensions</b> are too high in relation to the tensile strength of the laminated packaging materials. Tests on a form-, fill- and seal-machine of the Transwrap 125 H type showed that manipulations at the paper surface with the aim to reduce the dynamic friction coefficient are not so efficient. In this case the bending stiffness has to be regarded as the considerable criterion for the machineability.

40|$|International audienceIn web {{transport}} systems, {{the main}} problem is to control the <b>web</b> velocity and <b>tensions</b> independently, to prevent web breaks, folding, or damage. Interesting results have been obtained using multi-variable control strategies. Unfortunately, most of the existing methodologies are either not systematic or deal with the tracking and disturbance rejection problems as a whole, and not separately. This paper presents a complete methodology in order to design two-degrees-of-freedom (2 DOF) controller. The feedforward part {{is based on a}} reference model allowing operators to obtain the desired tracking performances (in particular, <b>web</b> <b>tensions</b> and velocity decoupling). The feedback part ensures robustness and disturbance rejection and is designed using two high-level tuning parameters only, thanks to the Standard State Control (SSC) methodology. However, the system dynamics change greatly during the winding/unwinding process due to the winder/unwinder radius and inertia variations. Therefore, a gain-scheduling controller is derived from the interpolation of consistent realizations of the H 2 controllers obtained at different points of the operating domain. The resulting controller is tested on a realistic simulator first, and after discretization, on a 3 -motor web-handling experimental platfor...|$|R

The estimates of <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> and casting drum speed are incorporated in a new speed control strategy, which counteracts the effects of creep and slip between the drive belt and pulleys. Experimental results demonstrate much improved steady-state speed holding and transient speed response of the casting drum, in comparison with the performance of the original controller: the steady-state speed error with nominal (50 per cent) <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> is reduced from 0. 8 to 0. 1 per cent, while the peak transient speed error for a 25 per cent change in <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> reduces from 4 to 0. 5 per cent...|$|E

In this paper, an adaptive sliding mode (ASM) control strategy is proposed for winding process control. It aims to force system state to move to and maintain on the defined sliding surface without fluctuation. An embedded neural fuzzy approximator is developed to improve the transient response and enhance <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> control; an A-function is suggested to improve control operation stability; and the controller’s convergence is improved by a hybrid training algorithm. The effectiveness of the developed ASM control is verified by experimental tests.

If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam <b>web</b> and <b>tension</b> flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|R

This work concerns the analysis of relation between various parameters (variables) characterizing the paper, printing press, the printing process and the web break occurrence. A large number of variables, 61 in total, obtained off-line as well as measured online during the printing process are used in the investigation. Each paper reel is characterized by a vector x of 61 components. Two main approaches are explored. The first one treats the problem as a data classification task into "break" and "non break" classes. The procedures of classifier training, the selection of relevant input variables and the selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier are aggregated into one process based on genetic search. The second approach combines procedures of genetic search based variable selection and data mapping into a low dimensional space. The genetic search process results into a variable set providing the best mapping according to some quality function. The empirical study was performed using data collected at a pressroom in Sweden. The total number of data points available for the experiments was equal to 309. Amongst those, only 37 data points represent the web break cases. The results of the investigations have shown that the linear relations between the independent variables and the web break frequency are not strong. Three important groups of variables were identified, namely Lab data (variables characterizing paper properties and measured off-line in a paper mill lab), Ink registry (variables characterizing operator actions aimed to adjust ink registry) and <b>Web</b> <b>tension.</b> We found that the most important variables are: Ink registry Y LS MD (adjustments of yellow ink registry in machine direction on the lower paper side), Air permeability (character- izes paper porosity), Paper grammage, Elongation MD, and four variables characterizing web tension: Moment mean, Min sliding Mean, <b>Web</b> <b>tension</b> variance, and <b>Web</b> <b>tension</b> mean.

Literature has mostly focused on the control of <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> and velocity, but has {{paid little attention to}} the control of web displacement. However, the control of the longitudinal displacement of web is important for register error reduction in multicolor image printing or multilayer flexible electronics printing. Hence, our result adds a new dimension to the control of roll-to-roll web systems. First, the dynamics of a class of roll-to-roll systems are reviewed and transformed into a form in which the longitudinal displacement of web can be observed directly. Second, the roll-to-roll systems are constructively shown to be differentially flat and thus dynamically feedback linearizable to chains of integrators. Third, a procedure for tracking control synthesis is provided for reference signals that are parameterized by flat output. The closed-loop system is shown to asymptotically track the reference inputs even in the presence of initial tracking errors and disturbances over finite time intervals. Last, a simulation study is carried out to illustrate the excellent tracking performance of the closed-loop system...|$|E

The two-dimensional problem where the points are at the vertices of a convex polygon is essentially solved: each multiplet of forces must be such that the net anticlockwise torque around any vertex of the forces summed over any number of consecutive points clockwise past the vertex must be non-negative; and one can find a truss structure that supports under tension, and only supports, those force multiplets in a convex polyhedron of force multiplets that is generated by a finite number of force multiplets each satisfying the torque condition. Progress is also made on the problem where only a subset of the points are at the vertices of a convex polygon, and the other points are inside. In particular, in the case where only one point is inside, an explicit procedure is described for constructing a suitable truss, if one exists. An alternative recipe to that provided by Guevara-Vasquez, Milton, and Onofrei (2011), based on earlier work of Camar Eddine and Seppecher (2003), is given for constructing a truss structure, with elements under either compression or tension, that supports an arbitrary collection of balanced forces at the vertices of a convex polygon.

40|$|A typical {{continuous}} web-processing machine {{consists of}} hundreds of idle rollers and web spans. A web span is formed by tensioning a thin film (the web) over at least two idle rollers. Machine drive controls, bearing friction, and air impingement on the web surface represent some {{of the factors that}} can influence <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> and web speed. A significant effort is devoted to maintaining uniform <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> and web speed in these machines. The uniformity of these parameters is a requirement to consistently manufacture web products within rigorous quality specifications. In support of this effort to control <b>web</b> <b>tension</b> and web speed, reports have been published to investigate the vibration response of the web-idle roller system. The machine is modeled as a multidegree-of-freedom system consisting of numerous springs and masses connected in series. The equivalent spring and mass elements are represented by the web span and roller inertia respectively. The scope of this investigation is limited to the analysis of the axial vibration of a single web span and idle roller interface. The two main objectives of this work are to characterize the axial vibration response of a single web span and numerically determine axial displacements of the web. A correlation is made between the axial displacement (less than 0. 05 inch) of the web relative to the surface of an idle roller and small scratches (0. 005 - 0. 010 inch long) formed {{on the surface of the}} web. The web is assumed to be an elastic member subject to tensile forces only. The one-dimensional wave equation is shown to be the governing equation of motion for the web-idle roller system. Boundary conditions are developed to accommodate the web-idle roller interface at one end of the web and the input tension force at the opposite end. A simplifying assumption of the model is that the average web speed is zero. The effect of zero average web speed is assumed to be small because the wave speed is nearly 1000 times greater than the typical average web conveyance speed of 250 feet per minute.
