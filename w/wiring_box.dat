For its associations with ceilings and confidentiality, refer to the Scottish Government's Sub Rosa initiative. Through its promise of secrecy, the rose, suspended above a meeting table, symbolises the freedom to speak plainly without repercussion. The physical carving of a rose on a ceiling was {{used for this purpose}} during the rule of England's Tudor King Henry VIII and has over the centuries evolved into a standard item of domestic vernacular architecture, {{to such an extent that}} it now constitutes a term for the aforementioned circular device that conceals and comprises the <b>wiring</b> <b>box</b> for an overhead light fitting.|$|E

There {{had once been a}} Papa Mouse as well; but while he was hunting for food one night he saw a nice piece of cheese in a <b>wire</b> <b>box,</b> and {{attempted}} to get it. The minute he stuck his head into the box, however, it closed with a snap that nearly cut his head off; and when Mamma Mouse came down to look for him he was quite dead.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{based on}} the {{experiment}} simulated the short circuit of the electrical fire situation, {{and with the help}} of the theoretical calculation and numerical simulation, sets out to study the copper wire short circuit melted bead ignition capability for the combustible. From the experiment and calculation, it is found that the melted bead diameter and the fallen height that is from <b>wire</b> <b>box</b> to the combustible are important factors for the melted bead ignition capability. Meanwhile, to further study two related factors, the melted bead diameter is the key factor for the ignition capability for the combustible to some extent...|$|R

He invented a device called the Tipsy <b>Wire</b> <b>Box,</b> which could be {{attached}} to a piano {{to make it sound}} like an out-of-tune barrelhouse upright. (Another interpretation is that [...] "Tipsy Wire Box" [...] was a slang expression for the piano itself, which was merely [...] "detuned"; that is, one of the three strings that make up each note of the main section of the piano is slightly flatted, giving the piano the characteristic sound.) ...|$|R

50|$|Guba Lafto has a mountainous landscape, {{with its}} ranging from 1300 to 3900 meters above sea level. Soil erosion {{is marked by}} ever-expanding gullies. Increasing {{population}} has led to shrinking farm and grazing areas. Declining soil fertility, increased incidence of crop pests and weeds, along with cultural attitudes have made Guba Lafto {{as one of the}} food insecure woredas of the Amhara Region. To help combat this, the AMAREW project helped inhabitants of kebeles located in the Lenche Dima watershed to create micro-enterprises to manufacture gabion <b>wire</b> <b>boxes.</b> Produced at a third of the cost they can be purchased at Debre Tabor, these gabions are used to fight gully formation.|$|R

5000|$|A {{breakout}} box {{serves as a}} troubleshooting tool to determine the wiring of an electrical connector interface on a networking device or computer. Typically, a {{breakout box}} is inserted between two electrical devices to determine which signal or power interconnects are active. Breakout boxes are extremely useful in troubleshooting connection problems resulting from manufacturing errors (e.g., miswiring) or defective interconnects resulting from broken <b>wiring.</b> Breakout <b>boxes</b> are specific examples of a more general category of network testing equipment called [...] "status monitors".|$|R
25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph <b>wire,</b> indicating the <b>box</b> number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of <b>wire</b> and 45 <b>boxes</b> in Boston.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{scenario}} instructions, players find the relevant map tile boards and arrange them together forming the game board (battlefield). Battlefields often comprise terrain {{that is a}} mix of rough, clear, buildings, woods, hills, etc. Roads and streams can meander through particular areas either easing or obstructing vehicle and troop movement but may also provide cover. Furthermore, entrenchments, razor <b>wire,</b> pill <b>boxes,</b> tank traps, minefields and other obstructions often abound, creating a variety of tactical considerations. For instance, tank traps will impede movement of tanks, but infantry squad movement is unaffected while actually providing them some cover.|$|R

50|$|In professionally built wire-wrap boards, long wires {{are placed}} first so that shorter wires {{mechanically}} secure the long wires. Also, {{to make an}} assembly more repairable, wires are applied in layers. The ends of each wire are always {{at the same height}} on the post, so that at most three wires need to be replaced to replace a wire. Also, to make the layers easier to see, they are made with different colors of insulation. In space-rated or airworthy wire-wrap assemblies, the <b>wires</b> are <b>boxed,</b> and may be conformally coated with wax to reduce vibration. Epoxy is never used for the coating because it makes an assembly unrepairable.|$|R

These screw-terminal blocks have been slowly replaced by 110 blocks and connectors. Modern homes usually have phone service entering the house to a single 110 block, whence it is distributed by on-premises <b>wiring</b> to outlet <b>boxes</b> throughout the home in star topology. At the outlet box, cables are punched down IDC type connectors, which fit in special faceplates.|$|R

5|$|The Dunstanburgh Castle {{golf course}} was built near the {{property}} in 1900, and expanded by the castle's then owner, Sir Arthur Sutherland, in 1922. By the 1920s Sutherland {{could no longer afford}} to maintain the castle, and he placed it into the guardianship of the state in 1930. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, measures were taken to defend the Northumberland coastline from a potential German invasion. The castle was used as an observation post and the site was refortified with trenches, barbed <b>wire,</b> pill <b>boxes</b> and a mine field. In the 21st century the castle is owned by the National Trust and run by English Heritage.
