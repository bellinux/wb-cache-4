5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|C. Rudhraiya, whose former {{name was}} Aarumugam, was {{introduced}} to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three shared {{an interest in the}} works of Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. K. Rajeshwar was writing a script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script would be used for the film; the result was Aval Appadithan. The initial script by Rajeshwar consisted of two pages.|$|E
5|$|For Invasion of the Vorticons, John Carmack and Romero focused {{exclusively}} on the programming, while Adrian Carmack joined late in development and had a personal art style that did not match with the game. As a result, the game was largely shaped by designer Tom Hall's personal experiences and interests. Keen's red sneakers and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, {{such as that of}} the id. For Keen Dreams, the team reprised their roles, and used the game as a prototype for what they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> for the next Keen games for Apogee: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel.|$|E

5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E
5|$|The plenum {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them with information on how to run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the internal balance of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need to go beyond political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Abzû {{lay in the}} {{development}} of Journey, an independent video game developed by Thatgamecompany and released in 2012. Abzûs creator, director and art director Matt Nava had previously worked as art director for Journey during its three-year development. Having worked in a game featuring a desert setting, Nava <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> to a more vibrant and populated setting for his next title. Nava began creating the pitch for Abzû before leaving Thatgamecompany and founding the game's developer Giant Squid Studios. One of the main elements Nava incorporated was his love for ancient cultures and their artwork, particularly relating to the myths surrounding the concept of Abzu. Nava's love of the ocean, which he explored through his hobby of scuba diving, also figured heavily in the design of Abzû. The team at Giant Squid Studios grew to ten developers from across the industry, mainly programmers who specialized in multiple aspects of game design from gameplay to graphics, in addition to a graphical and technical artist who helped create and animate the character models. The game was first announced at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). It was later previewed at E3 2016. The game was released digitally on PlayStation 4 via PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows through Steam on August 2, 2016. It released on Xbox One through Xbox Live on December 6. The game received a physical release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 31, 2017. All versions were published by 505 Games.|$|E
