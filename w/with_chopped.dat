40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether the relative dose-intensity of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy {{could be improved}} by prophylactic administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged 65 to 90 years (median, 72 years) with stage II to IV aggressive NHL {{were randomly assigned to}} receive standard CHOP every 3 weeks or CHOP plus G-CSF every 3 weeks on days 2 to 11 of each cycle. RESULTS: In 389 eligible patients, the relative dose intensities (RDIs) of cyclophosphamide (median, 96. 3 % v 93. 9 %; P =. 01) and doxorubicin (median, 95. 4 % v 93. 3 %; P =. 04) were higher in patients treated <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> plus G-CSF. The complete response rates were 55 % and 52 % for CHOP and CHOP plus G-CSF, respectively (P =. 63). The actuarial overall survival at 5 years was 22 % <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> alone, compared <b>with</b> 24 % <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> plus G-CSF (P =. 76), with a median follow-up of 33 months. Patients treated <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> plus G-CSF had an identical incidence of infections, with World Health Organization grade 3 to 4 (34 of 1, 191 cycles v 36 of 1, 195 cycles). Only the cumulative days with antibiotics were fewer <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> plus G-CSF (median, 0 v 6 days; P =. 006) than <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> alone. The number of hospital admissions and the number of days in hospital were not different. CONCLUSION: In elderly patients, G-CSF improved the RDI of CHOP, but this did not lead to a higher complete response rate or better overall survival. G-CSF did not prevent serious infection...|$|R

5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches <b>with</b> <b>chopped</b> nuts or olives.|$|E

40|$|In {{patients}} with intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), third generation chemotherapy regimens {{have been introduced}} to improve survival in comparison <b>with</b> the standard <b>CHOP</b> regimen. However, most studies have found no {{difference between these two}} treatments. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of third generation regimens as compared <b>with</b> <b>CHOP.</b> Our study included the randomized controlled trials published in English from 1970 to 1999. After a Medline search, 5 trials were found to meet our inclusion criteria. A total of 1982 patients, that were enrolled in these trials, were included in the survival meta-analysis. Our methodology retrieved patient-level information from all of these subjects; survival up to 9 years after randomization was compared between the two treatment options. The results of our meta-analysis showed that, in comparison <b>with</b> <b>CHOP,</b> third generation chemotherapy did not prolong survival at levels of statistical significance (chi-square by log-rank test = 1. 44, P = 0. 23). The relative death risk for third generation regimens vs. CHOP was 0. 92 (95 %CI: 0. 80 to 1. 06;P = 0. 26). We conclude that, on the basis of our meta-analysis, third generation regimens do not confer any survival benefit to {{patients with}} intermediate or high grade NHL as compared <b>with</b> <b>CHOP...</b>|$|R

25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver <b>with</b> <b>chopped</b> giblet, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, wine, verjuice, beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy of Aidi injection combined <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of malignant lymphoma. Methods: We made an electronic search in the database of Wanfang, CNKI, and PubMed. All the clinical studies related to Aidi injection combined <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of malignant lymphoma were screened and reviewed. The combined objective response rate (ORR), life quality improvement, and hematological toxicity were pooled by random- or fixed-effect model according to the heterogeneity across the included study. Moreover, the publication bias was evaluated by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's line regression test. Results: Eight prospective clinical trials with 513 subjects (273 in the Aidi injection plus CHOP group and 240 in the CHOP group) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that Aidi injection combined <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> chemotherapy regimen can significantly improve the ORR (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 68, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 09 ‚Äì 2. 60, P < 0. 05), improve the life quality (OR = 3. 32, 95 % CI: 1. 97 ‚Äì 5. 58, P < 0. 05), and decrease the risk of developing leukopenia (OR = 0. 25, 95 % CI: 0. 17 ‚Äì 0. 39, P < 0. 05) and thrombocytopenia (OR = 0. 34, 95 % CI: 0. 22 ‚Äì 0. 53, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: With the present evidence, Aidi injection combined <b>with</b> <b>CHOP</b> chemotherapy regimen can improve the treatment response and quality of life and decrease the risk of developing severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia...|$|R
