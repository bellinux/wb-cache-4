50|$|During March 1944 {{the unit}} rescued a {{disabled}} seaman from a tanker {{off the coast}} of San Cristóbal Island. Capt. Walter H. Hunt, Flight Commander of the 29th B.S. and pilot of the B-24 that aided in the immediate rescue of the seaman filed the following report: On 21 March 1944, a tanker en route to the Galapagos, at a point about sixty miles east of San Cristobal island, radioed this base for aid. An emergency existed because of the sudden illness of one of the tanker's crew. The crash boat was sent out to intercept the tanker and take the sick man aboard and return to this base. At 1700 G.C.T. the boat had reached a point about forty miles from the probable position of the tanker. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> a B-24 to guide the boat to the tanker. After finding the crash boat, we flew the same course that it was sailing until we picked up the tanker on radar. We circled the tanker and headed back to the crash boat, directing them to take up a corrected heading. We then flew back to the tanker, and after many attempts, got the tanker to change course so that it was headed towards the crash boat. When the sick crewman had been taken aboard and the crash boat was under way for the Galapagos we returned to the base.|$|E

5000|$|However, in September 2012, Stanton {{announced}} that his next directorial effort would be Pixar's Finding Dory, {{and that the}} plan to film a John Carter sequel [...] "went away" [...] and has been cancelled. Kitsch later stated he will not make another John Carter film unless Stanton returns as director. In a May 2014 interview, he added [...] "I still talk to Lynn Collins almost daily. Those relationships that were born won’t be broken by people we never met. I miss the family. I miss Andrew Stanton. I know the second script was awesome. We had to plant a grounding, so <b>we</b> could really <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> the second one. The second one was even more emotionally taxing, which was awesome." [...] Stanton tweeted both titles and logos for the sequels {{that would have been}} made with the titles being Gods of Mars as the sequel, and Warlord of Mars as the third film.|$|R
40|$|Problem based {{teaching}} {{has been}} on the agenda in higher education for at least the last twenty years and is embedded in professional educations often to prepare students for real life problem solving. However, in when higher education rather aim to provide deeper theoretical and reflective competences promoting the students capacities to address unpredictable challenges in different contexts, there might be other ways of applying and using problem based educational tools. In this paper we describe and discuss our experiences of such attempts in three different higher educational programs. The three educational settings are a Master of European and International relations, teacher-training courses on master level and Master of Political Science. The work on our new curriculums and pedagogical approaches has taken place within a development project and we have shared ideas and experiences throughout the project. The approach has been differently designed into the three programs but the common focus has been that <b>we</b> do not <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> the problem, but the students have to find the problem and explain how it fits to the theories they learn. We conclude, so far, that a key for success is to present and introduce the students to the model of teaching to be successful...|$|R
500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I sat in my seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I remember the first time <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our clothes <b>in</b> front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{insightful}} essay {{accompanying the}} first {{recording of the}} work, Tippett writes:About the time I was finishing 'The Midsummer Marriage' I was sitting one day in a small studio of Radio Lugano, {{looking out over the}} sunlit lake, listening to tapes of Vivaldi. Some pounding cello and bass C's, as I remember them, suddenly threw me from Vivaldi's world into my own, and marked the exact moment of conception of the 2nd Symphony. Vivaldi's pounding C's took on a kind of archetypal quality as though to say: here is where we must begin. The 2nd Symphony does begin in that archetypal way, though the pounding C's are no longer Vivaldi's. At once horns in fifths with F sharps force the ear away from the C ground. I don't think we ever hear the C's as classically stating the key of C. We only hear them as a base, or ground upon which we can build, or from which <b>we</b> can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> flight. When the C's return {{at the end of the}} Symphony, we feel satisfied and the work completed, though the final chord which is directed to [...] "let vibrate in the air," [...] builds up from the bass C thus: C16 C8 G C4 D2 AC#E.It was some years after the incident in Lugano before I was ready to begin composition. While other works were being written I pondered and prepared the Symphony's structure: a dramatic sonata allegro; a song-form slow movement; a mirror-form scherzo in additive rhythm; a fantasia for a finale. Apart from the rather hazy memory of the Vivaldi C's, I wrote down no themes or motives during this period. I prefer to invent the work's form in as great a detail as I can before I invent any sounds whatever. But as the formal invention proceeds, textures, speeds, dynamics, become part of the formal process. So that one comes closer and closer to the sound itself until the moment when the dam breaks and the music of the opening bars spills out over the paper. As I reached this moment in the Symphony the BBC commissioned the piece for the 10th anniversary of the Third Programme, but in the event I was a year late. It was performed first in the Royal Festival Hall, London, in February 1958 and conducted by Adrian Boult.|$|R
