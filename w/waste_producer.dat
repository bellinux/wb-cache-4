40|$|The mining {{industry}} is a fundamental industry involved {{in the development of}} modern society, but is also the world’s largest <b>waste</b> <b>producer.</b> This role will be enhanced in the future, because ore grades are generally decreasing, thus leading to increases in the waste/metal production ratio. Mine wastes deposited on-land in so-called tailings dams, impoundments or waste-dumps have several associated environmental issues {{that need to be addressed}} (e. g., acid mine drainage formation due to sulphide oxidation, geotechnical stability, among others), and social concerns due to land use during mining. The {{mining industry}} recognizes these concerns and is searching for waste management alternatives for the future.

After the occurrence of some severe environmental pollution, today the deposition in the deep sea (under constant reducing conditions) is seen as a new, more secure option, due to the general thought that sulphide minerals are geochemically stable under the reduced conditions prevailing in the deep marine environment.

On the other hand, depletion of natural aggregate deposits is an important incentive to search for substitutes, which would be suitable for the development of road infrastructure or which could be used in earth structure engineering to construct hydroengineering objects.

40|$|Because of {{increasing}} environmental demands, especially {{on dealing with}} products end of life phase, product manufacturers and designers must consider the future disposal of their products. For conventional materials like steel and aluminium well-functioning recycling methods exists. This {{is not the case}} for structures of polymer composites, which are used more extensively, especially for structures like vehicles and vessels. Several techniques do exist but they are not yet commercially available. The current disposal methods of polymer composites are landfill and incineration. Polymer composites are materials, which consist of several materials like fibre, matrix, and additives. This circumstance complicates the waste treatment of composite materials. Therefore, it is necessary to develop adequate waste treatment techniques for polymer composites including sandwich structures. Recommendations for waste treatment have been formed for a number of polymer composites. These recommendations are based on the analysis of costs and environmental effects and they compare different scenarios for mechanical material recycling and energy recovery by waste incineration. Recycling of the polymer materials largely depends on the type of polymer matrix. Incineration is one of the methods for waste treatment of polymer composite materials, because it can be used for energy recovery. However, waste incineration will always result in a additional cost for the <b>waste</b> <b>producer.</b> Many investigations have pointed out recycling of polymer composite materials as the best alternative considering environmental effects. Since recycling of polymer composites is a complicated process, especially recycling thermoset composite it is important to acquire comprehensive information about the constituents of these materials. ...|$|E

Having purified water and different types of solid waste as a final product, the wastewater purification in municipal {{and other types of}} treatment plants is actually an advanced imitation of water self-purification as it occurs in nature. A major part of waste produced by municipal treatment plants represents active sewage sludge, which is a product of a waste water treatment process, specifically the aerobic biological treatment.

The Diploma thesis discuses alternative options of the final treatment, the different ways this problem is addressed in certain foreign countries, the future prospects, and the current legislation in this field. Due to a large content of organic matter and its non-hazard behaviour, the waste sewage sludge can be recycled as an alternative solid fuel, thus enabling exploitation of its energy potential.

The recovery of packaging waste generated in the fast food industry is demanded by the packaging waste legislation and expected by the public. The means are revealed by the general factors influencing the recovery of packaging waste, analysed by a multidisciplinary literature review and a case study focusing on the packaging waste managementof McDonald's Oy operating in Finland. The existing solid waste infrastructure does not promote the recovery ofpackaging waste generated in the fast food industry. The theoretical recovery rate of the packaging waste is high, 93 %, while the actual recovery rate is only 29 % consisting of secondary packaging manufactured from cardboard. The total recovery potential of packaging waste is 64 %, resulting in 1 230 tonnes ofrecoverable packaging waste. The achievable recovery potential of 33 %, equalling 647 tonnes of packaging waste could be recovered, but is not recovered mainly because of non-working waste management practises.

The industry, particularly in the packaging industry has been a massive <b>waste</b> <b>producer,</b> although recently it has forced the use of new materials and it started to focus on environmentally friendly technologies. During the transportation of finished and semi-finished Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) sensitive products, the product packaging system has a vital role. These kind of packaging materials must be suitable to both logistic (protection against mechanical and environmental stresses) and special ESD protection requirements. During the transportation of printed-circuit electronic products, ESD defense is then of primary significance. However there is a huge disadvantage for the use of various shield bags. Namely, this kind of associated packaging is particularly pollutant, it causes a lot of inconvenience in the form of waste. In order to rule out these materials from the packaging system, new innovative solutions have to be found. The investigated TPS (thermoplastic starch biodegradable foam) is subjected to a validation, a long process to certify that this material unites properties of two types of packaging materials at the same time. On the one hand, this packaging foam has to meet the requirements product defense. On the other hand, the material must be anti-static under the logistic stress effects. In case it is found suitable, it can be an alternative of the conventional materials. In this article, we investigate the ESD characteristic of TPS foam.
