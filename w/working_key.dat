50|$|For example, a {{replacement}} for WEP, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), uses three levels of keys: master key, <b>working</b> <b>key</b> and RC4 key. The master WPA key is shared with each client and access point and is used in a protocol called Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to create new working keys frequently enough to thwart known attack methods. The working keys are then combined with a longer, 48-bit IV to form the RC4 key for each packet. This design mimics the WEP approach enough to allow WPA {{to be used with}} first-generation Wi-Fi network cards, some of which implemented portions of WEP in hardware.

40|$|For {{families}} with a disabled child, the usual challenges {{of family life}} can be further complicated {{by the need to}} access a wide range of services provided by a plethora of professionals and agencies. <b>Key</b> <b>working</b> aims to support children and their families in navigating these complexities ensuring easy access to relevant, high quality, and coordinated care. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the key worker role in relation to “being a key worker” and “having a key worker”. The data within this paper draw on a larger evaluation study of the Blackpool Early Support Pilot Programme. The qualitative study used an appreciative and narrative approach and utilised mixed methods (interviews, surveys and a nominal group workshop). Data were collected from 43 participants (parents, key workers, and other stakeholders). All stakeholders who had been involved with the service were invited to participate. In the paper we present and discuss the ways in which <b>key</b> <b>working</b> made a difference to the lives of children and their families. We also consider how <b>key</b> <b>working</b> transformed the perspectives of the key workers creating a deeper and richer understanding of family lives and the ways in which other disciplines and agencies worked. <b>Key</b> <b>working</b> contributed to the shift to a much more family-centred approach, and enhanced communication and information sharing between professionals and agencies improved. This resulted in families feeling more informed. Key workers acted in an entrepreneurial fashion, forging new relationships with families and between families and other stakeholders. Parents of young disabled children and their service providers benefited from <b>key</b> <b>working.</b> Much of the benefit accrued came from strong, relational, and social-professional networking which facilitated the embedding of new ways of working into everyday practice. Using an appreciative inquiry approach provided an effective and relevant way of engaging with parents, professionals, and other stakeholders to explore what was <b>working</b> well with <b>key</b> <b>working</b> within an Early Support Pilot Programme...|$|R

In this contex, touristic customers want high quality of delivered services, at appropriate prices, on appropriate destinations, at appropriate time. The process of delivering services with the desired high quality requires efficient management with human resources. Continuous training of human resources increases the quality of services and the result of this is increased user’s satisfaction and increased possibility for their visit again in the future. The focus of this paper is improving the quality of human resources management and their continuous training, and thus developing values from services used by the customers.

These additional costs {{must be taken into}} account when analysing the motivation to work as not to do so could underestimate the incentives to takeup paid employment. Using data from the Irish Household Budget Survey, this paper takes a two-stage logit model and Hausman selection model to control for selection effects to estimate the additional costs an employed CES faces compared to an unemployed CES. The main finding is that the additional costs of working are highly significant at nearly € 7000 per year without children; increasing to nearly € 9000 per year with one child under the age of five. These substantial additional costs seriously hamper work incentives as it is shown that there is a 25 -fold increase (without young children) in the number of individuals who have a higher income when unemployed than when in employment with the inclusion of these additional costs of <b>working.</b> <b>Key</b> words: costs of working, work incentive...|$|E

It is field and survey type and using standard questionnaires also using descriptive and inferential statistics on population, including managers, assistances, employees. According to results knowledge management, ideas, missions and work of group have effect on individual entrepreneurship of personnel.
