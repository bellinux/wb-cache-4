5|$|Hester Thrale did not {{completely}} abandon Johnson, {{and asked him}} to accompany the family on a trip to Brighton. He agreed, and was with them from 7 October until 20 November 1782. On his return, his health began to fail, and he <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> after Boswell's visit on 29 May 1783.|$|E
5|$|During summer 1797, Coleridge {{spent time}} with many of his friends, {{including}} John Thelwall, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Thomas Poole, and his wife Sara Fricker. During this time, he suffered an accident in which his foot was burned. As a result, he <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> at Poole's property underneath a lime tree, while Lamb, the Wordsworths and his wife went on a journey across the Quantocks.|$|E
5|$|On January 5, 1874, {{after five}} years of {{suffering}} with tuberculosis, Buckner's wife died. Now a widower, Buckner continued to live in Louisville until 1877 when he and his daughter Lily returned to the family estate, Glen Lily, in Munfordville. His sister, a recent widow, also returned to the estate in 1877. For six years, these three inhabited and repaired the house and grounds which had been neglected during the war and its aftermath. On June 14, 1883, Lily Buckner married Morris B. Belknap of Louisville, and the couple made their residence in Louisville. On October 10 of the same year, Buckner's sister died, and he <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E

5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} success with Scotland, Henry hesitated to invade France, {{annoying}} Charles. Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged Montreuil. The other, under Suffolk, laid siege to Boulogne. Henry later took personal command, and Boulogne fell on 18 September 1544. However, Henry had refused Charles' request to march against Paris. Charles' own campaign fizzled, {{and he made}} peace with France that same day. Henry <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> against France, unable to make peace. Francis attempted to invade England {{in the summer of}} 1545, but reached only the Isle of Wight before being repulsed. Out of money, France and England signed the Treaty of Camp on 7 June 1546. Henry secured Boulogne for eight years. The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns (£750,000). Henry needed the money; the 1544 campaign had cost £650,000, and England was once again bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Immediately the American {{forces were}} hit with machine gun and mortar {{fire from the}} north ridge, where North Korean troops had been dug in. The first burst of machine gun fire killed Chae and wounded {{most of the other}} commanders, {{including}} Mott. Mott managed {{to make it to the}} ditch where American forces dug him a foxhole, but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion. North Korean forces had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground, both from the pass and from the ridge. Mortar fire knocked out many parked vehicles, including the radio jeep of a US Air Force tactical air-control party which was to direct airstrikes. During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying in vain to contact the party, and when unable to do so, left the area without making any strikes.|$|E

5|$|Singh {{enrolled}} in the British Indian Army on 20 May 1936, and {{was assigned to the}} 1st Punjab Regiment. Between 1940 and 1945, he served on the North-West Frontier and as an instructor, before deploying to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. After independence, he took part in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, serving with the Indian Army's 6th Rajputana Rifles. During the battle, Singh was part of the leading section of a company that was assigned to capture a Pakistani post at Tithwal, in Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after their attack was launched, the company suffered heavy casualties. In time, Singh successfully occupied a Pakistani medium machine-gun post. But, by that time, the entire company lay dead or wounded. Singh <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> to achieve the objective. He moved out and lobbed grenades at the next enemy post. Before moving to another trench, he received a mortal bullet wound to the head.|$|E
5|$|Soult {{was in a}} dilemma. He {{could not}} defend both the {{important}} southwestern port of Bordeaux and Toulouse. He decided that trying to hold Bordeaux would put the Garonne Estuary at his back {{and that it would}} be difficult to obtain food in that area. Therefore, the French marshal determined to operate to the east in the direction of Toulouse. On 2 March, the Allies clashed with the French at Aire-sur-l'Adour in a combat that cost the French about 250 men killed and wounded, including 12 officers, and 100 captured. Hippolita Da Costa sent his Portuguese brigade to attack a strong position. When it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men, Da Costa failed to rally the soldiers and was replaced in command. British losses were 156 killed and wounded in the 2nd Division. After this action with Hill, Harispe abandoned Aire. Soult withdrew to a position between Maubourguet and Plaisance where his army <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> for ten days.|$|E
5|$|The Overland Campaign was {{a series}} of battles fought in Virginia during May and June 1864. Sigel's and Butler's efforts sputtered, and Grant <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone</b> to fight Lee. Grant crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, attacking Lee in the Battle of the Wilderness, a three-day battle with many casualties. Rather than retreat as his {{predecessors}} had done, Grant flanked Lee's army to the southeast and attempted to wedge his forces between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House. Lee's army got to Spotsylvania first and a costly battle ensued, lasting thirteen days. Grant attempted to break through Lee's defenses, resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War, known as the Battle of the Bloody Angle. Unable to break Lee's lines, Grant again flanked the rebels to the southeast, meeting at North Anna, where a battle lasted three days.|$|E

25|$|Initially, it was {{reported}} that the man was an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh. There had been calls from local organisations to expel outsiders.

25|$|Since 1680 the Dzungars {{had ruled}} as suzerain masters over the Tarim, for 16 more years using the Chagatai as their puppet rulers.

Although the Uighur's culture and religion <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone,</b> the Dzungars substantially exploited them economically.|$|E

They agreed Fox's conduct {{had been very}} ill-judged, and very distressing: that to {{separate}} from him would be highly disagreeable, yet that to remain with him after what he professed, was giving their tacit approbation to the sentiments he had avowed in the House of Commons, on the Parliamentary Reform, which sentiments were in direct contradiction to theirs.|$|E

As soon as the plane took off, the air traffic controllers alerted the United States Coast Guard and the MacDill Air Force Base.

His quest led him to the planet Oblivion, a surreal and brutal world ruled by Destrii's mother, the Matriax. Izzy was rescued and returned to her original form, while Oblivion's court system and the menace of the Horde were both destroyed, leaving Destrii free to leave her world and explore the universe with her roguish uncle Jodafra. However, Izzy had decided she wanted to return home to her family, and the Doctor <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh {{were sent}} in to bat, and Lasith Malinga took one wicket in three {{expensive}} opening overs, but Shahriar Nafees and Habibul Bashar took {{the fight to}} the Sri Lankan seam bowlers. With the score 35 for 1 after 7 overs, Atapattu brought on off spinner Muralitharan - who had quietly taken three for 42 in the first innings - and he immediately delivered. His third ball to Shahriar <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>alone,</b> and clattered into the opener's stumps - out for 13. Mohammad Ashraful only lasted one ball, trapped lbw by the doosra. Rain then provided relief for the Bangladeshis, as the second day's play was ended prematurely, but they looked to struggle to another innings defeat.|$|E
