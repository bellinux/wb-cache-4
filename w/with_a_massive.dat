5|$|A Late Preclassic tomb {{has been}} excavated, {{believed}} to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial1; it was found during excavations of Structure7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure.

The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring , which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD100–200.|$|E
5|$|Adam's main rival was William Chambers (1723–96), another Scot, but born in Sweden. He {{did most}} of his work in London, with {{a small number of}} houses in Scotland. He was {{appointed}} architectural tutor to the Prince of Wales, later George III, and in 1766, with Robert Adam, as Architect to the King. More international in outlook than Adam, he combined Neo-classicism and Palladian conventions and his influence was mediated through his large number of pupils. The classical influence also reached church architecture. Scots-born architect James Gibbs (1682–1754) introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive,</b> steepled portico and rectangular, side-aisled plan. Similar patterns in Scotland can be seen at St Andrew's in the Square, Glasgow (1737–59), designed by Allan Dreghorn (1706–64) and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth. Gibbs' own design for St. Nicholas West, Aberdeen (1752–55), had the same rectangular plan, with a nave-and-aisles, barrel-vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front.|$|E

Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for the Union army. Finally, under the cover of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for the Union army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E

5|$|On 14 October 1548 (13th waxing of Tazaungmon 910 ME), the Burmese three armies left Martaban {{to start}} the invasion.

From there they travelled by boat toward the town of Kanchanaburi. Tabinshwehti travelled in great state <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> retinue of elephants and servants. Many of these elephants carried muskets and bronze cannon; these were kept close to the king. Royal elephants were rafted across rivers, while the ordinary war elephants marched upstream to a ford. The Burmese king was accompanied by his crown prince Bayinnaung, Bayinnaung's thirteen-year-old son Nanda, and many richly attired lords. Hundreds of workmen marched ahead of the king's retinue, to pitch a richly decorated wooden camp, painted and gilded for the King's use, only to pack it up and pitch it at a new location every day.|$|E

The Battle of Berlin began at 03:30 on 16 April <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> {{artillery}} barrage. Within the week, fighting was taking place inside the city. Among the many elements defending Berlin were French, Latvian, and Scandinavian Waffen-SS troops. Hitler, now living in the Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery, still hoped that his remaining SS soldiers could rescue the capital. In spite of the hopelessness of the situation, members of the SS patrolling the city continued to shoot or hang soldiers and civilians for what they considered to be acts of cowardice or defeatism. The Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May, two days after Hitler committed suicide. As members of SS expected little mercy from the Red Army, they attempted to move westward to surrender to the western Allies instead.|$|E

5|$|The Viet Minh {{opened fire}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> {{artillery}} bombardment in March. After several days the French artillery commander, Charles Piroth, unable {{to respond with}} any effective counterbattery fire, committed suicide. The Viet Minh occupied the highlands around Điện Biên Phủ and bombarded the French positions. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. The French repeatedly repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions. Supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air, though as the key French positions were overrun, the French perimeter contracted and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible. As the Viet Minh antiaircraft fire took its toll, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached the French. The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, {{and most of the}} French forces surrendered. A few of them escaped to Laos. The French government then resigned, and the new Prime Minister, the left-of-centre Pierre Mendès France, supported French withdrawal from Indochina.|$|E

5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E

5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base.

To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E
5|$|Writer Damon Lindelof {{conceived}} Peter Weyland {{as a man}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> ego and a god complex. During the film's {{early development}} director Ridley Scott intended Max von Sydow to play Weyland, but he began to favor Guy Pearce when a scene was written with a younger version of the character. To depict Weyland's aging, Pearce wore heavy prosthetics requiring five hours to apply and one hour to remove. The actor worked to replicate the speech patterns and movements of an elderly man. Although Weyland's younger version was omitted from Prometheus final screenplay, the film marketed the character with a fictional, futuristic TED talk in which Pearce appears without prosthetics. His performance was generally negatively received because of the unconvincing prosthetics and the casting of a 44-year-old actor as a 103-year-old man. However, the Weyland Industries web campaign was recognized by the Key Art Awards. In October 2016, {{it was reported that}} Pearce would be reprising his role as a younger version of Weyland in Alien: Covenant.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} Allied {{offensive}} in Italy, the battalion {{was assigned to}} the new 9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, which was allocated as the divisional reserve in April for Operation Buckland. Initially, the battalion protected the engineers bridging the Senio. When the bridges were finished, it covered the open flank around Barbiano resulting from a delay to the 3rd Carpathian Division. The battalion then attacked Massa Lombarda in preparation for a crossing of the Sillaro river, boarding Kangaroo APCs and moving forward. Tiger tanks forced the battalion to dismount and dig in before the Tigers were knocked out by Allied artillery. A and C Squadrons supported the 22nd Battalion in attacking Squazzaloca. The battalion reached the Sillaro River, crossed it at first light and was relieved by the 27th Battalion on 15 April. D Squadron cleared Sesto Imolese of Axis troops, with A and BSquadrons protecting the left flank. On 16–17 April, the battalion protected the right flank behind the 22nd Battalion.

5|$|Preoccupied with {{trouble in}} Khurasan, Harun now {{accepted}} tribute and made peace. An exchange of prisoners was also arranged and {{took place during}} the winter at the two empires' border, on the Lamos river in Cilicia; some 3,700 Muslims were exchanged for the Byzantines taken captive in the previous years. During Harun's absence in Khurasan, however, Nikephoros used the opportunity to rebuild the destroyed walls of the towns of Safsaf, Thebasa, and Ancyra. The following summer he launched the first Byzantine raid for two decades; into the Arab frontier district (thughur) in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided and took prisoners as it went, even capturing the major Abbasid stronghold of Tarsus. At the same time, another Byzantine force raided the Upper Mesopotamian thughur and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of Melitene, while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in Cyprus. Harun retaliated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> invasion in 806, which forced Nikephoros to come to terms, but the Byzantine ruler soon violated them and prevailed over the Abbasid expeditions sent against him in 807. Following renewed trouble in Khurasan, a peace treaty was signed in 808 which left the Byzantine frontier zone intact and ended the payment of tribute to the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|The overall Persian {{strategy}} for the invasion of 480 BC was to overwhelm the Greeks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> invasion force, and complete the conquest of Greece in a single campaigning season. Conversely, the Greeks sought {{to make the best}} use of their numbers by defending restricted locations and to keep the Persians in the field for as long as possible. Xerxes had obviously not anticipated such resistance, or he would have arrived earlier in the campaigning season (and not waited 4 days at Thermopylae for the Greeks to disperse). Time was now of the essence for the Persians – the huge invasion force could not be reasonably supported indefinitely, nor probably did Xerxes wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position was useless; with the Allies now dug in across the narrow Isthmus, there was little chance of conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, as equally demonstrated by Thermopylae, if the Greeks could be outflanked, their smaller numbers of troops could be destroyed. Such an outflanking of the Isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the destruction of the Allied navy. Therefore, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by crippling the Persian fleet, the Greeks could effectively thwart the invasion.|$|E
