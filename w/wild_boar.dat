HEV genotype 3 infections were reported in developed countries in individuals who had consumed raw meat or meat products from deer, <b>wild</b> <b>boars,</b> or pigs. The aim of the study was the analysis of the occurrence of HEV-specific antibodies among <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> and domestic pigs in Poland. Material and Methods: A total of 290 samples from <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> and 143 samples from pigs were tested. The antibodies were tested by ELISA. Results: The presence of anti-HEV IgG was demonstrated in 44. 1 % of pigs and 31. 0 % of <b>wild</b> <b>boars.</b> Anti-HEV IgG antibodies were detected in 1. 4 % of samples from pigs and in 2. 1 % of samples from <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> at borderline level. The statistical analysis shows significant differences in the positive results for anti-HEV IgG between the groups of pigs and <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> (P = 0. 0263).

This study was done to recognize the spatial pattern of farm lands damaged by <b>wild</b> <b>boars.</b> Totally 2, 342 farms were known damaged by <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> in 2012, and used to statistically analyze the perspectives of the farm land damages by <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> in ArcMap v. 9. 3.

As well as domestic pigs, <b>wild</b> <b>boars,</b> being omnivores and the animals that broadly cover the territory of Serbia, could definitely be considered as one of possible trichinellosis indicators, {{and that is the}} main reason for starting this investigation with the objective to perceive the level of infection of <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> in different hunting areas at the territory of the Republic of Serbia. In this work it is presented the distibution of T. spiralis in <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> at the territory of Serbia in the period from 2006. to 2010. Besides the distribution of trichinellosis in <b>wild</b> <b>boars,</b> we have also calculated the tendency of changing in the number of infected <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> at the territories of different hunting associations, in the period from 2006. to 2010. The distribution of T. spiralis in shot <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> showed that trichinellosis appeared at the total of 24 hunting associations territories during the investigated period. Only at the territories of Pirot and Dimitrivgrad hunting associations, there was diagnosed at least one case of trichinellosis in shot <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> in all five years. Out of the total of shot and inspected <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> (20. 250) in 123 of them, there was diagnosed the presence of T. spiralis infectious forms (0, 61 %). The greatest number (29) of the infected <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> was shot in 2007. By analysing the change in number of positive <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> in the interval from 2006. to 2010. it was found out that there is a constant tendency of growth, namely 1, 1 head of boar per year. Change in number of trichinellosis <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> by years of observation is a second degree polynomial (Y=- 0, 6 + 17, 81 xi- 2, 79 xi 2) with correlation coefficient of 0, 69. On the basis of the obtained analysis, that were carried out, it can be concluded that the occurence of trichinellosis is most frequent in border areas towards Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina.
