In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint.

I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

But I can't feel very kindly or forgivingly toward either that good apprentice boy or that good slave woman, for they saved my life. One day when I was playing on a loose log which I supposed was attached to a raft--but it wasn't--it tilted me into Bear Creek. And when I had been under water twice and was coming up to make the third and fatal descent my fingers appeared above the water and that slave woman seized them and pulled me out. Within a week I was in again, and that apprentice had to come along just at the wrong time, and he plunged in and dived, pawed around on the bottom and found me, and dragged me out and emptied the water out of me, and I was saved again. I was drowned seven times after that before I learned to swim--once in Bear Creek and six times in the Mississippi. I do not now know who the people were who interfered with the intentions of a Providence wiser than themselves, but I hold a grudge against them yet.

6000|$|... "No; he petted me, {{and took}} pains to teach me. He was an actor; and I found out, after, that the 'Coburg' I used to hear of his going to at home was a theatre. But he {{had more to do}} with the theatre than acting. He had not always been an actor; he had been a teacher, and knew many languages. His acting was not very good; I think, but he managed the stage, and wrote and {{translated}} plays. An Italian lady, a singer, lived with us a long time. They both taught me, and I had a master besides, who made me learn by heart and recite. I worked quite hard, though I was so little; and I was not nine when I first went on the stage. I could easily learn things, and I was not afraid. But then and ever since I hated our way of life. My father had money, and we had finery about us in a disorderly way; always there were men and women coming and going; there was loud laughing and disputing, strutting, snapping of fingers, jeering, faces I did not like to look at--though many petted and caressed me. But then I remembered my mother. Even at first when I understood nothing, I shrank away from all those things outside me into companionship with thoughts that were not like them; and I gathered thoughts very fast, because I read many things--plays and poetry, Shakespeare and Schiller, and learned evil and good. My father began to believe that I might be a great singer: my voice was considered wonderful for a child; and he had the best teaching for me. But it was painful that he boasted of me, and set me to sing for show at any minute, as if I had been a musical box. Once <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nine</b> years old, I played the part of a little girl who had been forsaken and did not know it, and sat singing to herself while she played with flowers. I did it without any trouble; but the clapping and all the sounds of the theatre were hateful to me; and I never liked the praise I had, because it all seemed very hard and unloving: I missed the love and trust I had been born into. I made a life in my own thoughts quite different from everything about me: I chose what seemed to me beautiful out of the plays and everything, and made my world out of it; and it was like a sharp knife always grazing me that we had two sorts of life which jarred so with each other--women looking good and gentle on the stage, and saying good things as if they felt them, and directly after I saw them with coarse, ugly manners. My father sometimes noticed my shrinking ways; and Signora said one day, when I had been rehearsing, 'She will never be an artist: she has no notion of being anybody but herself. That does very well now, but by-and-by you will see--she will have no more face and action than a singing-bird.' My father was angry, and they quarreled. I sat alone and cried, because what she had said was like a long unhappy future unrolled before me. I did not want to be an artist; but this was what my father expected of me. After a while Signora left us, and a governess used to come and give me lessons in different things, because my father began to be afraid of my singing too much; but I still acted from time to time. Rebellious feelings grew stronger in me, and I wished to get away from this life; but I could not tell where to go, and I dreaded the world. Besides, I felt it would be wrong to leave my father: I dreaded doing wrong, for I thought I might get wicked and hateful to myself, in the same way that many others seemed hateful to me. For so long, so long I had never felt my outside world happy; and if I got wicked I should lose my world of happy thoughts where my mother lived with me. That was my childish notion all through those years. Oh how long they were!" ...|$|E

500|$|Until he was fifteen, Elgar {{received}} a general education at Littleton (now Lyttleton) House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers consisted of more advanced violin studies with Adolf Pollitzer, during brief visits to London in 1877–78. Elgar said, [...] "my first music was learnt in the Cathedral ... from books {{borrowed from the}} music library, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> eight, <b>nine</b> or ten." [...] He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on the theory of music. He later {{said that he had}} been most helped by Hubert Parry's articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the Leipzig Conservatory for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later, a profile in The Musical Times considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: [...] "Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools." [...] However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader. Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.|$|R

40|$|Many years ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{eight or}} <b>nine</b> years old, a {{great-aunt}} of mine {{told me a}} story—part-fact, part-fiction—about the devastation of a rural village during the Mexican Revolution, and about how, afterward, {{the people of the}} village, in their sorrow and fear, built a protective wall around their settlement to keep away the dangers of the world without. The story was filled with vivid descriptions of cruelty and destruction—old women being burned alive, children mutilated, houses looted and torn down, horses shot. It was the kind of tale to inspire nightmares. For me, it was also a “brief story ” that prompted self-reflection on my part and tapped my knowledge of myself as an individual whose personal memories reach beyond that self into an historical past shared by others. Lukacs (1985) makes the statement that “Historical Know ledge is personal knowledge, including personal self-know ledge ” (p. 230) and that “Self-Knowledge, and the existing po tentiality of past-knowledge are involved intimately with im agination—a word which suggests a colorful mental construc tion on the one hand, and an inward tendency on the other ” (p. 237). Stated another way, history is what is known about hu man beings by another human being as he or she understands this through the incorporation of personal memories, group memories, and the artifactual remnants from a past evoked by the imagination. In the sense that they seek continuity in mem ory and tradition to experience themselves as complete in the cultural and physical environments, children too are historians involved in a never-ending process of reconstructing the past. I like the quote from Marek’s Gods, Graves and Scholars, which Fehrenback (1973) uses as an introduction to the first chapter of his book Fire and Blood—A History ofMexico: The forces of the past still live on and exert their influence on us, though we may not be consciously aware of this. It is frightening to realize in full depth {{what it means to be}} a human being; that is, to realize that we are all imbedded in the flux of generations, whose legacy of thought and feeling we irrevocably carry along with us.

Between Sligo and Rosses Point, there is a tongue of land covered with coarse grass that runs out into the sea or the mud {{according}} to the state of the tide. It is the place where dead horses are buried. Sitting there, my father read me [...] "The Lays of Ancient Rome." [...] It was the first poetry that had moved me after the stable-boy's [...] "Orange Rhymes." [...] Later on he read me [...] "Ivanhoe" [...] and [...] "The Lay of the Last Minstrel," [...] and they are still vivid in the memory. I re-read [...] "Ivanhoe" [...] the other day, but it has all vanished except Gurth, the swineherd, at the outset and Friar Tuck and his venison pasty, the two scenes that laid hold of me in childhood. [...] "The Lay of the Last Minstrel" [...] gave me a wish to turn magician that competed for years with the dream of being killed upon the sea-shore. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first went to school, he tried to keep me from reading boys' papers, because a paper, by its very nature, as he explained to me, had to be made for the average boy or man and so could not but thwart one's growth. He took away my paper and I had not courage to say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> but reading and delighting in a prose re-telling of the Iliad. But after a few months, my father said he had been too anxious and became less urgent about my lessons and less violent if I had learnt them badly, and he ceased to notice what I read. From that on I shared the excitement which ran through all my fellows on Wednesday afternoons when the boys' papers <b>were</b> published, and <b>I</b> read endless stories I have forgotten as completely as Grimm's Fairy Tales that I read at Sligo, and all of Hans Andersen except the Ugly Duckling which my mother had read to me and to my sisters. I remember vaguely that I liked Hans Andersen better than Grimm because he was less homely, but even he never gave me the knights and dragons and beautiful ladies that I longed for. I have remembered nothing that I read, but only those things that I heard or saw. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ten or twelve my father took me to see Irving play Hamlet, and did not understand why I preferred Irving to Ellen Terry, who <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> can now see, the idol of himself and his friends. I could not think of her, as I could of Irving's Hamlet, as but myself, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not old enough to care for feminine charm and beauty. For many years Hamlet was an image of heroic self-possession for the poses of youth and childhood to copy, a combatant of the battle within myself. My father had read me the story of the little boy murdered by the Jews in Chaucer and the tale of Sir Topaz, explaining the hard words, and though both excited me, I had liked Sir Topaz best and been disappointed that it left off in the middle. As I grew older, he would tell me plots of Balzac's novels, using incident or character as an illustration for some profound criticism of life. Now that I have read all the Comédie Humaine, certain pages have an unnatural emphasis, straining and overbalancing the outline, and I remember how in some suburban street, he told me of Lucien de Rubempré, or of the duel after the betrayal of his master, and how the wounded Lucien had muttered [...] "so much the worse" [...] when he heard someone say that he was not dead.|$|R

The most significant of her contemporary peers {{comes in the form of}} Prince, a man she describes as one of her heroes: [...] "Prince goes back to me listening to preachers when I was a child, who tell a story to illustrate a point...the first song I heard by him was 'Little Red Corvette', <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nine.</b> Of course, I didn't have a clue about what he was singing about; the sexuality is implicit and I love that." [...] The influence of Prince, whom Knight even mentions on her Prodigal Sista and Who I Am album sleeves, can be seen throughout her back catalogue with songs such as [...] "Get Up!", [...] "Hurricane Jane" [...] and [...] "Supersonic" [...] being compared to Prince due to their mix of funk and soul.|$|E

She is the granddaughter of Kjell Aartun, a theologian and {{linguist}} who is considered a leading expert on Semitic languages, particularly the Ugaritic language. After attending a music high school, she began making music as a hobby. She stated she started playing music when she was six, saying: [...] "I would go to these classes where we would just sing and play the tambourine. You know, it wasn't really serious, but I really liked it so I started playing the violin when I was eight, then taking piano lessons <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nine,</b> and then singing lessons when I was twelve. So I was playing music at an early stage, but I didn't really take it that seriously. I wasn't practicing that much or anything. Then I went to a music high school, and I guess that's what you'd call my education in music." ...|$|E
