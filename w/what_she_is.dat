60|$|She looked {{round the}} room, vaguely. Birkin could not guess <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> looking for, nor <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> thinking. Evidently <b>she</b> noticed her sons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Tulliver. The {{small one}} <b>is</b> {{something}} like <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> when I was at school {{with her brother}} at King's Lorton; the larger one is not quite so good a likeness of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> when I came from abroad." ...|$|R

5|$|Cool World marked Bakshi's {{return to}} feature films after nine years. The film was {{originally}} pitched as an animated horror film about an underground cartoonist who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, who hates herself for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{and tries to}} kill him. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was scrapped by producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. and heavily rewritten by Michael Grais and Mark Victor in secret. Reviews praised the film's visuals, but criticized the story and characters, {{as well as the}} combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film would eventually gross only half its production budget.|$|E

5|$|Both the Human {{fleet and}} the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which {{occurred}} at least 2,000 {{years prior to}} the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) conclude the remains are not Human, but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs, but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of a different kind of Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human.

5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – they are far more elusive and dangerous than the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the clues to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E
60|$|In the passage, I met Penelope hanging about, {{and asked}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> waiting for.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> hesitated; <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} say had {{something}} of the anti-climax in it.|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

25|$|Mia is Feena's main escort {{from the}} Kingdom of Sphere and always tries {{to look out}} for the princess.

25|$|Natsuki is {{a friend}} and classmate of Kanade; {{something}} that they both share in common is their shy nature. Because Natsuki barely talks at all, and is usually emotionless, {{it is difficult to}} tell <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> thinking. The most important person to her is Kanade, her only friend. In Your Diary +, she is promoted to a heroine from a sub-character.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century and the fall of the French monarchy closed the doors on Vallayer-Coster’s still-life ‘era’ and opened them to her new style of florals. It has been argued that this was the {{highlight}} of her career and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> best known for. However, it has also been argued that the flower paintings were futile to her career. Nevertheless, this collection contained floral studies in oil, watercolor and gouache.|$|E
25|$|While Mea {{is listed}} officially as an android for the anime, {{it is unclear}} while {{watching}} Popotan {{that this is the}} case as there is no given reference, beyond her personality, to that effect. In episode four it is revealed she is not human, but the episode does not state <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> Mea is voiced by Asumi Noda in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Mai Kadowaki and in English by Anna Cummer.|$|E

25|$|Shortly thereafter, Cristal and {{her boyfriend}} Zack Carey, the {{entertainment}} director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a lap dance from Nomi. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is also based upon her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she {{is little more than}} a prostitute. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> doing is no different from prostitution.|$|E

25|$|Professor Trelawney first {{appears in}} the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends {{generally}} believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> saying, with no memory of it afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later to be shown true in the books even if she was not in a trance.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated--nay, I should rather say paused, {{for there}} was little {{hesitation}} in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did. She paused, as though weighing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to say next.|$|R
60|$|The {{manner in}} which he made his {{declaration}} to her was almost fierce in its energy.

The mare, {{taking advantage of the}} occasion, was cropping the grass close to them. And so, for a few seconds, they stood in silence.|$|R
60|$|She {{paused for}} a while, evidently {{considering}} with special attention <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> about to say next.|$|R
