A composite company drawn from the HV 114th Infantry Brigade attacked VRS positions on the right flank of the advance. The 7th Guards Brigade managed to move forward by about , but had to suspend its effort as the 114th Brigade company could not defeat the VRS' entrenched defences at Marino Brdo to cover the 7th Brigade's right flank. The VRS defences were <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> all along the front line attacked by the HV and the HVO.

5|$|Having {{performed}} well in training exercises during 1941 and early 1942, {{elements of the}} 2nd Division were selected as the main force for Operation Jubilee, a large-scale amphibious raid on the port of Dieppe in German-occupied France. On 19August 1942, with air and naval gunfire support, the division's 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades assaulted Dieppe's beaches. The Germans were <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> and, despite being reinforced, the Canadians sustained heavy losses {{and had to be}} evacuated, with fewer than half their number returning to the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrounded}} {{church was}} <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> for defence, but its garrison was by then composed {{almost entirely of}} the wounded. By noon the defenders were overpowered, and the Russians entered the church. The fight for Fort 56 was over. Altogether the Russian side lost no less than 1,000 killed in action during the storming of the fort. Polish casualties did not exceed 300 killed and wounded, with 1,230 soldiers and officers taken prisoner. Only up to 500 soldiers managed to withdraw and reach Polish lines.|$|E
5|$|As the 48th Highlanders secured their {{positions}} west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment {{was involved in}} intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> German defences of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment. A Company was quickly tied down by German mortar fire, while B Company flanked German positions {{to the north of}} San Donato. By nightfall, all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of German defences. On the night of 8/9 December, the RCR was subjected to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous Canadian artillery shelling.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{upheaval}} on shore, {{the arrival of}} the British blockade squadron provoked Renaud into taking action. Although the defences of Île de France were <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> under Malartic's orders, food supplies were running low, with only rice still available in quantity. The potential for famine and consequent social unrest among the slave population was severe and Renaud sailed immediately to intercept Centurion and Diomede. The French squadron comprised the 40-gun frigate Cybèle under Captain Pierre Tréhouart, the 36-gun Prudente under Renaud, and the 14-gun brig Coureur under lieutenant de vaisseau Garaud. The 20-gun privateer corvettes Jean-Bart and Rosalie, as well as the aviso Sans-Culotte, accompanied the two frigates. The ships' crews were heavily augmented by volunteers, including a young Robert Surcouf on Cybèle, as well as a detachment of soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Hay {{enrolled}} at Brown in 1855.

Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858, and was, like his grandfather before him, Class Poet. He returned to Illinois. Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in his firm, where he could study law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} {{occupied}} by 1st Commonwealth Division, Chinese communist forces were dug {{into a group}} of hills overlooking the Imjin River. The division faced 6,000 troops from the Chinese 191st Division, 64th Army under the overall command of Xie Zhengrong. The Chinese forces were divided into three regiments of about 2,000 men each, with two regiments dug-in in <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> defensive positions with overhead protection, and a third regiment in support. The 28th Brigade faced {{one of the two}} forward regiments—the 571st Regiment—which was deployed with one battalion on Hill 355, a second battalion astride Hill 217 and Hill 317, and a third battalion in reserve to the west.|$|E

The neighbouring Mali Miletinac was captured by the HV the following day, and on 12 November the HV captured the villages of Bastajski Brđani and Rekići. Two days later the TO counterattacked, killing nine HV troops and wounding about ten more, but the HV defence held. Another effort to recapture Bastajski Brđani {{was made by the}} TO, reinforced with 50 paramilitary White Eagles. It failed (despite being <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> and supported by artillery) because the defending HV force was alerted by signals intelligence of the attack and reinforced.

5|$|The Dutch fleet raided up the Thames in June 1667, {{but did not}} {{approach}} Gravesend Blockhouse due to {{the threat posed by}} its guns. The fort, under the command of Sir John Griffith, was in reality not <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> for war. £400 was spent on upgrading the blockhouse, artillery was sent from the Tower of London to reinforce the local guns and four infantry companies were detached to guard the site. The risk of attack ended with the signing of the Peace of Breda that July, and the blockhouse did not see action. Shortly after the Dutch raids, Sir John was removed from his post for apparently demanding payments from ships passing by the blockhouse, a complaint which was repeated in later years under subsequent captains.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Ypres were <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> for a siege {{by the time}} the English and their allies arrived and attacked the city on 8 June 1383. Dwellings in the outlying suburbs had been abandoned; the timber from them was used to strengthen the earth ramparts and the stone gates of the city. A mission had been dispatched to Paris to replace artillery powder stocks. The city was well organised under the command of the Castellan of Ypres, John d'Oultre, and had been divided into different defensive sectors. Although the ramparts were low, they were well protected with a double wet ditch, a high thorny hedge reinforced with stakes and a wooden stockade and fire-step.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 6 October, 9 Platoon C Company—under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Arthur Pembroke—moved forward to Sierra, using the heavy mist to conceal their movements. Under-strength and not expecting the feature to be occupied, instead the Australians found {{a large number of}} Chinese in <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> {{defensive}} positions. Without fire support and outnumbered, the Australians immediately conducted a quick attack and, using grenades and bayonets, they inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese before forcing the survivors to withdraw. Although subjected to constant shelling, 9 Platoon continued to hold the knoll, repelling several counterattacks over the next 13 hours, cutting down each assault through the tree-line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine-gun fire, forcing the Chinese to withdraw leaving their dead and wounded behind. One Australian was killed in the initial assault on Sierra, while a number were later wounded during the defence. Chinese casualties included 19 killed, 30 wounded and seven captured. Pembroke was later awarded the Military Cross.|$|E

5|$|By {{this point}} in the Quasi-War, the 1,265-ton Constellation carried 38 cannon despite officially being {{classified}} by the United States Navy as a 36-gun frigate. Previously her armament had consisted of 24-pounder guns, but these had proven inefficient during Truxton's action with L'Insurgente and as a result were removed and replaced with twenty-eight 18-pounder cannon and ten 24-pounder carronades. Truxton and his crew were hardened veterans and were <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> for a fight. Their French counterparts were not as ready for an engagement. Pitot's frigate was carrying a large quantity of specie as well as 36 American prisoners of war and 80 passengers, two of whom were generals. Under such circumstances Pitot intended to avoid an engagement if possible, even though La Vengeance was a more heavily armed vessel carrying eight 42-pounder carronades, twenty-eight 18-pounders, and sixteen 12-pounder cannon. The French also had a distinct advantage {{in the event of a}} boarding action, as Constellation had only 310 men to La Vengeance's complement of 380 crew.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Cadiz, Linois {{had learned from}} {{the crew of the}} {{captured}} brig HMS Speedy that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez lay off Cadiz, blockading the port. Concerned that this squadron could overwhelm his own, Linois took shelter in the small but well-defended harbour of Algeciras, just across Algeciras Bay from the heavily fortified British naval base at Gibraltar. Saumarez was informed of Linois's arrival, and turned eastwards to confront him, discovering the French ships anchored in a <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> position on the morning of 6 July. Saumarez attacked immediately, but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind. Becalmed under heavy fire, the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water, two grounding. However, when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow, HMS Hannibal grounded as well, trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore. With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the squadron's boats all either sunk or engaged in towing the battered HMS Pompée back to Gibraltar, Saumarez called off the attack at 13:35. The battered British squadron retired to Gibraltar, except for Hannibal, which was trapped, battered and swiftly forced to surrender, having lost two masts and more than 140 men.|$|E
5|$|Experiment {{kept her}} gunports closed and passed herself {{off as a}} merchantman, while the Haitians sailed closer to the convoy {{with the intent of}} {{boarding}} and capturing all five vessels. Once the Haitians were in musket range of the American vessels they opened fire on them, and Experiment returned the fire. Grapeshot from the Americans wreaked havoc among the Haitian barges and they were forced to withdraw. They stood off the American convoy for thirty minutes before beaching at the nearby island of Gonâve to land their wounded and gather reinforcements. With three more barges and fresh crews, the picaroons set off to assault the American convoy once more. They divided themselves into three squadrons of four barges each and set course to attack Experiment. The lead and centermost divisions attacked the sides of the American warship while the rear division assaulted the stern. During the lull in fighting Experiment had readied herself for the picaroons' next assault by positioning musketeers in defensive positions, loading her main guns, and raising boarding nets. Thus, when the Haitians attacked the American warship again she was <b>well</b> <b>prepared</b> to repulse any attempt at boarding her.|$|E
