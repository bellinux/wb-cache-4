40|$|We use microsample {{data from}} the 2005 (1 %) National Population Sample Survey in {{southeast}} China and {{examine the relationship between}} the effect of hukou status on income and return to education under China’s rural – urban divide. For labor-market return we find that: (1)  the influence of hukou status is deeply rooted in an indivdual’s other key features (occupation, years of schooling, and <b>working</b> <b>location)</b> in the labor market, and (2)  hukou status affects labor-market return primarily through its influence on people’s return to education. Assisted by spline regression models, we find that the gap of return to education among people with different hukou status increases as years of schooling decrease, and reaches its peak in primary education. The data overwhelmingly suggest that individuals’ human capital was largely determined by the place (rural versus urban) where they were born and received their compulsory education, which highlights the role of China’s rural – urban divide in shaping people’s labor-market return. ...|$|E

This study aimed at evaluating thermal stress and its following function fall and the effect of asphalt work on the degree of heat stress and asphalt workers’ physiological parameters. The present study was done at the work location of 29 asphalt workers in Qum City,  central  Iran.  The  degree  of  thermal stress  was  by  WBGT  index.  The  workers’ physiological parameters such as their blood pressure and pulse rate were studied as well. In order to determine the function fall caused by thermal stress, the related graph was utilized, and the calculated data were analyzed by SPSS software. The longest heat (WBGT) exposure period of asphalt paver drivers, troweling workers, shoveling workers, and burner service workers were 31. 59, 32. 68, and 33. 53 centigrade degrees, respectively causing the laborers’ function fall by 70, 85, and 82 %. Increase in WBGT is followed by increase in the average diastolic and systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. There was found a significant relationship between WBGT in the asphalt <b>working</b> <b>locations</b> and out of asphalt <b>working</b> <b>locations</b> (P < 0. 05). In addition to diseases and effects caused by thermal stress, it is a major reason for man’s function fall and efficiency decline, which eventually causes poor production.

Little is known on a national level about how many workers are exposed to solar radiation, the circumstances in which they are exposed, or their use of protective measures. Methods: The Australian Work Exposures Study (AWES) was a cross-sectional telephone survey of 5, 023 Australian workers aged 18 to 65. A subset of 1, 113 respondents who indicated they worked outdoors was asked about their exposure to solar radiation in terms of the amount of time they spent working outdoors, their <b>working</b> <b>location</b> and their use of sun protective measures. Results: A total of 1, 100 respondents (22 % overall) were assessed as being exposed to solar radiation at work. Exposure was more likely among males and those residing in lower socioeconomic and regional areas. Sun protection was used by 95 % of the respondents, although the level of protection varied among workers, with only 8. 7 % classified as fully protected.

40|$|Productivity levels between {{harvester}} operators {{have been}} noted to vary significantly, by up to 40 % in similar stands. It is believed that differences originate from the operators cutting techniques, motoric skills, planning of work, experience, felling order of removable trees, deci-sion processes at the <b>working</b> <b>location,</b> machine proper-ties and the surrounding environment. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine and compare six harvester opera-tors and to detect those features of working technique that improve and rationalise the work. Consequently, im-proving the basic working technique can raise average productivity. The harvester operators ’ work was examined by using the normal stopwatch study method and the operators ’ working technique was registered for each han-dled tree. Working technique observations were adjoined to stopwatch the study time units as a large matrix after data collection. Results indicate that unnecessary stem movements in the felling phase should be avoided. The stem should be processed close to the stump so that the positioning-to-cut distance to next removable tree is short. This reduced positioning-to-cut time for the next felling. In processing, a productive operator can operate without big delays and the variations in processing times for same stem sizes are small. Furthermore, the productive operator avoids revers-ing when he is doing normal harvesting work...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} which factors influence the pattern of enforcement (violation) of basic rights among women trafficked for sexual exploitation. A conceptual framework is adopted where the degree of agency and the possibility to influence the terms of sex-based transactions are seen as conditional on the enforcement of some basic rights. Using data collected by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on women assisted by the organization after having been trafficked for sexual exploitation, we investigate the enforcement (violation) of five uncompromisable rights, namely the right to physical integrity, to move freely, to have access to medical care, to use condoms, and to exercise choice over sexual services. By combining classification tree analysis and ordered probit estimation we find that <b>working</b> <b>location</b> and country of work are the main determinants of rights enforcement, while individual and family characteristics play a marginal role. Specifically, we find that (1) in lower market segments working on the street is comparatively less ‘at risk’ of rights violation; (2) there is no consistently ‘good’ or ‘bad’ country of work, but public awareness on trafficking within the country is important; (3) the strength of organised crime in the country of work matters only in conjunction with other local factors, and (4) being trafficked within one’s country, as opposed to being trafficked internationally, is associated with higher risk of rights violation...|$|E

In this study Rural Areas of Sri Lanka is defined as the areas outside the Municipal council and Urban council areas. This definition will lead to use Pradeshiya Saba (PS) divisions as Rural Areas. Presently there are 270 PS divisions in Sri Lanka. 205 PS divisions were used in this study excluding the North and East province PS divisions that were difficult to reach. The level of Informatization was measured as an index value, which is referred as the Informatization Index. In the Asia Pacific region different type of Informatization Indices are calculated in different countries. In this study author had defined a mechanism to calculate the Informatization Index for Sri Lanka, by considering number of indices related to Informatization. This Informatization Index was calculated using 48 measures categorized under 11 sub components of ICT.
