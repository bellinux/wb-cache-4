I am a London City Missionary. My name is John Seaward. We have, as you see, {{brought out a}} number of our Sunday-school children, to give them a sight of God's beautiful earth; poor things, they've been used to bricks, mortar, and stone all their lives hitherto. Now, if you choose to spend the remainder of the day with us, we will be happy to give you and the injured bicycle a place in our vans till we reach a cabstand or a railway station. What say you? It will give much pleasure to me and the teachers." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Perry {{expressed}} his {{pride in the}} enactment of the statute extending in-state tuition to children of undocumented workers. He said:We must say to every Texas child learning in a Texas classroom, “we don’t care where you come from, but where you are going, {{and we are going to}} do everything <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> get there.” And that vision must include the children of undocumented workers.

6000|$|... "You {{are most}} welcome," [...] he said. [...] "You relieve my {{partners}} and myself {{of a great}} anxiety. I can only explain what I mean by referring {{for a moment to}} the business affairs of my firm. We have a fishing establishment in the ancient city of Enkhuizen, on the shores of the Zuyder Zee. Mr. Ernest Van Brandt had a share in it at one time, which he afterward sold. Of late years our profits from this source have been diminishing; and we think of giving up the fishery, unless our prospects in that quarter improve after a further trial. In the meantime, having a vacant situation in the counting-house at Enkhuizen, we thought of Mr. Ernest Van Brandt, and offered him the opportunity of renewing his connection with us, in the capacity of a clerk. He is related to one of my partners; but I am bound in truth to tell you that he is a very bad man. He has awarded us for our kindness to him by embezzling our money; and he has taken to flight--in what direction we have not yet discovered. The English lady and her child are left deserted at Enkhuizen; and until you came here to-day we were quite at a loss {{to know what to do}} with them. I don't know whether you are already aware of it, sir; but the lady's position is made doubly distressing by doubts which we entertain of her being really Mr. Ernest Van Brandt's wife. To our certain knowledge, he was privately married to another woman some years since; and we have no evidence whatever that the first wife is dead. If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> in any way to assist your unfortunate country-woman, pray believe that our services are at your disposal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] she said, when I had {{suggested}} {{the only explanation}} I could offer, to account for my perplexed looks, [...] "I understand. You are such a perfect stranger in the house, that you are puzzled by my familiar references to the worthy inhabitants. Natural enough: I ought to have thought of it before. At any rate, I can set it right now. Suppose I begin with myself, so as to get done with {{that part of the}} subject as soon as possible? My name is Marian Halcombe; and I am as inaccurate as women usually are, in calling Mr. Fairlie my uncle, and Miss Fairlie my sister. My mother was twice married: the first time to Mr. Halcombe, my father; the second time to Mr. Fairlie, my half-sister's father. Except that we are both orphans, we are in every respect as unlike each other as possible. My father was a poor man, and Miss Fairlie's father was a rich man. I have got nothing, and she has a fortune. I am dark and ugly, and she is fair and pretty. Everybody thinks me crabbed and odd (with perfect justice); and everybody thinks her sweet-tempered and charming (with more justice still). In short, she is an angel; and I am---- Try some of that marmalade, Mr. Hartright, and finish the sentence, in the name of female propriety, for yourself. What am I to tell you about Mr. Fairlie? Upon my honour, I hardly know. He is sure to send for you after breakfast, and you can study him for yourself. In the meantime, I may inform you, first, that he is the late Mr. Fairlie's younger brother; secondly, that he is a single man; and thirdly, that he is Miss Fairlie's guardian. I won't live without her, and she can't live without me; and that is how I come to be at Limmeridge House. My sister and I are honestly fond of each other; which, you will say, is perfectly unaccountable, under the circumstances, and I quite agree with you--but so it is. You must please both of us, Mr. Hartright, or please neither of us: and, what is still more trying, you will be thrown entirely upon our society. Mrs. Vesey is an excellent person, who possesses all the cardinal virtues, and counts for nothing; and Mr. Fairlie is too great an invalid to be a companion for anybody. I don't know what is the matter with him, and the doctors don't know what is the matter with him, and he doesn't know himself what is the matter with him. We all say it's on the nerves, and we none of us know what we mean when we say it. However, I advise you to humour his little peculiarities, when you see him to-day. Admire his collection of coins, prints, and water-colour drawings, and you will win his heart. Upon my word, if you can be contented with a quiet country life, I don't see why you should not get on very well here. From breakfast to lunch, Mr. Fairlie's drawings will occupy you. After lunch, Miss Fairlie and I shoulder our sketch-books, and go out to misrepresent Nature, under your directions. Drawing is her favourite whim, mind, not mine. Women can't draw--their minds are too flighty, and their eyes are too inattentive. No matter--my sister likes it; so I waste paint and spoil paper, for her sake, as composedly as any woman in England. As for the evenings, I think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> through them. Miss Fairlie plays delightfully. For my own poor part, I don't know one note of music from the other; but I can match you at chess, backgammon, ecarte, and (with the inevitable female drawbacks) even at billiards as well. What {{do you think of the}} programme? Can you reconcile yourself to our quiet, regular life? or do you mean to be restless, and secretly thirst for change and adventure, in the humdrum atmosphere of Limmeridge House?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Let us talk," [...] I broke in, {{treading}} warningly upon Ragnall's foot. [...] "We {{have heard}} your Oracle {{and we know}} that you believe its words. It is said that <b>we</b> alone <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to conquer the Black Kendah. If you will not promise what we ask, we will not <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> We will burn our powder and melt our lead, so that the guns we have cannot speak with Jana and with Simba, and after that we will do other things that I need not tell you. But if you promise what we ask, then we will fight for you against Jana and Simba and teach your men to use the fifty rifles which we have here with us, and by our <b>help</b> <b>you</b> shall conquer. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, Peter! I am just as {{glad to see}} you as you are to see me," [...] cried Sunshine the Yellow Warbler. [...] "Yes, indeed, we {{certainly}} intend to stay here if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find just the right place for our nest. It is lovely to be back here again. We've journeyed so far that we don't want to go a bit farther if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. Have <b>you</b> seen Sally Sly the Cowbird around here this spring?" ...|$|R
60|$|So I hope now I {{have put}} you in your place, dear reader. Sit you like Watts' Hope on your own little blue globe, and I'll sit on mine, and we won't bump into one another if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> twang your old hopeful lyre. It may be music to you, so I don't blame you. It is a terrible wowing in my ears. But that may be {{something}} in my individual atmosphere; some strange deflection as your music crosses the space between us. Certainly I never hear the concert of World Regeneration and Hope Revived Again without getting a sort of lock-jaw, my teeth go so keen on edge from the twanging harmony. Still, the world-regenerators may really be quite excellent performers on their own jews'-harps. Blame the edginess of my teeth.|$|R
5000|$|On Memorial Day 1964, Schwerner and Chaney {{spoke to}} the {{congregation}} at Mount Zion Methodist Church in Longdale, Mississippi, about setting up a Freedom School. Schwerner implored the members to register to vote, saying, [...] "you have been slaves too long, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> help yourselves". The White Knights learned of Schwerner's voting drive in Neshoba County and soon developed a plot to hinder the work and ultimately destroy their efforts. The White Knights wanted to lure CORE workers to Neshoba County, so they attacked congregation members and torched the church, burning it to the ground.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2013, the Home Office {{introduced}} an advertising lorry in London with its billboard saying [...] "In the UK illegally? — GO HOME OR FACE ARREST — Text HOME to 78070 for free advice, {{and help with}} travel documents. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention." [...] This campaign was criticised from various quarters: Vince Cable, a prominent minister in the governing coalition, called it [...] "stupid and offensive"; some on the left said that [...] "go home" [...] evoked an old National Front slogan. Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party criticised the campaign as [...] "nasty" [...] and suggested that its real message was [...] "Please don’t vote UKIP, we’re doing something".|$|E
5000|$|According to The New York Times, their {{corporate}} clients — Fortune 100 companies — hire them as insurance against [...] "tweet risk". Bennett said, [...] "If he’s gonna come after you, there’s {{nothing we can}} do to stop it. But if you want {{to figure out how to}} win in this environment, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> example, [...] "Call Jared Kushner and tell him you’re gonna build a new factory," [...] or invite Mr. Trump to [...] "fly somewhere, cut a ribbon, and high-five 200 employees... That [...] "drives optimism, and it drives his power. There are few things a president can do to build power faster than to lead a great economic comeback." [...] Lewandowski added, [...] "We’re your sherpa through turbulent times." [...] While there, Lewandowski won a $160,000 account with Community Choice Financial, a large payday lender.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, Madame," [...] stammered Diana, hardly knowing at {{the moment}} what to say. [...] "Be {{discreet}} and silent until you hear from me again; guard the girl carefully and see {{that she is not}} too unhappy; but for heaven's sake keep Charlie's secret until he sees fit to restore Miss Merrick to her friends. No crime is contemplated; I would not allow such a thing, as you know. Yet it is none of my affair whatever. My cousin has compromised me by taking the girl to my house, and no knowledge of the abduction must get abroad if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. Do <b>you</b> understand me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} again, I {{have nothing to}} do with your difficulties," [...] Julius resumed. [...] "Take the rest of the day to {{consider}} what I have said to you. If you decide to accept the proposal, I shall expect you to prove you are in earnest by meeting me at the station to-night. We will travel back to Scotland together. You will complete your interrupted visit at Lady Lundie's (it is important, in my interests, that you should treat a person of her position in the county with all due respect); and my wife will make the necessary arrangements with Mrs. Glenarm, in anticipation of your return to our house. There is nothing more to be said, and no further necessity of my staying here. If you join me at the station to-night, your sister-in-law and I will do all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> If I travel back to Scotland alone, don't trouble yourself to follow--I have done with you." [...] He shook hands with his brother, and went out.|$|R
500|$|Game Director and creator David Jaffe {{confirmed}} the game {{would be a}} cinematic presentation. He said that at E3, they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said, [...] "we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas" [...] of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players [...] "hate cinematic camera systems, nothing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do will <b>help</b> <b>you</b> like the God of War cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001).|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the {{publication}} of the NAO report, Pickering had been fighting for redress from the University of Portsmouth for four years; he sought to have the report withdrawn, arguing that it stood {{in the way of his}} chances of reaching a settlement with the university over his dismissal. However, Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general of the NAO, wrote to Pickering saying: [...] "I regret that you feel that you have been unfairly and unsympathetically treated by the NAO. It is of course for you to decide if you wish to take any further action on this matter. I think it unlikely that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> further". [...] Pickering's campaign to have the NAO report withdrawn was later backed by Portsmouth MPs Mike Hancock and Michael Mates. Sir John Bourn acknowledged in a letter to the latter:"The report is critical of the way the governing body handled a number of issues, including Professor Pickering's departure from the university and… contains some criticisms of the treatment of whistleblowers. In relation to Professor Pickering, the report does record that the investigation (into the vice-chancellor's expenses) was not an insignificant factor in the chain of events leading up to Professor Pickering's departure”.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the voice}} of Vrillon, a {{representative}} of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the skies. We speak to you now in peace and wisdom as we have done to your brothers and sisters all over this, your planet Earth. We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you. This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New Age of Aquarius. The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments. Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all. You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution. Hear now the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. Be aware also that there are many false prophets and guides operating in your world. They will suck your energy from you - the energy you call money and will put it to evil ends and give you worthless dross in return. Your inner divine self will protect you from this. You must learn {{to be sensitive to the}} voice within that can tell you what is truth, and what is confusion, chaos and untruth. Learn to listen to the voice of truth which is within you and you will lead yourselves onto the path of evolution. This is our message to our dear friends. We have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies. You know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your Earth than your scientists admit. We are deeply concerned about you and your path towards the light and will do all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> Have no fear, seek only to know yourselves, and live in harmony with the ways of your planet Earth. We of the Ashtar Galactic Command thank you for your attention. We are now leaving the plane of your existence. May you be blessed by the supreme love and truth of the cosmos.|$|R
