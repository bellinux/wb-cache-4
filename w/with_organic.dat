5|$|Potassium reacts violently with halogens and detonates in the {{presence}} of bromine. It also reacts explosively with sulfuric acid. During combustion, potassium forms peroxides and superoxides. These peroxides may react violently <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> compounds such as oils. Both peroxides and superoxides may react explosively with metallic potassium.|$|E

25|$|The most {{effective}} strategy to counter copper deficiency is {{to supplement the}} soil with copper, usually {{in the form of}} copper sulfate. Sewage sludge is also used in some areas to replenish agricultural land <b>with</b> <b>organics</b> and trace metals, including copper.|$|R
5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, small privately owned dairies began to produce {{handmade}} cheeses from goat and sheep’s milk {{as well as}} cow’s milk, resembling traditional cheeses like those made in rural France, Spain and Italy.

5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> substances.|$|E
30|$|Normally, {{isoelectric point}} of HZD is reached in neutral media: under these {{conditions}} cation- and anion-exchange capacities are equal. Thus, the HZD aggregates permit both counter (Cl−) and co- (Na+) ions. However, the aggregates protect the ion-exchange materials against fouling <b>with</b> <b>organics.</b>|$|R

5|$|Many organosodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} prepared. Because {{of the high}} polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa). Because of the large size and very low polarising power of the Na+ cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Paints {{containing}} {{zinc oxide}} powder {{have long been}} utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They are especially effective for galvanized iron. Iron is difficult to protect because its reactivity <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>organic</b> acids {{inductive}} {{effects and}} mesomeric effects affect the pKa values. A simple example {{is provided by}} the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid by the more electronegative chlorine atom. The electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent makes ionisation easier, so successive pKa values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, and 0.7 when 0, 1, 2, or 3 chlorine atoms are present. The Hammett equation, provides a general expression for the effect of substituents.|$|E

30|$|Another {{example of}} an organic-inorganic system, which is {{extensively}} studied, is diamond in combination <b>with</b> <b>organics,</b> e.g., fullerene [10, 11]. Such systems are highly promising for bio-sensoric or opto-electronic applications, as a charge transport between the two materials is observed. However, the basic electronic properties at their interface {{still need to be}} fully understood.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{inorganic}} thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, {{such as the}} perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, {{and their}} hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, {{but most of them}} have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no US ground forces under MacArthur's command in action against the Japanese, and the task of {{securing}} Finschhafen was allocated to Australian troops from the 9th Division. A veteran formation of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), the 9th Division was vastly experienced, having fought in the North African campaign, where it had held Tobruk against a German onslaught earlier in the war and had been heavily engaged at the First and Second Battle of El Alamein. In early 1943, the division had been brought back to Australia, and it had subsequently been reorganised {{to take part in}} jungle warfare. With an establishment of 13,118men, the division consisted of three brigades of infantry– the 20th, 24th and 26th– each consisting of three battalions, along <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> battalion-level engineer, pioneer, artillery, and armoured formations attached at divisional level. In support of the 9th Division, Militia infantry units from the 4th Brigade would also take part in the fighting after the initial fighting. American forces would also be involved, mainly providing logistical, naval and engineering support.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, the {{composition}} of the infantry division gradually changed, and there was an increased emphasis on providing the infantry divisions <b>with</b> <b>organic</b> fire support. By 1918, a British division consisted of three infantry brigades, each of three battalions. Each of these battalions had 36 Lewis machine guns, making a total of 324 such weapons in the division. Additionally, there was a divisional machine gun battalion, equipped with 64 Vickers machine guns in four companies of 16 guns. Each brigade in the division also had a mortar battery with eight Stokes Mortars. The artillery also changed the composition of its batteries. At the start of the war, there were three batteries with six guns per brigade; they then moved to four batteries with four guns per brigade, and finally in 1917, to four batteries with six guns per brigade to economise on battery commanders. In this way, the army would change drastically over {{the course of}} the war, reacting to the various developments, from the mobile war fought in the opening weeks to the static trench warfare of 1916 and 1917. The cavalry of the BEF represented 9.28% of the army; by July 1918, it would only represent 1.65%. The infantry would decrease from 64.64% in 1914 to 51.25% of the army in 1918, while the Royal Engineers would increase from 5.91% to 11.24% in 1918.|$|E
