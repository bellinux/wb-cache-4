40|$|Work {{and family}} embody {{two of the}} most {{fundamental}} areas of adult life. The increased participation in the labour force of <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children has had a major impact on the work and family interface. Theories of work and family have been incorporated to analyse potential relationships of conflict with undesirable work outcomes such as reduced job satisfaction and burnout. The study investigates whether work-family conflict ultimately leads to <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children’s experiences of burnout and lower job satisfaction. The research study also explores the effects of the mother-role identity on the manifestation of family and work conflict in <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children and posits that <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children experience role salience differently from other working women without children. The study employed a quantitative research design using electronic self-administered questionnaires. Using the data from 545 employees in a fast-moving consumer goods industry showed that <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children who identified closer with the mother-role identity, experienced greater work-family conflict. The mother-role identity forms a greater part of <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children’s self than that of the employee-role identity and the results infer that role identity plays a significant role when conflict is experienced. In <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children, strong relationships were found between family-work conflict and burnout, and moderate inverse relationships between work-family conflict and job satisfaction. Work-family conflict may ultimately lead <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children to experience higher burnout and lower job satisfaction owing to their preoccupation with family-related responsibilities. The concept of role identity is introduced as a significant variable to consider into the work and family conflict investigation, {{as well as in the}} development of burnout and job satisfaction for <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children. The current research also assists in understanding the work and family role integration of <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children and provides a consolidated overview of the current work and family theories within a conceptual and unifying model. This research offers an explanatory model that outlines the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, by investigating the mechanisms by virtue of which such relationships exist.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis is}} conducted on two panels of 18 OECD countries {{to test whether}} the elasticity of hourly productivity to working time is negative and decreasing <b>with</b> <b>working</b> time itself. If so, the decreasing returns on working time could be indicative of a fatigue effect that increases <b>with</b> <b>working</b> time. We find that the elasticity of productivity per hour to working time is negative and decreasing <b>with</b> <b>working</b> time, but its coefficient is not strongly significant. This study offers empirical support for the hypothesis of a fatigue effect that increases <b>with</b> <b>working</b> time, but <b>with</b> some reservations.
