5|$|Changyuraptor yangi {{is a close}} {{relative}} of Microraptor gui, also {{thought to be a}} glider or flyer based on the presence of four wings and similar limb proportions. However, it is a considerably larger animal, around the size of a <b>wild</b> <b>turkey,</b> being among the largest known flying Mesozoic paravians.|$|E
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, <b>wild</b> <b>turkey,</b> and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Small mammal {{species that}} inhabit along the trails are beaver, squirrel, river otter, chipmunk, porcupine, bobcat, {{two species of}} fox, boar, woodchuck, raccoon, and coyote. Bird species that reside in the trails are <b>wild</b> <b>turkey,</b> ruffed grouse, {{mourning}} dove, raven, two species of eagle, wood duck, three species of owl, and three species of hawk as well as warblers.|$|E
40|$|Nineteen dead <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> were necropsied and 573 live <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> were {{physically}} examined for pathological agents in Arkansas between 1992 and 1997 {{to determine the}} proximate role disease may play in declining wild populations in Arkansas. Necropsy of the dead <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> identified avian pox and histomoniasis as the most common diseases (16 % and 11 % of necropsies, respectively). Avian pox was recorded from three major physiographic regions in the state (Ozark Highlands, Ouachita Mountains, Gulf Coastal Plain). One hen died of non-accidental crop impaction, the fifth occurrence observed in the southeastern United States. Another hen died after developing severe, focal necrotic dermatitis caused by a Penicillium sp. fungus, the first occurrence observed in <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys.</b> All live <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> appeared free of gross signs of disease. We found diseases in <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> in Arkansas are not uncommon and are more diverse than previously reported. Continued monitoring of disease in <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> is therefore encouraged...|$|R
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{addition}} to the wildlife at Rockwood has been the reintroduction of <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys.</b> Due to unregulated hunting, <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> were at one point completely gone. However, eastern <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> from the southern United States were introduced to this area within the past 20 years and are now permanent residents.|$|R
50|$|There were {{virtually}} no <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> or white-tail deer in {{large parts of}} South Carolina. <b>Wild</b> <b>turkeys,</b> as well as deer, had been largely extirpated {{from most of the}} state, particularly the Piedmont and mountain regions upstate. Feral hogs has decimated the state's <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys,</b> which are ground nesting birds, by eating their eggs.|$|R
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and <b>wild</b> <b>turkey</b> are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as <b>wild</b> <b>turkey,</b> bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota's varied {{geography}} is inhabited by {{many species of}} birds. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted particularly well to the area after being introduced from China, and growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. The <b>wild</b> <b>turkey</b> is another large bird found {{in many areas of}} the state. The numerous lakes and wetlands of eastern South Dakota support migratory populations of Canada geese, snow geese, mallards, pelicans, and wood ducks. The prairie serves as home to songbirds such as meadowlarks (both the eastern and western varieties), goldfinches, and bluebirds, and the open landscape of the plains also suits many carnivorous birds, such as hawks, falcons, and owls.|$|E
25|$|The {{state also}} stocked <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> in the 1950s. There were {{reported}} {{to be less than}} 900 at one point. Once nearly extinct here, <b>wild</b> <b>turkeys</b> thrive throughout today's Kentucky. Hunters officially reported a record 29,006 birds taken during the 23-day season in Spring 2009.|$|R

5|$|The PGC {{established}} the Northcentral State Game Farm in 1945 {{on part of}} State Game Lands 134 to raise <b>wild</b> <b>turkey.</b> The farm was converted to ringneck pheasant production in 1981, and, as of 2007, {{it was one of}} four Pennsylvania state game farms that produced about 200,000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting. The Northcentral State Game Farm is chiefly in the Plunketts Creek valley, just south of Proctor and north of the bridge. The opening weekend of the trout season brings more people into the village of Barbours at the mouth of Plunketts Creek than any other time of the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek {{are lined with}} large rock and cliff {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants rare {{in the state of}} Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species of wildflowers bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, bloodroot, blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, <b>wild</b> <b>turkey,</b> and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass, rock bass, channel catfish and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E
25|$|A {{break in}} the case came in March 2014 when a Buffalo Trace {{employee}} was arrested by Franklin County deputies when five barrels of stolen <b>Wild</b> <b>Turkey</b> bourbon were found on his property. On April 21, 2015 nine Kentucky residents, three of whom were employees at both <b>Wild</b> <b>Turkey</b> and Buffalo Trace, were indicted for thefts at the Buffalo Trace and <b>Wild</b> <b>Turkey</b> distilleries dating back to 2008. Over $100,000 worth of the stolen whiskey was recovered, including {{more than two dozen}} bottles of Pappy Van Winkle and 15 barrels of <b>Wild</b> <b>Turkey.</b> The Van Winkle family has stated that the stolen whiskey should be destroyed as a precaution against tampering or contamination, pending the approval of the judge.|$|E
