5|$|Parsifal <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Garden is a {{dream and}} asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E
5|$|Redfield and Alomar {{board the}} tanker and {{encounter}} Gionne, who escapes after dropping {{a case of}} syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Redfield <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> world is worth fighting for. Looking at Alomar and Valentine, he decides {{to live in a}} world without fear.|$|E

Occasionally the fog in his mind lifts. During one such time, he finds himself aware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him. Jack shows him that the bow and arrow have become more reliable than the gun, whose cartridges do not always work. Ish realizes that the former civilization is now completely gone. But he also <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> new world is that much worse off than the old world, and finds himself hoping that the new world will not rebuild civilization and its mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent. The {{evidence}} points to manslaughter at best and murder at worst. Mrs Rice suddenly has an idea and <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> hotel management and foreign police are open to bribery. Harold agrees {{to give it a}} try and wires for money but aside from that, and unable to speak the local language, leaves Mrs Rice to carry out the negotiations. All seems to go well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people.|$|E

Ensign Nellie Forbush, a naïve U.S. Navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, {{has fallen in}} love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right ("A Cockeyed Optimist"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> other reciprocates those feelings ("Twin Soliloquies"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other ("Some Enchanted Evening").

500|$|During the trip, Danner <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Mayans and Egyptians had {{discovered}} the same formula as his father, [...] "which could be poured into the veins of the slaves , making them stronger than engines". There, he works as the head steward of the hired Mayan helpers and proves himself an asset to the team. But when a mishap reveals his great strength to the professor, the elderly man suggests Danner use his father's formula {{to create a new}} race of men known as the [...] "Sons of Dawn", who will use their powers to right the world's wrongs. The idea appeals to him at first, but Danner fears that these sons would also be hated by humanity for their superiority and treated much the same as himself. In the end, he climbs a mountain amidst an oncoming thunderstorm, and is struck dead by lightning while praying to God. The formula is lost in the resulting fire. The professor discovers his charred remains three days later and buries him among the Mayan ruins.|$|E
500|$|Garfield's biographers, {{and those}} who have studied his {{presidency}}, tend to think well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian Justus D. Doenecke, while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements, [...] "by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched." [...] Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation. According to Caldwell, writing in 1931, [...] "If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality—but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more." [...] Rutkow writes, [...] "James Abram Garfield's presidency is reduced to a tantalizing 'what if.|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} is shot {{primarily}} in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish {{a little girl in}} the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. [...] "It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down... the annihilation of European Jewry," [...] he said. [...] "So that was my message in letting that scene be in color." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing [...] "the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance."

2500|$|Women {{artists are}} notable {{producers}} of self-portraits; almost all significant women painters have left an example, from Caterina van Hemessen to the prolific Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, and Frida Kahlo, {{as well as}} Alice Neel, Paula Modersohn-Becker and Jenny Saville who painted themselves in the nude. [...] Vigée-Lebrun painted a total of 37 self-portraits, {{many of which were}} copies of earlier ones, painted for sale. Until the 20th century women were usually unable to train in drawing the nude, which made {{it difficult for them to}} paint large figure compositions, leading many artists to specialize in portrait work. Women artists have historically embodied a number of roles within their self-portraiture. Most common is the artist at work, showing themselves in the act of painting, or at least holding a brush and palette. Often, the viewer <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> clothes worn were those they normally painted in, as the elaborate nature of many ensembles was an artistic choice to show her skill at fine detail.|$|E
2500|$|After Bender's {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt at}} godhood, he encounters a god-like entity in space.

Bender eventually theorizes that the entity may have, in fact, been {{the remains of a}} satellite that collided with God, to which the entity replies [...] "Probable". The conversation between them touches on the ideas of predestination, prayer, and the nature of salvation, in what Mark Pinsky referred to as a theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need [...] "to be reminded that this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class". By the end of the conversation, Bender's questions still have not been fully answered, and he is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him. The character/entity returned, albeit briefly, in the first of the direct-to-DVD installments, Bender's Big Score.|$|E

In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote that Buckaroo Banzai [...] "may well {{turn out to be}} a pilot film for other theatrical features, though this one would be hard to top for pure, nutty fun". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "its creators, Earl Mac Rauch and W.D. Richter, propel their film with such pace and farfetched style that anyone without Ph.D.s in astrophysics and pop culture is likely to get lost in the ganglion of story strands. One <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> movie is too ambitious, facetious and hip for its own box-office good". Film critic Pauline Kael wrote, [...] "I didn't find it hard to accept the uninflected, deadpan tone, and to enjoy Buckaroo Banzai for its inventiveness and the gags that bounce off other adventure movies, other comedies. The picture's sense of fun carried me along".|$|E
