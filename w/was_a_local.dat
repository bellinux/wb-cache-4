5|$|Some {{historians have}} argued that the Ford {{administration}} felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local,</b> and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E

5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD.

5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E

5|$|A silver boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland ‚Äì up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production.|$|E

5|$|Although Palmyrene art {{was related}} to that of Greece, it had a {{distinctive}} style unique to the middle-Euphrates region. Palmyrene art is well represented by the bust reliefs which seal the openings of its burial chambers. The reliefs emphasized clothing, jewelry and a frontal representation of the person depicted, characteristics which {{can be seen as}} a forerunner of Byzantine art. According to Michael Rostovtzeff, Palmyra's art was influenced by Parthian art. However, the origin of frontality that characterized Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by Daniel Schlumberger), Michael Avi-Yonah contends that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art. Little painting, and none of the bronze statues of prominent citizens (which stood on brackets on the main columns of the Great Colonnade), have survived. A damaged frieze and other sculptures from the Temple of Bel, many removed to museums in Syria and abroad, suggest the city's public monumental sculpture.|$|E
5|$|At {{its most}} fundamental, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> feud between two {{competing}} dynastic interests‚Äîthe Seneschals (Truchsess) of the House of Waldburg and the dukes of the House of Wittelsbach‚Äîthat acquired religious overtones. The dispute had broad implications in the political, social, and dynastic {{balance of the}} Holy Roman Empire. It tested the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in the religious Peace of Augsburg (1555). The 1555 agreement settled religious problems in the Empire with the principle Cuius regio, eius religio: the subjects of a secular prince followed the religion of their sovereign. Ecclesiastical reservation excluded the territories of the imperial prelates (bishops, archbishops, abbots or abbesses) from cuius regio, eius religio. In an ecclesiastical territory, if the prelate changed his religion, his subjects {{did not have to}} do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post. Problematically, the 1555 agreement did not specify this detail.|$|E
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E

5|$|Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Chadderton formed {{part of the}} Oldham Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit {{established}} to provide social security.

The urban district council, comprising 18 members, would later be based out of Chadderton Town Hall, a purpose built municipal building opened in 1913. In 1933, there were exchanges of land with the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Middleton and City of Manchester.|$|E

5|$|In 1190, York Castle was the {{location}} {{of one of the}} worst pogroms in England during the medieval period. The Normans had introduced , where some occupied a special economic role as moneylenders, an essential but otherwise banned activity. English Jews were subject to considerable religious prejudice and primarily worked from towns and cities in which there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks from the majority Christian population. Royal protection was usually granted as the Norman and Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown, reverting to the king on a Jew's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1198 and 1199, William was Sheriff of Devon and Sheriff of Cornwall, {{along with}} another royal servant, {{and served as a}} royal justice. In 1200 he was {{recorded}} as a receiver of the carucage, a tax on land, in the Pipe roll; whether this meant that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> or a national collector of the tax is unclear. By 12 September 1204, William was Archdeacon of Taunton in the Diocese of Bath, and he witnessed the election of Jocelin of Wells as the new bishop of the diocese. He was jointly placed in charge of the mints of London and Canterbury in 1205, along with Reginald de Cornhill, with whom he also shared the collection of the tax of a fifteenth on merchants, a post the two had held since 1202. In May 1205 William, along with de Cornhill, was given custody of one of three dies for the mint at Chichester; in July the king gave William's custody to Simon of Wells, the Bishop of Chichester. William was one of the officials in charge of the collection of a tax of a thirteenth in 1207.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Thomson, Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming {{were members}} of The Medway Poets {{performance}} group, to which Absolon and Sanchia Lewis had earlier contributed. Peter Waite's Rochester Pottery staged a series of solo painting shows. In 1982, TVS broadcast a documentary on the poets. That year, Emin, then a fashion student, and Childish started a relationship; her writing was edited by Bill Lewis, printed by Thomson and published by Childish. Group members published dozens of works. The poetry group dispersed after two years, reconvening in 1987 to record The Medway Poets LP. Clark, Howard and Machine became involved over the following years. Thomson got to know Williams, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> art student and whose girlfriend {{was a friend of}} Emin; Thomson also met Everall.
