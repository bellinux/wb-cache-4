50|$|Spotless crake are omnivorous. Their diet {{consists}} of seeds, fruits, shoots of grasses, leaves of aquatic plants, adult and larval insects, mollusks, crustaceans, spiders, carrion, <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and other insects.|$|R
60|$|As soon as Dias started, {{the lines}} were got ready. They cut a couple of saplings to serve as rods, and José, digging among the rocks, found plenty of <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and grubs for bait. In addition, they took a cake or two of maize, to break up and throw in to attract the fish.|$|R
50|$|Periophthalmus barbarus is an omnivore. In the wild, mudskippers {{prefer to}} eat worms, crickets, flies, meal <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> small fish, and small {{crustaceans}} (sesarmid crabs). Mudskippers kept as pets can eat frozen fare such as bloodworm or artemia and flake. It cannot eat dried food, however, because its stomach would swell up. It is recommended to feed it frozen {{food for a}} healthy diet.|$|R
500|$|As adults, long-toed {{salamanders}} {{often go}} unnoticed because they live a subterranean lifestyle digging, migrating, and feeding on the invertebrates in forest soils, decaying logs, small rodent burrows or rock fissures. The adult diet consists of insects, tadpoles, <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles</b> and small fish. Salamanders are preyed upon by garter snakes, small mammals, birds, and fish. An adult may live 6–10 years, {{with the largest}} individuals weighing approximately , snout to vent lengths reaching , and total lengths reaching [...]|$|R
50|$|Aklan {{is synonymous}} with Inubarang Manok, chicken simmered in coconut milk, as well as Binakoe na Manok, chicken cooked in bamboo with lemongrass. Of {{particular}} interest is Tamilok (<b>wood</b> <b>worms),</b> which is either eaten raw or dipped in an acidic sauce such as vinegar or calamansi. There is a special prevalence of chicken and coconut milk (gata) in Akeanon cooking.|$|R
50|$|At {{any other}} time, also, {{if a woman}} strips herself naked while she is menstruating, and walks round a field of wheat, the caterpillars, <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and other vermin, will fall from off the ears of corn. Metrodorus of Scepsis tells us that this {{discovery}} was first made in Cappadocia; and that, in consequence of such multitudes of cantharides being found to breed there, it is the practice for women {{to walk through the}} middle of the fields with their garments tucked up above the thighs.|$|R
25|$|Bins need holes or mesh for aeration. Some people add a spout or {{holes in}} the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection. The most common {{materials}} used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and <b>wood.</b> <b>Worm</b> compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay {{and need to be}} replaced.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the Capella Antiqua Bambergensis {{bought the}} property, which had again fallen into poor condition. The timber framing was almost {{completely}} destroyed by dry rot and <b>wood</b> <b>worms.</b> The floors were molded, {{and in several}} places the ceilings had collapsed. There was no electricity, no sanitation and no heating. After over 30,000 hours of work, the music group re-opened the castle and the park to the public.|$|R
50|$|Around 65 {{species of}} Demodex are known. Two species live on humans: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis, both {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} eyelash mites. Different species of animals host different species of Demodex. Demodex canis lives on the domestic dog. Infestation with Demodex is common and usually does not cause any symptoms, although occasionally some skin diseases {{can be caused by}} the mites. Demodex is derived from Greek dēmos fat + dēx, a <b>wood</b> <b>worm.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Schon in der Antike waren Schnecken als Pflanzenschädlinge ein Thema. So findet man in einem Gebet des Märtyrers Trypho von Lampsacus aus dem 10. Jahrhundert, das im Rahmen von Exorzismus-ähnlichen Riten eingesetzt wurde, Folgendes: „O ye, Caterpillars, <b>Worms,</b> <b>Beetles,</b> Locusta, Grasshoppers, Wooly-Bears, Wireworms … Snails, Earwigs and {{all other}} creatures that cling to and wither {{the fruit of the}} grape {{and all other}} herbs, I charge you by the many-eyed Cherubim, and by the six-winged Seraphim … and by the holy Angels and all the powers, hurt not the vines nor the land nor the fruit of the trees nor the {{vegetables}} … but depart into the wild mountains, into the unfruitful woods … [...].“ (Harmer 1895).|$|R

5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and moray eels, and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|R
50|$|In Ben 10: Omniverse, the Nemetrix, a {{knock-off}} of {{the original}} Omnitrix used by a bounty hunter with an alien dog which uses the Nemetrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of the sentient alien races such as a giant <b>worm,</b> <b>beetle,</b> etc., which throughout the Omniverse series have {{the sole purpose of}} hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it themselves without incurring mental and/or genetic damage. In Omniverse, Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.|$|R

50|$|Rotenone {{has been}} used as an organic {{pesticide}} dust for gardens. Unselective in action, it kills potato beetles, cucumber beetles, flea <b>beetles,</b> cabbage <b>worms,</b> raspberry <b>beetles,</b> and asparagus beetles, as well as most other arthropods. It rapidly biodegrades under warm conditions, so harmful residues are minimal. A light dusting on the leaves of plants will control insects for several days.|$|R
50|$|Many {{historical}} references {{suggest that}} anasyrma had dramatic or supernatural effect—positive or negative. Pliny the Elder wrote that a menstruating woman who uncovers her body can scare away hailstorms, whirlwinds and lightning. If she strips naked and {{walks around the}} field, caterpillars, <b>worms</b> and <b>beetles</b> fall off the ears of corn. Even when not menstruating, she can lull a storm out at sea by stripping.|$|R

5000|$|Construction of {{a bridge}} across the Brisbane River was first agreed to in 1861. The newly formed Legislative Assembly of Queensland forced the council {{to pay for the}} costs. £70,000 worth of {{borrowings}} was acquired from the Bank of Queensland.Work first began on the foundations for the first {{bridge across the}} Brisbane River on 22 August 1864. The bridge, known as the Brisbane Bridge, was a tolled, timber structure which opened in June 1865. It was a temporary structure which was {{to be replaced by a}} more elaborately designed, iron lattice-girder bridge. [...] The Bank of Queensland failed in July 1866, bringing about a halt to funding for the project. The state government was reluctant to take on responsibility for the bridge's construction because it didn't want to incur debt. The timber bridge quickly succumbed to marine <b>wood</b> <b>worm</b> and began to progressively collapse. The council wasn't able to fully repair the structure and its remnants took two years to fall away into the river.|$|R
25|$|Only one Red Cross {{supply of}} parcels was {{received}} by the prisoners between March 1942 and September 1945. This arrived in March 1944 and worked out at one sixth of a parcel per person: a single tin of food. Prisoners occasionally were able to buy or barter chicks which they raised on <b>worms</b> and <b>beetles</b> and rice sweepings from the quartermaster's store floor (other edible food scraps being too precious to use). If female these provided much-needed eggs.|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{with the}} snake {{detection}} hypothesis, previous ERP studies {{have established a}} larger early posterior negativity (EPN) in response to pictures depicting snakes than to pictures depicting other creatures. Here, we examined {{to what extent the}} curvilinear shape of the snake's body drives the larger EPN. To this end, we employed pictures of threatening and nonthreatening species with or without typical curvature. Participants watched a random rapid serial visual presentation of snake, <b>worm,</b> spider, and <b>beetle</b> pictures. The EPN was scored as the mean activity (225 - 300 ms after picture onset) at occipital and parieto-occipital electrodes. Across electrodes, the EPN was significantly larger for snake pictures than for spider, <b>worm,</b> and <b>beetle</b> pictures, and for spider and worm pictures than for beetle pictures. The results suggest that curvilinear body shapes may partly drive the enhanced EPN. However, the unique cortical response to snakes is not fully explained by this mechanism, and is most probably also determined by other threat-relevant cues...|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of some Echis species. For others, their diets are {{reported}} to be extremely varied, and may include items such as locusts, <b>beetles,</b> <b>worms,</b> slugs, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, solifugids, frogs, toads, reptiles (including other snakes), small mammals, and birds.|$|R
50|$|This pelican feeds {{almost entirely}} on fish. Preferred prey species can include common carp (Cyprinus carpio), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), common rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus), eels, catfish (especially silurids during winter), mullet and {{northern}} pike (Esox lucius), the latter having measured up to 50 cm when taken. In the largest remnant colony, located in Greece, the preferred prey is reportedly the native Alburnus belvica. The Dalmatian pelican requires around 1200 g of fish per day and can take locally abundant smaller fish such as gobies, but usually ignore them in lieu of slightly larger fish. It usually forages alone or in groups of only two or three. It normally swims along, placidly and slowly, until it quickly dunks its head underwater and scoops the fish out, along with great masses of water. The water is dumped out of {{the sides of the}} pouch and the fish is swallowed. Occasionally it may feed cooperatively with other pelicans by corralling fish into shallow waters and may even cooperate similarly while fishing alongside cormorants in Greece. Occasionally, the pelican may not immediately eat the fish contained in its gular pouch, so it can save the prey for later consumption. Other small wetlands-dwellers may supplement the diet, including crustaceans, <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles</b> and small water birds, usually nestlings and eggs.|$|R
50|$|The Antilles pinktoe is an {{aggressive}} feeder and will eat anything from crickets, <b>worm,</b> grasshoppers, cockroaches, <b>beetles,</b> moths, and other flying insects, to anole lizards. They will also take mealworms and moth larvae, but these {{have to be}} given sparingly due to their fat percentage and the calcium-phosphorus proportions.|$|R

40|$|The growth {{fertilizer}} recommendation for grapevine is mainly based on using mineral fertilizers, which only recommends {{the application of}} nitrogen. However, using organic fertilizers is getting more popular in agriculture. It benefits the environment {{because it is a}} natural process, promotes organic matter recycling, and also helps the edaphic fauna, as well as <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> fungi with beneficial bacteria. With the objective to compare the organic and the mineral fertilizer during the initial growth of the Paulsen 1103 (berlandieri x rupestres) rootstock and, posteriorly, the leaves nutritional composition and the production of dry matter from the branches of the Cabernet Sauvignon graft, it has been developed as an experiment in the field, at Embrapa Uva e Vinho dependencies, Bento Gonçalves, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in Neossolo Litólico soil, using an experimental design of random blocks with 5 repetitions, with the experimental plot constituted by 32 Paulsen 1103 rootstocks, planted in July 2013, with 2, 5 m spacing between lines and 1, 3 m between each rootstock and conducted in a vertical trellis system.

50|$|It is {{revealed}} in Superior Saturday that even if all the realms of the House were to be destroyed by Nothing, except the Incomparable Gardens, the universe will still exist {{and will not be}} destroyed as Arthur previously believed. Arthur believed that the entire House was created before the universe and that its partial destruction would thus cause the Secondary Realms to cease to exist. This is incorrect as The Incomparable Gardens alone were in fact the first thing the Architect created from Nothing; the Secondary Realms were created secondly, followed closely by the other Demesnes of the House for the purpose of study and documentation. This therefore makes the Incomparable Gardens {{the most important part of}} the House, and indeed, the epicentre of all creation. The Incomparable Gardens are 'defended' by a variety of bug-like creatures (believed to be Nithlings), mostly giant <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and similar. The Gardens' supporting Drasil Trees, which are situated in the four corners of the Upper House, are also defended by beetle-shaped Nithlings. Past attempts to invade have failed due to these creatures, and Superior Saturday's attempts to build a tower tall enough to reach Sunday failed due to the Drasil trees' growth. However, she was able to slow them down by destroying segments of the house with Nothing. Thus, she was able to launch her invasion. The Nothing, however, has continued unabated, and threatens to destroy the House.|$|R

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} answers the most {{frequently}} asked health questions (FAQs) about endosulfan. For more information, call the ATSDR Information Center at 1 - 800 - 232 - 4636. This fact sheet is {{one in a series}} of summaries about hazardous substances and their health effects. It is important you understand this information because this substance may harm you. The effects of exposure to any hazardous substance depend on the dose, the duration, how you are exposed, personal traits and habits, and whether other chemicals are present. HIGHLIGHTS: Exposure to endosulfan occurs mainly from eating contaminated food, but may also occur from skin contact, breathing contaminated air, or drinking contamin ated water. Endosulfan affects the function of the nervous system. Endosulfan has been found in at least 164 of the 1, 699 National Priorities List si tes identified by the Environmental Protection A gency (EPA). What is endosulfan? Endosulfan is a restricted-use pesticide. It is particularly effective against aphids, fruit <b>worms,</b> <b>beetles,</b> leafhoppers, moth larvae, and white flies {{on a wide variety of}} crops. Endosulfan is sold as a mixture of two different forms of the same chemical (referred to as α- and β-endosulfan). Technical grade endosulfan also contains endosulfan sulfate. It is a cream-to-brown-colored solid that may appear crystalline or in flakes. It has a distinct odor similar to turpentine. Endosulfan is applied to crops by aerial or ground-level foliar spray. The use of endosulfan is being restricted to certain crops and is scheduled to be canceled for all uses b...|$|R
40|$|In 2011, western corn root <b>worm</b> <b>beetles</b> were {{detected}} in the federal states Hesse (Groß-Gerau) and Rhineland-Palatinate (Bodenheim) for the first time. Control measures based on commission decision 2003 / 766 /EG (Byrne, 2003) were conducted after detection in PAL-traps. Focus and safety zones were established. In Hesse, both focus and safety zones were treated with the insecticide Biscaya, due to {{the high number of}} 50 beetles which {{were detected}} in the PAL-traps. Since in Rhineland-Palatinate, only one beetle had been captured, only the focus zone was treated with the insecticide. After insecticide treatment, new PAL-traps were arranged like a close grid over the infested areas in both federal states. In each maize field in the focus- and safety zone further traps were placed and checked weekly until September 30 th by supporting staff. Until the end of the monitoring in 2011 (September 30 th) further beetles were {{detected in the}} south of the area (district of Groß-Gerau, Hesse), were the first infestation had been discovered. However, in Rhineland-Palatinate no further beetles were detected that year. By the end of the monitoring 354 beetles in Hesse and one beetle in Rhineland-Palatinate had been captured in total. Subsequently the demarked zones in Hesse were extended. Taking into account the local circumstances, the new focus zone was delimited to include all the areas where beetles had been detected as well as the surrounding maize fields. In the focus zones the cultivation of maize was forbidden for the consecutive two years and a crop rotation with at least 50 percent maize was established in the safety zones. In 2012 no further beetles were captured in the infested region...|$|R
