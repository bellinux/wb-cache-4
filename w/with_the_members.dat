5|$|Javier Lugo from Manga Life found Shikamaru's {{fight in}} the series' fourteenth volume good despite how {{threatening}} it is for him. For Part II, Park Cooper from the same site acclaimed Shikamaru's strategy in dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> from the series' antagonist, Akatsuki. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network praised how Shikamaru's epilogue episodes helps to expand his characterization as he decides to aid Naruto when he becomes the Hokage. Reviewing the anime s third episode, Sam Stewart from IGN enjoyed the adult Shikamaru's characterization for how he helps his sons Shikadai but ultimately felt he was overshadowed by his wife Temari.|$|E

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E

5|$|Attempts at {{establishing}} cooperatively owned radio networks {{had been}} made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System. Mutual's original participating stations were WOR–Newark, New Jersey, just outside New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGN–Chicago (owned by WGN Inc., {{a subsidiary of the}} Chicago Tribune), WXYZ–Detroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLW–Cincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50% of the stock—five each of the ten total shares.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Jinnah and Gandhi, who had by then been {{released}} from his palatial prison, met formally at the Muslim leader's home on Malabar Hill in Bombay. Two weeks of talks followed between them, which resulted in no agreement. Jinnah insisted on Pakistan being conceded prior to the British departure and to come into being immediately, while Gandhi proposed that plebiscites on partition occur sometime after a united India gained its independence. In early 1945, Liaquat and the Congress leader Bhulabhai Desai met, with Jinnah's approval, and agreed that after the war, the Congress and the League should form an interim government <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the Executive Council of the Viceroy to be nominated by the Congress and the League in equal numbers. When the Congress leadership were released from prison in June 1945, they repudiated the agreement and censured Desai for acting without proper authority.|$|E

5|$|The BJP's origins {{lie in the}} Bharatiya Jana Sangh, {{formed in}} 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party; it {{defeated}} the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in strength {{on the back of}} the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days.|$|E
5|$|The Czech revolutionary {{network in}} Europe {{also had a}} role in the {{uncovering}} of Bagha Jatin's plans. The network was in touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots. The American network, headed by E. V. Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

5|$|The House of Representatives of Japan (衆議院) is the Lower house, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of {{the house}} being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a {{four-year}} term. As of December 24, 2014, it has 475 members. Of these, 180 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 295 are elected from single-member constituencies. 238 seats are required for majority. The House of Representatives is the more powerful house out of the two, {{it is able to}} override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority. It can, however, be dissolved by the Prime Minister at will. Members {{of the house}} must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 25 years and older may run for office in the lower house.|$|E
5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet. In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor caucus had decided that should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be Cabinet members. Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work, and on 18 December the caucus elected the Cabinet. The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam, and within three hours, he had announced the portfolios of the Cabinet members. To give himself greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control of the Cabinet agenda.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Gymnopilus, {{it is located}} in the {{subgenus}} Gymnopilus and section Macrospori. The subgenus Gymnopilus was proposed by Henri Romagnesi as Cortinatae (while the genus was known as Fulvidula) in 1942, though the name Gymnopilus was given later by Rolf Singer. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no veils, or veils that do not form rings. The section Macrospori, proposed by Guzmán-Dávalos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. Molecular analysis revealed that G.maritimus forms a sister group to (that is, shares an immediate common ancestor with) the spectabilis–imperialis clade, a clade that includes G.imperialis, G.spectabilis, G.junonius (often considered synonymous with G.spectabilis), G.pampeanus, and others. G. maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of spectabilis–imperialis; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with fibrils (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores that turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine.|$|E
