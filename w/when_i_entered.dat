500|$|On February 2, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Williams would travel to the United States to have heart surgery. The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada's health care system. According to Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale, [...] "It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province." [...] Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for, or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada. On February 8, 2010, it {{was reported}} that Williams' surgery had been successful. On his return, Williams later defended his choice saying: [...] "I did not sign away my right to get the best possible health care for myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> politics". Williams said although he had [...] "the utmost confidence" [...] in his own province's health care system, his decision was to go to Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami to undergo [...] "a very specialized piece of surgery [...] somebody who's doing this {{three or four times a}} day, five, six days a week." ...|$|E

2500|$|Where Renzi {{lived and}} what he did {{throughout}} the 1986–1997 period is unclear. In a letter to the Arizona Daily Sun in July 2002, Renzi said [...] "The only time I have not lived in Arizona is when I served our nation overseas on a Defense Department program, or <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> law school at age 39" [...] But according to an August 2002 Associated Press article, Renzi said that between college, starting in the late 1970s, and his return some 20 years later, he had lived in Flagstaff for only a total of seven years. The AP article also said [...] "Renzi made much of his money while living in Burke, Virginia, about 20 minutes from downtown Washington. He has owned a $765,000 two-story, six-bedroom home on five acres there since 1991, according to Fairfax County, Virginia, property records." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the moderates on Congress politics began to wane after Gokhale died in 1915. Anti-moderate leaders such as Annie Beasant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak {{took the opportunity to}} call for a national movement for Home Rule. But, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action. Besant nevertheless formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916; and Tilak, on his release from a prison term, had in April 1916 formed his own league. Nehru joined both leagues but worked especially for the former. He remarked later: [...] " [...] had a very powerful influence on me in my childhood... even later <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> political life her influence continued." [...] Another development which brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of Hindu-Muslim unity with the Lucknow Pact {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress in December 1916. The pact had been initiated earlier in the year at Allahabad at a meeting of the All India Congress Committee which was held at the Nehru residence at Anand Bhawan. Nehru welcomed and encouraged the rapprochement between the two Indian communities.|$|E

[...] I shall {{have to give him}} the lie when he says that I was offered $1500 by an agent of Coach Yost to enter Michigan. [...] I neither {{received}} an offer direct or indirect from Yost nor any agent. [...] I went to Michigan because several lawyers in my native town were graduates of that university and I always liked the place. [...] I do not regret my choice. [...] If President Jordan will talk facts rather than trash, he will change his attitude on my standing in college, so far as Michigan is concerned. [...] At Stanford I was only a special and I do not deny that my work was not of a high order. [...] At Michigan I never flunked during my entire course, and what the conditions were against me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> I made up by working hard in summer school. ... I owe it to Michigan and athletics in general to state definitely that I did not receive one cent in connection with athletics while I was in Michigan." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
