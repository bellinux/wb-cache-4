40|$|Abstract Recent {{years have}} seen a growing {{interest}} in {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} receptor (IGF 1 R) in medical oncology. Interesting data have <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> IGF 1 r in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) especially in children and in young adult patients whose disease does not harbour mutations on KIT and PDGFRA and are poorly responsive to conventional therapies. However, {{it is too early to}} reach conclusions on IGF 1 R as a novel therapeutic target in GIST because the receptor's biological role is still to be defined and the clinical significance in patients needs to be studied in larger studies. We update and comment the current literature on IGF 1 R in GISTs and discuss the future perspectives in this promising field. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The small rigid sail {{projects}} {{into the}} air and catches the wind [...] However Velella sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind. Having no means of locomotion other than its sail, V. velella is at the mercy of prevailing winds for moving around the seas, and are thereby also subject to mass-strandings on beaches throughout the world. For example, most years in the spring, there is a mass stranding that occurs along the West Coast of North America, from British Columbia to California, beginning in the north and moving south over several weeks' time. In some years, so many animals are left at the tide line by receding waves, that the line of dying (and subsequently rotting) animals may be many centimetres deep, along hundreds of kilometres of beaches. Mass strandings have <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>also</b> <b>on</b> the west coast of Ireland.|$|R
