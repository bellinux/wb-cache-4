5|$|The {{marshes and}} meres {{surrounding}} the village supported fishing since Saxon times, {{at least until}} significant draining during the 17th century. Eels were plentiful in the waters {{in and around the}} Isle of Ely (Eel–ey). In 1086, Little Thetford was worth 3,250 eels to the nearby abbots. In one year, 1087, it was written that 52,000 eels <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> and around the city. The islands in this landscape supported pastures; whilst reeds, peat, and rushes were harvested from the wetlands. As the land was drained, arable farming became the dominant activity, as it is today.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was part}} of a cavalry force commanded by General Averell that pursued Confederate Generals McCausland and Bradley Johnson after the rebels burned the Pennsylvania community of Chambersburg.

5|$|The {{strongest and}} most notorious {{tropical}} {{system of the}} season was the second tropical cyclone, which peaked as a Category3 hurricane. The storm devastated southwestern Louisiana in early August, especially Cameron Parish, leaving 34fatalities and approximately $5million (1918USD) in damage. In late August, the season's third tropical storm damaged portions of coastal North Carolina, causing up to $15,000 in damage. Although the fifth tropical storm or its extratropical remnants caused only minor impacts on land in Bermuda and Atlantic Canada, 21people drowned after two ships <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the storm.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the bed to grow cotton.|$|E
