5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study by}} He et al. used a simple {{epidemic}} model, to incorporate three factors including school opening and closing, temperature changes {{over the course}} of the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.|$|E

5|$|Hill censer: The hill censer, {{a vessel}} used for burning incense, {{dates to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). The censers are shaped like {{mountains}} and were used for religious rituals. The shape of the hill censer acts as a visual aid for envisioning the sacred mountains that {{were said to have}} been inhabited by Taoist immortals. Hill censers were originally designed for Taoist rituals, but were later used by Chinese Buddhists. Hill censers often include carvings of wilds animals and birds. Some censers depict waves at the foundation of the vessel, said to be the <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East China Sea. A hole {{at the top of the}} censer releases the smoke of the incense.|$|E
5|$|On Carpenter's command, several massive volleys of aimed Spencer repeating rifles hit {{the front}} <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mounted Indians. The volleys {{decimated}} {{them as if}} hit by cannon filled with musket balls. A number of warriors, dismounted and using their ponies as bullet breaks, returned fire. Nearly all of these warriors died along with their ponies. Only three warriors made it to within fifty yards of the wagons before their demise. The Indians were so traumatized and demoralized by Carpenter's defense {{that they did not}} renew their attack.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{activity}} in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased tropical cyclogenesis from African tropical waves, which are troughs that {{move across the}} ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical <b>waves.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> season's twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, {{only three of the}} eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel. There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although {{for the first time in}} over 24years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} phenomenon {{that took place}} within the lands of Poland in the Early Middle Ages, {{as well as other}} parts of central and eastern Europe, was the arrival and permanent settlement of Slavic peoples. The Slavic migrations in the area of contemporary Poland started {{in the second half of}} the 5th century AD, about a half century after these territories were vacated by Germanic tribes. The first <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incoming Slavs settled the vicinity of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands of present southeastern Poland and southern Masovia. Coming from the east, from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River, the immigrants would have had come primarily from the western branch of the early Slavs known as Sclaveni, and since their arrival are classified as West Slavs. Their early archeological traces belong to the Prague-Korchak culture, which is similar to the earlier Kiev culture.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{newly elected}} {{government}} in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, {{and that its}} fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP {{as opposed to the}} 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis.|$|E

25|$|In 1863, François Antoine Edouard and Em. Keller {{presented}} a theory {{by using a}} Le Sage type mechanism in combination with longitudinal <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aether. They supposed that those waves are propagating in every direction and losing some of their momentum after the impact on bodies, so between two bodies the pressure exerted by the waves is weaker than the pressure around them. In 1869, Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran presented the same model as Leray (including absorption {{and the production of}} heat etc.), but like Keller and Keller, he replaced the particles with longitudinal <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aether.|$|E

25|$|NREM Stage 2 (N2 – 45–55% {{of total}} sleep in adults): In this stage, theta {{activity}} is observed and sleepers become gradually harder to awaken; the alpha <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous stage are interrupted by abrupt activity called sleep spindles (or thalamocortical spindles) and K-complexes.
