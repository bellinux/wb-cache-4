40|$|The layup {{sequence}} in a composite laminate greatly effects its properties. If one ply is misaligned in the layup sequence, it {{can result in}} the part being rejected and discarded. At the present time, most manufacturers cut a small coupon from the <b>waste</b> <b>edge</b> and use a microscope to optically verify the ply orientations on critical parts. This can add a substantial cost to the product since the test is both labor intensive and performed after the part is cured. A nondestructive technique {{which could be used}} to test the part after curing and require less time than the optical test would be very beneficial, and one that could be performed prior to curing would be extremely desirable. Preliminary tests demonstrate a high probability that the model and tests developed in this paper can be used for characterizing uncured layups as well...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{recover the}} <b>waste</b> (<b>edges,</b> heads and guts) {{of a species}} of pelagic fish Sardina pilchardus {{as a source of}} lactic bacteria. Methods: The {{microbiological}} control of the fish waste was carried out. Then, the fish waste was assessed as a source of bacteria of industrial interest among other lactic bacteria. The standard protocol for researches of these microorganisms was adopted which comprised enrichment, isolation, identification, purification and conservation. Results: The results of the microbiological control indicated the presence of some species as part of the normal flora of the fish. The physiological and biochemical characterization has presented 2 different groups of lactic bacteria: Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus spp. Conclusions: The assessment of fish waste can give us the opportunity to obtain different species of useful bacteria...|$|R

The <b>wasting</b> <b>edge</b> of the cloud-bank always strives for, but seldom wins, the middle of the gulf. The sun--as the sailors say--is eating it up.

After the statue became a victim in The Mask's antics by making {{it look like a}} statue of Mayor Tilton getting an atomic wedgie, Mayor Tilton went along with Beauregard's idea to hold the Edge City Games between Edge City and Centerville at the newly built Edge City Stadium as a way to ignore The Mask. What Mayor Tilton didn't know is that Colonel Klaxon has been dumping nuclear <b>waste</b> underneath <b>Edge</b> City Stadium where the Edge City Games were being held. This resulted {{in the creation of a}} swamp monster abducting the Edge City Team. During the tournament, Peggy used a security camera to obtain a confession from Beauregard about Edge City Stadium being built on unstable swamp grounds and the creation of a swamp monster. After the swamp monster is defeated followed by the destruction of Edge City Stadium, Beauregard is then given an atomic wedgie by The Mask and is then arrested by Lt. Kellaway.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the total energy {{consumed}} by the Internet has followed an increasing trend over the years. A considerable part of this energy is wasted due to an inefficient utilization of edge devices, i. e., Personal Computers (PCs) and other user equipment in homes and offices. PCs are often left on even when they are not used (e. g., overnight or during weekends), while other edge devices, such as printers, IP phones, and displays, are typically kept always on, especially in public buildings. A number of solutions have been proposed for eliminating, or reducing, energy <b>wastes</b> due to <b>edge</b> devices. In this chapter we propose a general taxonomy for their classification. Then, according to the introduced taxonomy, we survey the main proposals appeared in the literature. Finally, we highlight some open issues...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Seismometers {{deployed}} over a 3 {{year period}} on icebergs in the Ross Sea {{and on the}} Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, reveal that impulsive sources of ocean surface waves are frequent (e. g. ∼ 200 events {{per year in the}} Ross Sea) in the ice-shelf and iceberg-covered environment of coastal Antarctica. The 368 events recorded by our field deployment suggest that these impulsive events are generated by glaciological mechanisms, such as (1) small-scale calving and <b>edge</b> <b>wasting</b> of icebergs and ice-shelf fronts, (2) edge-on-edge closing and opening associated with iceberg collisions and (3) possibly the impulsive opening of void space associated with ice-shelf rifting and basal crevasse formation. The observations described here provide a background of glaciogenic ocean-wave phenomena relevant to the Ross Sea and suggest that these phenomena may be exploited in the future (using more purposefully designed observation schemes) to understand iceberg calving and ice-shelf disintegration processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{appearance}} of a Hamilton cycle in the following random process. The process starts with an empty graph on n labeled vertices. At each round we are presented with K = K(n) edges, chosen uniformly at random from the missing ones, and are asked to add one of them to the current graph. The goal is to create a Hamilton cycle as soon as possible. We show that this problem has three regimes, depending on the value of K. For K = o(log n), n log n, i. e., typically we can construct a Hamilton cycle K times faster that in the usual random graph process. When K = ω(log n) we can essentially <b>waste</b> almost no <b>edges,</b> and create a Hamilton cycle in n + o(n) rounds with high probability. Finally, in the intermediate regime where K = Θ(log n), the threshold has order n and we obtain upper and lower bounds that differ by a multiplicative factor of 3. the threshold for Hamiltonicity is 1 +o(1) 2 K...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{disposing}} of low-level waste {{in a much}} larger trench than the slit trenches analyzed in the revised performance assessment for the E-Area low-level waste facility is evaluated. The conclusion of the evaluation is that such disposal is bounded by the performance assessment if two restrictions are imposed. These restrictions are: the radionuclide inventory limits for slit trench disposal derived from the revised performance assessment, rather than the radionuclide concentration or package limits, are applied to the larger trench. For stabilized waste radionuclide concentration or package limits derived from the inventory limits for these wasteforms calculated in the performance assessment and the volumetric waste capacity of the entire MegaTrench may be used if this waste fills a large-enough segment of the trench to provide structural support for the closure cap, as assumed in the performance assessment and the stabilized waste is segregated from the unstabilized waste by emplacing the stabilized <b>waste</b> along the <b>edge</b> of the trench and separating the stabilized waste from the unstabilized waste by {{a minimum of two}} feet of soil or other material with similar hydraulic properties...|$|R

5000|$|In Britain, [...] "digging for victory" [...] used {{much land}} such as <b>waste</b> ground, railway <b>edges,</b> {{ornamental}} gardens and lawns, while sports fields and golf courses were requisitioned for farming or vegetable growing. Sometimes a sports field was left {{as it was}} but used for sheep-grazing instead of being mown (for example see Effects of the Second World War). By 1943, the number of allotments had roughly doubled to 1,400,000, including rural, urban and suburban plots. C.H. Middleton's radio programme In Your Garden reached millions of listeners keen for advice on growing potatoes, leeks and the like, and helped ensure a communal sense of contributing {{to the war effort}} (as well as a practical response to food rationing). County Herb Committees were established to collect medicinal herbs when German blockades created shortages, for instance in Digitalis purpurea (Foxglove) which was used to regulate heartbeat. Victory gardens were planted in backyards and on apartment-building rooftops, with the occasional vacant lot [...] "commandeered for the war effort!" [...] and put to use as a cornfield or a squash patch. During World War II, sections of lawn were publicly plowed for plots in Hyde Park, London to promote the movement, while allotments growing onions {{in the shadow of the}} Albert Memorial also pointed to everybody, high and low, chipping in to the national struggle.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Decorative lace production has been highly mechanised since the 19 th century. Modern lace is manufactured on CNC Jacquard and Raschel looms, little technological development has occurred since the early 1980 's. Decorative lace is knitted in webs as much as 3. 8 m wide containing may smaller lace breadths. The lace breadths must {{be separated from the}} main web ready for garment manufacture. The separation process for decorative lace is traditionally carried out using scissors or a guided knife system. The development of a machine vision guided laser cutting system at Loughborough University in the 1990 's demonstrated that an economical fully automatic cutting system could replace the slow and expensive traditional methods. Marketing of the laser cutting system has identified some weaknesses in the quality of the cut-edge for some markets that require higher quality lace. The vision-guided laser cutting system utilises a continuous wave (CW) laser. Incorrect positioning of the laser causes melting to the lace edge which can be detected by a rough texture. A high accuracy pulsed laser-cutting solution for lace is demonstrated in this thesis. The lace is cut by applying a short pulse of laser energy directly onto individual threads that connect the lace breadth to the <b>waste</b> material. An <b>edge</b> directed algorithm that utilises a transmissive illumination method locates the position of the cutting point on the threads. The transmissive illumination method highlights lace density as well as position. The density information facilitates the accurate location of the lace-cutting path. A 3 D transient finite difference thermal model of the cutting process has been developed to aid in the optimisation of the laser process. Deficiencies in the existing CW process have been highlighted with the model. Optimum processing parameters have been calculated with the model for the pulsed process. Fully automatic, vision guided, pulsed laser cutting of lace has been demonstrated on a low speed system. The lace produced on the pulsed laser system has been shown to have a significant improvement in edge quality over lace produced using the CW process. The edge quality approaches that of traditionally cut lace...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the use of}} the life cycle analysis (LCA) system developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to assist two U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites in Ohio [...] the Ashtabula Environmental Management Project near Cleveland and the Fernald Environmental Management Project near Cincinnati [...] in assessing treatment and disposal options for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) -contaminated low-level radioactive waste (LLW) and mixed waste. We will examine, first, how the LCA process works, then look briefly at the LCA system's ''toolbox,'' and finally, see how the process was applied in analyzing the options available in Ohio. As DOE nuclear weapons facilities carry out planned decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) activities for site closure and progressively package waste streams, remove buildings, and clean up other structures that have served as temporary waste storage locations, it becomes paramount for each waste stream to have a prescribed and proven outlet for disposition. Some of the most problematic waste streams throughout the DOE complex are PCB low-level radioactive wastes (liquid and solid) and PCB low-level Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) liquid and solid wastes. Several DOE Ohio Field Office (OH) sites have PCB disposition needs that could {{have an impact on the}} critical path of the decommissioning work of these closure sites. The Ashtabula Environmental Management Project (AEMP), an OH closure site, has an urgent problem with disposition of soils contaminated by PCB and low-level <b>waste</b> at the <b>edge</b> of the site. The Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP), another OH closure site, has difficulties in timely disposition of its PCB-low-level sludges and its PCB low-level RCRA sludges in order to avoid impacting the critical path of its D&D activities. Evaluation of options for these waste streams is the subject of this report. In the past a few alternatives for disposition of PCB low-level waste and PCB low-level RCRA waste had seemed achievable, but these options did not materialize. Recently, however, new PCB waste treatment alternatives have appeared, and some regulatory requirements for treatment and disposal of PCBs have been relaxed. This LCA evaluation has been performed to assess new and existing PCB waste opportunities that are available for the treatment and disposal of wastes at AEMP and FEMP...|$|R
