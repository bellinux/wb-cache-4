25|$|I yield {{neither to}} Senator Borah nor {{to any other}} man in admiration of the Farewell Address and of the great Fathers of the Republic; but I would not use them as a cover for party politics. Never did I sneer at the Farewell Address; but I believe that the greatness of Washington was due to his looking the facts of his day in the face, and {{determining}} his conduct thereby, instead of by utterances, however wise of {{a hundred and fifty}} years before. I <b>will</b> <b>trust</b> the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.|$|E
500|$|In Re Finger, Goff J made a {{distinction}} between gifts to incorporated bodies and gifts to unincorporated bodies. When a gift is to an unincorporated body, it must be treated, whatever the wording, {{as a gift to}} that body's purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess things. If the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies on the other hand can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in Re Vernon's <b>Will</b> <b>Trust,</b> [...] "A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a gift to that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee." ...|$|E
500|$|The charity raises {{money from}} a number of sources. [...] Since 1999, it has been {{recognised}} in Wales as the equivalent of the Churches Conservation Trust (which only covers churches in England), and as a consequence receives full funding for taking Anglican churches into its care. [...] Of this, 70% comes from the State via Cadw, and 30% from the Church in Wales. [...] In England, grants are sometimes obtained from bodies such as English Heritage, {{as in the case of}} St Mary's Church, Mundon, but otherwise funds are raised by donations and local money-raising campaigns. [...] Some of the churches have been supported by the formation of local groups of Friends, such as Caldecote Church Friends, and the Friends of St Andrew's, Wood Walton. [...] Members of the public can make donations, become a member of the charity, or leave a legacy in their wills. [...] In addition the charity administers two trusts, one of which, the Cottam <b>Will</b> <b>Trust,</b> was established by RevS.E.Cottam for [...] "the advancement of religion of objects of beauty to be placed in ancient Gothic churches either in England or Wales".|$|E

500|$|Failures {{that lead}} to an {{application}} for cy-près are of two sorts; subsequent failure, where the trust, constituted properly, failed {{after a period of}} action, and initial failure, where the trust fails at creation. Subsequent failure cases are designed to have the charity's funds applied to more effective purposes, and as such money already donated to the charity cannot be returned to the next of kin of the original money; in Re Wright, it was said that [...] "once money has been effectually dedicated to charity... the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are for ever excluded". Schemes for initial failure, on the other hand, ask the court to decide whether the gifts should be returned to the testator's estate and next of kin or be applied to a new purpose under cy-près. When deciding if a gift has failed, there is a distinction made between gifts to unincorporated bodies and incorporated bodies, as laid down in Re Vernon's <b>Will</b> <b>Trust.</b> This is because gifts to an unincorporated body must be treated as gifts to that body's purpose, not to the body itself, since unincorporated bodies cannot hold property. As such, the gift does not revert to the next of kin because even if the body is dissolved, the gift's purpose is (presumably) still valid.|$|E
500|$|Dotty {{arrives in}} Walford on Christmas Day with Nick, {{to see her}} estranged {{grandmother}} Dot (June Brown). Nick introduces Dot to Dotty and they quickly bond. Nick lies to Dot that he had promised to send money to Sandy {{on the condition that}} she named their daughter Dorothy after her grandmother, so that Dot <b>will</b> <b>trust</b> him and bond with his daughter; Dot does not know Dotty's real name. After spending the night, Dotty begs Dot to let them stay longer. Dot soon discovers that Nick is unemployed and he and Dotty have been living rough. Nick says he will either put Dotty into care or sell her to Dot. After serious consideration, she buys Dotty to get her away from Nick. Dotty learns that Dot has left all her money to Dotty in her will, and tells Nick. They plan to kill Dot to inherit the money, and trick her into thinking she is suffering from dementia. Eventually, Dotty is told by Nick to give Dot an overdose of her medication, but, Dotty has {{had a change of heart}} and gives the pills to Nick in his beer. When Nick learns of Dotty's double-crossing, he drags her to the café and holds everyone inside hostage. [...] Dotty escapes along with most of the others, but the café explodes, and in the commotion, Nick escapes. Dot suspects Dotty may be just as evil as Nick, so plants some tablets on the kitchen table whilst Dotty has her back turned. Dot leaves the room and spies on Dotty, who ignores the tablets.|$|E

[...] However, even after a trip to the past to witness how her father and mother met, she finds that no one knows of her father's fate after Oran returned to Avalon with her two children and is left only with a rumour that he is possibly a prison in the Gwimun Mountains. [...] Towards the end of volume 16, Fanta returns to Avalon with her mother under the impression that Oran will allow her to meet Sindo; in truth, Oran attempting to keep her daughter from interfering with her plans. However, Fanta really does see her father, whose only care {{in life is to}} be free from his imprisonment.|$|E

The empty building that {{was to have been}} the clinic was leased by the group and $50,000 in federal grants was obtained, with the first patient taken in October 1981. By 1992, Soundview was offering medical and preventive care to 45,000 patients annually, and was also running a computer literacy program, serving lunch to hundreds of seniors daily and distributing surplus food. The New York Times noted that the health center featured Espada's name and image throughout the facility, describing it as having [...] "elements of a cult of personality", though Espada explained it as [...] "The community has to know you" [...] so that [...] "In the end, they <b>will</b> <b>trust</b> you".|$|E

Wanting to seduce Donna Elvira's maid, and believing that she <b>will</b> <b>trust</b> him better if he appears in lower-class clothes, Don Giovanni orders Leporello to exchange cloak and hat with him. Donna Elvira comes to her window (Trio: [...] "Ah taci, ingiusto core" [...] – [...] "Ah, be quiet unjust heart"). Seeing {{an opportunity for a}} game, Don Giovanni hides and sends Leporello out in the open wearing Don Giovanni's cloak and hat. From his hiding place Don Giovanni sings a promise of repentance, expressing a desire to return to her and threatening to kill himself if she does not take him back, while Leporello poses as Don Giovanni and tries to keep from laughing. Donna Elvira is convinced and descends to the street. Leporello, continuing to pose as Don Giovanni, leads her away to keep her occupied while Don Giovanni serenades her maid with his mandolin.
