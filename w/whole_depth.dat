5|$|Lactarius blennius has a {{flattened}} convex cap that is 4–10cm (1.6–4in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands, though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, {{and a very}} brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland. The cap is very slimy when moist and has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5cm (1.6–2in) tall by 1–1.7cm (0.4–0.7in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom. The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run a small way down the stem in attachment, or that they {{are attached to the}} stem by the <b>whole</b> <b>depth</b> of the gills. The milk is white and dries grey, and is very plentiful. L.blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7µm.|$|E

40|$|Novel single-molecule {{switching}} super-resolution microscopy overcomes the diffraction {{limit of}} far-field fluorescence microscopy by precisely localizing individual fluorescent molecules {{from thousands of}} images of stochastic, sparse blinking-molecule distributions. However, this technique has so far mostly been limited to thin, fixed samples: usually, fluorescent molecules are activated throughout the <b>whole</b> <b>depths</b> of the sample {{and not just in}} the 1 - 2 μm thick optical section where they can be localized. In thick samples, this incurs excessive background and unwanted bleaching of probe molecules out of focus. Using two-photon absorption allows to limit activation of photo-activatable fluorescent proteins to the optical section where they can be localized. However, no spectroscopic information about the two-photon activation of the most commonly used molecules has been available so far. Live-cell imaging is additionally hampered by the typically used EM-CCD cameras which can only record up to 60 full frames/second. Novel sCMOS cameras feature much higher readout speeds and have the potential for fast live-cell imaging, but artifact-free performance at high speed has not been demonstrated yet. In this thesis, I have realized a new super-resolution microscope capable of two-photon activation of photo-activatable probes. I have characterized PAmCherry 1, PA-GFP and PAmKate, three of the most popular photo-activatable fluorescent proteins, spectroscopically for two-photon activation. My results suggest a modified model of photo-activation of PAmCherry 1. Super-resolution images of ring canals in thick Drosophila egg chambers have been recorded in three dimensions using this new microscope. Furthermore, I present the first artifact-free super-resolution microscopy using a sCMOS camera. Microtubules could be imaged at 32 nm spatial resolution in only 33 ms. ...|$|R

60|$|So {{the mother}} and little Pearl were {{admitted}} into the hall of entrance. With many variations, suggested {{by the nature of}} his building materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of social life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land. Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extending through the <b>whole</b> <b>depth</b> of the house, and forming a medium of general communication, more or less directly, with all the other apartments. At one extremity, this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers, which formed a small recess {{on either side of the}} portal. At the other end, though partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall windows which we read of in old books, and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat. Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles of England, or other such substantial literature; even as, in our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre table, to be turned over by the casual guest. The furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a table in the same taste, the whole being of the Elizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor's paternal home. On the table--in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind--stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale.|$|E
60|$|At Aji Bipa the lode runs N. 38º E. (Mag.) in {{the centre}} shaft, and N. 40 E. in the {{southern}} shaft, a sort of fault occurring in the centre shaft. In the northern shaft I should put it at 38º, but from {{the way in which}} the neighbouring rock had cleaved it was difficult to get the strike accurately. The dip is the same in all three shafts, viz. 82º. The lode being so near vertical, it can be clearly traced for the <b>whole</b> <b>depth</b> of the shafts, and is very well defined. The hanging (eastern) wall is highly coloured with iron oxides, and contains many quartz crystals which are through-coloured with the same, and I do not think it at all unlikely that garnets and other gems may be found in it. One or two minute crystals showed a green colour, and might be tourmaline or emerald; but perhaps it was only a surface-colour caused by the presence of copper. The foot wall is very well marked by a strip of whitish yellow clay about an inch in thickness. The rock on both sides of the lode is gold-bearing, and is evidently, as well as the real lode, formed of the debris of old quartz and granites. Talcose flakes are frequent, and in some places it seems to be clearly gneiss. Although with a small plant it might not be profitable to treat this, still with large and suitable machinery it may be made to pay, and the trouble of separating the rich lode from the inferior stone avoided. One remarkable trait in the lode is the manner in which it splits into blocks and slabs, all the faces of the quartz pebbles being cloven in precisely the same plane.|$|E
