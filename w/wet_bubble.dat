In the present study, disease incidence, disease intensity and yield losses due to the pathogen were recorded in important mushroom units of Kashmir division, in order to check the frequency of prevalence of <b>wet</b> <b>bubble</b> disease. The survey revealed that <b>wet</b> <b>bubble</b> disease was prevalent in all mushroom growing districts in the range of 33. 0 to 67. 0 %. With the overall mean disease incidence of 9. 09 % over years in three districts, the disease incidence was more (10. 55 - 14. 25 %) in spring than in autumn season (3. 61 - 8. 05 %). Similarly, the overall disease intensity was 17. 82 % over the years in these districts with more (16. 86 - 28. 31 %) in spring than in autumn season (9. 81 - 15. 46 %). The% yield loss over the years due to the disease ranged from 13. 53 - 22. 41 % with maximum loss reported in district Pulwama and minimum in district Srinagar. With an overall yield loss of 16. 97 % over the years, the loss was highest (15. 88 - 26. 01 %) in spring than in autumn season (8. 63 - 14. 92 %).

40|$|In microfluidics, the {{formation}} of bubbles within devices obstructs flow and can damage the microfluidic chip or the samples contained therein. This thesis works toward a better understand of <b>bubble</b> <b>wetting</b> on surfaces, so that future microfluidics devices can be designed to be more robust and free of <b>bubbles.</b> Current <b>wetting</b> theory as applied to bubbles is examined, and two key areas for improvement are identified: disjoining pressure effects and gravitationaleffects. Wetting of textured surfaces is also analyzed for bubble application, leading to a prediction that a model based on a Cassie-Baxter analysis with knowledge of <b>bubble</b> <b>wetting</b> {{on a flat surface}} would be most accurate compared to other models. Dynamic and sessile bubble contact angles and droplet contact angles were measured on smooth acrylic, fluorosilanized silicon, glass, nylon, and silicon. These results were compared to the existing model, and the resulting error showed a strong correlation with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0. 863 to the magnitude of the bubble contact angle hysteresis. Because contact angle hysteresis can be related to the disjoining pressure, these results were a good indicator that disjoining pressure should be considered in developing improved <b>bubble</b> <b>wetting</b> models. Dynamic and sessile bubble contact angles and droplet contact angles were also measured on four silicon samples with different surface textures. These results were compared to three existing wetting models as applied to <b>bubble</b> <b>wetting,</b> and {{it was found that the}} Cassie-Baxter model based on the bubble contact angle on a smooth silicon surface was most accurate, with an average percentage error of 0. 8 %.

However, highly WBD-resistant strains are rare. Here, we tested 28 A. bisporus strains for WBD resistance by inoculating M. perniciosa spore suspension on casing soil, and assessed genetic diversity of these strains using 17 new simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed in this study. We found that 10 wild strains originating from the Tibetan Plateau in China were highly WBD-resistant strains, and 13 cultivated strains from six countries were highly susceptible strains. A total of 88 alleles were detected in these 28 strains, and the observed number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8. Cluster and genetic structure analysis results revealed the wild resources from China have a relatively high level of genetic diversity and occur at low level of gene flow and introgression with cultivated strains. Moreover, the wild strains from China potentially have the consensus ancestral genotypes different from the cultivated strains and evolved independently.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} cultivated basidiomycetes worldwide and in Serbia are button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sp.) and shiitake (Lentinus edodes). Production of their fruiting bodies is severely afflicted by fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens that {{are able to}} cause diseases which affect yield and quality. Major A. bisporus fungal pathogens include Mycogone perniciosa, Lecanicillium fungicola, and Cladobotryum spp., the causal agents of dry bubble, <b>wet</b> <b>bubble,</b> and cobweb disease, respectively. Various Trichoderma species, the causal agents of green mould, also affect all three kinds of edible mushrooms. Over the past two decades, green mould caused by T. aggressivum has been the most serious disease of button mushroom. Oyster mushroom is susceptible to T. pleurotum and shiitake to T. harzianum. The bacterial brawn blotch disease, caused by Pseudomonas tolaasii, is distributed globally. Disease control on mushroom farms worldwide is commonly based on the use of fungicides. However, evolution of pathogen resistance to fungicides after frequent application, and host sensitivity to fungicides are serious problems. Only a few fungicides are officially recommended in mushroom production: chlorothalonil and thiabendazol in North America and prochloraz in the EU and some other countries. Even though decreased sensitivity levels of L. fungicola and Cladobotryum mycophilum to prochloraz have been detected, disease control is still mainly provided by that chemical fungicide. Considering such resistance evolution, harmful impact to the environment and human health, special attention should be focused on biofungicides, both microbiological products based on Bacillus species and various natural substances of biological origin, together with good programs of hygiene.

40|$|We {{describe}} a hitherto unknown self-organising effect in <b>wet</b> crystalline <b>bubble</b> structures exposed to air. Due to the escape of {{gas from the}} bubbles in the top surface layer, bubbles shrink and create space for the bubbles of the lower layers to interpose themselves at the top. This occurs irregularly, but finally a newly ordered bidisperse top layer is formed. This process can be followed for several episodes of elimination of surface layers. The crystalline orientation influences the speed of shrinkage and formation of the bidisperse top layer. Compared with diffusion of a single bubble or monodisperse monolayer {{on top of a}} liquid pool, the diffusion is much faster. This may be accounted for by the extra buoyancy force leading to a larger exposure of the bubbles at the surface...|$|R

50|$|Although chipseal is an {{effective}} low-cost way to repair road, it has some drawbacks. Loose crushed stone is often left on the surface, owing to underapplication of bitumen or overapplication of stone.

Therefore, {{it is very important}} to sweep the road after the emulsion sets. As mentioned earlier, this problem can be minimized by using chips precoated with bitumen. Overapplication of emulsion can lead to bleeding, a condition where the excess asphalt rises to the surface, creating a very smooth surface that is very slippery when <b>wet</b> and <b>bubbling</b> in the hotter summer months.

40|$|Pool boiling {{in an aqueous}} {{surfactant}} {{solution is}} one of efficient approaches to increase pool boiling performance in nucleate boiling regime since additive polymer surfactants modify interfacial wetting properties between heating surface and fluids.

40|$|The {{operation}} of a piezo inkjet printhead involves a chain of processes in many physical domains at different length scales.

The next two steps are the coupling to the acoustic domain inside the ink channels, and the coupling to the fluid dynamic domain, i. e. the drop formation process.

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. Heat transfer enhancement at liquid-solid interfaces is often achieved by modifying the surface properties. However, deep efforts to describe the actual role of surface modification only started at the 1980 ’s and much work has left undone since then. The wettability is a key parameter governing heat, mass and momentum transport at liquid-solid interfaces. However it is usually quantified using macroscopic quantities, which cannot be related with the micro-and-nano-scale phenomena occurring at the interface. In this context, the present paper revises the potential and limitations of using macroscopic apparent contact angles to predict the wetting regimes. Then, these angles are used to relate the <b>wetting</b> regimes with <b>bubble</b> dynamics and heat transfer processes occurring at pool boiling. The {{results show that the}} macroscopic angles are useful to establish general trends and differentiate bubble dynamics behaviour occurring for opposite wetting regimes. However, milder wetting changes occurring within each regime, caused, for instance, by surface topography are not well captured by the apparent angle, as the surface topography is not scaled to affect this macroscopic angle, although it can clearly influence the bubble formation and departure mechanisms and, consequently the heat transfer coefficients. In line with this, the concept of the micro-scale contact angle, as introduced by Phan et al. [1] is used here together with a geometrical parameter to include the effect of surface topography, to describe the role of the wettability on bubble dynamics. Based on this analysis, a multi-scale approach is proposed to include the role of wettability on correlations predicting the pool boiling heat transfer coefficients. am 201...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{control is}} omnipresent in today’s life: from keeping your fridge cold, {{maintaining}} {{a room at}} a pleasant temperature or preventing your computer from overheating. Efficient ways of heat transfer are often based on phase change, making use of the high latent heat of evaporation. In the context of spray cooling, liquid drops are impacting a hot plate to ensure a rapid cooling. At some temperature however, no contact occurs between the liquid and the plate, and the heat transfer rate is strongly reduced. The origins of this so-called Leidenfrost phenomenon are investigated in this thesis from an experimental point. By investigating the <b>wetting</b> behaviour and <b>bubble</b> generation at the interface between a heated plate and a liquid drop, new light is shed on the onset of this undesirable phenomenon. Rather than a sudden change between contact boiling and Leidenfrost boiling, a new regime is found and described where the drop is only partially {{in contact with the}} wall. The lower temperature boundary of this new regime is found to correlate strongly with that of a deposited gently Leidenfrost drop. The upper temperature boundary depends strongly on the impact dynamics, forcing the drop onto the wall {{in the early stages of}} the impact process. The identification of the relevant time- and length scales give insight on how the both liquid and solid properties influence the onset of the Leidenfrost effect. Depending on the impact parameters and plate properties, a second touch-down mechanism is found in which the heat transfer towards the evaporative front is limited in the case of a poor thermal conducting plate. These findings allow for a better prediction of the heat transfer between drops and a heated plate, aiding the optimization of efficient cooling processes...|$|R
40|$|Gas-phase {{controlled}} mass-transfer for the system, hexane-nitrogen-dodecane {{has been}} studied. Three different contacting apparatuses were used: (1) a wetted wall column; (2) a bubble column; (3) a slug-flow absorber. The outlet gas streams from these apparatuses were analysed {{and the effect}} of gas-flow rate, liquid flow rate and contact time on overall mass-transfer efficiencies, ET, were investigated. For the wetted wall column mass-transfer efficiencies were found to be a function of column diameter and contact time. The results are found to be consistent with the data of previous investigators. Practically no end-effect mass-transfer took place. For the bubble column, ET, was found to be very high and end-effect mass-transfer predominated. The EE values fell between 0. 98 and 0. 99. ET was observed to be the function of gas flow rate and contact time. For the slug-flow absorber, mass-transfer efficiencies were again high and end-effect mass-transfer also predominated EE ranging from 0. 94 to 0. 98. ET was observed to be the function of liquid flow rate as well as gas flow rate, and contact time. Asymtopic values of E T less than 1. 0 were observed and are considered to be as the result of incomplete liquid mixing. The effect of liquid flow rate was further studies by varying the position of liquid loading, top or-bottom of the absorber. ET, values were slightly reduced when the liquid was introduced {{at the top of the}} column. The overall gas phase mass transfer coefficients were calculated for the rise period mass-transfer. Highest values were found with the bubble column, but are considered to be low in view of the high ET, values observed. Lowest values were found with the slug flow absorber and suggested that mass-transfer was inhibited when bubble movement is restricted.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of bubbles migrating in porous media {{is a critical}} factor in several soil remediation operations such as in situ air sparging, supersaturated water injection, bioslurping, trench aeration and up-flow operation of moving bed sand filters {{as well as in the}} oil and gas industry. Groundwater aquifers are constantly polluted by human activity and a common threat to fresh water is the contamination by non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL). In many NAPL removal technologies, gas bubbles carrying NAPL residuals move upwards through the water-saturated porous media and thus play an essential role in contaminant recovery. The mobilization of the residual oil blobs in oil reservoirs is another important application for rising bubbles in porous media. After an oil field is waterflooded, a significant fraction of oil, referred to as waterflood residual oil, remains trapped. A potential mechanism to recover this residual oil is the mobilization of oil by gas bubbles moving upwards in water-wet systems. The main focus of this work was to measure the velocity of bubbles of various lengths during their migration through a water-wet porous medium. Experiments were conducted in a saturated glass micromodel with different test liquids, air bubbles of varying lengths and different micromodel elevation angles. More than a hundred experimental runs were performed to measure the migration velocity of bubbles as a function of <b>wetting</b> fluid properties, <b>bubble</b> length, and micromodel inclination angle. The results showed a linear dependency of the average bubble velocity as a function of bubble length and the sine of inclination angle of the model. Comparisons were made using experimental data for air bubbles rising in kerosene, Soltrol 170 and dyed White Oil. The calculated permeability of the micromodel was obtained for different systems assuming the effective length for viscous dissipation is equal to the initial bubble length. It was found that the calculated permeability had an increasing trend with increasing bubble length. Laboratory visualization experiments were conducted for air bubbles in White Oil (viscosity of 12 cP) to visualize the periodic nature of the flow of rising bubbles in a pore network. The motion of the air bubbles in saturated micromodel was video-recorded by a digital camera, reviewed and analyzed using PowerDVD ™ 11 software. An image of a bubble migrating in the porous medium was obtained by capturing a still frame at a specific time and was analyzed to determine the bubble shape, the exact positions of the bubble front and bubble tail during motion and, thus, the dynamic length of the bubble. A deformation in the shape of the bubble tail end was observed for long bubbles. The dynamic bubble lengths were larger than the static bubble lengths and showed an increasing trend when increasing the angle of inclination. The dynamic bubble lengths were used to recalculate the bubble velocity and permeability. A linear correlation was found for the average bubble velocity as a function of dynamic bubble length. Numerical simulation was performed by modifying an existing MATLAB® simulation for the rise velocity of a gas bubble and the induced pressure field while it migrates though porous media. The results showed that the rise velocity of a gas bubble is affected by the grid size of the pore network in the direction perpendicular to the bubble migration. In reality, this effect is demonstrated by the presence of other bubbles near the rising bubble in porous media. The simulation results showed good agreement with experimental data for long bubbles with high velocities. More work is required to improve the accuracy of simulation results for relatively large bubbles...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 9928 This work {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} electrohydrodynamic forces on the two-phase flow patterns of HFE 7000 refrigerant under convective boiling conditions. A flow loop was constructed which featured two novel transparent heat exchanger designs which facilitated visualisation of the flow field under EHD and diabatic conditions. In both designs, a sapphire tube was employed which allowed heat transfer and optical access to the boiling refrigerant. A stainless steel rod within the sapphire tube formed a high voltage electrode, while {{a thin layer of}} Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), deposited on the tube exterior provided an optically transparent though electrically conductive transparent ground. High-speed video imaging was combined with thermal-hydraulic measurements to relate flow patterns with voltage. In Test Section A, the sapphire tube was surrounded by an acrylic channel through which heated water flowed, forming a transparent concentric heat exchanger. Heat transfer coefficients were calculated using thermocouples embedded in the sapphire tube wall and along the water side, and pressure drop was measured across the test section. A high speed camera recorded imagery along the test section length. In the first study, experiments were carried out at a refrigerant mass flux (G) of 100 kg/m 2 s, inlet qualities from 0 - 45 %, heat input (Q//) of 12. 4 kW/m 2 and EHD voltage levels between 0 to 8 kV at 60 Hz AC. It was found that at a constant heat flux of 12. 4 kW/m 2, EHD increased the heat transfer coefficients but with lower superheat temperatures. At 2 % inlet quality an EHD voltage of 8 kV altered the flow regime from a stratified flow with nucleate boiling to a complex mixed flow with oscillating bubbles and liquid jets, resulting in improved heat transfer. It was also found that as quality increased, EHD voltages precipitated a flow regime change from stratified to annular, resulting in improved heat transfer. In the second study of tests at a constant water inlet temperature, the flow regime was seen to fall into three types dependent on EHD voltage. A base case was performed at 0 kV and voltage was increased in 1 kV increments. The first regime was of a stratified wavy flow with nucleate boiling, interspersed with occasional slugs which wet the top of the tube. The evaporation of this layer at the top provided lower thermal resistance and high heat transfer. As voltage was increased to 1 and 2 kV, bubble size increased and oscillations became apparent. Heat transfer rose by about 13 % during this phase. As the voltage rose to between 3 to 6 kV, a new flow regime where occurred where liquid was extracted from the lower layer towards the electrode. Bubble diameter and oscillation increased further. At 6 kV the flow alternated between oscillatory entrained bubble flow and a flow of waves of cresting bubbles and liquid. These cresting events caused wetting of the top of the tube. EHD forces seemed to contribute to the upward movement and cresting of the large bubbles. This regime accounted for around 55 % of the total heat transfer enhancement. At 7 kV another change appeared where liquid jets were produced and the flow began to alternate between the oscillating bubble and thin film regimes. In-tube flow was highly mixed, featuring droplets both from liquid jets and from bursting of the elongated bubbles. The top wall was highly <b>wetted</b> by the <b>bubble</b> bursting and cresting and this regime contributed 37 % of the total heat transfer enhancement. Finally a third series of tests were conducted on Test Section B. This used an identical sapphire tube to Test Section A, but instead of water heating, the ITO coating on the tube exterior was thicker which permitted direct electrical heating. Thermocouples imbedded in the tube wall permitted local temperature measurements. On investigating the local heat transfer coefficients and flow patterns, it was found that EHD enhancement was higher at lower qualities and this was strongly linked to the higher liquid levels. EHD enhancement was also improved at higher qualities, but to a lesser level. The amount of liquid in proximity to the central electrode, and thus subject to higher EHD forces was central to high heat transfer enhancement. The magnitudes and profiles of the thermal measurements differed significantly from the water heated test section. This was mainly due to the upper temperature in the water heated section being limited, while the temperatures in the ohmically heated section had no such upper bound...|$|R
