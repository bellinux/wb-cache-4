25|$|Many low-grade lymphomas remain {{indolent}} {{for many}} years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In {{these forms of}} lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful lymphadenopathy. Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of single agent rituximab {{in the treatment of}} follicular lymphoma rather than the <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch and worry.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} the poorest {{performance}} of the season by the Longhorns, both offensively and defensively. On offense, Vince Young had only 162yards of offense, his lowest output of the season. The Associated Press remarked on the poor performance and said that Young, {{considered one of the}} nations best quarterbacks and a Heisman trophy candidate coming into the game, was [...] "not even the best quarterback on the field that day". The Daily Texan predicted that the game could hurt Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach Mack Brown as saying [...] "Looking at the numbers from what Reggie Bush did last week and Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> to see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|On Saturday 26 October, at {{his house}} in Hoxton, Monteagle {{received}} an anonymous letter that warned him {{to stay away from}} Parliament. [...] Uncertain of its meaning, he delivered it to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. [...] Cecil was already aware of certain stirrings, although he did not then know the exact nature of the plot or who exactly was involved. [...] Instead of informing the king immediately, he decided to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> what happened. [...] Catesby's reaction to news of the letter's existence was somewhat different; he and Wintour suspected Francis Tresham was its author and the two went to confront him. [...] Tresham managed to convince them of his innocence, all the while urging them to abandon the plot. [...] Percy reacted to the news by declaring that he was ready to [...] "abide the uttermost trial". [...] He may have visited the infant Prince Charles on 1 November, indicating perhaps that some rearrangement of the plan was being considered. [...] The deposition of a servant claimed that Percy visited the prince's lodgings and [...] "made many enquiries as to the way into his chamber", although the statement came too late for Percy to comment on it.|$|E

60|$|But with Yowler it is {{altogether}} different. Yowler hides beside one of Peter's favorite little paths, <b>and</b> {{there he}} <b>waits</b> patiently for unsuspecting Peter to come along. He <b>waits</b> <b>and</b> <b>watches</b> much as Black Pussy, {{who is a}} cousin of Yowler, <b>waits</b> <b>and</b> <b>watches</b> at a mousehole. Peter feels that it doesn't give him a chance, and everybody is entitled to at least a chance to live.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the boys}} went {{directly}} to the camp, and built a fire, after which nothing could be done save <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E

60|$|So the {{six weeks}} passed slowly away, <b>and</b> Olga <b>waited</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched,</b> with smiles on her lips, in mute terror.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yoong man," [...] {{said the}} miner, [...] "thou's got to mak' t' wife's {{medicine}} here, and now, and quick, while I <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> thee, or else happen thou might need some medicine thysel' before all is over." ...|$|E
60|$|Never again, ah surely never Shall we <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch,</b> where of old we stood, The low good-night of {{the hill}} and the river, The faint light fade, and the wan stars quiver, Twain grown one in the solitude.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{some five}} or ten minutes," [...] said the Showman, [...] "before I shall want a fresh Bear, and {{it looks to me}} as if prices would fall during that time. I think I'll <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the market." ...|$|E
60|$|They <b>waited</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> eagerly, <b>and</b> thus {{five minutes}} passed. Then from a {{distance}} they saw a light flash up.|$|R

60|$|Then {{the hunter}} {{went to his}} blind which, you know, was the hiding-place he had made of bushes and rushes, and behind this he sat down with his terrible gun to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> for Dusky the Black Duck and his flock.|$|E
60|$|She {{dared not}} tell him yet, {{for fear of}} a relapse. She could only <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch,</b> and nurse him tenderly. And all the time she knew he distrusted her--knew he thought her a hypocrite and a traitor. For Harry's sake she had to bear it.|$|E
60|$|Do {{not wait}} for life to be picturesque, but try and see life under picturesque {{conditions}}. These conditions you can create for yourself in your studio, for they are merely conditions of light. In nature, you must wait for them, watch for them, choose them; and, if you <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch,</b> come they will.|$|E
2500|$|Holland was {{overlooked}} for {{the tour}} of New Zealand and India. Cricket writer Phil Wilkins said that [...] "ignoring Holland for India seemed indecent with its excessively demanding conditions and the siege mentality which so often applies to the game with its consuming hours of <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>and</b> working." ...|$|R
60|$|But Blacky isn't {{like those}} people who are {{satisfied}} not to understand and to think other people and things queer. He does his best to understand.

5000|$|The name [...] "Souhegan" [...] {{comes from}} the {{language}} of the Native American Algonquins, meaning [...] "waiting <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> place". Tribal fishermen set weirs across the rapids, <b>and</b> then <b>waited</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> for fish, including salmon, alewives, sturgeon, and eels.|$|R
60|$|This {{of course}} was possible, since what wind there was blew from the {{direction}} of the fire, although I whose nose is fairly keen could smell nothing at all. So I determined to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> a while, and indicated my decision to Hans, who, considering our purpose accomplished, showed signs of wishing to retreat.|$|E
60|$|The maid {{who took}} it in (for my girl went to a private school) smiled, and said at once she knew who I meant. I left my cake, and strolled round the corner {{to the house of}} a friend, there to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> for the success of my joke, for the girls always went that way at recess.|$|E
60|$|And, {{the commonplace}} {{character}} {{of so much}} of our English painting seems to me {{due to the fact that}} so many of our young artists look merely at what we may call 'ready-made beauty,' whereas you exist as artists not to copy beauty but to create it in your art, to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> for it in nature.|$|E
6000|$|He paused; <b>waiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> her. She made no reply. A {{flash of}} the quick temper in him leaped {{up in his}} eyes. He {{repeated}} his last words in louder and sterner tones: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No one but the King of {{the gulls}} can change you, my Periwinkle," [...] said the merman, kindly. [...] "You must <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> for him patiently.

6000|$|But Nod in {{the heat}} of his glory cared nothing for what his old friend said to quench it.

6000|$|The guest was {{staggered}} this time--the dullest {{eye could}} see it. He fumbled with his hands; once or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come.

60|$|Kit was annoyed, but he <b>waited</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> {{the people}} as they passed. The shadow was not very dark and he thought the woman give him a curious glance. He knew her and {{imagined}} that she knew him. When the people went through a gate Janet laughed.|$|R
