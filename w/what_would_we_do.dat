5000|$|... "The {{story was}} driven by my passion for “healthily controversial” thrillers; looking towards {{exploring}} sometimes difficult and challenging issues - especially with moral dilemmas {{that none of us}} would want to face. When your own survival being at stake, it is the most primal instinct, and we wanted to explore <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>does</b> human beings to survive. This form of dilemma is so interesting on a number of different levels." [...] —Tim R. Lea, director of 54 Days, on the film. After receiving positive feedback for the short length version of 54 Days, the production team decided to remake the story, this time as a feature-length film. To finance the project, a crowdfunding campaign was launched on February 2014. The goal was set to $54,000 with a time limit of 54 days. The campaign was successful and raised $54,127.|$|R

The band cited, [...] "unforeseen personal matters", as the reason for the cancellations. At the time, the band denied rumours about a breakup, saying, [...] "We're not splitting. Not at all.

6000|$|Haney {{insisted on}} smoking a cigar in the lobby. Bertha took her mother away to talk over the {{tremendous}} decision {{which was about}} to be thrust upon them. [...] "We want a house," [...] said she, decisively, [...] "but not a palace like that. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with it? It scares me up a tree to think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] muttered Galleygo, as he {{descended the}} stairs; [...] "if I {{was to do}} as he says, now, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with the fleet?

6000|$|... "I swear, beloved! {{and thus}} I seal my oath!" [...] and {{she kissed me}} on the forehead. And I, too, kissed her; and we talked of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> when <b>we</b> were wed, and how we should {{overcome}} the Roman.|$|R
6000|$|April 2.--Spoke to-day the {{magnetic}} cutter {{in charge of}} the middle section of floating telegraph wires. I learn that when this species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay! So wags the world. Tempora mutantur--excuse me for quoting the Etruscan. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> without the Atalantic telegraph? (Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.) We lay to a few minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among other glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and Ayesher. Is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy by Humanity, the world was accustomed to regard War and Pestilence as calamities? Do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon mankind? Is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of interest our forefathers acted? Were they so blind as not to perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive advantage to the mass! ...|$|E

5000|$|Albrecht {{disagreed}} with Keller's majority opinion and stated: [...] "I don't {{understand how the}} court could say <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> It would be impossible.

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, writing: The movie generates {{the best kind of}} suspense, because it's not about what will happen to people - it's about what {{decisions}} they will reach. We have the same information they have. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> How far would we go to protect our happiness and reputation? How selfish would we be? Is our comfort worth more than another person's life? Allen does not evade this question, and his answer seems to be, yes, for some people, it would be.|$|E

Many make a rational choice. They move to close havens: thousands of Syrians shelter in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. But desperation and aspiration drive thousands to the cluster of safe and affluent European states that lie temptingly close, and who need skilled eager workers to secure {{the future of their}} economies and welfare regimes. Such a ‘push–pull’ scenario has driven human mobility throughout the ages. peer-reviewe...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Gordon. [...] "It's quite <b>what</b> one <b>would</b> expect. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> things differently. <b>We</b> heave our rails {{down and}} {{fill up the}} country with miners and farmers while you'd be {{worrying}} over your parliamentary bills.

5000|$|The United States {{had applied}} [...] "reverse engineering" [...] to the MiG, {{essentially}} saying [...] "if {{we had an}} aircraft with such capabilities, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with it?" [...] In the fighter-interceptor role, however, the US gives the pilot considerable flexibility in tactics, where the Soviets had a doctrine of tight ground control. For the U.S. doctrine, the aircraft was too inflexible for American fighter tactics, but made sense for the Soviets as an interceptor that could make one pass at a penetrating bomber, using an extremely powerful radar to burn through jamming for final targeting.|$|E
5000|$|His {{most recent}} play, written in 2013, was a {{theatrical}} adaption of his book, The Junket. In 2014 Albo performed The Junket Off Broadway at the Lynn Redgrave Theater. The New Yorker said of it, [...] "Like many good comic monologuists, Albo makes serious points that land like clouds in our consciousness as we giggle along, hoping that life doesn't trip him {{up too much}} - because <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> without Albo's self-proclaimed compulsion to express himself?" [...] The New York Times stated, [...] "Mr. Albo, a skillful performer and comedian {{as well as a}} keen journo-observer, has a way with words and line delivery. His likable persona balances the snark and the silliness, and it’s hard not to be sympathetic to his dilemma as 'the Silkwood of Swag.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, {{nearly five}} years after having {{launched}} Marvel Comics' flagship superhero title, Fantastic Four, creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break from the archetypal mold of supervillains of the time, and be instead a being of god-like stature and power. As Lee recalled in 1993, [...] Galactus was simply another {{in a long line}} of super-villains whom we loved creating. having dreamed up many powerful baddies, we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of a demi-god, but now <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with him. We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god would be beyond mere good and evil. What he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!" ...|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} {{information}} literacy theorists and practitioners have lauded information literacy {{as a major}} role for librarians, particularly for those working in academic environments. To be successful requires librarians to be leaders in {{the teaching and learning}} process, well versed in pedagogy and practice.
