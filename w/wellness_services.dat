40|$|Aims: Alongside the {{increasing}} prevalence of chronic health {{conditions such as}} cardiovascular disease and diabetes, {{has been an increase}} in interventions to reverse these ill-health trends. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the longitudinal impact of the Sheffield Hallam University Staff <b>Wellness</b> <b>Service</b> on health indicators over a five year period. Methods: The Sheffield Hallam Staff <b>Wellness</b> <b>Service</b> was advertised to university employees. Of 2561 employees who have attended the service, 427 respondents (male = 162, female = 265) aged 49. 86 ± 12. 26 years attended for five years (4 years follow up). Each year, participants were assessed on a range of health measures (i. e. cardio-respiratory fitness, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high density lipoproteins, lung function and percentage body fat). Participants also received lifestyle advice (based on motivational interviewing) as part of the intervention to either improve, or in some cases maintain, their current health behaviours (e. g. increased physical activity and diet change). Results: The <b>wellness</b> <b>service</b> improved staff health for those with an ‘at risk’ health profile from baseline. These improvements were maintained in subsequent follow-up assessments. Improvement from baseline to year 1 follow up was observed for all health indicators as was the maintenance of this improvement in years 2, 3 and 4. Conclusions: The service demonstrates that a university-based <b>wellness</b> <b>service</b> using a combination of motivational interviewing and health screening to elicit behaviour change (and subsequent improvements in health-related outcomes) was successful in improving the health of employees with an ‘at risk’ profile.

40|$|This article {{examined}} the antecedents {{of a positive}} <b>wellness</b> <b>service</b> experience by identifying factors leading to customers’ positive <b>wellness</b> <b>service</b> experience. This study proposes that servicescape has a positive relationship with the service experience, and that servicescape may strengthen the effects of emotion and trust. The research hypotheses were tested with data collected directly from customers of a spa located in the Midwestern United States. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to estimate how emotion, trust, and servicescape affect customers’ evaluations of spa experiences. An estimation was carried out on the interaction effects between servicescape, emotion and trust. The {{results indicate that the}} main effects of servicescape, emotion and trust, were significant, while the interaction effects did not prove to be significant. Trust has the biggest effect on customers’ wellness experience followed by emotion and servicescape. Prior research has not simultaneously addressed the role of servicescape, emotion and trust and their subsequent influence on customers’ emotional evaluation of service experience. This study therefore provides valuable insight to extend present understanding of the simultaneous role of these factors as effective predictors of the evaluation of service experience...|$|R
