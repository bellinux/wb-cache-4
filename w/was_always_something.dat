500|$|After Wiggins died, several {{well-known}} baseball figures {{commented on}} his death. Longtime Oriole Frank Robinson said, [...] "He {{was a very}} bright individual, and you could like the guy. But there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> there to back you off." [...] Former Padres player Garry Templeton said {{that he might have}} been Wiggins' closest friend, but he said {{that he did not know}} that Wiggins had been ill.|$|E
500|$|Lindsay Beyerstein - She started {{attending}} the Skeptic's Toolbox {{when she was}} 14; her father Barry Beyerstein strongly influenced her involvement in the skeptical movement. [...] "It's sorta funny, the skeptics' movement is now finally old enough, it's like Scientology, we have second gen!" [...] She recounts, [...] "I was always involved with my Dad in skeptical meetings... "We would have family newsletter-stuffing nights (for the BC Skeptics)." [...] instead of hiring babysitters her father would take Lindsay to his media interviews. [...] "Does Satanic music cause suicide? [...] Out-of-body experiences... it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> new and different." ...|$|E
500|$|Staffing {{schedules}} led to {{the band}} having a surplus of engineers at one point, and as a result, they split recording between Elsinore and the Edge's home studio to increase productivity. Engineer Robbie Adams said the approach raised morale and activity levels: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> different to listen to, always something exciting happening." [...] To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called [...] "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48tracks of audio by using a 24-track analogue recording, a DAT machine, and a synchroniser. The focus on capturing the band's material and encouraging the best performances meant that little {{attention was paid to}} combating audio spill. In issue 14 of U2's fan magazine Propaganda, Lanois said that he believed some of the in-progress songs would become worldwide hits, despite lyrics and vocal takes being unfinished.|$|E

500|$|The {{bridge of}} [...] "Lamb of God" [...] paraphrases {{the chorus of}} [...] "Across the Universe" [...] (from 1970's Let It Be), whose lyric [...] "Nothing's gonna change my world" [...] {{inspired}} the song. Manson elaborated that: [...] "Mark David Chapman came along and proved him very wrong. That <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> growing up that was very sad and tragic to me". The song uses the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to criticize the media's veneration of death, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. [...] "Burning Flag" [...] is a heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band Ministry. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: [...] "Valentine's Day", [...] "The Fall of Adam", [...] "King Kill 33°" [...] and [...] "Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)", as each song abruptly ends and is instantaneously followed by the intro of the proceeding track.|$|E
500|$|In {{her letters}} to her {{siblings}} in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease {{at the new}} restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg. She and her parents were searched by guards at the Ipatiev House and were warned they {{would be subject to}} further searches. A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. [...] "Oh, how complicated everything is now," [...] she wrote on May 2, 1918. [...] "We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it's all started again." [...] Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the Ipatiev House Guard. She showed them pictures from her photo albums and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she [...] "was a girl who loved to have fun." [...] Another of the guards recalled Maria's buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn't assume an air of grandeur. One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in [...] "severe and angry whispers," [...] apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg. Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, [...] "We're so bored! In Tobolsk there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> to do. I know! Try to guess the name of this dog!" [...] The teenage girls walked by the sentries, whispering and giggling in a manner that the guards considered flirtatious.|$|E
2500|$|The band flew to New York {{to record}} their debut eponymous album, Baby Animals, at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and Second City Studio, Long Island with ex-pat Australian Mike Chapman producing. DeMarchi said of the {{production}} process: [...] "It was great. Basically, Mike left us alone to {{make the kind of}} music we know how to make; and whenever he did have a suggestion, it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> that made the sound better. So what you hear is pure recording, the band as it really is." ...|$|E

2500|$|During Reznor and Ross' keynote {{session at}} the 2014 [...] "Billboard and Hollywood Reporter Film & TV Music Conference," [...] held on November 5, Reznor {{said that he is}} open to working with other filmmakers besides Fincher, the only {{director}} he had worked with as a composer up until that point: [...] "I'm open to any possibility ... Scoring for film kind of came up unexpectedly. It <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> I'd been interested in and it was really a great experience and I've learned a lot." [...] Reznor further explained that he cherishes his previous experiences with Fincher, as [...] "There's a pursuit and dedication to uncompromised excellence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Almost 40 years later, writer Peter Guralnick {{wrote that}} Presley found it [...] "good {{running around with}} Nick... there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> happening, and the hotel suite was like a private clubhouse where you needed to know the secret {{password}} {{to get in and}} he got to change the password every day." [...] Presley's girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was always talking about his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley's own mother even commented about Adams, [...] "He sure is a pushy little fellow".|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something.</b> I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In {{an attempt to}} overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.|$|E
