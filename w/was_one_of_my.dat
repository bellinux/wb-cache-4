Which of course, for these two guys, is the entire theme of the show for them. So I think we've done that really well". Actor John Noble added, [...] "Tolerance. Acceptance. I loved 'Johari Window'.

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger {{called it a}} [...] "balls to the wall, gut-busting, amazing Office episode", and called the fire opening scene [...] "not only the best Office pre-credits sequence ever, but an all-time sitcom classic". Sepinwall said [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He said the only drawback of the episode was the Mrs. Albert Hannaday subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars. TV Guide writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, [...] "This <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite episodes ever. It had me laughing the whole way through." [...] Abbas particularly praised the fire opening scene and the final scene in which Michael insults everybody, which he called [...] "a very satisfying ending to the roast saga". He called the Black/Leachman romance [...] "creepy and hilarious", but described the Jim and Pam romance subplot as the weak link of the episode.|$|E

Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite shows growing up, {{and as soon as}} I saw that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I {{have to do to get}} this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E

500|$|In {{the year}} before Duncan's arrival at Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, but then lost main scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft. In the 1993–94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was {{considering}} redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N'Diaye was ruled out due to NCAA rules violations and eventually transferred to Michigan. Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20–11 win-loss record. Duncan's style of play was simple but effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games. Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature. Despite focusing heavily on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best was quoted: [...] "Tim [...] <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> more intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest." [...] Duncan also established {{his reputation as a}} stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as [...] "Mr. Spock", the prototypical logical, detached character from Star Trek.|$|E
500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie!

Latvala stated that [...] "It's a super feeling, it's almost unbelievable. Henri (Toivonen) <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> idols and secretly I've always wanted to beat his record as the youngest winner." [...] Over 20 years after the 1980 RAC, Paul White (nicknamed [...] "Chalkie" [...] by Toivonen) commented that he still receives questions about the rally and Henri Toivonen. He noted that the Talbot team, run by Des O'Dell and 15 full-time personnel, was much smaller than other works teams and [...] "had to draft in 'mercenary' mechanics to help." [...] Toivonen's results led to another year in the Talbot squad. In the 1981 season, he was signed up for a larger WRC programme and had a new co-driver, Fred Gallagher, who would later partner Juha Kankkunen and Björn Waldegård in a Toyota Celica Twincam Turbo. Toivonen's rear-wheel drive Group 2 Sunbeam Lotus was now less competitive against the Group 4 cars and the all-wheel-drive Audi Quattro, but despite four retirements, the second places at Rally Portugal and Sanremo, as well as a fifth place at the Monte Carlo Rally, resulted in a seventh place overall in the drivers' world championship. Together with more consistent team mate Guy Fréquelin, he brought Talbot a surprise manufacturers' title. He also competed in the last round of the British Open Rally Championship, the Audi Sport International Rally, and won the event.|$|E

There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode."

Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces.

500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
