5|$|A {{new wave}} of Armenian {{immigrants}} moved in the late 1940s, including Soviet Armenian prisoners of war who <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way westward after being freed from Nazi camps. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 allowed people displaced during the World War II to immigrate to the US. From 1944 to 1952, 4,739 Armenians migrated to the US, many {{with the help of}} George Mardikian's American National Committee to Aid Homeless Armenians (ANCHA).|$|E
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Jack Grayburn led {{an attempt}} to secure the {{southern}} end of the bridge but was unsuccessful, and a later attempt using a flame thrower only succeeded in setting the freshly painted girders of the bridge alight.

5|$|The Mirabello group {{engaged the}} Austro-Hungarian cruisers at 07:00, but were heavily outgunned, and instead {{attempted}} to shadow the fleeing cruisers. At 07:45, Rear Admiral Acton's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and Balaton. After 20 minutes, the Italian destroyers {{were able to}} close {{the distance to the}} Austro-Hungarian ships; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship's boilers. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers were under the cover of the coastal batteries at Durazzo, and <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> good their escape.|$|E

5|$|The line closure that {{followed}} the initial service suspension saw most Virgin services terminate at Preston or Lancaster from the south, with buses to Carlisle and all stations along the route. The only exception was an early-morning and late-evening through service from Carlisle to London and return. This was diesel-hauled via Blackburn and Settle. There were also several non-stop trains from Preston to London Euston. Local services all terminated short but many <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their journeys as their destinations were off branches. The Caledonian Sleeper was diverted via the East Coast Main Line, along with freight services, although some were diesel-hauled via Blackburn and Settle.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead {{may have played a}} role in the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
5|$|French {{losses on}} Mercure, {{although}} unknown exactly, were severe, only three sailors surviving. Weasel, despite being engaged {{with three different}} French ships for a considerable time, had not one man killed or wounded during the entire engagement. Rivoli's scattered escorts were not pursued, British efforts being directed instead at bringing the shattered Rivoli back to port as a prize. As a result, the remaining French ships <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way to friendly ports unopposed. Rivoli was a new and well-built ship and, following immediate repairs at Port St. George, she and Victorious traveled together to Britain. There they were both repaired, Victorious returning to the fleet under Talbot for service against the United States Navy during the War of 1812, and Rivoli commissioned as HMS Rivoli for service in home waters.|$|E

5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next two days, the {{battalion}} withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went. In the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.|$|E
5|$|The 1971–72 {{season was}} even worse for the Sabres as they {{finished}} with the fewest wins in the league with 16. Crozier posted a 13–34–14 record and a 3.51 GAA. He faced 2,190 shots during the season. This remains as the franchise record for most shots faced by a goalie in a single season. The Sabres improved the next season and they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{the playoffs for the}} first time in franchise history. Playing 49 games, Crozier had his first winning record with the Sabres and he posted a much improved 2.76 GAA. In the first round, the Sabres were matched up against the Canadiens. Crozier played four games and won two, but his team was ultimately dispatched in six games.|$|E

5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it through the barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on {{the eastern side of the}} camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek bed that offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its request was also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 3 June, she {{launched}} nine B5Ns, escorted by six Zeros, to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only {{six of the}} B5Ns {{and all of the}} Zeros <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it through the bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil storage tanks and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from Ryūjō from the second strike was damaged by a Curtiss P-40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the Akutan Zero, remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E
5|$|Chicago's {{top four}} {{receiver}}s, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, Marquess Wilson and Kevin White, were not active {{for the game}} in Cincinnati. During the game, Perry, Clausen, cornerback Tracy Porter, wide receiver John Chiles and linebacker Jon Bostic also suffered injuries. Penalties were {{a concern for the}} Bears, who committed 12 for 117 yards; the offense also struggled on converting third downs, with only two of eleven successful. On defense, the Bears allowed the Bengals to score three unanswered touchdowns: in the first quarter with Andy Dalton's one-yard run, and in the second with AJ McCarron's touchdown pass to Marvin Jones and Jeremy Hill's one-yard run. It would not be until the final six seconds of the half that the Bears scored, with Gould's 34-yard field goal. The first-team offense left the game during the third quarter, with all but one drive having ended in a punt, and on four of those drives, the unit failed to record a first down. Halfway through the final quarter, the Bears <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the score 21–10 after Ify Umodu blocked Kevin Huber's punt and returned it for an eight-yard touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Freda's {{ambition}} {{to make a}} horror film derived from his desire to make films in the fantastique style, feeling that only the Americans and German expressionists <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such films in the past. Freda approached film producer Luigi Carpentieri {{with the idea of}} the film despite not having a treatment ready. Promising them that he would have something for them by the next day, he returned with a tape of his treatment that was complete with sound effects. Carpentieri phoned Goffredo Lombardo to convince him further. Freda followed up his tape with the promise that his script could pass the censors and could be filmed in 12 days. This convinced the producer who allowed Freda to create what became I Vampiri. I Vampiri was a low-budget production with Donati and Capentieri of Athena and Lombardo's Titanus investing 32 million lire each initially into the film. The initial budget was 97 million Italian lire which increased to 142 million for its post-production and release after the films format was switched to panoramic CinemaScope.|$|E
5|$|Sebree's final mission {{before his}} {{retirement}} saw him lead the Pacific Fleet {{on a tour}} of ports in east Asia. The fleet left San Francisco on September5, 1909, sailing west to the Philippines, with only brief stops en route. Speed testing was a major goal of {{the early part of the}} voyage and he and his fleet of eight ships broke speed records by sailing to Honolulu in just over four days. Six of the eight ships <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the voyage in that time; the Colorado and West Virginia had mechanical failures which prevented them from completing the voyage on time. On the Colorado, those failures led to the deaths of two crewmen due to a steam pipe explosion. From Hawaii, the fleet moved on to Manila where the ships performed target practices and exercises, as well as being cleaned and repainted, before resuming their primary mission by sailing to Yokohama, Japan. In Japan, the fleet dispersed and small groups of cruisers were dispatched to the ports of British-controlled Hong Kong, Wusong in China, and Kobe, Japan. Afterwards, the fleet returned home. Just before Sebree's retirement the Pacific Fleet was split into two: a smaller Pacific Fleet and an Asiatic Fleet commanded by Rear Admiral John Hubbard. On February19, 1910, Sebree officially retired and was replaced as head of the Pacific Fleet by Rear Admiral Giles B. Harber.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E
