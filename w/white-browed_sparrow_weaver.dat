40|$|Birds {{living in}} social groups {{establish}} dominance hierarchies, and {{taking up the}} dominant position influences behaviour and physiological parameters. In cooperatively breeding <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weavers</b> (Plocepasser mahali), the transition from subordinate helper to dominant breeder male induces {{the production of a}} new type of song. This song contains a large number of new syllables and differs in temporal pattern from duet songs produced by all other group members. Here we show that this change in social status of adult males affects the morphology of a behavioural control circuit, the song control system of songbirds that is composed of large neuron populations. The volume of the song control areas HVC and RA and their gene-expression levels depend on males' social status. Dominant males have several times larger testes than subordinates, which is not reflected in circulating androgen and oestrogen levels. Our findings suggest a remarkable differentiation of adult vertebrate brains in relation to changing social cues...|$|R

Contrary to previous work on captive animals, our findings suggest that PHA-induced immune- activation does not elicit oxidative stress. Compared with controls (n = 25 birds), PHA-injected birds (n = 27 birds) showed no evidence of a differential change in markers of oxidative damage or enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant protection 24 hours after challenge. We did, however, find that the activity of a key antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, SOD) prior to immune-activation predicted the scale of the resulting swelling: birds with stronger initial SOD activity subsequently produced smaller swellings. Our findings (i) suggest that wild birds can mount immune responses without suffering from systemic oxidative stress, and (ii) lend support to biomedical evidence that baseline oxidative status can impact the scale of immune responses; a possibility not yet recognised in ecological studies of immunity.

40|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} societies, where individuals (termed ‘helpers’) {{provide care}} to young {{which are not}} their own, group members can vary substantially in their contributions to cooperative activities. Individuals are expected to exhibit higher levels of cooperative investment if the benefit of performing that behaviour greatly outweighs the cost of performing that behaviour. This may be achieved by directing investment towards kin (thereby maximising indirect fitness benefits) and/or attaining large direct fitness benefits. In this thesis, I explore whether direct fitness benefits shape patterns of helping behaviour in the cooperatively breeding <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weaver</b> (Plocepasser mahali). White-browed sparrow weavers live in year round territorial groups with high reproductive skew, comprising a dominant pair and subordinates of both sexes. Although all group members contribute {{to a wide range}} of highly conspicuous cooperative activities, there is large inter-individual variation in investment. In chapter 2, I use simulated territorial intrusions to show that sexually-selected direct benefits shape the expression of sentinel behaviour. In chapter 4, I provide evidence that the direct benefits associated with either the pay-to-stay or social prestige hypotheses are unlikely to modulate patterns of provisioning in male white-browed sparrow weavers. Evidence of marked individual differences in contributions to offspring care in cooperative societies is also generating increased interest in the proximate causes of such variation. In chapter 5, I use within-individual measurements to demonstrate that variation in provisioning effort is not directly regulated by variation in circulating levels of prolactin (a pituitary hormone). The evidence does suggest, however, that provisioning behaviour may be induced by exceeding a threshold hormone level. Individual contributions to parental behaviours (as opposed to alloparental) may be shaped by constraints associated with life-history traits. In chapter 3, I show that parents in <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weaver</b> societies perform different provisioning rates yet employ similar food allocation tactics, and that these patterns are expected in tropical living bird species. Combined, these findings provide insights into the selection pressures that may shape individual contributions to cooperative activities...|$|E
40|$|Group {{living is}} a life history {{strategy}} employed by many organisms. This strategy {{is often difficult to}} study because the exact boundaries of a group can be unclear. Weaverbirds present an ideal model for the study of group living, because their colonies occupy a space with discrete boundaries: a single tree. We examined one aspect of group living. nest placement, in three Kenyan weaverbird species: the Black-capped Weaver (Pseudonigrita cabanisi), Grey-capped Weaver (P. arnaudi) and <b>White-browed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> <b>Weaver</b> (Ploceropasser mahali). We asked which environmental, biological, and/or abiotic factors influenced their nest arrangement and location in a given tree. We used machine learning to analyze measurements taken from 16 trees and 516 nests outside the breeding season at the Mpala Research Station in Laikipia Kenya, along with climate data for the area. We found that tree architecture, number of nests per tree, and nest-specific characteristics were the main variables driving nest placement. Our results suggest that different Kenyan weaverbird species have similar priorities driving the selection of where a nest is placed within a given tree. Our work illustrates the advantage of using machine learning techniques to investigate biological questions...|$|E
40|$|Circulating {{testosterone}} (T) {{is widely}} considered to {{play a key role}} in the production of sexual displays by male vertebrates. While numerous studies support a role for circulating T in promoting the production of song in male birds, this understanding is based primarily on evidence from seasonally breeding northern temperate species, leaving it unclear whether this mechanism generalizes to other regions of the world. Here we investigate whether variation in circulating levels of T can explain the marked within- and among-individual variation in male song performance observed in a subtropical population of the year-round territorial <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weaver</b> (Plocepasser mahali mahali). Our findings reveal that both circulating T and male song production peaked at a similar time point, halfway through the population-level breeding season. However, while dominant males were more likely to sing and sang for longer than subordinate males, within-group paired comparisons revealed no dominance-related differences in circulating T. Moreover, comparisons both among and within individual dominant males revealed that song duration, syllable rate and proportion of time spent singing were all unrelated to circulating T. Together, our findings suggest that natural variation in male song production, at least in this population of white-browed sparrow weavers, is achieved principally through mechanisms other than variation in circulating T concentration. More widely, our results are in line with the view that male song production is not exclusively regulated by gonadally synthesized steroids...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative stress has {{recently}} been highlighted as a potential physiological mechanism underpinning life-history trade-offs in animals. While the role of oxidative stress in mediating such trade-offs is receiving increasing attention, its importance in wild populations remains poorly understood. In this thesis, I use a wild population of cooperatively breeding <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weavers</b> (Plocepasser mahali) to investigate the role that oxidative stress plays in mediating the costs of reproduction and immune defence. Cooperative animal societies offer {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate the costs of reproduction, because dominants frequently monopolise breeding opportunities (exhibiting higher reproductive effort than subordinates), and subordinate cooperative contributions frequently lighten reproductive workloads. My findings reveal, first, that dominants’ reproductive monopolies do not arise because they exhibit superior oxidative balance, as no such rank-related differences in oxidative state exist prior to breeding (Chapter 2). However, the higher reproductive effort of dominant females may underpin their differential declines in antioxidant protection after the breeding season (Chapter 2). Second, experimental manipulation of reproductive effort reveals marked oxidative damage and body mass costs incurred during reproduction. However, these costs are entirely mitigated in large social groups, suggesting that the cooperative contributions of helpers may offset the costs of reproduction for all group members (Chapter 3). While this represents rare evidence of an oxidative stress cost of reproduction in the wild, longitudinal data suggests that these costs do not endure after the breeding season (Chapter 4), highlighting that circulating markers of oxidative balance are unlikely to mediate long-term costs of reproduction. Finally, an immune activation experiment reveals that, while mounting an immune response causes no net change in oxidative balance, the scale of the response can be adjusted according to baseline antioxidant protection in an oxidative-condition-dependent manner (Chapter 5). Together my results provide support for the role of oxidative stress in shaping life histories in the wild. Furthermore, evidence of rank-related disparities in oxidative balance and the avoidance of reproductive costs in large social groups may have important implications for our understanding of both the evolution of cooperative breeding and the patterns of health and ageing in societies.

40|$|Conspicuous {{displays}} {{are thought}} to have evolved as signals of individual quality, though precisely what they encode remains a focus of debate. While high quality signals may be produced by high quality individuals due to good genes or favourable early-life conditions, whether current immune state also impacts signalling performance remains poorly understood, particularly in social species. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that male song performance is impaired by immune system activation in the cooperatively breeding <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weaver</b> (Plocepasser mahali). We experimentally activated the immune system of free-living dominant males via subcutaneous injection of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and contrasted its effects with those of a control (phosphate buffered saline) injection. PHA-challenged males showed significant reductions in both the duration and the rate of their song performance, relative to controls, and this could not be readily attributed to effects of the challenge on body mass, as no such effects were detected. Furthermore, male song performance prior to immune-challenge predicted the scale of the inflammatory response to the challenge. Our findings suggest that song performance characteristics are impacted by current immune state. This link between current state and signal performance might therefore contribute to enforcing the honesty of signal performance characteristics. Impacts of current state on signaling may be of particular importance in social species, where subordinates may benefit froman ability to identify and subsequently challenge same-sex dominants in a weakened state...|$|E
40|$|Journal ArticleLife-history theory {{assumes that}} {{reproduction}} entails a cost, {{and research on}} cooperatively breeding societies suggests that the cooperative sharing of workloads can reduce this cost. However, the physiological mechanisms that underpin both the costs of reproduction {{and the benefits of}} cooperation remain poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that reproductive costs may arise in part from oxidative stress, as reproductive investment may elevate exposure to reactive oxygen species, compromising survival and future reproduction and accelerating senescence. However, experimental evidence of oxidative costs of reproduction in the wild remains scarce. Here, we use a clutch-removal experiment to investigate the oxidative costs of reproduction in a wild cooperatively breeding bird, the <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weaver,</b> Plocepasser mahali. Our results reveal costs of reproduction that are dependent on group size: relative to individuals in groups whose eggs were experimentally removed, individuals in groups that raised offspring experienced an associated cost (elevated oxidative damage and reduced body mass), but only if they were in small groups containing fewer or no helpers. Furthermore, during nestling provisioning, individuals that provisioned at higher rates showed greater within-individual declines in body mass and antioxidant protection. Our results provide rare experimental evidence that reproduction can negatively impact both oxidative status and body mass in the wild, and suggest that these costs can be mitigated in cooperative societies by the presence of additional helpers. These findings have implications for our understanding of the energetic and oxidative costs of reproduction, and the benefits of cooperation in animal societies...|$|E
40|$|It {{is thought}} that neural sex {{differences}} are functionally related to sex differences in the behaviour of vertebrates. A prominent example is the song control system of songbirds. Inter-specific comparisons {{have led to the}} hypothesis that sex differences in song nuclei size correlate with sex differences in song behaviour. However, only few species with similar song behaviour in both sexes have been investigated and not all data fit the hypothesis. We investigated the proposed structure – function relationship in a cooperatively breeding and duetting songbird, the <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weaver</b> (Plocepasser mahali). This species lives in groups of 2 – 10 individuals, with a dominant breeding pair and male and female subordinates. While all male and female group members sing duet and chorus song, a male, once it has reached the dominant position in the group, sings an additional type of song that comprises a distinct and large syllable repertoire. Here we show for both types of male – female comparisons a male-biased sex difference in neuroanatomy of areas of the song production pathway (HVC and RA) that does not correlate with the observed polymorphism in song behaviour. In contrast, in situ hybridisation of mRNA of selected genes expressed in the song nucleus HVC reveals a gene expression pattern that is either similar between sexes in female – subordinate male comparisons or female-biased in female – dominant male comparisons. Thus, the polymorphic gene expression pattern would fit the sex- and status-related song behaviour. However, this implies that once a male has become dominant it produces the duetting song with a different neural phenotype than subordinat...|$|E

Sex-biased {{dispersal}} {{is pervasive}} and has diverse evolutionary implications, but the fundamental drivers of dispersal sex biases remain unresolved. This {{is due in}} part to limited diversity within taxonomic groups in the direction of dispersal sex biases, which leaves hypothesis testing critically dependent upon identifying rare reversals of taxonomic norms. Here, we use a combination of observational and genetic data to demonstrate a rare reversal of the avian sex bias in dispersal in the cooperatively breeding <b>white-browed</b> <b>sparrow</b> <b>weaver</b> (Plocepasser mahali). Direct observations revealed that (i) natal philopatry was rare, with both sexes typically dispersing locally to breed, and (ii), unusually for birds, males bred at significantly greater distances from their natal group than females. Population genetic analyses confirmed these patterns, as (i) corrected Assignment index (AIc), FST tests and isolation-by-distance metrics were all indicative of longer dispersal distances among males than females, and (ii) spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated stronger within-group genetic structure among females than males. Examining the spatial scale of extra-group mating highlighted that the resulting 'sperm dispersal' could have acted in concert with individual dispersal to generate these genetic patterns, but gamete dispersal alone cannot account entirely for the sex differences in genetic structure observed. That leading hypotheses for the evolution of dispersal sex biases cannot readily account for these sex-reversed patterns of dispersal in white-browed sparrow weavers highlights the continued need for attention to alternative explanations for this enigmatic phenomenon. We highlight the potential importance of sex differences in the distances over which dispersal opportunities can be detected. BBSRCNER...|$|E
