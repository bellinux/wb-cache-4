5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E

5|$|Following his assassination, many {{associates}} of Elagabalus {{were killed or}} deposed, including his lover Hierocles. His religious edicts <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> and the stone of Elagabal {{was sent back to}} Emesa. Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate. The practice of damnatio memoriae—erasing from the public record a disgraced personage formerly of note—was systematically applied in his case.|$|E

5|$|From {{the first}} {{announcement}} {{to the actual}} launch of the product, Microsoft made some significant changes to the console. Initially the system was {{to be able to}} play a disc-based game without the disc after the initial install; however, this came with a requirement that the users would have to connect online once per day, as well as restrictions on used games. These policies <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E
5|$|In May 2000 the Whitbread Beer Company was {{acquired}} by the Belgian brewer Interbrew, which owned Stella Artois. At that time one in eight barrels of Boddingtons was exported to some 40 countries worldwide, including China, the United States, Taiwan and the West Indies. The Strangeways Brewery kegging facility closed in February 2003 {{with the loss of}} 50 jobs. In August 2003, amidst falling sales, Interbrew relaunched the cask product in the North West of England, with an increased strength. The relaunch was unsuccessful and the changes <b>were</b> <b>reversed.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, a highway {{numbered}} M-178 was designated between M-28 south of Munising to M-94 in town. In 1941, the routings of M-28 and M-94 <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> between Harvey and Munising, and M-28 supplanted the M-178 designation completely. Since then, M-28 has {{run along the}} lakeshore through Au Train. M-28 was extended along US2 to the state line at Ironwood, and {{the eastern end of}} M-28 through Brimley was moved to a new alignment ending at US2, in Dafter in 1942. The eastern end was moved along US2 back to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948, though the terminus was returned to Dafter in 1950.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{appointed}} Landis {{a federal}} judge in 1905. Landis received national attention in 1907 when he fined Standard Oil of Indiana more than $29million for violating federal laws forbidding rebates on railroad freight tariffs. Though Landis was reversed on appeal, he was seen as a judge determined to rein in big business. During and after World War I, Landis presided over several high-profile trials of draft resisters and others whom he saw as opposing the war effort. He imposed heavy sentences on those who were convicted; some of the convictions <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> on appeal, and other sentences were commuted.|$|E
5|$|Railroads {{and roads}} in the Sammamish River and Snoqualmie River valleys, where modern-day SR202 runs, were built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The early roads were {{incorporated}} into the Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s and became a state highway in 1925. SR202 was established in 1964 {{as part of a}} new state highway system, running from Woodinville to Monroe; SR522 was designated to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, continuing west to Seattle. By 1970, the designations <b>were</b> <b>reversed,</b> with SR202 moved to the Woodinville–North Bend highway, and SR522 moved to the Bothell–Monroe highway.|$|E

These results <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> {{in a similar}} poll in the first Naruto databook, in which Chidori was ranked first and Rasengan second. In a top ten list of jutsu compiled by IGN's Ramsey Isler, Rasengan was ranked first and Chidori second. Several pieces of merchandise have been released featuring Naruto characters performing jutsu, including action figures and clothing.|$|E
5|$|When Rovers were {{admitted}} to The Football League in 1920 they wore white shirts with blue shorts. These remained the team colours until 1930, when the colours <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> to blue shirts and white shorts for one season. The {{blue and white}} quarters were first worn in 1931, when they were introduced {{to try to make}} the players look larger and more intimidating. Rovers continued to wear the quarters for 31 years until they were replaced by blue pinstripes on a white background.|$|E
5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms <b>were</b> <b>reversed.</b> The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E

5|$|In 1759, peace {{negotiations}} at The Hague came to nothing. The series of Franco-Austrian losses <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> until, in 1762, the Empress Elizabeth of Russia died. Her successor Peter III greatly admired Frederick, {{and at once}} withdrew Russia's support from the French coalition. Prussia began a drive to expel the Austrians from Saxony, and the French from Hesse-Kassel. Though she was only partially successful as her own forces were exhausted, the conflict had essentially descended into a costly stalemate, with Maria Theresa no longer believing that she could retake Silesia. The peace treaties of Hubertusburg and Paris exacted harsh terms from France, as {{she was forced to}} relinquish most of her American colonies. For Austria, though, the result was the status quo ante bellum.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Laffoon {{moved to}} San Antonio, Texas, where {{he opened a}} law {{practice}} and managed a citrus fruit business near Galveston. Though he had intended {{this to be a}} permanent relocation, while on a visit to family a few months later, friends urged him to return to Kentucky, and he obliged after only three months in Texas. In 1921, he sought election to the bench of the Fourth District Circuit Court. In the primary, he defeated Trice Bennett, a candidate from Princeton, and went on to face Republican incumbent Carl Henderson of Marion. In the general election on November 8, 1921, Laffoon defeated Henderson, carrying every county in the district. In his first term, only 7 percent of his decisions <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was a record for the Fourth District at the time. He was re-elected for a second six-year term in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, the North Staffordshire Regiment {{consisted}} of two Regular and two Territorial battalions – the 1st and 2nd Regular and the 6th and 7th Territorials. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939, the regiment was expanded as it had been during the First World War. This expansion, however, was limited this time only to the addition of two more battalions – the 8th and 9th battalions, of which both were raised in 1940 but later converted to other roles. The roles of the two regular battalions <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> this time, with the 1st Battalion serving in India and Burma throughout the war, while the 2nd Battalion remained in Italy and North Africa.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia late in 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. The fixtures were meant to revive cricket following the war and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946. As a result, Hassett could not appear for Victoria during the 1945–46 season. The Services performed poorly; after playing consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state. Hassett’s team was saved by the clock against Queensland when the time ran out with the hosts four runs short of their target, but their fortunes <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> in the final match when Tasmania hung on with only one wicket in hand to salvage a draw.|$|E
5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> {{after his}} fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, {{as was the}} division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing and your children {{would not be able to}} get into the better schools.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been {{alternately}} neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing {{its status as a}} congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves <b>were</b> <b>reversed</b> under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.|$|E
