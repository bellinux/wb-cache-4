5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Helgoland was {{assigned}} to the I Division, I Battle Squadron. Helgoland was stationed off the heavily fortified island of Wangerooge on 9 August. Minefields and picket lines of cruisers, torpedo boats, and submarines were also emplaced there to defend Wilhelmshaven. Helgolands engines were kept running for the entirety of her deployment, so that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> respond at a moment's notice. Four days later, on 13 August, Helgoland returned to Wilhelmshaven to refuel. The following day, naval reservists began arriving to fill out the wartime complements for the German battleships.|$|E
5|$|Following his election, O'Malley's first {{personnel}} {{decision was}} {{to retain the}} director of the city's economic development agency. O'Malley had his transition team, and had them compile policy drafts by mid-December, so they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> compete for state funds when the Maryland State Legislature reconvened on January 12, 2000. He participated in the Newly Elected Mayors Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government in mid-November. By the beginning of December, he named five deputy mayors and filled most of his cabinet. He finalized his cabinet on December 7, during his last session as a city councillor. He was sworn in as mayor later that day at the War Memorial Plaza, near Baltimore City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Through June 12, Zito was 7–2 with a 3.10 ERA. After {{a strong}} {{start to the}} season, Zito regressed down the stretch, going 2–12 with a 4.97 ERA {{the rest of the}} way. He {{finished}} the season 9–14 with a 4.15 ERA, snapping a streak of nine straight seasons in which he had 10 or more wins. In a rotation featuring Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan Sánchez, and Madison Bumgarner, Zito was the odd man out for the playoffs. In fact, he was left completely off the Giants' 25-man active roster for the postseason. Zito worked out throughout the playoffs so that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> join the roster in case of an injury, but he was never needed and remained on the secondary squad. Nevertheless, he won his first World Series ring {{as a member of the}} full roster.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Panzer Army's {{offensive}} forced Stavka {{to recalculate}} its intentions for Operation Saturn, and on 13 December Stalin and Stavka authorized the redeployment of the 2nd Guards Army from the Don Front to the Stalingrad Front, where it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{be used against}} German forces on 15 December. This army had a strength of roughly 90,000 soldiers, organized into three guards rifle corps (the 1st, 13th and 2nd). Operation Saturn was redesigned into Operation Little Saturn, which limited {{the scope of the}} attack to breaking through the Italian 8th Army and then engaging Army Group Don in the rear. The offensive was also changed from a southward push to a drive in a southeastern direction, and the start date was pushed back to 16 December. In the meantime, the 4th Mechanized and 13th Tank Corps continued to counterattack against German forces {{in the vicinity of the}} Alksay River, trying to delay their advance in anticipation of the arrival of the 2nd Guards Army.|$|E
5|$|Including Bradley, the Capitals lost {{six players}} {{who played for}} them in the playoffs, as well as back-up goaltender Semyon Varlamov. To replace some of the {{departed}} players, Washington traded its 2011 first round draft pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for veteran winger Troy Brouwer, {{who was a member of}} the Blackhawks' Stanley Cup championship team in 2010. They then signed Joel Ward as a free agent, adding grit and the hopes that he could duplicate his 2011 playoff success. Ward scored seven goals and 13 points in 12 playoff games with the Nashville Predators, after scoring 10 goals and 29 points in 80 regular season games. In net, they added veteran Tomas Vokoun, who was considered to be one of the top goaltenders in the 2011 free agent class. He signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract, well below his believed market value, to have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup. After making these and other off-season moves, the Capitals were over the NHL salary cap. The expectation was that defenseman Tom Poti would not be able to play due to injury and Washington would be forced to place him on long-term injured reserve, where his $2.9 million salary would not count against the cap total. Unexpectedly, Poti told the Capitals that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> play by training camp. Poti, however, failed his medical exam prior to training camp and was placed on long-term injured reserve.|$|E

25|$|Rob Andrew {{stated in}} July, {{pre-season}} to the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership, that Wilkinson <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> challenge for an England position come the November internationals. Captaincy of the Falcons was also given to former Wallabies fullback Matthew Burke, {{a move that}} Andrew believed would allow Wilkinson to concentrate more on his game and a full return to rugby. In early August head coach of England, Andy Robinson announced the Elite Player Squad for the 2006–07 season, in which Wilkinson was included.|$|E
25|$|In February 1945 at the Yalta Conference, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin {{agreed to}} enter the war against Japan within three months' of Germany's defeat. In order to meet this deadline, it was {{necessary}} that the Soviet Union and Western allies cooperate in stockpiling supplies in the Far East while the Red Army dispatched additional forces along the Trans-Siberian Railway. While the Japanese monitored this buildup, {{they did not believe}} the Soviets <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> attack until mid-September, resulting in their being taken by surprise when the attack actually began on August 8.|$|E
25|$|The {{intention}} {{was for the}} 4th New Zealand Brigade and 5th New Zealand Brigade (on 4th Brigade's right) to attack north-west to seize {{the western part of}} the ridge and on their right the Indian 5th Infantry Brigade to capture the eastern part of the ridge in a night attack. Then 2nd Armoured Brigade would pass through the centre of the infantry objectives to exploit toward Deir el Shein and the Miteirya Ridge. On the left, the 22nd Armoured Brigade <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> move forward to protect the infantry as they consolidated on the ridge.|$|E

In Church's latest interview, she mentioned she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> work on more music in a few months, although she was not sure whether she would further develop her career in classical, pop, or both, as she loves both genres for different reasons. Church also mentioned {{that she has been}} working with a vocal instructor to keep her voice in check, and while she has never put a focus on her body image, she would like to get back into pre-pregnancy shape before resuming work.|$|E
25|$|The Allied plans also {{expected}} that Tarakan would {{be transformed into}} a major base within days of the landing. Under the pre-invasion planning it was intended that a wing of fighter aircraft would be based at Tarakan six days after the landing and this force would be expanded to include an attack wing nine days later and staging facilities for a further four squadrons of aircraft within 21 days of the landing. It was {{also expected}} that the 26th Brigade Group and its supporting beach group <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave Tarakan by 21 May and the RAAF units could be redeployed in mid-June after providing support for the landing at Balikpapan.|$|E
25|$|During his career, Houston {{was known}} for his three-point {{shooting}} prowess. Despite the on-court accolades, though, Houston's lasting legacy may be something that happened off the court: In 2001, Houston signed a six-year, $100.4 million contract extension with the Knicks. Houston's yearly salary of over $20 million made him virtually untradeable, and his injury problems would burden the Knicks. Houston missed 32 games in 2003-04 due to a knee injury, and despite claims in the summer of 2004 that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> play the next season (he even refused to have surgery on his knee that summer), he played in only 20 games that season because his injury had not completely healed. Knee injuries would eventually force Houston to announce his retirement on October 17, 2005.|$|E

60|$|The motives {{whereby the}} nobility was swayed to proceed after this manner, were obvious enough.

25|$|The {{soldiers}} of the Sikkim Scouts are trained in the tactics of mountain warfare. As {{the members of the}} regiment are mostly locals, they are expected to be fairly familiar with the skills needed to operate and survive in the mountainous terrain of Sikkim, prior to their enlistment. Their training serves to instruct them in modern methods of warfare and instill military discipline. In an additional advantage to the Indian Army, they are able to obtain information from locals more easily, as they belong to the same culture and speak the same language. Indian Army commanders have expressed the sentiment that in the event of war, members of the Sikkim Scouts and other local regiments from the border <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fight to the end for their home state.|$|E
25|$|The Bug River was crossed by the Soviets (1st Belorussian Front) on 19 July 1944 {{and their}} {{commander}} Konstantin Rokossovsky headed for Warsaw, {{together with the}} allied Polish forces. As they approached the Polish capital, German panzer divisions counterattacked, while the Poles commenced the Warsaw Uprising. After the German attack was brought under control, Rokossovsky informed Stalin on 8 August that his forces <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> engage in an offensive against the Germans in Warsaw around 25 August, but received no reply. The Soviets secured their Vistula bridgeheads, and, with the First Polish Army, established control over the Praga east-bank districts of Warsaw. The situation on the ground, combined with political and strategic considerations, resulted in the Soviet decision to pause at the Vistula {{for the remainder of}} 1944.|$|E
25|$|The War Office promised General Edmund Allenby, Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), {{substantial}} reinforcements {{after his}} successful capture of Jerusalem. The Imperial War Cabinet was keen {{to know when}} Allenby <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make further advances; they wished operations against the Ottomans to continue as forcefully as possible within the means at Allenby's disposal and they attached importance to the cutting the Hejaz Railway. The French, however, imposed an important qualification to Joint Note 12 which gave qualified approval for a decisive offensive against the Ottoman armies; no British troops in France could be deployed to the EEF. It was therefore decided to reinforce the EEF with one or possibly two British Indian Army cavalry divisions from France and three divisions from the Mesopotamian campaign, which were to be supported by more artillery and aircraft.|$|E

25|$|By July 2009, {{work was}} being done on carving the headstones. A supply of the {{traditional}} Portland Stone (Broadcroft Whitbed) was reserved, and blank headstones shaped and shipped to France. Carving of the headstones was done using the Commission's computer-controlled Incisograph system. Also that month, planning and cultivation had started for the plants {{to be used in}} the new cemetery. Many months would be needed to develop and prune the plants in pots so they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> transplant in the Spring of 2010, in preparation for the opening ceremony that July. The limited time between the planned reburials in February 2010, and the opening of the cemetery, meant that the grassed areas would need to be turfed, instead of growing the grass from seeds. The roses used are the 'Remembrance' cultivar, one often used in Commission cemeteries.|$|E
25|$|The words {{found in}} a book of his {{signifying}} that though the catholic religion did now serve, swear and obey, yet if occasion were offered they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> help the execution, , were annexed to a text taken out of a general council of Lateran for {{the authority of the}} pope in his excommunication, and at the last council of Trent there was a consent of the catholic princes for a reformation of such realms and persons as had gone from the authority of the bishop of Rome, when it was concluded that if any catholic prince took in hand to invade any realm to reform the same to the authority of the see of Rome, that then the catholics in that realm should be ready to assist and help them. And this was the meaning of the execution as he saith, which he never revealed to any man before.|$|E
25|$|Although Joffre {{was aware}} (18 August) {{that as many}} as fifteen German corps were moving through Belgium (in fact it was sixteen, and twenty-eight if the German Fourth and Fifth Armies in the centre are also included), he {{believed}} that only a few of these would come west of the Meuse, where he believed they could be held by the British and Belgians. French Third and Fourth Armies, on Lanrezac's right, were preparing to attack into the Ardennes in accordance with Plan XVII, and Joffre wanted Lanrezac’s Fifth Army to attack the bulk of the German right wing on its west flank as—it was assumed—it attacked the left flank of French Fourth Army. Lanrezac, forbidden to retreat by Joffre, reported that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> attack by 20 August. Lanrezac began to move north on 19 August, leaving a gap between his army and Fourth Army on his right.|$|E
