5|$|An {{excavation}} led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 {{identified the}} site as a chambered long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have {{been defined as}} having long earthen mounds <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> internal structures, whereas chambered tombs, while also being covered by a long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> internal structures {{have been identified in}} southeast Wales, perhaps because long barrows were usually built where there was no suitable stone.|$|E
5|$|The counterfort {{with the}} {{staircase}} was roofed <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> boards and tin sheets in 1869. A telegraph installation and rescue stations were established near the lighthouse {{in the same}} year; the first-established worked until 1898 when it {{was replaced by a}} telephone.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} Buddhist metal {{implements}} and objects have been designated as 19 National Treasures. These include five decorated bronze or copper gongs, struck <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> sticks during Buddhist rituals, {{a set of}} flower baskets (keko) used in the Buddhist flower-scattering ritual, six pagoda shaped reliquaries, an incense burner, a sutra container, a bowl for offerings, a banner for ceremonial use, the finial of a pilgrim's staff and two sets of implements used in Esoteric Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E

5|$|Cracker Barrel's menu {{is based}} on {{traditional}} Southern cuisine, with appearance and decor designed to resemble an old-fashioned general store. Each restaurant features a front porch lined <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> rocking chairs, a stone fireplace, and decorative artifacts from the local area. Cracker Barrel {{is known for its}} partnerships with country music performers. It has received attention for its charitable activities, such as its assistance of victims of Hurricane Katrina and injured war veterans.|$|E
5|$|Maya stelae were {{worked with}} stone chisels and {{probably}} <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> mallets. Hammerstones were fashioned from flint and basalt and {{were used for}} shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels. Originally most were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments. At Copán and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.|$|E
5|$|Murals, mostly {{replaced}} by monochromatic tin sheets, were also {{present on the}} church's ceilings. Though most ceiling paintings were unpreserved, an original work of Max Aya-ay in 1957 can still be seen on portions of the crossing. The walls were originally adorned <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> images of Stations of the Cross commissioned by Father Ubeda in 1859 which were later {{replaced by}} European-made images.|$|E

5|$|Somerset is a {{historic}} county in the south west of England. There is evidence of human occupation since prehistoric times with hand axes and flint points from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras, {{and a range of}} burial mounds, hill forts and other artefacts dating from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. The oldest dated human road work in Great Britain is the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> planks in the 39th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests {{that much of the}} earth was quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> shovels, and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days of effort to build.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — are covered <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> structures. The similar technique {{has been applied}} in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover. Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Hyderabadi haleem {{is cooked}} {{on a low}} flame of {{firewood}} for up to 12 hours in a bhatti (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). One or two people are required to stir it continuously <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E

5|$|Every full moon, tens of {{thousands}} of pilgrims worship Annamalaiyar by circumambulating the Arunachala hill barefoot. The circumambulation covers a distance of , and is referred as Girivalam. According to Hindu legend, the walk removes sins, fulfils desires and helps achieve freedom from the cycle of birth and rebirth. Offerings are made in a string of tanks, shrines, pillared meditation halls, springs and caves around the hill. The circumambulation continues {{during the rest of the}} month. On the day of yearly Chitra Pournami, the full moon of the Tamil calendar, hundreds {{of thousands}} of pilgrims come from across the world to worship Annamalaiyar. Five temple cars, called ther, <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> carvings, are used for the procession.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> or stone enclosures, {{built on}} higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first {{studied in the}} eighteenth century and the first serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
