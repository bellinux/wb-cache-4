40|$|A post-earnings {{announcement}} drift {{associated with}} the market reaction to analyst forecasts errors remains a puzzle. This study suggests that <b>whispers</b> help to explain part of the puzzle. The study examines the market reaction to <b>whispers</b> and analysts in bull and bear markets, and finds that investors listen to <b>whispers</b> in the bull market and <b>whispers</b> help explain the post-announcement drift. In a bear market, reaction to <b>whispers</b> is significantly positive prior to announcement despite a down market, indicating optimism by investors who follow <b>whispers.</b> However, in the bear market, both <b>whispers</b> and analysts contribute to the post-announcement drift. 1...|$|R

5|$|Inspired by {{personal}} crises and global events, We Don't Need to <b>Whisper</b> was conceptualized as DeLonge taught himself to play instruments and created {{his own home}} studio. He recruited his longtime friend and guitarist David Kennedy of Box Car Racer, as well as drummer Atom Willard and bassist Ryan Sinn to form Angels & Airwaves, who were primarily inspired by arena rock groups such as U2 and The Police.

40|$|The main cue to interrogativity in Dutch {{declarative}} {{questions is}} found in the final boundary tone. When <b>whispering,</b> a speaker does not produce the most important acoustic information conveying this: the fundamental frequency. In this paper listeners are shown to perceive the difference between <b>whispered</b> declarative questions and statements, though less clearly than in phonated speech. Moreover, possible acoustic correlates conveying <b>whispered</b> question intonation were investigated. The results show that the second formant may convey pitch in <b>whispered</b> speech, and also that first formant and intensity differences exist between high and low boundary tones in both phonated and <b>whispered</b> speech.

40|$|<b>Whispered</b> {{speech is}} a {{relatively}} common form of communications, used pri-marily to selectively exclude or include potential listeners from hearing a spo-ken message. Despite the everyday nature of <b>whispering,</b> and its undoubted usefulness in vocal communications, <b>whispers</b> have received relatively little research effort to date, apart from some studies analysing the main <b>whispered</b> vowels and some quite general estimations of <b>whispered</b> speech characteris-tics. In particular, a classic vowel space determination has been lacking for <b>whispers.</b> For voiced speech, this type of information has played an im-portant {{role in the development}} and testing of recognition and processing theories over the past few decades, and can be expected to be equally useful for whisper-mode communications and recognition systems. This paper aims to redress the shortfall by presenting a vowel formant space for <b>whispered</b> speech, and comparing the results with corresponding phonated samples. In addition, since the study was conducted using speakers from Birmingham, the analysis extends to discuss the effect of the common British West Midlands (WM) accent in comparison with Standard English (RP). Thus, the paper presents the analysis of formant data showing dif-ferences between normal and <b>whispered</b> speech while also considering an accentual effect on <b>whispered</b> speech.

Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E

5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft <b>whisper</b> of a single plea for inaction.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly beat down Hardy and {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried {{to come back with}} a mule kick from the corner, but MVP moved out of the way, leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the <b>Whisper</b> in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E

40|$|<b>Whispered</b> speech, as a {{relatively}} common form of communications, has received little research effort {{in spite of its}} usefulness in everyday vocal communications. Apart from a few notable studies analysing the main <b>whispered</b> vowels and some quite general estimations of <b>whispered</b> speech characteristics, a classic vowel space determination has been lacking for <b>whispers.</b> Aligning with our previous published work which aimed to redress this shortfall by presenting a vowel formant space for <b>whispered</b> speech, this paper studies Singapore English (SgE) from this respect. Furthermore, by comparing the shift amounts between normal and <b>whispered</b> vowel formants in two different English accents (British West Midlands and SgE), the study also considers the question of generalisation of shift amount and direction for two dissimilar accent groupings. It is further suggested that the shift amounts for each vowel are almost consistent for F 2 while these vary for F 1, making it difficult to propose a general correlation between normal and <b>whispered</b> vowels. This paper presents the results of the formant analysis, in terms of acoustic vowel space mappings, showing differences between normal and <b>whispered</b> speech for SgE, and compares this to results obtained from the analysis of more standard English...|$|R
5|$|Three {{types of}} song have been described: the day song {{is the most}} common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an antiphonal duet, {{generally}} {{over the course of}} the day and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. The <b>whisper</b> song is sung more commonly in wet or windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree warbling soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the breeding song at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and more complex than the day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may chatter or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to <b>whisper</b> and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly <b>whisper.</b> James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E
