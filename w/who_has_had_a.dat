5|$|Members of {{the current}} and {{previous}} Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the five most-nominated writers, with additional nominees possible {{in the case of}} ties. Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Writers become eligible once they have a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a nominal amount. While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined as someone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> least one unprovoked seizure {{in the last five}} years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E

However, arguably at least, Aristotle's concept of the unmoved mover owed much to Plato's Idea of the Good.|$|E

40|$|AIM: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine skin temperature changes on the unaffected and affected sides as well as changes in perceived temperature and comfort during <b>a</b> footbath in patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stroke with consequent sensory impairment. METHODS: The study used a quasi-experimental design in which the results of intervention for patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stroke and healthy adults were compared. The subjects were 20 patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stroke with consequent sensory impairment and 20 healthy adults. RESULTS: Before the footbath, the skin temperature of the dorsum of the foot on the affected side of the patient <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stroke was lower than that of the foot on the unaffected side. Five minutes after the start of the footbath, however, the relationship reversed, with the skin temperature on the affected side increasing in parallel with the water temperature. After the footbath, the dorsum skin temperature on the affected side was again lower than that on the unaffected side. In healthy adults, a difference was found in dorsum skin temperature between the left and right feet. In contrast with patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stroke, no reversal of the sides was found with the lower and higher temperature. CONCLUSION: Unlike in the healthy adults, the skin temperature of the patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stroke with consequent sensory impairment was susceptible to changes in the external environment. However, no significant changes in the physiological indices were seen, while perceived temperature and comfort remained at high levels after the footbath...|$|R

25|$|The {{classical}} {{caesarean section}} involves a midline incision on the uterus longitudinal incision which allows a larger space {{to deliver the}} baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the lower segment of the uterus is unformed as it is safer in this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. Any woman <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision {{is much more likely}} to rupture in labour than the transverse incision.|$|E

25|$|The {{same rules}} in {{principle}} {{apply to the}} matrilineal descendants of such persons, though some rabbinical authorities may require stricter proof of Jewish descent than others. Whether such persons are required to undergo a full formal conversion depends on the community and their individual circumstances. For example, a male <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> brit milah, who has a general understanding of Judaism, but who has been raised in a secular home might {{not be required to}} undergo ritual conversion. However, a male who has not had a brit milah, a male or female who has converted to or been brought up in another religion, or an individual raised in a completely secular home without any Jewish education, in most communities, may be required to undergo a full ritual conversion. For full participation in the community (for example, to marry with the participation of a rabbi), they may be required to display sincerity, such as a declaration of commitment to Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Phil reacts badly when {{he discovers}} Ben (now Joshua Pascoe) is gay, {{and makes it}} clear that he prefers Billy's (Perry Fenwick) foster son, Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). Jay likes {{spending}} time with Phil and changes his surname to Mitchell, becoming Phil's surrogate son. Ben secretly enacts revenge on Phil for this rejection, terrorising him with letters, implying he has evidence to incriminate Phil for past misdemeanours. Among other deeds, Ben sends Denise Fox (Diane Parish) evidence that Phil supplied the cut and shut car responsible for her husband, Kevin Wicks's (Phil Daniels), death in 2008. Denise's attempts to get Phil imprisoned fail; however, DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton), <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vendetta against Phil for many years, investigates the allegations and Ben tells her that Phil forced Stella to jump from the roof in 2007. Phil is held on remand in prison on suspicion of Stella's murder and Ben delights in the distress he causes his father. Ian, however, is horrified by Ben's behaviour, and tells the police that Ben is lying; however, Ben thinks Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Shirley's best friend, is responsible. Fearful and angry, Ben retaliates by murdering Heather just as Phil returns to confront him. Blaming himself for Ben's actions, Phil makes the murder look like a burglary, spurns a grieving Shirley, allows his neighbours and family to become murder suspects, and bullies Ian into keeping quiet after Ben confesses to him.|$|E

It's not like the old days when I was doing 25 sessions a week. All the studios are gone. The budgets are gone. The record companies are all gone." [...] His own output as a session musician has slowed along with the rest of the industry—as of 2009, Lukather stated he was only doing a few sessions a year.|$|E

Ross, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> crush on Rachel since {{the two of them}} were in high school, constantly attempts to tell her how he feels about her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, such as the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. Joey is shown to be a bachelor and struggling actor, while Phoebe works as a masseuse and portrays a sort of [...] "crazy" [...] attribute to her personality based on her troubles as a child after her mother committed suicide. However the rest of the group loves her regardless. Chandler breaks up with girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler), who frequently returns in later seasons. At the end of the season, Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who realizes that she feels the same way. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross’ arrival from a trip.|$|E

A caption wishes the viewers a happy April Fools' Day. The drama itself opens in a courtroom in Canada, with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip's sworn nemesis, Scott, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long hatred of the duo's toilet humour, is acting as the prosecutor. Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits to prove Terrance's guilt, while Terrance's defense consists of nothing but a long string of fart jokes. Ultimately, the jury returns a verdict of not guilty. Angered, Scott promises vengeance. He is ultimately approached by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, proposing a deal: Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, in exchange for Scott assisting Saddam and his Iraqi associates into Canada. Scott is apprehensive about trusting Saddam, but agrees to the deal. The pair then conspires to kidnap Sally, daughter of Terrance and Celine Dion, and hold her hostage, as bait to lure Terrance and Phillip to Tehran; Saddam's soldiers would then murder Terrance and Phillip on arrival.|$|E
