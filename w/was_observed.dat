5|$|Albinism <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) {{along the}} {{coastline}} {{of the southern}} Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E
5|$|As Cindy moved inland, tornadoes {{touched down}} in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland along the outer bands of the storm. A tornado <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> near Nags Head around 17:40UTC on July 10, {{and a second}} <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> 25minutes later. Both tornadoes caused minimal damage– the first damaged four {{buildings}} and the second uprooted trees and toppled power poles. In addition, two waterspouts were noted offshore North Carolina, of which one was near New Topsail Beach in the mid-morning of July 8 and another near Sneads Ferry. No damage was reported from the waterspouts.|$|E

5|$|Eruptions from Mount Cleveland are {{generally}} vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows, lava fountains, pyroclastic flows, ash and steam emissions, lava dome growth, and the ejection of breadcrust bombs. Hot springs were reportedly {{found on the}} volcano in the 1800s, and persistent fumarolic activity <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in the 1980s and 1990s. Mount Cleveland is a site of persistent steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background activity. During 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous intrusion of magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome.
