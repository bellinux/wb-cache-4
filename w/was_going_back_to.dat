500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Eick {{opined that}} [...] "33" [...] was the [...] "silver bullet" [...] that ultimately tipped the scales {{in their favor}} and convinced the Sci Fi Channel {{to pick up the}} series. [...] The network's biggest concern in picking up the series was that Battlestar Galactica would fall victim to the same trappings of space opera as other television properties (Star Trek, Andromeda, Stargate). [...] Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] First, [...] "33" [...] went into Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) mind and visited his house on Caprica (shot in Lions Bay, British Columbia); being swept away by the blue skies and beaches in his fantasy was not the sort of imagery expected of space opera-type shows. [...] Second <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the devastated Caprica and following-up with Helo's (Tahmoh Penikett) story.|$|E
500|$|In June 2000, id Software's game engine {{designer}} John Carmack posted {{an internal}} company plan announcing {{a remake of}} Doom using next generation technology. This plan revealed controversy had been growing within id Software over remaking Doom. Kevin Cloud and Adrian Carmack, two of id Software's owners, were always strongly opposed to remaking Doom, believing that id <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the same formulas and properties too often. However, after the positive reception to Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the latest improvements in rendering technology, most of the employees agreed that a remake was the right idea and presented the two owners with an ultimatum: allow them to remake Doom or fire them. After the reasonably amicable confrontation (although artist Paul Steed, one of the instigators, was fired in retaliation), the agreement to work on Doom 3 was made. id Software began development on Doom 3 in late 2000, immediately after finishing [...] In 2001, it was first shown {{to the public at}} Macworld Conference & Expo in Tokyo and was later demonstrated at E3 2002, where a fifteen-minute gameplay demo was shown. It won five awards at E3 that year.|$|E

In May 2017, Iraqi Minister of Water Resources stated that no {{danger to the}} dam {{remained}} and it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> normal operation.

2500|$|Regarding the album's lyrical {{inspiration}}, Robyn told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul in March 2008: [...] "I {{think the}} biggest lyrical inspiration for this album <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> when I was like 15 and on the subway listening to hip hop. Back then—because I didn't know many people in Sweden who knew about rap, it was like my own music world—where the lyrics were very direct. So I tried to return to that age when you're so strong and self-confident, while acknowledging there's {{also a part of}} being a teenager when you're sometimes very insecure and feel very fragile." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with 'MaximoTV' on April 12, 2010, Ciara announced that the album would be titled, Basic Instinct. The title {{was inspired by the}} 1992 film of the same name, which starred Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. Stone's character, Catherine Tramell, was a beautiful, seductive, and stealthy crime writer. Ciara told the interviewer [...] "When you get the record, you're gonna get a really fun vibe. You're gonna get an even more sensual side and also confident and cocky. I got like such an attitude on this record, but in such a fun way." [...] One song which follows this theme is [...] "I Run It," [...] Rap-Up described it as a sensual slow jam. The new album is said to sound much like Ciara's debut album, Goodies, and her 2006 single, [...] "Promise," [...] following on from comments made by Tricky Stewart that Ciara <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her roots with this album. Meanwhile, she told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul magazine, that [...] "Basic Instinct is really about her trusting her instinct and going back to the R/urban basics in her music – like where she first started, in the days of [...] "Goodies" [...] and [...] "1, 2 Step." [...] In a later interview with Maxim, she said [...] "The album is about our basic wants and desires. But I have to say, Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct was smart, a little shady, and she definitely had a sexy gangsta thing going on." ...|$|E
