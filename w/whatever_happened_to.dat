5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Eric Pringle, {{a veteran}} of 2D digital animation, was {{employed}} as animation director, providing Jones with much technical assistance. Pringle's colleagues from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, another Cartoon Network production, comprised a team of around fifteen full-time animators at the network's studio, all working on Apple computers. Greg Miller was hired as supervising director, Martin Cendreda as technical director, and John Pham with Jon Vermilyea as character designers. Miller is the creator of <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to...</b> Robot Jones?, another series on the network. Vermilyea worked also as a character designer on the network's series Adventure Time, while Cendreda, Pham, and Jones all contributed to the anthology comic book Kramers Ergot.

5|$|When {{still in}} operation, the power {{stations}} appeared in films and television programs {{shot in the}} Newcastle area. They appeared in Payroll, a movie made in 1961, starring Michael Craig. One of two security van operators lives in Stella park, a housing estate above the power station. It is prominently in the background whenever the van operator's home is shown. In 1985, the Stella power stations are seen briefly in a shot in Seacoal, a movie made by Amber Films. They appear during a scene where the two protagonists, Ray and Betty, are travelling from Sunderland to Newcastle. (Lynemouth power station, a North East power station still in operation, is more prominent in the film.) In <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> the Likely Lads?, a British sitcom broadcast between 1973 and 1974, the stations themselves did {{not appear in the}} series, but in the end credits their ash boat, Bessie Surtees, could be seen passing Spiller's Wharf near Byker. In 1981, it was featured in Swing Bridge Videos' Check it Out, a short film about youth unemployment in the west end of Newcastle. In the mid-1990s, the decommissioned stations were photographed by north eastern artist John Kippin as part of his work The Secret Intelligence of the Silent. This piece was exhibited at the Laing Art Gallery in 2012 as part of the exhibition Futureland Now.|$|E

25|$|The latter aspect {{was usually}} a {{consequence}} {{of one of the}} lads reflecting on the past. Nostalgia was a strong thread running through the show.

25|$|In {{terms of}} humour, the two shows are very different. The Likely Lads {{had been a}} broad comedy, full of jokes and obvious gags, whereas <b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> the Likely Lads? used much subtler humour, derived from the {{dialogue}} and characterisation, often interspersed with sentimentality (as the Lads mourned their lost past), and even touches of pathos.|$|E
25|$|Predictably, the {{selection}} process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates.

25|$|<b>Whatever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> the Likely Lads? is a British sitcom {{which was}} {{broadcast}} between 9 January 1973 and 9 April 1974 on BBC1. It was the colour {{sequel to the}} mid-1960s hit The Likely Lads. It was created and written, as was its predecessor, by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. There were 26 television episodes over two series; and a subsequent 45-minute Christmas special was aired on 24 December 1974.|$|E
25|$|The episode's {{setting is}} stated in {{dialogue}} and a newspaper masthead as being 18–25 December 1981, and Sarah Jane's {{experiences with the}} Doctor and UNIT are in her past, indicating that the Third and Fourth Doctor serials took place more or less contemporaneously to their original broadcast dates.
