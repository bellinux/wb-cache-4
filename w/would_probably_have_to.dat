5|$|In 1877 Lieutenant Kitchener, of the Palestine Exploration Fund survey team, {{reported}} uncovering an Arabic inscription {{buried in}} {{the wall of the}} village mosque recording its building and dedication. He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea. He noted that they <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> repeat the payment.|$|E
5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{have been}} made that would either double or triple the {{frequency}} on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track {{would have to be}} built to where the current service to Nærbø terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the Jæren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between [...] However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they have little to gain from the increased speeds.|$|E
50|$|Grimsby: The Commission {{deferred}} {{a decision}} on the county borough's boundary. Grimsby corporation sought to annex the adjacent borough of Cleethorpes and much of Grimsby rural district, which <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> ceased <b>to</b> exist as a result.|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} Roman road {{which passed}} through Wych Cross and Colemans Hatch reached the London-Lewes trunk road at Gallypot Street, Hartfield, and <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> served <b>to</b> link the Romano-British iron-working complex at Garden Hill {{to the main}} road.|$|R
25|$|A. d. binghami, the Indonesian giant honey bee, is {{classified}} as the Indonesian subspecies of the giant honey bee or a distinct species; in the latter case, A. d. breviligula and/or other lineages <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be considered species.|$|R
2500|$|In 1946, Ben-Gurion {{decided that}} the Yishuv <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and {{neighbouring}} Arab states and accordingly began a [...] "massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West", and acquired many more {{during the first few}} months of hostilities.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a brief dissent {{from the}} majority's decision. He agreed that under Simmons, Shafer <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{have a new}} chance at sentencing; instead, he argued that this new {{criminal}} rule made by the courts was not proper for the American system of jurisprudence.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, in {{the wake}} of an {{announced}} merger of NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse, speculation developed that NASDAQ OMX and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE. NASDAQ OMX could be looking to acquire the American exchange's cash equities business, ICE the derivatives business. At the time, [...] "NYSE Euronext’s market value was $9.75billion. Nasdaq was valued at $5.78billion, while ICE was valued at $9.45billion."

60|$|It {{would have}} been better for the Lines Supplying Trust if Merrett had not {{received}} this crushing blow and <b>had</b> been allowed <b>to</b> carry on a rival business on legitimate lines.

2500|$|Sullivan and Garner {{are viewed}} as standing, in tandem, for the {{proposition}} that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> report {{the amount of the}} illegal income, but might validly claim the privilege by labeling the item [...] "Fifth Amendment" [...] (instead of [...] "illegal gambling income," [...] "illegal drug sales," [...] etc.) The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: [...] "Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported." [...] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated: [...] ".... the amount of a taxpayer's income is not privileged even though the source of income may be, and Fifth Amendment rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws [...] "by simply listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for 'miscellaneous' income on his tax form." [...] In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: [...] "While the source of some of [...] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the amount of his income was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it." [...] In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: [...] "A careful reading of Sullivan and Garner, therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} Oswald mounted and rode off, {{attended}} by Roger, who <b>had</b> asked Oswald <b>to</b> take him with him, {{as he had}} no relations he cared to visit.

60|$|Stirling's {{tone was}} coldly even, but Weston {{did not like}} the question. The form of it rather jarred on him. He realized, however, that he was on his defense, and <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put up with a good deal more than that.|$|E
50|$|Also, an airstrike <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> failed <b>to</b> destroy in {{entirety}} {{all of the}} missiles, {{with many}} of the positions hidden to U-2 reconnaissance planes.

The Cape Mounted Rifles went out in skirmishing order, ahead of the infantry, keeping a {{vigilant}} look-out for lurking foes.

60|$|The {{advantage}} an inn {{has over}} a private house, {{from the point}} of view of the person who wants to get into it when it has been locked up, is that a nocturnal visit is not so unexpected in the case of the former. Preparations have been made to meet such an emergency. Where with a private house you <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wander round heaving rocks and end by climbing up a water-spout, when you want to get into an inn you simply ring the night-bell, which, communicating with the boots' room, has that hard-worked menial up and doing in no time.|$|E
