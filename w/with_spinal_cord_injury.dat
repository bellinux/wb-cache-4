40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} a questionnaire for obtaining owner-perceived, weighted quality-oflife assessments for dogs <b>with</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries.</b> DESIGN Evaluation study. Animals- 100 dogs <b>with</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> and 48 healthy control dogs. PROCEDURES The questionnaire {{was adapted from}} a questionnaire (the schedule {{for the evaluation of}} individual quality of life-direct weighting) used for human patients. Specifically, owners were asked to identify 5 areas or activities they believed had the most influence on their dogs' quality of life, assess their dogs' current status in each of those areas, and provide a weighting for the importance of each area. Results were used to construct a weighted quality-of-life score ranging from 0 to 100 for each dog. Owners were also asked to provide a quality-of-life score with a visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS A good correlation was found between weighted and VAS quality-of-life scores. Dogs <b>with</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> had weighted quality-of-life scores that were significantly lower than scores for control dogs. Quality-of-life areas and activities provided by owners of dogs <b>with</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> were similar to areas and activities provided by owners of healthy control dogs and could mostly be encompassed by 5 broader domains: mobility, play or mental stimulation, health, companionship, and other. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that the questionnaire could be used to obtain owner-perceived, weighted quality-of-life assessments for dogs <b>with</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries.</b> Obtaining owner-perceived quality-of-life assessments for individual dogs should allow veterinarians to better address quality-of-life concerns and expectations of owners...|$|R
