500|$|Discussing the album's {{reception}} in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote: [...] "Harrison's worldly critics, {{who had long}} found his sermons insufferable, responded like bulls to a red flag to Extra Texture, which contains a number of treatises on how reviewers always 'miss the point.'" [...] Even Harrison's loyal [...] "disciples", Schaffner continued, tended to view the album as [...] "plodding and aimless". Rolling Stones reviewer, Dave Marsh, highlighted [...] "You" [...] as a return to All Things Must Pass-style grandeur, and [...] "Can't Stop Thinking About You" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as [...] "the most effective nine minutes of music" [...] the artist had made since 1970. Generally, on an album that was [...] "sketchy at best", however, Marsh bemoaned the over-reliance on [...] "merely competent" [...] keyboards and Harrison's [...] "affectingly feeble voice", before concluding: [...] "Harrison {{is no longer a}} Beatle, as he has reminded us more than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked.</b> But if he learned nothing else from his experience in that organization, it ought to have been that a good guitar player isn't worth much without a band." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July, in a {{somewhat}} different context, Dean Greenough claimed the Court did all it could with the evidence it extracted from its witnesses. Grace Smerage, the mother of expelled student Keith Smerage, had complained to Greenough that Harvard had just graduated others her son said were as guilty as he or more so. Greenough replied {{on behalf of the}} Court: [...] "We certainly cannot be held responsible for not acting on evidence we did not possess, especially when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> all the boys we have summoned if they had anything further to tell us. If boys choose to shield those who are guilty they must accept the incomplete results of a Board acting upon information which is inadequate because the boys themselves have chosen to let it be inadequate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oversight of U.S. Airline Customer Service: May 2, 2017. [...] The Congresswoman posed {{questions}} to the witnesses, including Oscar Munoz,, after the Committee Chairman Bill Shuster left his chair. Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so {{there is no question that}} there is an issue of training as well.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I don't mean to make {{a serious}} complaint,' she added, in injured tones, showing that she did.

6000|$|Old Madame de Bellegarde {{stood up}} to give Newman her greeting, and there {{was that in the}} way she did so which seemed to measure {{narrowly}} the extent of her condescension.

60|$|And {{there are}} four kinds of tomtits round here, remember: but we may go on with such talk for ever.

60|$|She {{then put}} the same {{question}} to the schoolmaster which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> already of almost every {{one else in the}} village. It was met by the same discouraging answer Mr. Dempster had not set eyes on the stranger of whom we were in search.|$|R

"If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> Mrs. Dyer {{to give us}} fifteen dollars, cold cash," [...] remarked Laura, [...] "she {{would have}} snubbed us properly; but the first article from her attic which <b>we</b> sold <b>has</b> netted us that sum and I really believe we will get from fifty to seventy-five dollars more out {{of the rest of}} the stuff." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Masters," [...] Sir Richard said suavely, [...] "the {{truth is}} that we cannot afford to let you go--unless you agree to do what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked.</b> You see we really have not the money or any way of raising it--and the {{inconvenience}} of being posted you have yourself very ably pointed out.

I remember a faint sensation of some change about me, but I was too absent to think of it then. And that's where it is now, and you must go and look there.' ...|$|E

Seeing how keenly {{he felt the}} insult offered {{to me by the}} ladies whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> to our table, I willingly {{prepared}} for our sudden departure. When Mr. Germaine is far away from his false friends, my experience of him tells me that he will recover his tranquillity. That is enough for me.|$|R

[...] "We dined out here with some new comers in the square only last week. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> them before, and they came quite in a quiet way,--just like this; {{and when we got}} there we found they'd four kinds of ices after dinner!" ...|$|R

Well, we do not expect this, and you will find Wolf's business is, for the most part, transacted at a neighbourhood we leave alone. All the same, the chartered steamer is valuable, and although <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for some guarantees, we would like a company's servant on board.

6000|$|... "It {{is always}} they {{who come to}} us, we go not to them. They are jealous of our {{entering}} their country, and men who go too far in search of game have often been shot at by invisible foes. They take care that their arrows don't strike, but shoot only as a warning that we must go no farther. Sometimes some foolhardy men have declared that they will go where they like {{in spite of the}} Fenmen, and they have gone, but they have never returned. When <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> the men who come in to trade what has become of them they say 'they do not know, most likely they had lost their way and died miserably, or fallen into a swamp and perished there;' and as the men have certainly lost their lives through their own obstinacy nothing can be done." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} yet one last class of persons to be interrogated. The wise {{religious}} men <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> in vain; the wise contemplative men, in vain; the wise worldly men, in vain. But there is another group yet. In {{the midst of this}} vanity of empty religion--of tragic contemplation--of wrathful and wretched ambition, and dispute for dust, {{there is yet}} one great group of persons, by whom all these disputers live--the persons who have determined, or have had it by a beneficent Providence determined for them, that they will do something useful; that whatever may be prepared for them hereafter, or happen to them here, they will, at least, deserve the food that God gives them by winning it honourably: and that, however fallen from the purity, or far from the peace, of Eden, they will carry out the duty of human dominion, though they have lost its felicity; and dress and keep the wilderness, though they no more can dress or keep the garden.|$|E

6000|$|Euphemia and I {{once wrote}} a book,--this {{was just before}} we were married,--in which we told young married people how to go to {{housekeeping}} {{and how much it}} would cost them.

6000|$|At {{the ninth}} verse the sailor-missionary said, [...] "Jesus is God, you see, so we're safe to trust Him," [...] and, at the thirteenth verse, [...] "Whatsoever ye shall ask {{in my name}} that will I do," [...] he said. [...] "Now, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> Jesus to save you, and He will do it, by His Holy Spirit, as He has saved me--has saved {{millions}} in time past, and will save millions more in time to come. Why, you see, in the sixteenth verse He tells you He will pray the Father {{to send you a}} Comforter, who will stay with you for ever. Has He not reason then for beginnin' with `let not your heart be troubled'? And that same Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is to `teach us all things,' so, you see, every difficulty is taken out of our way. `Arise, let us go hence.' Now, my old messmate, I have arisen. Will you not arise and go with me, both of us looking unto Jesus?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen, my son. Thou hast to-day proved thyself {{worthy of}} trust, and thou shalt hear. My son, ere yet I {{knew the truth}} I was a {{reckless}} disobedient youth, and I bore thy mother from her parents in England without their consent. Since, by Heaven's grace, I {{have come to a}} better mind, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> and obtained their forgiveness, and it has long been their desire to see again their daughter and her son. Moreover, since the accession of the present Queen, it has been a land where the light is free to shine forth; and though I verily believe what Maitre Gardon says, that persecution is a blessed means of grace, yet it is grievous to expose one's dearest thereto when they are in no state to count the cost. Therefore would I thither convey you all, and there amid thy mother's family would we openly abjure the errors in which we have been nurture. I have already sent to Paris to obtain from the Queen-mother the necessary permission to take my family to visit thy grand-father, and it must now be our endeavour to start immediately on the receipt of the reply, before the Chevalier's information can lead to any hindrance or detention of Eustacie.' ...|$|E
60|$|My dearest Mona Nina,--Your letter {{makes me}} feel very uncomfortable. We are in real {{difficulty}} about our dear friend Mr. Kenyon, the impulse being, of course, that Robert should go at once, and then the fear coming {{that it might be}} an annoyance, an intrusion, something the farthest from what it should be at all. If you had been more explicit--you--and we could know what was in your mind when you 'ask' Robert to come, my dear friend, then it would be all easier. If we could but know whether anything passed between you and Miss Bayley on this subject, or whether it is entirely out of your own head that you wish Robert to come. I thought about it yesterday, till I went to bed at eight o'clock with headache. Shall I tell you something in your ear? It is easier for a rich man to enter, after all, into the kingdom of heaven than into the full advantages of real human tenderness. Robert would give much at this moment to be allowed to go to dearest Mr. Kenyon, sit up with him, hold his hand, speak a good loving word to him. This would be privilege to him and to me; and love and gratitude on our parts justified us in asking to be allowed to do it. Twice <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked.</b> The first time a very kind but decided negative was returned to us on the part of our friend. Yesterday we again asked. Yesterday I wrote to say that it would be consolation to us if Robert might go--if we might say so without 'teasing.' To-morrow, in the case of Miss Bayley sending a consent, even on her own part, Robert will set off instantly; but without an encouraging word from her--my dear friend, do you not see that it might really vex dearest Mr. Kenyon? Observe, we have no more right of intruding than you would have if you forced your way upstairs. It's a wretched world, where we can't express an honest affection honestly without half appearing indelicate to ourselves; nothing proves more how the dirt of the world is up to our chins, and I think I had my headache yesterday really and absolutely from simple disgust.|$|E
