Most of the benefits praised by its enthusiasts — the ease of play, the camaraderie among fans, the challenge of solving <b>what</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> math puzzle — are real. It does take skill to parse game film, diligently follow the news and interpret the thousands of bits of sports information that are generated each night. If a problem gambler at the poker rooms I frequent in New York City were to hire a programmer and flood the D.F.S. market with his lineups, he would almost certainly hemorrhage money." ...|$|E

Mr. Meadows stated: [...] "I will not sacrifice Charles Siebert {{on the altar of}} political expediency or correctness. Despite <b>what</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reckless character assassination by some media outlets and, regrettably, even some members of our government, I believe Dr. Siebert to be a competent and thorough medical examiner–not beholden to anyone or any cause.

2500|$|In {{legal systems}} based on English tradition, {{findings}} of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury {{findings of fact}} even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known, are entitled to great deference on appeal. [...] In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems evidence may be presented to appellate courts in <b>what</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trial de novo (new trial) of appealed findings of fact. [...] The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has major impact on court procedure in these systems. [...] This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition. [...] The higher the stakes, the more this is true. [...] Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition {{than they are in}} other legal systems.|$|E
2500|$|Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot {{noted that}} [...] "Legend sings with more grit than usual, and the Roots crackle with energy", but stated, [...] "This well-intentioned {{collection}} never surpasses the strong originals {{from which it}} draws".

[...] AllMusic writer Andy Kellman shared a similar sentiment and commented that [...] "There are several instances when the Roots, who are deeply intimate with grit, outshine Legend, whose polished and pride-rich voice occasionally clashes with the material." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave it two out of four stars and stated: [...] "Legend might be the weak link; he's not the grittiest singer to be tackling this particular set list – he's often a boy in a man's studio here, especially when he gamely but lamely yeah's through the 12-minute arc of Bill Withers' wartime lament 'I Can't Write Left-Handed' – but his ease mostly makes a dynamic foil for the Roots' muscle and the frequent guest vocals." [...] Zach Cole of URBs criticized Legend's singing as overdone and wrote that the album [...] "run the risk of coming across as entirely cheesy and contrived". Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo found it musically [...] "hollow and brittle" [...] and commented that [...] "Many of these treatments are good, but barely justify <b>what</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> good-time vanity project for both acts." ...|$|E
