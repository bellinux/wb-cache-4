5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding {{the eggs and}} guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards {{the site for the}} two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E

At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a toilet lid, she sees rats forcing their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sewer.

5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical.

The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others made their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Klondike in search of food and shelter for the winter.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the bay where the pirates were said to be, Alligator dispatched boats to engage the enemy vessels, as the water was too shallow for the warship to engage them directly. With Allen personally commanding one of the boats, the Americans assaulted the schooner Revenge. Although the Navy was able to force the pirates into abandoning Revenge, the buccaneers managed to fight their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay and inflict seven casualties. With their commander mortally wounded, the boats ceased pursuit of the pirates, but were able to recover the vessels that had been held in the bay.|$|E
5|$|After two {{costly and}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to seize the}} fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, {{on the last day}} of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. Considering the time, effort, and resources spent to capture the small fort, it was a pyrrhic victory for the British. A number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way; but more than any other battle of the war, the fighting around Nalapani established the Gurkhas' reputation as warriors. As a result, they were later recruited by the British to serve in their army.|$|E

5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was undone at the critical moment when Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Underworld, and intent on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, and took his hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to dismantle the grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warehouse.|$|E

Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach, the officer of the day, was stationed at El Morro Castle at San Juan Bay on 21 March 1915. The Odenwald, built in 1903 (not {{to be confused with the}} German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|Classical {{definitions}} of complementarity {{are based on}} cross price elasticities, and so they do not apply, for example, when goods are free. This context includes many relevant cases such as online newspapers and public attractions.

We uncover a conflict between properties that complementarity should intuitively possess. We discuss three <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impossibility...|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} attempt to relieve Mantua, Vukassovich {{participated in the}} Tyrol Corps' {{victories}} at Cembra on 2 November and the Battle of Calliano on 6–7 November.

Together they routed the French at Rivoli Veronese. After Bonaparte won the Battle of Arcole, the French army commander drove the Tyrol Corps back to Trento. During the fourth attempt to relieve Mantua, Jozsef Alvinczi directed Vukassovich to lead his 6th Column down the east bank of the Adige River. His artillery supported the attack of Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen {{on the west bank}} of the river, but he exerted little other influence on the disastrous result of the Battle of Rivoli because his troops were on the wrong side of the river.|$|E
