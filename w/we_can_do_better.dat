At {{the time of}} the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that [...] "It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than that.'" ...|$|E

According to Paul himself, it will not cost a thing, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, [...] "But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better.</b> Right now, the program has changed to the Ron Paul Liberty Report, {{and that is what we}} do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news." [...] Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California.|$|E

Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many things <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better...</b> If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown {{said he did not}} want to hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E

2500|$|After playing 34 {{games with}} the Eagles, Smukler was {{suspended}} in October 1939 for breaking training rules. When owner Bert Bell asked him why, Smukler allegedly told him, “I’m through with football.” Apparently, Smukler had broken training rules various times in the past. He had made a pledge to Bell that this would not happen again, only to break training once more. Bell said, “In my opinion, Dave {{was one of the}} greatest football players in professional football when he wanted to be. But I believe for the best interests of the team and myself <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> without him as he was a demoralizing influence.
