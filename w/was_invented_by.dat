The repeating clock, that chimes {{the number of hours}} (or even minutes) <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> either Quare or Barlow in 1676. George Graham invented the deadbeat escapement for clocks in 1720.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} deep-fried butter {{on a stick}} debuted at the Iowa State Fair 2011, which was {{prepared}} using frozen butter that is dipped in a honey- and cinnamon- flavored batter, deep-fried until browned, and then topped with a confectioner's sugar glaze. This concoction on a stick <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa State Fair have also been prepared and served formed as balls. Deep-fried butter has also been served on a stick at the State Fair of Texas.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US {{patent for}} it was granted in 1974. It was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of epileptic seizures at the originally recommended dosage caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose.|$|E

5|$|The first {{power-assisted}} steering on {{any type of}} vehicle dates to 1876, but little is recorded of the system. Other {{attempts were made to}} add {{power-assisted steering}} to motorized vehicles such as in the 1903 Columbia 5-ton truck and other heavy vehicles, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a practical hydraulic power system <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Francis W.

5|$|Following the Civil War, {{minstrel}} shows {{became the}} first distinctively American form of music expression. The minstrel show was an indigenous form of American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, usually performed by white people in blackface. Minstrel shows used African American elements in musical performances, but only in simplified ways; storylines in the shows depicted blacks as natural-born slaves and fools, before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism. The minstrel show <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Daniel Decatur Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels. Minstrel shows produced the first well-remembered popular songwriters in American music history: Thomas D. Rice, Daniel Decatur Emmett, and, most famously, Stephen Foster. After minstrel shows' popularity faded, coon songs, a similar phenomenon, became popular.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Dooley <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Dunne {{to replace}} a similar {{character}} whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> English author A. A. Milne {{for his son}} Christopher Robin Milne. The sport {{first came}} to {{prominence}} when it was described in the author's book The House at Pooh Corner {{as well as in}} the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises the rules for Poohsticks. Pooh continues to play the sport with the other characters, Christopher Robin, Tigger and Eeyore.|$|E

5|$|The John Deere House and Shop {{is located}} in the unincorporated village of Grand Detour, Illinois, near the Lee County city of Dixon. The site is known as the {{location}} where the first steel plow <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> John Deere in 1837. The site includes Deere's house, a replica of his original blacksmith shop, a gift shop, and an archaeological exhibit showing the excavation site of his original blacksmith shop. The Deere House and Shop is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it joined that list in 1966, the year the Register was established. Prior to that, it was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E

5|$|The first hydrogen-filled balloon <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Jacques Charles in 1783. Hydrogen {{provided}} the lift {{for the first}} reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard. German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; {{the first of which}} had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of rapid}} firing {{machine guns and}} long range breech loading {{artillery}} quickly led to camouflaging of vehicles and positions. Artillery pieces were soon painted in contrasting bold colours to obscure their outlines. Another early trend was building observation trees, made of steel with bark camouflage. Such trees became popular with the British and French armies in 1916. The observation tree <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> French painter Lucien-Victor Guirand de ScÃ©vola, who led the French army's camouflage unit, {{the first of its}} kind in any army. He also invented painted canvas netting to hide machine gun positions, and this was quickly taken up for hiding equipment and gun positions from 1917, 7 million square yards being used by the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
