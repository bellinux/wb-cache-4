His style is {{influenced}} by the Swiss film Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000, a favorite of Cuarón's. Cuarón reminisces: [...] "I was studying cinema <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> , and interested in the French New Wave. Jonah was so unflashy compared to those films. The camera keeps a certain distance and there are relatively few close-ups. It's elegant and flowing, constantly tracking, but very slowly and not calling attention to itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Perreault {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} superb stickhandler, and scored a goal on his first shift in a professional scrimmage. [...] Bobby Orr once said of Perreault: [...] "His head and shoulders go one way, his legs go the other way, and the puck is doing something else. [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> it I couldn't believe it." [...] His popularity and respect surpassed O. J. Simpson in a poll of Buffalonians about the best Buffalo athlete. [...] Phil Esposito once said if anyone was to break his 76-goal, 152 point season records [...] "It will be Gilbert Perreault." ...|$|E
500|$|A single of [...] "Ultra Thizz" [...] was {{released}} by Warp as a 12" [...] vinyl single and as a digital download on 6 September 2011. For the Glass Swords album cover, Whyte was shown various designer's portfolios by Warp. Whyte chose Jonathan Zawada, as he felt it had a [...] "'70s sci-fi art feel". After discussing ideas with Whyte, Zawada gave him the album cover in a few days. When asked about the album cover resembling two erect penises, Whyte responded [...] "Everyone says that! That's what I thought <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> it and I was like, 'Am I okay with that?' And, yeah, that's fine." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E
2500|$|Victor Kraft, {{his partner}} at that time, found Rock Hill. It had been {{designed}} by a local architect 20 years earlier. [...] "One look at the grounds," [...] Copland said, [...] "and I was sold! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the studio I said {{it looked like a}} room where a composer could write music. His datebook for November 1, 1960, the day he closed on the house, proudly proclaims [...] "HOUSE BOUGHT!" [...] He lived there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{image of}} Mochrie's face is used {{extensively}} in Animutation, {{a style of}} Flash animation. Neil Cicierega, the father of Animutation, would place Mochrie in almost every Animutation he made, making the inclusion of him in Animutation somewhat of a running gag. Mochrie is aware of his status among Animutation artists and fans, having been quoted, [...] "It was very odd <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the animutations. Obviously, the animators {{are more than a}} little crazy, but I am very proud of my standing in the animutation arena and hope that some day I can make millions off of it." ...|$|E

Whatever {{may have}} passed under that calm brow – anger, joy, disagreement, surprise, relief, triumph – no outward sign was betrayed {{on the field}} of play. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> him, in 1919, he was a debonair and {{powerful}} stylist. As you bowled opening overs to the later Sutcliffe you noticed the entire development of every defensive art; the depressingly straight bat, the astute use of pads (as with Hobbs), the sharp detection of which out-swinger could be left; above all, the consistently safe playing down of a rising or turning ball on leg stump, or thighs.|$|E
2500|$|Addressing the {{similarities}} between MDK2 and the original game, he explained [...] "The key characteristics we retained in MDK2 were the humor and the light-hearted style of the game. The reasoning is pretty straightforward - the humor and style of MDK set it apart." [...] He praised the original game, stating [...] "There isn't much I would change about MDK. It {{could have been a}} little longer, it would have been well served by more character development and it really needed a method {{to tell the story of}} the game. We're directly addressing all of these areas in MDK2." [...] Speaking of how much MDK2 was influenced by MDK, he explained [...] "I can't even begin to explain the strength of the visual influence that the original MDK has over MDK2. I was very impressed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> MDK and I'm even more impressed after having played it many times. In many ways, in MDK2 we're striving to reach the goal Shiny set with the original by using new and improved technology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his Australian {{citizenship}} ceremony, Coetzee {{said that}} [...] "I did {{not so much}} leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because {{from the time of}} my first visit in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and– <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> Adelaide– by the grace of the city that I now have the honour of calling my home." [...] When he initially moved to Australia, he had cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason for the move, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who, speaking of Coetzee's novel Disgrace stated that [...] "South Africa is not only a place of rape". In 1999, the African National Congress submission to an investigation into racism in the media by the South African Human Rights Commission named Disgrace as a novel exploiting racist stereotypes. However, when Coetzee won his Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him [...] "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".|$|E

[...] Explaining how having three playable characters would affect the gameplay, he said, [...] "The largest impact to the gameplay experience, in our opinion, will be an increased variety to the gameplay. Players will have to quickly change gears between the run and gun shooting style of Max, the stealthy style of Kurt and the puzzling style of the Doctor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E

5000|$|The British actress Mary Linley Taylor was {{impressed}} by Dilkusha Kothi and named her own home in Seoul after it.
