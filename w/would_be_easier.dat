5|$|Historically the Barnard Run was a seven-mile course {{which began}} at Towler Hill Farm, ran to Cotherstone {{suspension}} bridge, with an undetermined route {{back to the}} school. In 1898 a 4-mile junior Barnard Run was created for 11- to 14-year-olds. In 1904 {{it was decided that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> for training purposes if the run began at the school, and a new course was developed.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, Charles Cornwallis {{arrived at}} Petersburg with 1,500 men after {{suffering}} heavy casualties at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He immediately assumed command, as Phillips had recently {{died of a}} fever. Cornwallis had not received permission to abandon the Carolinas from his superior, Henry Clinton, but he believed that Virginia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to capture, feeling that it would approve of an invading British army.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes {{estimated}} that Argos <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized the rugged area above the city's theatre. The {{people of the}} city were too terrified to offer resistance. They accepted a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies. The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan king had ever managed to seize Argos. Even Pyrrhus of Epirus, {{one of the most}} famous generals of the age, had been killed while trying to take the city.|$|E

5|$|Seth MacFarlane voices {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire.

MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his own voice while portraying Brian.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes.

5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters, including Goku, with small statures. Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier,</b> even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up. The editor said his concerns were unfounded, as readers accepted the change without complaint.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{was cast}} as {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to portray the voices he already envisioned than {{for someone else to}} attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. The voice of Quagmire was inspired by fast-speaking radio advertising spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one-time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E
5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{the first}} Capcom-designed Vs. {{installment}} to be rendered fully in 3D. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and its graphical characteristics were optimized for the Wii, which prevents the game from being ported to other consoles without completely re-building the game. Niitsuma explained that its Wii exclusivity was also {{due to a lack}} of Capcom fighting games for the console, and because the Wii's casual quality matches the Vs. series trait of accessibility. The producer suggested that porting a sequel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier,</b> but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making such plans. On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's senior vice president Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell Tatsunoko vs. Capcom physically or digitally.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he came to}} Hamburg to {{work with}} Pauli, Rabi found Otto Stern working there with two English-speaking {{postdoctoral}} fellows, Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor. Rabi soon made friends with them, and became interested in their molecular beam experiments, for which Stern would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943. Their research involved non-uniform magnetic fields, which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately. Rabi {{came up with the}} idea of using a uniform field instead, with the molecular beam at a glancing angle, so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to use, and produce more accurate results. Encouraged by Stern, and greatly assisted by Taylor, Rabi managed to get his idea to work. On Stern's advice, Rabi wrote a letter about his results to Nature, which published it in February 1929, followed by a paper entitled Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen ("On the method of deflection of molecular beams") to Zeitschrift für Physik, where it was published in April.|$|E

5|$|Barber {{finished}} hubs for {{the four}} coins in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington. Snowden praised {{the beauty of the}} coins, and was happy that Barber had required less relief than needed on US coins of like value, since this meant the coins <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> for the Mint to strike. Preston sent the coins to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for its coin cabinet and for the director's office in Washington. Barber was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, to be sent to the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no coins were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that the dies were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.|$|E
5|$|Bolívar {{took control}} of Caracas with his victory {{at the battle of}} Carabobo, and the Congress of Cúcuta issued laws similar to those in Perú.

Peru sent a military force of 1,300 men. Bolívar entered the city a month later, and claimed that for historical reasons Quito should be part of Colombia. San Martín and Bolívar sought to generate Latin American integration, but disagreed on the type of government: Bolívar proposed a republic, and San Martín a constitutional monarchy, reasoning that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to receive international recognition for the now-independent South American nations. Peru and Colombia signed a treaty of integration, to be proposed to Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay, and at a later point to the United Provinces of Central America and the Empire of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals.

A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Whereas prior {{research}} has demonstrated that warning students of an examʼs difficulty well in advance of the exam enhances performance, the current research dem-onstrated the effect of such forewarning immediately before examination administration. Moments before taking an examination in a laboratory environment, participants were either (a) informed that the examination <b>would</b> <b>be</b> difficult, (b) informed that the examina-tion <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy,</b> or (c) not given any information about the examʼs ostensible difficulty. Participants of low trait anxiety performed better when told the exam <b>would</b> <b>be</b> difficult than when told that the exam <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy.</b> Conversely, participants of high trait anxiety performed worse when told the exam <b>would</b> <b>be</b> difficult than they did when told the exam <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> or when provided with no such information. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.
