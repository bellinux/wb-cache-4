During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including Greenland halibut, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, haddock, spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, <b>witch</b> <b>flounder,</b> and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.In 1497 John Cabot became the first to explore mainland North America {{and one of his}} major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as [...] "Newfoundland Currency" [...] this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish, Greenland halibut, <b>witch</b> <b>flounder,</b> and grenadiers. Overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on international waters, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including American plaice, redfish, and Greenland halibut, together with flounder and grenadier.|$|E

The <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> has become increasingly important commercially since the 1940 's. There was heavy exploitation of <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> by foreign ships in the early 1970 's but with the introduction of Canada's 200 -mile limit in 1977, foreign fishing for the species was reduced and Canada's take increased.

The study focused on the infection levels of the three most abundant nematode species, Hysterothylacium aduncum, Anisakis simplex and Contracaecum osculatum, in the three flatfish species American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and common dab (Limanda limanda). When all nematode and fish species were pooled the percentage of infected fish (i. e prevalence), {{the average number of}} nematodes per fish (i. e. abundance) and the average number of nematodes per infected fish (i. e. the intensity) were significantly higher at Langøya than at Torbjørnskjær. While H. aduncum and C. osculatum had higher abundances at the western site, A. simplex was more abundant at the eastern site. Among the three flatfish species, American plaice had a relatively high prevalence both at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær (55 and 53 % respectively). <b>Witch</b> <b>flounder</b> was only infected at Langøya (59 %) and mainly with H. aduncum (53 %). Common dab had a high prevalence at Langøya (80 %) and rather low at Torbjørnskjær (15 %). However, since the sample size was small for <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> at Torbjørnskjær (n = 4) and for common dab at Langøya (n = 5), these results are likely to be biased. This study also supports the general view that there is a large fluctuation in the nematode populations in the outer Oslofjord. The previously observed decrease of A. simplex seems to continue. C. osculatum and H. aduncum are getting more widespread in the Oslofjord. In addition, my data contain the first recording of the flatfish nematode Cucullanus heterochrous at Langøya, suggesting that also this species is expanding in the Oslofjord. The lengths of the nematodes were used to investigate whether the three flatfishes are suitable hosts for the three nematode species. American plaice and <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> are good transport and final hosts for H. aduncum. American plaice seemed to be suitable transport host for C. osculatum as well. Despite the fact that A. simplex is known to have a pelagic life-cycle with Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as the main transport host, my observations show that it can also use the benthic common dab as transport host in the outer Oslofjord. The number of nematodes per <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> and common dab had a random distribution (Poisson distribution). However, the number of Pseudoterranova decipiens per American plaice was highly over-dispersed. It is likely that a combination of different factors, especially the feeding ecology and habitat preferences of the fish, is the cause for the observed infestation patterns. In addition, American plaice and <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> harboured a more diverse parasite fauna than common dab.

40|$|During {{the fishing}} process, fish {{react to a}} trawl {{with a series of}} {{behaviours}} that often are species and size specific. Thus, a thorough understanding of fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear and a scientific understanding of the ability of different gear designs to utilize or stimulate various behavioural patterns during the catching process are essential for developing more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly trawls. Although many behavioural studies using optical and acoustic observation systems have been conducted, harsh observation conditions on the fishing grounds often hamper the ability to directly observe fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear. As an alternative to optical and acoustic methods, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to catch data to extract detailed and quantitative information about species- and size-dependent escape behaviour in towed fishing gear such as trawls. We used catch comparison data collected with a twin trawl setup; the only difference between the two trawls was that a 12 m long upper section was replaced with 800 mm diamond meshes in one of them. We investigated the length-based escape behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt) and quantified the extent to which behavioural responses set limits for the large mesh panel's selective efficiency.

40|$|Several commercially {{important}} {{demersal fish}} stocks for the North Sea fisheries are classified by ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) as “data limited” stocks, which are stocks {{for which the}} data are insufficient to perform a full analytical assessment and forecast (ICES 2012 b). Until 2012 for most of these ‘data-limited’ stocks, there was no quantitative management advice {{that is based on}} the status of the stock, because the status is unknown. In this report catch per unit of effort (CPUE) indices, spatial distributions, length frequencies and agelength relationships are analysed for 7 species that have commercial importance for Dutch fisheries: dab, flounder, <b>witch</b> <b>flounder,</b> lemon sole, brill, turbot and North Sea horse mackerel.

40|$|Canadian fall surveys {{since the}} late- 1970 s {{indicated}} that <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> were widely {{distributed throughout the}} shelf area in deeper channels around the fishing banks primarily in Division 3 K. By the mid- 1980 s they were rapidly disappearing and by the early- 1990 s had virtually disappeared from the area entirely except for some very small catches along the slope in Div. 3 L. The fall 1998 - 2001 surveys indicate no change in this distribution pattern. For the three Divisions combined, the biomass index declined from about 65 000 tons in 1984 to less than 1 000 tons in 1995, by far {{the lowest in the}} time series. A small increase was observed between 1995 and 1996 and was almost exclusively a result of inclusion of the deeper strata surveyed in Div. 3 L. The estimates have remained the same since then.

40|$|Our {{mission is}} to ensure that the Freshwater, Marine, and Wildlife Resources of the State of Rhode Island will be conserved and managed for {{equitable}} and sustainable use. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report summarizes the status marine fisheries resources, management, and related activities in Rhode Island for 2007. Rhode Island commercial fisheries landed almost 34 thousand metric tons valued at approximately $ 77 million in 2007, all species combined. The recreational fisheries harvested 2, 065 metric tons in 2007. Over half of recreational anglers were non-residents, as has been the case the past twenty-seven years. The most recent stock assessment information suggests that ten marine species important to Rhode Island are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. These are the stocks of Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic striped bass, bluefish, longfin squid (Loligo), silver hake—Southern stock, little skates, spiny dogfish, and <b>witch</b> <b>flounder.</b> Six species of commercial importance to Rhode Island are considered overfished and experiencing overfishing: monkfish, scup, tautog, winter flounder—Southern New England stock, winte...|$|E
40|$|Catch-per-tow indices {{obtained}} by research vessels {{for the years}} 1963 – 2009 from NAFO statistical areas 4 W, 4 X, 5 Y, and 5 Z were studied to determine how fish “apparent abundance ” in the decade 2000 – 2009 differed from the long-term time-series. Cluster ana-lysis of normalized catch-per-tow data indicated that the abundance and species composition of stocks in each statistical area changed dramatically over the 50 -year period. There were decreases in thorny skate, ocean pout, cusk, <b>witch</b> <b>flounder,</b> and monkfish and increases in herring, haddock, northern shrimp, and spiny dogfish. Cluster analysis suggested that these decreases and increases were not gradual, but abrupt, and that these abrupt decreases and increases were concentrated in {{the decade of the}} 1980 s. Observations of abrupt change were supported by regression-tree analysis of individual stocks. Examination of the interrelationship among abundance indices from different stocks by Bonferroni-adjusted correlation coefficients showed that the abundance trajector-ies of most stocks were uncorrelated. It appears that the set of population transitions during the decade of the 1980 s was a dominant event in the statistical time-series...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} review of the {{geographic}} and bathimetric patterns of occurrence of the Greenland halibut catches in NAFO Divisions 3 LMNO and their incidence on the catch of other stocks, namely cod, American plaice and yellowtail and witch flounders. The Greenland halibut mature proportions at depth in both the commercial catches and the spring Spanish 3 NO survey indices are also presented. According to the results of the Spanish fleet, the Greenland halibut fishery does not overlap significantly with either American plaice, yellowtail flounder, skate or cod. By-catches of <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> in the Greenland halibut fishery have been very small, at least in 1999. The CPUE analysis indicate that Greenland halibut is best caught in the deepest strata, with catch rates comparatively poor at depths less than 600 m. Besides a sharp change in catchability is observed between 500 – 600 m. The proportion of mature fish in the catches increases with depth attaining a maximum between 1200 – 1600 m. The survey results indicate that most part of the SSB is found at depths beyond 800 m...|$|E
40|$|In 2002 the R/V Vizconde de Eza {{will replace}} the C/V Playa de Menduíña in {{conducting}} the Platuxa bottom trawl series {{carried out by the}} Centro Oceanográfico de Vigo (Oceanographic Center of Vigo) since 1995. So in May of 2001 a comparative fishing experience was conducted to transform the series of the indices previously obtained and maintain the continuity of the time series obtained by the C/V Playa de Menduíña. A 81 parallel hauls series was performed. For each of the main species: American Plaice, Yellowtail flounder, Cod, <b>Witch</b> <b>flounder</b> and Thorny skate, the catches of both vessels were compared and a linear fit for these catches is presented. Also, we performed a comparative study on the catches by lenght for American plaice and Yellowtail flounder by a probability variant of the logistic curve, assuming unequal catches between the two vessels, and a fit to transformed these data. As anticipated, the values of the new indices were lower than the previous values, because teh Pedreira is approximately four times more efficient then the Campelen trawl gear...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{characterize}} the different Spanish fisheries in NAFO Subarea 3 during the period 2005 - 2011 base on the catch composition, depth and gear used by the Spanish fleet. Normally a fishery is determined by its catch composition, the area where it was took and the fleet and gear used to catch it. Based on the results, it can conclude that Spanish fleet had six different fisheries in the period 2005 - 2011 in NAFO Division 3 LMNO depending on the target species, area, depth and gear (mesh size). The Spanish fisheries were the following: 1) In Divisions 3 LMNO at more than 600 meters depth with demersal 130 mm mesh size gear with Greenland halibut (86 %) as target species and the roughhead grenadier (4 %) and the redfish (2 %) as main by-catch species. 2) In Divisions 3 LMNO, mainly in Div 3 O and 3 M with demersal 130 mm mesh size gear in the 200 - 600 strata. The target species was the redfish (80 %) and the main by-catch species were Greenland halibut (4 %), American plaice (4 %), cod (3 %) and <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> (3 %). 3) In Divisions 3 NO with demersal 130 mm mesh size at depth less than 200 meters. This is a mix fishery with different catch composition in Div. 3 N (56 % American plaice, 26 % yellowtail flounder, 10 % cod and 6 % skates) than in Div. 3 O (57 % redfish, 14 % American plaice, 12 % skates and 7 % <b>witch</b> <b>flounder).</b> 4) In Divisions 3 NO with 280 mm mesh size at less than 200 meters depth. The target species was the skates (63 %) with American plaice (19 %), yellowtail flounder (10 %) and cod (6 %) as main by-catch species. 5) In Division 3 LM with 40 mm mesh size at depth between 300 - 500 meters. The target species of this fishery was the shrimp with 98 % of the catches and only a 2 % of redfish as by-catch. 6) In Division 3 M at depth between 150 - 550 meters targeting cod with 130 mm mesh size gear. The target species of this fishery was cod (92 %) and the most important species in the by catch was redfish (7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies had}} {{identified}} novel antimicrobial peptides derived from <b>witch</b> <b>flounder.</b> In this work, we extended {{the search for}} the activity of peptide that showed antibacterial activity on clinically isolated bacterial cells and bacterial biofilm. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained from otitis media and cholelithiasis patients, while Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from otitis media patients. We found that synthetic peptide NRC- 16 displays antimicrobial activity and is not sensitive to salt during its bactericidal activity. Interestingly, this peptide also led to significant inhibition of biofilm formation at a concentration of 4 – 16 μM. NRC- 16 peptide is able to block biofilm formation at concentrations just above its minimum inhibitory concentration while conventional antibiotics did not inhibit the biofilm formation except ciprofloxacin and piperacillin. It did not cause significant lysis of human RBC, and is not cytotoxic to HaCaT cells and RAW 264. 7 cells, thereby indicating its selective antimicrobial activity. In addition, the peptide’s binding and permeation activities were assessed by tryptophan fluorescence, calcein leakage and circular dichroism using model mammalian membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC/cholesterol (CH) and PC/sphingomyelin (SM).

40|$|Exploratory Statistical Catch-at-Age {{assessments}} of the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank <b>witch</b> <b>flounder</b> stock indicate possibly unrealistically high q values (in the range of 3 - 5) for surveys, suggesting substantial herding by the net. If q is forced to be lower, the primary lack of fit that arises originates from the larger numbers of 11 + fish predicted compared to observed for the spring survey. All of treating the Albatross and Bigelow abundance index series as independent, including LPUE data, and forcing a lower value for q suggest the resource at present to be larger and of better status relative to pristine. Even if both the first two of these factors are incorporated, however, a strong retrospective pattern remains. During the meeting, a further base case run was developed to mimic the specifications agreed for the ASAP base case run as closely as possible, and some sensitivities to that also run. Of interest is that for {{a combination of the}} sensitivity factors (allowing selectivity doming, including LPUE data and downweighting the proportions-at-age data) the retrospective pattern is considerably reduced (especially for spawning biomass), the survey indices are fit better, and values of q drop, approaching 3...|$|E
