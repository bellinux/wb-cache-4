500|$|Andrew Davies, the screenwriter who adapted Pride and Prejudice for the BBC, was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} script for Northanger Abbey. He had previously written an adaptation of the novel for Weekend Television in 1998.

Davies told The Daily Telegraph's Hugh Davies that Northanger Abbey was much more straightforward to adapt than Pride and Prejudice, which was [...] "quite a fiendish bit of compression". The reporter explained, [...] "A young heroine thinks she has stumbled across a Gothic conspiracy of murder and concealed corpses. In fact, the true crimes are those of psychological cruelty and selfishness. Davies said {{that part of the}} back story <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> heroine read the 1764 best-seller The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, which he uses to fill Catherine's head with the expectation of unspeakable secrets in the Abbey."
