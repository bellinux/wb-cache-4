5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C {{for a few}} minutes results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000°C.|$|E
5|$|The DMT {{group is}} removed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of an acid, such as 2% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or 3% dichloroacetic acid (DCA), in an inert solvent (dichloromethane or toluene).

5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} simple {{modification}} of a well-known Random Walk algorithm for solving the Satisfiability problem and analyze its performance on random CNFs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> planted <b>solution.</b> We rigorously {{prove that the}} new algorithm solves the Full CNF with high probability, and for random CNFs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> planted <b>solution</b> of high density finds an assignment that differs from the planted in only ε-fraction of variables. In the experiments the algorithm solves random CNFs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> planted <b>solution</b> of any density. ...|$|R
5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, as well as <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2.

25|$|Hand washing {{with soap}} and water is an {{effective}} method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% ethanol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope.

Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E

25|$|By {{varying the}} {{apparatus}} and catalyst loading, Shirakawa and coworkers {{were able to}} synthesize polyacetylene as thin films, rather than insoluble black powders. They obtained these films by coating {{the walls of a}} reaction flask under inert conditions <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst and adding gaseous acetylene, resulting in immediate formation of a film. Enkelmann and coworkers further improved polyacetylene synthesis by changing the catalyst to a CoNO3/NaBH4 system, which was stable to both oxygen and water.|$|E
