5|$|The archbishop's next {{opponent}} was {{the papal}} legate {{of the new}} Pope Honorius II, Cardinal John of Crema, who arrived in England in 1125. A compromise between York and Canterbury was negotiated, which involved Canterbury allowing York {{the supervision of the}} dioceses of Bangor, Chester, and St Aspah in return for Thurstan's verbal submission and the <b>written</b> <b>submission</b> of his successors. The pope, however, rejected the agreement, likely because he wished to preserve his own primacy, and substituted his own. The papal solution was that Honorius would appoint William papal legate in England and Scotland, which was done in 1126, giving William the position over York, but it was dependent on the will of the pope, and would lapse on the pope's death. The arrangement merely postponed the problem however, as neither Thurstan nor William renounced their claims. That Christmas, at a royal court, Thurstan unsuccessfully attempted to claim the right to ceremonially crown the king as well as have his episcopal cross carried before him in Canterbury's province. As a result of his lengthy dispute with Thurstan, William travelled to Rome more frequently than any bishop before him except for Wilfrid in the 7th century.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} final appellate courts internationally, {{there is no}} {{automatic}} right of appeal to the Supreme Court of New Zealand. All appeals are first required to apply to the Court for leave to appeal. This is granted or declined based on a number of factors listed in the Supreme Court Act, with the overarching principle being that it must be necessary in the interests of justice for the Court to hear the appeal. Leave applications are normally determined by any two judges of the court based on the <b>written</b> <b>submission</b> of the parties without an oral hearing; however, the judges hearing the application can decide to hold an oral hearing if they wish.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{declared}} {{his intention to}} stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his <b>written</b> <b>submission</b> to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment {{in the light of}} Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years [...] "the one idea of my life has been to make myself thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in my power to facilitate the study of its literature." [...] He assured voters that, if elected, [...] "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion. Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit [...] "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his [...] "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" [...] when compared to Müller's [...] "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.|$|E

40|$|<b>Written</b> <b>submissions</b> or {{comments}} as {{a response}} on an EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) rank {{as one of the}} most common forms of public participation. Within public participation research there appears to be an international dearth of knowledge concerning such <b>written</b> <b>submissions.</b> The possible impact of such responses on an EIS is - with few exceptions - seldom put in focus. The aim in the present brief communication is to study one aspect of public participation within transport infrastructure planning, namely the role of <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> sent to the applicant by individuals, Non-governmental organisations, companies and authorities. By comparing 34 <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> with road planning documents (including EIS) the impact of the public views has been analysed in a south Swedish case study. At a time when the new Environmental Code only had been in force for less than one year, it does not appear as if the Road Administration's regional office accepted most of the <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> just to show that the new regulation concerning participation had a direct impact on the planning. Sweden's long tradition of public access to official documents may explain why <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> as one aspect of public participation worked well in the E 18 highway planning process, because civil servants have long been taught to promptly furnish information and guidance, as well as to giving advice and other assistance to individuals in matters concerning an authority's activity. This study shows, then, that - if properly managed by the developer's street-level staff - the use of <b>written</b> <b>submissions</b> may improve the EIS from a stakeholder perspective and also make the stakeholders feel they are being taken seriously.
