40|$|Abstract: This article aims the {{evaluation}} of a protective window, {{which is part of}} a LASER welding system. This component is used in automotive body-in-white (BIW) LASER welding processes to protect other high value optic components against <b>weld</b> <b>spatters,</b> metallic vapors and smoke. The referring concern to optimize its use is related to the fact of being a component whose continuous substitution in some levels of work volume brings high costs to the process. If its replacement, by means of one proposed index of degradation will not be well defined, will cause breaks in the process flow, either causing demerit to the product quality or increasing the final cost of the product because of its excessively replacements. However, even though the constant increase of the employment of such a componen, its production on a large scale with supply for multiple manufacturers is still a distant fact. It continues being made for few specialized companies around the world hindering a significant reduction on the unitary cost. The importance of this article becomes evident in this case because it not only demonstrates the viability in the reusing of the protective windows, but also defines a way to determine the maximization for using such component without affect the final product quality.

The development of the weld monitor took into account the constraints and operating environment of the factory floor in addition to monitoring needs for quality assurance. The non-intrusive weld monitor is rugged and simple to use, does not require power to operate, is <b>weld</b> <b>spatter</b> protected and low cost. This process monitor is available as a stand-alone monitor with laser pointing suitable as an inexpensive addition to an existing processing system. For constrained configurations, the monitor can be easily integrated into an existing optic module resulting in through-the-optic viewing. The stand-alone monitor's flexibility is suitable for test and evaluation or research and development applications where flexibility in pointing or change in optics is required. A photograph of the monitor is shown in Figure 1. The reproducibility of the monitor's signal output {{will depend on the}} accuracy and repeatability in aiming. Laser aiming that comes with the monitor offers the best overall accuracy and ease. Costs can be reduced further with conventional gunsights with loss in accuracy and ease. The reproducibility of the monitor's output will depend on the field of view, the aiming method and the capability to manually aim and lock in position. In practice, even with laser aiming, the accuracy will be compromised by the mechanical system used to allow for aiming adjustments. 10 to 20 % changes may be result from using a flexible connector. Improved reproducibility can be obtained at the expense of time taken to aim accurately. The integrated version of the monitor is recommended for process operations. This integrated monitor is available as an option on Spawr Industries reflective optics for high power laser beams or as a modification to the user's beam delivery optics. The advantage of the integrated design is that the monitor is pre-aimed and does not suffer from bumping and space constraints. Excellent reproducibility of the data can then be obtained. Both versions of the monitor are supplied with a BNC connector for detecting the voltage output of the sensor. The standard sensor is optimized for the monitoring of ferrous or steel alloys and other metals that have similar properties. Sensitivity to changes in penetration of < 0. 05 mm can be expected. Monitoring of aluminum alloys will require a different sensor that is available as an option.

In this respect, the influence of such cracks on the fatigue strength particularly of modern high-strength austenitic steels is not sufficiently well-known at present. The influence of welding cracks with various positions and formations was therefore investigated within the framework of this paper. In this case, the analysis of the standardised stiffness courses of specimens and the comparison of the numbers of failure stress cycles served to prove that the surface cracks produced without any spatter in the centre, interfacial region and peripheral region of the weld nugget do not have any negative influence on the fatigue strength of the high-strength austenitic material investigated here. Specimens which were manufactured with <b>welding</b> <b>spatter</b> and exhibit cracks in the peripheral region show considerably higher numbers of failure stress cycles than crack-free reference specimens...|$|R

The pre-eruption figure shows a pond {{at the bottom of}} the crater surrounded by ring-fault structures of the crater’s hanging wall. We investigated blocks from these ring-fault areas in 2005, and found that they represent <b>welded</b> <b>spatters.</b> Therefore, we suggest that before the 2011 eruption there was no lava filling the crater. On the other hand, Fig. 1 (C) (mid-eruption) shows that the crater is filled by lava about 130 meters thick with surface wrinkle structures. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) inter-ferometric measurements indicate that the volume of lava is about 1.5 × 107 m 3, with the volume staying within the measurement uncertainty (~ 0.1 × 107 m 3) for more than 1 year (Ozawa, 2011). Thus, the lava filling the crater did not show evidence of drain-back. However, lava did drain back after an andesitic eruption of Mt.

40|$|Hyperbaric Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is an {{important}} technology for repair welding of deep sea pipelines and linking of existing pipeline networks to newer ones through tie-ins and hot-tap welding. With increasing water depth the process becomes susceptible to hydrogen assisted cracking due to the very fast cooling rate of the weld caused by higher habitat gas density and resulting higher thermal diffusivity. Maintaining sufficient heat in the welding zone is vital to avoid a potential cracking tendency especially as moisture pick-up {{may be difficult to}} avoid during hyperbaric welding operations. In addition to this, hyperbaric GMAW has a limitation of low heat input because it is operated at a short arc length or dip transfer mode to avoid process instability at high pressure. Also, the short arc length generates <b>weld</b> <b>spatter</b> that may affect weld quality. The research presented in this thesis, investigated the use of an industrial laser in conduction mode for the purpose of providing significant additional heat input to control the weld thermal cycles of GMAW. Advanced GMAW power sources such as the Fronius Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) and EWM ColdArc have also been investigated for reduced <b>weld</b> <b>spatter</b> generation. Studies were conducted to investigate the weld pool thermal cycles and resulting metallurgical phase formation in hyperbaric GMAW at different pressures ranging from 1 bar to 200 bar. This was followed by welding trials at one atmosphere to compare the process characteristics of traditional dip transfer GMAW with some advanced GMAW power sources such as CMT and ColdArc. The main experimental trials to investigate a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process were performed at one atmosphere condition. A thermal model was developed using Abaqus software to predict the weld metal and heat affected zone thermal cycle in a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process at one atmosphere and under high ambient pressures. Finally, investigation was carried out to evaluate the benefit of the laser assisted process in lowering diffusible hydrogen content from the weld metal. The hyperbaric GMAW experimental results showed that the weld pool cooling rate increases with pressure due to higher chamber gas density and resulting thermal diffusivity. But this effect is not prominent for thicker plates. Therefore, it was concluded that heat conduction through the steel thickness dominates convective losses to the chamber gas environment. It was also shown that the welding arc shrinks as pressure increases in order to minimise energy loss to the environment. This defined the weld bead profile; although it was found that beyond 100 bar pressure the weld penetration depth remained effectively unchanged. Apart from the hardness of the weld made at 1 bar, there was little difference between those at 18, 100 and 200 bar. However, all of the welds show hardness peaks greater than 350 HV 10 recommended for offshore structures. It was observed that CMT produced the lowest <b>weld</b> <b>spatter</b> compared to the traditional GMAW and ColdArc. However, this advantage is constrained to low wire feed speed (3 to 5 m/min) beyond which it becomes relatively unstable. For the laser assisted GMAW (CMT) trials, it was shown that the laser serves as a spatially resolved heat source, reheating the weld bead and reducing the cooling rate. For the laser parameters investigated, over 200 % reduction of cooling rate could be achieved when compared with GMAW alone. It was also demonstrated that the additional laser thermal input will extend the weld residence time at high temperature (over 300 °C). This will prolong the weld cooling time such that dissolved hydrogen can diffuse out before it comes to room temperature. The laser was shown to significantly reduce the weld peak hardness from about 420 HV 0. 5 to values below 350 HV 0. 5, which will be beneficial for hyperbaric welding. The model prediction of the weld thermal cycles was in good agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, it could be used to predict the weld metal and HAZ cooling rate of a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process although the model would need to be calibrated for higher pressure data. It was also demonstrated that additional laser heat can reduce the weld hydrogen content to acceptable limits of 5 ml/ 100 g of weld metal even for high moisture content in the welding environment. In conclusion, the addition of laser heating to GMAW will reduce the weld cooling rate, extend the weld pool cooling time, and expel diffusible weld hydrogen. All of these would be immensely beneficial in terms of improving the quality and reliability of structures fabricated through hyperbaric GMAW...|$|E

To obtain an 'optimum balance' between globular and spray transfer will thus be beneficial for the welding of thin plates with high production rates, as well as pro;iding an accurate boundary zone between these two modes of metal transfer for industrial and research purposes. Based on the work performed by Haidar and Lowke [151, [24 J with respect to the calculation of the transition current between globular- and spray metal transfer in MIG welding, the influence of different shielding gas mixtures on the transition current were studied. The effects of oxygen and carbon dioxide additions to argon shielding gas were studied to verifY the vital importance of including the shielding gas effects on the transition current v. ithin the mathematical formulation of [24 J.

The studied deposit, crops out along the flanks of Sciara del Fuoco and, from base to top, consists of: (1) a layer of HP and LP ash and lapilli; (2) an unwelded layer of coarse HP lapilli and flattened dark scoriae; (3) weakly <b>welded</b> <b>spatter</b> made up of dense HP pyroclasts at the base, overlain by strongly vesicular LP clasts. The textural and chemical zoning of minerals and the glass chemistry of the LP products record repeated mafic recharge events, mixing with an old mushy body and episodes of rapid crystallization due to sudden degassing. Collapse of a foam layer originated by deep degassing probably triggered this large-scale, spatter-forming paroxysm.

Historical accounts and field evidence indicate, however, that even larger paroxysms, in terms of volume, dispersal of products and intensity of explosive phenomena, occurred in the recent past. During these paroxysms incipiently <b>welded</b> <b>spatter</b> deposits mantled {{the north and south}} rims of the Sciara del Fuoco down to low elevations, extending much farther than the similar deposits from recent observed events (5 April 2003 and 15 March 2007).

Analysis of texture and deposit components reveals that the early phases of the two eruptions were driven by distinctly different eruptive dynamics.

40|$|The small- to moderate-volume, Quaternary, Siwi {{pyroclastic}} sequence was erupted during {{formation of}} a 4 km-wide caldera on the eastern margin of Tanna, an island arc volcano in southern Vanuatu. This high-potassium, andesitic eruption followed a period of effusive basaltic andesite volcanism and represents the most felsic magma erupted from the volcano. The sequence is up to 13 m thick and can be traced in near-continuous outcrop over 11 km. Facies grade laterally from lithic-rich, partly <b>welded</b> <b>spatter</b> agglomerate along the caldera rim to two medial, pumiceous, non-welded ignimbrites that are separated by a layer of lithic-rich, spatter agglomerate. Juvenile clasts comprise {{a wide range of}} densities and grain sizes. They vary between black, incipiently vesicular, highly elongate spatter clasts that have breadcrusted pumiceous rinds and reach several metres across to silky, grey pumice lapilli. The pumice lapilli range from highly vesicular clasts with tube or coalesced spherical vesicles to denser finely vesicular clasts that include lithic fragments. Textural and lithofacies characteristics of the Siwi pyroclastic sequence suggest that {{the first phase of the}} eruption produced a base surge deposit and spatter-poor pumiceous ignimbrite. A voluminous eruption of spatter and lithic pyroclasts coincided with a relatively deep withdrawal of magma presumably driven by a catastrophic collapse of the magma chamber roof. During this phase, spatter clasts rapidly accumulated in the proximal zone largely as fallout, creating a variably welded and lithicrich agglomerate. This phase was followed by the eruption of moderately to highly vesiculated magma that generated the most widespread, upper pumiceous ignimbrite. The combination of spatter and pumice in pyroclastic deposits from a single eruption appears to be related to highly explosive, magmatic eruptions involving low-viscosity magmas. The combination also indicates the coexistence of a spatter fountain and explosive eruption plume for much of the eruption...|$|R

For untroubled operation of the optical components also stronger soiling/impurification (dust and deposition of weld fume particles) should be avoided, if possible. Exchangeable protective glasses and safety screens in the form of compressed air curtains provide a remedy. The quality of the surface which is to be measured has substantial influence on the measuring result. If the surface is strongly reflecting, unwanted reflection and faulty measurements may occur, lustreless surfaces are less difficult. Ever-changing surface qualities also lead to problems.Since optical systems are equipped with semiconductor detectors and comprehensive electronics, it is most important to pay attention to safe electro-magnetic screening. This applies to the sensor, the image processing unit and the connecting cables thereof. Sensor systems with active laser illumination are reacting particularly sensitive to strong temperature fluctuations since the emitted light wavelength of the used laser diodes depends on the temperature of the laser. If the ambient temperature and thus the wavelength of the active illumination are changing, the light is no longer capable to penetrate through the narrow-band optical filter to the photodetector. Therefore, appropriate screening against the welding process or the cooling of the sensor head is required. Depending on the applied laser power, particular caution must be taken when sensors with active illumination are applied. The wavelength of the applied systems are often in the field of vision, which means the classification into the hazard classes 3A and 3B. The respective accident prevention regulations must be strictly adhered to.The application of optical sensors demands the consideration of following points: ...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{laser welding}} of {{stainless}} steel was studied for different joint configurations and gaps. The higher focusing capability of fiber lasers compared to traditional Nd:YAG and CO 2 lasers creates different, usually smaller, keyhole and melt pool geometries. These geometrical aspects, accompanied by a different laser energy redistribution, are essential for the weld pool dynamics and the resulting joint, with or without defects. Typical defects identified during fiber laser <b>welding</b> were <b>spatter,</b> humping, or lack of material at the top or root. High-speed imaging enables observation of the geometry and motions of the melt pool surface and keyhole during welding. This is illuminated by an additional diode laser permitting spectral filtering and also the metal vapor dynamics can be visualized. Mathematical modeling provides the possibility to estimate and study additional phenomena {{that are difficult to}} measure, such as effects inside the melt volume or the impact of surface tension forces on dynamic melt motion. For recorded melt surface motion images, in particular, the corresponding surface tension forces and other mechanisms can be estimated by cooperative complementary modeling, enabling to draw conclusions. This advanced method was carried out for the different joint and defect cases studied, resulting in an illustrated theoretical description of the observed physical phenomena.

40|$|Typical {{changes in}} {{shielding}} gas flow restrictions caused by <b>spatter</b> in the <b>welding</b> gun nozzle, <b>spatter</b> clogging {{some of the}} welding gun gas diffuser ports, bends in the welding cable, or de-bris in the welding gun gas hose passages can be automatically compensated to maintain a preset flow. From the time the GMAW process was introduced, typical shielding gas flow sys-tems utilize a minimum pressure of 170 kPa (25 lb/in. 2) as the output of regulator/flowmeters and flow gauge regulators for cylinder use or in pipeline gas supply. This pressure provides au-tomatic flow compensation for the inevitable gas restrictions that occur in production. Automatic Gas Flow Control Self-compensating or automatic flow control is achieved by employing a minimum gas delivery pressure upstream of the shielding gas control orifice or valve.

40|$|Guffey Butte is a basaltic maar and tuff cone {{complex that}} was formed about one {{million years ago}} near the southwestern margin of the western Snake River Plain. Its {{evolution}} was characterized by two distinctly similar, yet non-synchronous, sequences of events. The result of these events is a single complex volcanic structure comprised of deposits from two separate vent systems. The stratigraphy in both parts of the volcano reflect one or more 2 ̆ 2 drying out 2 ̆ 2 cycles in which the amount of external water that interacted with the magma was gradually reduced. The two vent complexes differ from {{one another in the}} chemical compositions of their magmas, the nature of their pyroclastic deposits, and the overall morphology of their cones and craters. The earlier of the Guffey Butte vent systems (GBV 1) produced a maar-tuff ring characterized by thick deposits of planar and dune bedded pyroclastic surge deposits. Juvenile ash in GBV 1 deposits is commonly vesicular (Type 2 ash shards of Woheltz, 1983). GBV 1 basalts are slightly more mafic than those in the younger complex; however, they also appear to have assimilated slightly greater amounts of shallow crustal rocks. The average composition of plagioclase phenocrysts in GBV 1 basalts is about AnS 7. The younger Guffey Butte vent system (GBV 2) produced a tuff cone composed largely of massive, unbedded tuffs containing at least two units of <b>welded</b> <b>spatter.</b> Juvenile ash in GBV 2 deposits consists mainly of blocky glass shards (Type 1 shards of Woheltz, 1983). GBV 2 basalts are slightly more differentiated than those of GBV 1 and plagioclase phenocrysts have average compositions of An 47. The relative ages to the two vent systems were determined in part by the fact that GBV 2 pyroclastic deposits contain accidental fragments having the ash morphology characteristics and chemical and mineralogical compositions of GBV 1 basalts. In contrast, no material typical of GBV 2 was found in the deposits produced by the GBV 1 vent. The two vent systems at Guffey Butte may have produced different types of structures and deposits because the physical condition of the stratigraphy through which they erupted was different. The pre-Guffey Butte stratigraphy consists of fluvial-lacustrine sediments and a few basaltic lava flows, at least one of which is up to 33 m thick. The GBV 1 magma may have become stalled beneath one of these flows, resulting in a buildup of pressure and a large highly energetic explosion. The maar-tuff cone morphology, dominance of surge deposits, vesicular shards, and crustal assimilation is consistent with this scenario. The GBV 2 magmas encountered no significant barrier so they erupted less explosively, producing a tuff cone. The Type 1 shards and lower level of contamination associated with these basalts suggests a more rapid rise and greater access to ground water. The evolution of Guffey Butte therefore supports models for hydrovolcanism that emphasize the nature of the stratigraphy through which magmas rise as well as the relative mixing proportions of water and magma...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{concerns}} work environmental {{risks that}} {{are a part of}} the modern steel industry. The result is a tool that can be used for identifying unwanted risks, which usually are hard to identify. The content of the tool is based on results from extensive literature studies, statistical analyses and qualitative in-depth interviews with the persons that are exposed for the risks on a daily basis. The master thesis project was conducted during the spring of 2015 as a final project of the civil engineering program Technical design at Luleå University of Technology. Ovako AB was the outsourcer and the studies were carried out on their production plant in Hällefors. The production in Hällefors included the making of hot rolled, peeled and ground bar and wire and also the manufacturing of pre-components from bars. The plant in Hällefors was certified with ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001 and TS 16949. The statistical analyses showed that crushing injuries and other soft tissue injuries were the most common type of injuries at the production plant in Hällefors during the time period 1 / 1 2014 – 28 / 4 2015. The second most common type of injuries was cutting injuries, sprains and muscle strains. During the same time period the most frequently reported reasons for an injury or a close call were getting hit by a flying or a falling object. The second most common reason was getting stuck or crushed between objects. The qualitative in-depth interviews pointed out that crushing injuries, cutting injuries, injuries from falls, burns and repetitive strain injuries were the most common injury types at the production plant in Hällefors. The interviewees described that tangled bundles, crooked bars, short bars, sharp edges on cut bars, work up on machines and loading tables, slippery surfaces, <b>welding</b> <b>spatters</b> and the manoeuvring of overhead cranes and vehicles are the biggest reasons why accidents occurs. The tool has the form of a checklist and the content is, based on the results from the study, divided in five different areas; Physical work environment, Psychological work environment, Ergonomics and work methods, Technical facilities and hand-held tools and at last Machines, vehicles and automation. The main part of the questions focuses on the risks with manual lifting and manual handling, but physical environmental factors and the functionality of machines also stands for a big part. The recommendation to Ovako is to implement the risk identifying tool at their unit in Hällefors and continue the development of the content. There are many positive sides with a safe work environment and good working conditions. Wellbeing of the employees, financial benefits for the company and stronger competitive forces are just some of these. The result of this master thesis project are applicable for other type of businesses in the industry sector. However, the tool needs to be optimized based on the specific work conditions to obtain optimal benefits. Safety needs priority!Validerat; 20160814 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
