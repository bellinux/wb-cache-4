5|$|Ironically, Bawdsey <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> by the Germans for {{the entire}} war, while St Athan was {{attacked}} by a Junkers Ju 88 only weeks after the team arrived. The single bomb struck the runway directly, but failed to explode.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, a {{negligible}} set {{is a set}} that is small enough that it can <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> for some purpose.As common examples, finite sets can <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> when studying the limit of a sequence, and null sets can <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> when studying the integral of a measurable function.|$|R

5|$|Joseph Brittan's health {{declined}} during 1867. Of distress for {{the family}} were the financial affairs, with various debts that only Joseph knew about.

5|$|Josephine {{campaigned for}} women's rights, {{including}} the right to the vote and to have a better education. In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the Reform Bill to widen the franchise to include women. The petition, which was supported by the MP and philosopher John Stuart Mill, <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> and the bill became law.|$|E
5|$|After the {{operation}} closed, {{at the end}} of June 1944, the threat of invasion from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for Operation Ferdinand. The invasion story was replaced with a supposed Allied plan to increase French resistance in the Bordeaux region to tie up German forces. Most of Ironside II <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> by the Germans, whose interest had turned away from the region.|$|E
5000|$|The cloture {{petition}} <b>is</b> <b>ignored</b> for {{one full}} day {{during which the}} Senate is sitting (called a [...] "Legislative Day").

5|$|After {{the severe}} {{injuries}} sustained by Vince on the June 23, 3-hour edition of Raw, Shane appeared requesting for the Raw Superstars to stand together during {{what was a}} 'turbulent time'. Shane's plea <b>was</b> <b>ignored,</b> and subsequently, {{for the next two}} weeks, McMahon and Shane urged the superstars to show solidarity. The following week, Shane announced Mike Adamle as their choice to be the new Raw General Manager.|$|E
5|$|Another {{treaty that}} fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, {{negotiated}} in {{settlement of the}} Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> by the Senate during {{the remainder of the}} President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.|$|E
5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and <b>was</b> <b>ignored,</b> and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cities were}} used and some <b>were</b> <b>ignored.</b> Close {{to the main}} lines of {{transportation}} the cities grew, while towns that <b>were</b> <b>ignored</b> by transportation and administration in effect disappeared, as for example Kukawa and Dahomey.|$|R

5|$|By his writing, Espejo {{wanted to}} educate the people and to awaken a rebellious spirit in them. He embraced {{equality}} between Indians and criollos, an ideal that <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> during the future processes of independence. He also favored women's rights but did not really develop these ideas. He had an advanced understanding of science, considering {{the circumstances in which}} he lived. He never traveled abroad but nonetheless understood the relation between microorganisms and the spreading of disease.|$|E
5|$|During the strike-shortened 1982 season, {{only nine}} regular season games were played, and a {{modified}} playoff format was instituted. Divisional play <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> (there were some cases where division rivals had both games {{wiped out by}} the strike, although each division ultimately sent at least one team to the playoffs), and the top eight teams from each conference (based on W-L-T record) were advanced to the playoffs. As a result, this became {{the first time that}} teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs: the 4–5 Cleveland Browns and the 4–5 Detroit Lions.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} losses {{from the late}} 1990s onwards, the {{government}} offered 40percent of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004, hoping a buyer would take over {{the management of the}} carrier. However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6million in consultancy fees with no positive results.|$|E

5000|$|A good interpretive theory clarifies people's values. SCT {{highlights}} {{the values of}} rhetorical community by creating a common ground, meeting of minds and empathic communication. This theory does not explain what happens when someone that <b>is</b> <b>ignored</b> <b>is</b> left out or excluded from the group because people don't mesh well when they <b>are</b> <b>ignored.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1969 {{the novel}} was adapted into the sixth {{film in the}} Eon Productions series. It starred George Lazenby in his only {{appearance}} of the Bond role. With the films being produced in a different order to the books, the continuity of storylines was broken and the films altered accordingly. Even so, the character of Blofeld was present in the previous film, You Only Live Twice, and he and Bond had met: this previous meeting <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> for the plot of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes {{revisited}} the Jevons paradox for {{the case}} of society's energy use. Brookes, then {{chief economist at the}} UK Atomic Energy Authority, argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the California Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1815, {{four days}} after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette {{arranged}} for the former emperor's passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended his days {{on the island of}} Saint Helena. The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> by the victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over La Grange as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, a private citizen again.|$|E

5|$|Stanley gained {{national}} notoriety for {{his actions}} against U.S. Steel. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for {{an investigation of the}} company, but it died in the House Rules Committee. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but <b>was</b> <b>ignored</b> by President William Howard Taft. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost control of the house in the 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. House Speaker Champ Clark appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970. This time the measure made it through both houses of Congress and became law on 22 December.
