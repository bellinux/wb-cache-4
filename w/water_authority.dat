Twenty-five minor watercourses were added to the Authority's jurisdiction in 1973. Reorganisation in 1974 under the Water Act 1973 brought the Avon catchment into a new regional body, the Wessex <b>Water</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was transferred}} to Welsh Water in 1973 when the Welsh <b>Water</b> <b>Authority</b> was formed, and it supplied water until the mid-1970s. In 1996 Welsh Water's holding company was renamed as Hyder plc and the group acquired South Wales Electricity plc. After Hyder's share price collapsed in 1999 and 2000, the Hyder Group was sold to WPD on terms recommended by the Hyder Board after a competitive and hostile takeover battle. WPD is the American-owned electricity distribution network operator for South West England and South and West Wales.|$|E

50|$|The {{treatment}} {{and disposal of}} sewage was also removed from the local authorities and given to the regional <b>water</b> <b>authorities.</b> The Working Party on Sewage Disposal, which reported in 1970, had suggested that there were over 3000 treatment plants which were producing sub-standard effluent discharges. Over many years there had been little incentive {{to improve the quality}} of treatment, but the <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> were given the task. Some 1,400 sewage authorities were divided among the ten <b>water</b> <b>authorities,</b> as it was recognised that the discharge of treated effluent was a major element in the total hydrologic system.|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis, {{after a brief}} {{introductory}} historical exposé {{of water}} use (not only) in our territory and related sources of law focuses on decision making and processes in water use in contemporary Czech legislation.

5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the <b>Water</b> <b>Authority</b> Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the towpath to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about the legality of the action, and subsequently two further diversions were made, at Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on the waterway until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for the waterway as a drainage channel passed to the Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and some work was carried out to maintain the integrity of the waterway. These responsibilities later passed to the Southern <b>Water</b> <b>Authority,</b> and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern <b>Water</b> <b>Authority</b> resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E

Prior to privatisation, the Regional <b>Water</b> <b>Authorities</b> held an agreement whereby the various English Local Authorities were responsible as agents to the <b>Water</b> <b>Authorities</b> for the provision and maintenance of sewerage facilities within their districts. These agency agreements were transferred to the PLCs but these could be subject to far reaching review in the future.

5|$|The City of Lock Haven {{owns the}} {{reservoirs}} and water distribution system for Wayne Township, Castanea Township, and the city. Water is treated at the Central Clinton County Water Filtration Authority Plant in Wayne Township before distribution. The city also provides {{water to the}} Suburban Lock Haven <b>Water</b> <b>Authority,</b> which distributes it to surrounding communities. Lock Haven operates a sewage treatment plant for waste water, industrial waste, and trucked sewage {{from the city and}} eight upstream municipalities: Bald Eagle Township, Castanea, Flemington, Lamar, Mill Hall, Porter Township, Woodward Township, and Walker Township in Centre County. Storm water runoff from within the city is transported by city-owned storm sewers. Curbside pickup of household garbage is provided by a variety of local haulers licensed by the city; recyclables are picked up once every two weeks. The Clinton County Solid Waste Authority owns and operates the Wayne Township Landfill, which serves Lock Haven.|$|E

40|$|The Dutch water {{management}} system is {{confronted with a}} lack of awareness among citizens and further faces the consequences of climate change and urbanisation. New governance structures with high levels of citizen participation are required to be fit for the future. An implementation of participation could be citizen science, which is rather unexplored in Dutch water resource management. The thesis’ objective was to develop practical guidelines for practitioners at Dutch <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> on ‘how to set up a citizen science project’. To get to this objective several research methods and steps were taken. This thesis provides an answer to how Dutch <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> could incorporate citizen science in their activities, by focussing on the driving forces of both citizens and <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> whether to engage in citizen science projects mediated by a mobile crowd sensing device. A literature review and case study were used to identify key success factors for citizen science projects. A survey, based on the Self-Determination Theory, was used to identify citizen motivations in water quality monitoring. Using a Q methodological approach three viewpoints on citizen science at <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> were identified. Additionally it is investigated what role modern technology, such as mobile sensing, could play in designing a citizen science project using a Technology Acceptance Model. The developed guidelines answer how citizen science could be implemented at Dutch <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> to increase citizens’ water awareness and to adopt governance structures with higher levels of citizen participation.

40|$|In recent years, {{governmental}} institutes {{have started}} to use citizen science {{as a form of}} public participation. The Dutch <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> are among them. They face pressure on the water governance system and a water awareness gap among the general public, and consider citizen science a possible solution. The reasons for practitioners to engage in citizen science, and in particular those of government practitioners, have seldom been studied. This article aims to pinpoint the various viewpoints of practitioners at Dutch regional <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> on citizen science. A Q-methodological approach was used because it allows for exploration of viewpoints and statistical analysis using a small sample size. Practitioners (33) at eight different <b>water</b> <b>authorities</b> ranked 46 statements from agree to disagree. Three viewpoints were identified with a total explained variance of 67  %. Viewpoint A considers citizen science a potential solution that can serve several purposes, thereby encouraging citizen participation in data collection and analysis. Viewpoint B considers citizen science a method for additional, illustrative data. Viewpoint C views citizen science primarily as a means of education. These viewpoints show water practitioners in the Netherlands are willing to embrace citizen science at <b>water</b> <b>authorities,</b> although there is no support for higher levels of citizen engagement.
