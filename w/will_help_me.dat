6000|$|... 'I <b>will.</b> So <b>help</b> <b>me</b> God!' There {{was a pause}} of a {{few seconds}} which seemed an interminable time. Then in a feebler voice Squire Norman spoke again: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Merciful God! to {{meet you}} here," [...] she faltered.

60|$|CURTIS--[With nervous vehemence.] I don't {{want your}} help. You <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> most by keeping silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} may be of great use to me, my dear, if you <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> The bishop has desired me to preach the next visitation sermon, and he wishes it to be {{on some of these}} subjects.

6000|$|... "It will be so, and {{it shall}} be so, my trusty friend," [...] replied Mowbray, cheerily, [...] "so you <b>will</b> but <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to the stock to trade with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{never spoke}} {{of it in}} words, Cissy," [...] he went on, [...] "but I think we understood. <b>Will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to leave the shadows alone? Will you be my wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heer, Adrian," [...] said Martin, [...] "you {{have the}} {{cross-bow}} and the bolts, and {{you used to}} be the best shot of all three of us; <b>will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to hold the causeway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to do}} you justice, Geoffrey--if you <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> {{by meeting}} me half-way. Our mother has {{told you about the}} will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The child shrugged her shoulders. [...] "Quien sabe. But Pedro (the vaquero) <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> now on {{my horse}} {{when he comes}} for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, thank you. Please don't {{speak of}} this; I'm used to bearing my {{troubles}} alone, and time <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{to do it}} cheerfully." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{said the}} Prince, 'If I {{come to your}} town, will you suffer me further to prosecute that which is in mine heart against mine enemies and yours?--yea, <b>will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in such undertakings?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'But {{you know}} of a place, and <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to it!' cried she, {{clapping}} her hands. 'Dear good Mr. Pendy, always a friend in need!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> {{will you}} not!' said Winifred, smiling, {{though she did}} not augur well from this opening scene. 'May I go soon to Albinia?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{an order}} from Pittsburgh I can't read very well," [...] said Richard. [...] "I'd be much obliged if you <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you consent? Thank you, dear Walter. Now, <b>will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{into your}} room, and I'll put two rolls of clothes to bed, that the captain may find his prisoners fast asleep to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mainwaring, with {{a sudden}} incomprehensible, but utterly irrepressible, resolution; [...] "but I'M 'a-marchin',' you know, and perhaps I must 'choose my true love now or never.' <b>Will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Macy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{said the}} Prince, 'If I {{come to your}} town, will you suffer me further to prosecute that which is in mine heart against mine enemies and yours, yea, <b>will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in such undertakings?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{wishing to}} get well <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> I shall not be long sick. This morning I had no reason and no {{strength}} to wish it." ...|$|E
60|$|If I should live, I shall write (I believe) better poems than 'The Seraphim;' which belief <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{to survive}} the {{condemnation}} heavy upon your lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know how}} I hamper you. But if you <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> Oh! I would work, I would study. I would do all I could to understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And when he died, {{she came}} and cried all the morning,' said Miss Fowler. 'This only {{makes me feel}} tired--terribly tired. <b>Will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to bed, please, Mary?--And I think I'd like the hot-water bottle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, sir, {{for this}} interview," [...] said his royal highness. [...] "You <b>will</b> not <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> but what I require will happen {{by some other}} means. It is necessary, and {{therefore}} it will occur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why did {{you come}} to that place in the accursed island? I am ruined by that journey. Yes, I am ruined. You <b>will</b> not <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to get a {{shilling}} from her--not even for my expenses." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} here," [...] he decided, [...] "which <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> very much. With your {{permission}} I will take this," [...] he added, selecting one at random.|$|E
6000|$|... "Spare me all remonstrances; I am not fit to bear them. My {{life has}} only one object now--the {{pursuing}} of this mystery to the end. <b>Will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me?</b> I am scarcely fit to act for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And ye, white men, <b>will</b> ye <b>help</b> <b>me?</b> What have I {{to offer}} you! The white stones! If I conquer {{and can find}} them, ye shall {{have as many as}} ye can carry hence. Will that suffice you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Vervain yawned. [...] "Well I can't think {{anything}} {{more about it}} to- night; I'm too stupid. But that's the way we shall do. <b>Will</b> you <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to bed, my dear? I shall be good for nothing to-morrow." ...|$|R
