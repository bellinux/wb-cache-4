By the winter of 1866-67, work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue. The cross section of a tunnel face was a 16 ft, 16 ft oval with an 11 ft vertical wall. Progress on the tunnel sped up to over 1.5 ft per day per face when they started using the newly invented nitroglycerin—manufactured near the tunnel. They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required 16 ft height after the four tunnel faces met, and made even faster progress. Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle.

40|$|The ship sailed on time at 0900 on Saturday the 11 th of September. This cruise was {{the first}} with the new {{computer}} system. While {{there had been some}} frantic preparation in {{the weeks leading up to}} the cruise some of the systems had not been fully tested. This was partly because of the near-impossibility of testing some of systems in port. However, basic navigation and the CTD system were working at this stage. The first CTD station was reached at 3 pm on the Saturday. CTD work continued smoothly for the first part of the 43 S section. Some problems were experienced with the ADCP software but this was going in an effective manner after about a day and a half. By this stage the ADCP, CTD, Trimble GPS, Navtrak GPS, thermosalinograph and sounder acquisition systems were all operational. The main problem with the computer system for the next week or so was an annoying problem with the winch monitor software (which provided the CTD pressure readout for the <b>winch</b> <b>driver)</b> hanging. This was exacerbated by the fact that the stand-alone PC versio...|$|E

50|$|Companies such as Dupré Logistics, that {{traditionally}} {{paid by the}} mile have switched to hourly wages. Regional and local drivers are usually paid by the hour. In 2011 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported the average heavy and over-the-road truck driver hourly wage to be $21.74 per hour. The BLS reported in 2012 that the median hourly wage was $18.37 per hour. In May 2013 the BLS reported a mean average hourly pay of from $12.21 (bottom 10%) to $28.66 per hour (top 10%).

40|$|A Zimbabwian {{designer}} {{has been}} testing a two-wheeled winch tractor on small farms {{for the last}} few years, with encouraging results. Small farmers in tropical regions with distinct dry and rainy seasons often experience great difficulty in field preparation. During the dry season, animal-powered tillage is usually not possible, as the animals become weak due to the shortage of green fodder and deep ploughing in dry soil usually needs a heavy tractor, which is too expensive. A small tractor incorporating a winch and anchor permits a light- weight machine to exert a high pull which can be used for deep ploughing during the dry season. Two people are required to operate a <b>winch</b> tractor, a <b>driver</b> and a plough controller. The plough is attached {{to the end of the}} winch chain which is wrapped around the winch drum on the traction unit. As the tractor driver propels his machine forward the winch chain unwinds from the drum and the plough remains at rest. When the chain is unwound from its drum the driver disengages the power from the wheels and engages it to the winch drum. The tension in the chain digs the tractor anchor into the ground and then, as the chain re winds onto its winch drum the plough is controlled by its operator as it is pulled up to the anchored tractor unit The two processes of driving the traction unit forward and then pulling the plough up to the anchored traction unit are repeated across the length of the field, until the machine is turned at the ends of the field. The area ploughed in a day is similar to when using animals and the fuel consumed is similar to that used when ploughed with a medium-sized tractor. The deep ploughing obtained from using the winch tractor permits the crop to be planted at the start of the rainy season and also encourages soil moisture conservation and plant root establishment.
