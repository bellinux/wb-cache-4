2500|$|On 29 May, Brigadier Slater {{met with}} {{military}} and civilian leaders in East Timor, and had secured the return of FDTL soldiers to their barracks. Australian Defence Minister Brendan Nelson {{also said that the}} East Timorese authorities should expand the rules of engagement of the international forces, to give them police powers to combat the gangs, saying that [...] "It's clear there needs to be political leadership as far as the policing is concerned... <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> policing strategy across Dili." [...] Also on 29 May, Australian Prime Minister John Howard rejected criticisms that Australian troops had not secured Dili quickly enough, saying that the crisis was possibly more dangerous than the violence following independence from Indonesia in 1999, and that [...] "We cannot have a situation around the world and particularly in our region where Australia is told to respect the independence of a country and that it's a bully boy if it seeks to express a view or to intervene, but when something goes wrong Australia is then criticised for not having, quote, intervened earlier." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Edward A. Gargan {{writing in}} November 1991 {{described}} Sharif's government as [...] "bedeviled by gossip, barraged by accusations of venality, castigated {{by the opposition}} and threatened by a final rupture of cordiality with the United States". The same year Najam Sethi described Sharif's government as [...] "it is corrupt, absolutely, astronomically corrupt, including the Prime Minister". In 2009, The New York Times commenting on Sharif's relationship with the U.S wrote that [...] "Bhutto and her Pakistan Peoples Party were considered more amenable allies for Washington" [...] adding that [...] "more nationalistic and religiously oriented, he (Sharif) and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, have traditionally found common cause with the religious parties". Pervez Hoodbhoy described [...] "Sharif {{as a reflection of}} (the) Pakistani society" [...] adding that [...] "he is silent on what matters most: the insurgency. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> leader." [...] Celia W. Dugger, writing in 1999, described Sharif's Raiwind Palace as [...] "walls paneled in silken fabrics and rococo chairs laden with so much gold leaf they looked like they belonged in the court of Louis XIV or a bordello", drawing comparison between Sharif's lifestyle and that of the [...] "Mughals".|$|E

6000|$|Godolphin {{poured out}} a cloudy volume of suggestion, with nothing clear in it but {{the belief that}} the part of Haxard ought to be fattened. He recurred to all the {{structural}} impossibilities that he had ever desired, and there was hardly a point in the piece {{that he did not want}} changed. At the end he said: [...] "But all these things are of no consequence, comparatively speaking. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> woman who can take the part of Salome, and play it with all the feminine charm that you've given it, and yet keep it strictly in the background, or thoroughly subordinated to the interest of Haxard." ...|$|E

We all do this, I suppose, {{in a small way}} for ourselves. There are few men who have not some chosen {{quotations}} printed on their study mantelpieces, or, better still, in their hearts. Carlyle's transcription of [...] "Rest! Rest! Shall I not have all Eternity to rest in!" [...] is a pretty good spur to a weary man. But <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more general application of the same thing for public and not for private use, until people understand that a graven thought is as beautiful an ornament as any graven image, striking through the eye right deep down into the soul.|$|E
6000|$|Taking, first, {{dreams of}} the unknown past, we find a large modern {{collection}} of these attributed to a lady named [...] "Miss A---". They were waking dreams representing obscure incidents of the past, and were later corroborated by records in books, newspapers and manuscripts. But as these books and papers existed, and were known to exist, before the occurrence of the visions, {{it is obvious that}} the matter of the visions may have been derived from the books and so forth, or at least, a sceptic will vastly prefer this explanation. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dream or vision of the unknown past, corroborated by a document not known to exist at the time when the vision took place and was recorded. Probably there is no such instance, but the following tale, picturesque in itself, has a kind of shadow of the only satisfactory sort of corroboration.|$|E
