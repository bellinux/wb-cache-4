40|$|There is {{merit in}} {{considering}} a simple toxicological screening method that evaluates the total cytotoxic potential of e-liquids or electronic cigarettes (ECs) aerosol emissions in one single testing. However, {{there is growing}} confusion, with several researchers endorsing their personal solution to the problem. Here, we discuss as an example the recent paper by Scheffler and colleagues, in which the authors suggest that more relevant and <b>well</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> lines from human airways {{could be the most}} suitable candidates for toxicological evaluation of ECs aerosol emissions. We advance recommendations for validated protocols and advocate for an international coordinated effort aimed at establishing consensus on methodology...|$|E
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the metrial gland of the rat was examined at days 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 of pregnancy and at all these stages two <b>well</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> types were seen. A relatively pale-staining cell which contained numerous dense granules was readily distinguished from a darkly stained fibroblast-like cell. Numerous cells could be identified, however, which did not fit either of these categories. On {{the basis of their}} morphological appearances these cells were placed in a series, with the members of the series showing a transition from a small cell with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic size ratio to a readily identifiable metrial gland cell containing a few typical granules. The small cell, apparently the precursor of the granulated metrial gland cell, was characterized by a markedly heterochromatic nucleus and few cytoplasmic organelles, although there were occasional mitochondria and Golgi bodies. On morphological grounds this cell appeared to be from the lymphocyte series and was probably a small lymphocyte...|$|E
40|$|A {{complementary}} DNA (cDNA) library from a cloned subbine (CD-i 1) of a well differentiated human pancreatic {{tumor cell}} line, HPAF, {{was subjected to}} differential screening using single stranded cDNA probes synthesized from mRNA of the <b>well</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> clone CD-i 1 and a poorly differentiated pancreatic tumor cell line, Panc i. A cDNA clone (PD-i) was identified which had an insert of 626 base pairs (bp). PD-i cDNA hybridized to a transcript of about 650 bp on Northern blot analysis, suggesting that the cDNA was close to full length. Densitometric analysis of Northern blots showed that a well differentiated pancreatic tumor line had a 5 -fold higher PD-i expression {{as compared to the}} poorly differentiated line, Panc 1. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PD-i cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence showed an open reading frame of 399 bp. In addition to the open reading frame, the sequence had a 5 ’ untranslated region of 61 bp and a 3 ’ untranslated tail of 147 bp. The nucleotide sequence did not show any significant homology to any other sequence in the GENBANK or EMBL databases; however, the translated protein showed 35 % homology to bacterial ribosomal proteins over 1 1 2 amino acids. Sequence analysis of the PD-i cDNA and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of its in vitro transcription/translation product suggest that this gene encoded a protein of 16, 000 daltons. Northern blot analysis with a panel of 1 1 pancreatic cell lines, a fibroblast line, a melanoma line, and normal and tumor pancreatic tissue showed that PD-i expression was relatively higher in the more differentiated pancreatic tumor lines as compared to normal and poorly differentiated lines with few exceptions...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructural {{features}} of myoepithelial {{cells in the}} benign proliferative lesion of the breast were studied. The meterials were 32 cases of fibroadenoma and 30 cases of adenosis. The {{emphasis was placed on}} the differentiation of myoepithelial cells, which has implied cell maturity. The most important indicator of the differentiation was the amount of myofilaments in myoepithelial <b>cells.</b> <b>Well</b> <b>differentiated</b> myoepithelial <b>cell</b> possessed <b>well</b> developed myofilaments, and vice versa.

In adenosis, 78. 6 % of <b>well</b> <b>differentiated</b> myoepithelial <b>cells</b> were recognized, and they were generally proliferated.

5|$|In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, {{the cancer}} cells grow in {{patterns}} reminiscent of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cluster 1 antigen and the human milk fat globule membrane (HMFG) antigen were studied in three SCLC, three lung adenocarcinoma, six ovarian adenocarcinoma and three colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines before and after culture {{in the presence of}} the differentiation inducing agent, sodium butyrate. Before treatment, only SCLC and <b>well</b> <b>differentiated</b> ovarian <b>cell</b> lines expressed the cluster 1 antigen.

40|$|Regulation of the {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{plays an important}} functional role either in physiological or pathological conditions. The plasminogen activation (PA) system, comprising the uPA and tPA proteases and their inhibitor PAI- 1, {{is one of the}} main suppliers of extracellular proteolytic activity contributing to tissue remodeling. Although its function in development is well documented, its precise role in mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation in vitro is unknown. We found that the PA system components are expressed at very low levels in undifferentiated ESCs and that upon differentiation uPA activity is detected mainly transiently, whereas tPA activity and PAI- 1 protein are maximum in <b>well</b> <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells.</b> Adipocyte formation by ESCs is inhibited by amiloride treatment, a specific uPA inhibitor. Likewise, ESCs expressing ectopic PAI- 1 under the control of an inducible expression system display reduced adipogenic capacities after induction of the gene. Furthermore, the adipogenic differentiation capacities of PAI- 1 (-/-) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are augmented as compared to wt iPSCs. Our results demonstrate that the control of ESC adipogenesis by the PA system correspond to different successive steps from undifferentiated to <b>well</b> <b>differentiated</b> ESCs. Similarly, skeletal myogenesis is decreased by uPA inhibition or PAI- 1 overexpression during the terminal step of differentiation. However, interfering with uPA during days 0 to 3 of the differentiation process augments ESC myotube formation. Neither neurogenesis, cardiomyogenesis, endothelial cell nor smooth muscle formation are affected by amiloride or PAI- 1 induction. Our results show that the PA system is capable to specifically modulate adipogenesis and skeletal myogenesis of ESCs by successive different molecular mechanisms...|$|R
