Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.

5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of <b>whirling</b> snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing straight toward them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E

40|$|The {{swimming}} {{motions of}} cells within Bacillus subtilis colonies, {{as well as}} the associated fluid flows, were analyzed from video films produced during colony growth and expansion on wet agar surfaces. Individual cells in very wet dense populations moved at rates between 76 and 116 μm/s. Swimming cells were organized into patterns of <b>whirls,</b> each approximately 1, 000 μm 2, and jets of about 95 by 12 μm. <b>Whirls</b> and jets were short-lived, lasting only about 0. 25 s. Patterns within given areas constantly repeated with a periodicity of approximately 1 s. <b>Whirls</b> of a given direction became disorganized and then re-formed, usually into <b>whirls</b> moving in the opposite direction. Pattern elements were also organized with respect to one another in the colony. Neighboring <b>whirls</b> usually turned in opposite directions. This correlation decreased as a function of distance between <b>whirls.</b> Fluid flows associated with <b>whirls</b> and jets were measured by observing the movement of marker latex spheres added to colonies. The average velocity of markers traveling in <b>whirls</b> was 19 μm/s, whereas those traveling in jets moved at 27 μm/s. The paths followed by markers were aligned with the direction of cell motion, suggesting that cells create flows moving with them into <b>whirls</b> and along jets. When colonies became dry, swimming motions ceased except in regions close to the periphery and in isolated islands where cells traveled in slow <b>whirls</b> at about 4 μm/s. The addition of water resulted in immediate though transient rapid swimming (> 80 μm/s) in characteristic <b>whirl</b> and jet patterns. The rate of swimming decreased to 13 μm/s within 2 min, however, as the water diffused into the agar. Organized swimming patterns were nevertheless preserved throughout this period.
