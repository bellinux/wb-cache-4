50|$|Friction {{stud welding}} {{has been used}} to {{retrofit}} sacrificial anodes to subsea pipelines while the pipeline is “live” (that is, it continues to transport hydrocarbons at pressure). In some cases the anodes are placed on the sea bed next to the pipeline and a lug on a cable from the anode is connected to the stud welded on the pipeline. Another option is a tripartite weld where the lug on the anode cable is made of steel with a tapered hole in it. The tapered end of the stud welds through the hole onto the pipeline, welding to both the lug and the pipe and providing a fully <b>welded</b> <b>connection</b> between the anode cable and pipeline. The advantage of this method {{is that there is no}} significant increase in the electrical resistance of the connection due to corrosion during the lifetime of the pipeline. Many subsea pipelines have concrete weight coating on them and a small area of this can be removed with a water jet to permit welding.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the widely}} used systems for {{offshore}} oil production in water depths up to 500 - 2500 meters is a steel catenary riser (SCR). Requirements for long-term corrosion resistance of SCR are very stringent, that obliges to manufacture it from expensive steels. Still, the increased water depth leads to increased riser tension, grown pressure, aggravated buckling and oscillation problems. Among alternative materials to manufacture catenary risers, i. e., steel, titanium and aluminum alloys, the aluminum {{is the best}} from the “Strength/Weight/Cost ” aspects with its high corrosion strength. Design of an aluminum catenary production riser (ACPR) was developed in Russia; and comprehensive tests were performed on mechanical characteristics and corrosion resistance properties of ACPR tubes and their connections. Two possible connections of riser sections were considered, i. e., welded and threaded. Strength analysis of threaded connection was performed by FEM. Mechanical testing included: testing of small samples of pipe material and <b>welded</b> <b>connection</b> cut out of riser section, testing of full-scale specimens of connection prototypes, and measurement of residual stresses.

40|$|Transportation {{departments}} {{have been using}} aluminum overhead sign structures since the early 1960 ’s. It is well documented that cracks develop in the welds between diagonal and chord members, due to fatigue stresses by wind-induced vibration of slender members. The cracks propagate to complete failure of the members, which causes signs to fall and inflict injuries. The original design of overhead sign structures did not consider fatigue as a limit state. In addition, field welding of aluminum structures for any possible repairs is prohibited. A repair method for the cracked aluminum welded connections between diagonals and chord members using {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} composites (GFRP) has been investigated. The static tensile load carrying capacity of the <b>welded</b> <b>connection</b> and the cracked connection repaired with GFRP composites were established. This article describes the surface preparation of the aluminum tubular members, the application of GFRP composites to repair the connection, and the experimental results from monotonic static tests. The experimental results of specimens from actual sign structures show that the GFRP repaired connection achieved 1. 17 to 1. 25 times the capacity of the uncracked aluminum <b>welded</b> <b>connection.</b> These results, along with the minimal traffic disruption anticipated in the application, make this repair method a good candidate for implementation...|$|E

In this study, the fatigue strength of the repaired base material and repaired fatigue damaged V-shape <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> made of very high strength steels is investigated. This thesis consists of four parts. In Part I, the emphasis was put on the effects of the material imperfections on the fatigue strength of materials and this part consists of an extensive literature study and a microscopic examination of the fracture surfaces of the base material of very high strength steels. Part II presents a literature survey on the fatigue crack repair methods and the results of the experimental programme of the current study. The experimental programme comprises fatigue tests on the repaired base material and repaired V-shape <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> made of very high strength steels. The V-shape welded specimens were made of rolled and cast steel plates. In Part III, fatigue strength prediction models were evaluated and a comparison was made between the fatigue strength curves from the prediction models and the fatigue strength curves of the test results.

Although this notion has existed for the static design of such connections, its implementation into design recommendations or specifications has never been checked against existing test data. This is performed herein, using a database of gapped and overlapped CHS-to-RHS N-connection tests undertaken by others, and the suitability of this procedure is examined for both existing and proposed new static design recommendations for RHS <b>welded</b> <b>connections.</b> For fatigue design, no design guidance exists for CHS-to-RHS <b>welded</b> <b>connections.</b> Thus, a database of welded CHS-to-RHS T-connection fatigue tests, undertaken by both the authors and others, under branch axial loading or branch in-plane bending, is used to evaluate the replacement of the circular branch with an equivalent square branch, in the context of contemporary fatigue design procedures. It is shown that, for the connection types examined, this substitution of a circular branch member by an equivalent square branch member is a valid operation, with an adequate level of safety, for both the static and fatigue design of such connections.

40|$|Abstract The stress {{concentration}} factors (SCFs) in <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> usually occur at zones with high stress levels. Stress concentrations reduce the fatigue behavior of <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> in offshore structures and cracking can develop. By using the grinding technique, cracking can be eliminated. Stress concentration factors {{are defined as}} a ratio of maximum stress at the intersection to nominal stress on the brace. Defining the {{stress concentration}} factor is an important stage in the fatigue behavior of <b>welded</b> <b>connections.</b> Several approaches have evolved for designing structures with the classical S-N approach for estimating total life. This work correlates to the stress concentration factors of T-welded connections and the fatigue behavior. Stress concentration factors were computed with the finite element employing 3 D T-welded connections with intact and grinding depth conditions. Then, T-welded connections were constructed with A 36 plate steel and welded with E 6013 electrodes to obtain the stress-life (S-N) approach. The methodology from previous works was used to compute the SCF and fabricate the T-welded connections. The {{results indicated that the}} grinding process could restore the fatigue life of the T-welded connections for SCFs values in the range of 1. 29. This value can be considered to be a low SCF value in T-welded connection.
