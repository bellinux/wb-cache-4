5|$|A four-stop continuo organ {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it <b>was</b> <b>depressed.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of The Adventures of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E

5|$|During the station's construction, {{the main}} road of Queens Boulevard <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> into {{underpass}}es at the intersections with Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Boulevard (also known as Nassau Boulevard). The easternmost underpass now carries Queens Boulevard below the Long Island Expressway (LIE), which replaced Horace Harding Boulevard. On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard Line was extended by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike, and the Woodhaven Boulevard station opened {{as part of this}} extension. As a result of the extension, areas in Elmhurst were accessible by subway.|$|E

5|$|Hitler fled to {{the home}} of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some {{accounts}} contemplated suicide. He <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason. His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, {{with the goal of}} supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of the Helium Control Act (1927), which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.|$|E
5|$|The two {{tubes of}} the 53rd Street Tunnel under the East River began {{construction}} in spring 1927, and were fully excavated between Queens and Manhattan in January 1929, with a ventilation shaft built on Welfare Island (today's Roosevelt Island). On October 4, 1928, the Board of Estimate approved {{the construction of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. During the line's construction, several intersections of Queens Boulevard with major roads were grade separated, in a similar manner to Grand Concourse in the Bronx during the building of the IND Concourse Line around that same time. At adjacent intersections with Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Boulevard (now the Long Island Expressway) in Elmhurst, Queens Boulevard's main road <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> into underpasses. In Kew Gardens, Union Turnpike and the Interboro Parkway (now the Jackie Robinson Parkway) were depressed below Queens Boulevard {{at the level of the}} Union Turnpike station's mezzanine. The subway from Long Island City to Roosevelt Avenue and 74th Street was completed by April 1932.|$|E
5|$|Lace was {{released}} from Dartmoor in July 1987 and settled in nearby Brixham, Devon, returning to visit family in Portsmouth in 1988. He intimated that he <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> about his past actions and in December 1988 gave away his possessions and resigned from his job. He was last seen by friends between 7–8 December and was found dead by his landlord on 9December. Postmortem examination revealed superficial wounds to his wrist, ingestion of analgesics and a plastic bag over his head. The {{cause of death was}} determined to be asphyxiation and his death was determined as suicide by the coroner. Lace was buried in Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth on 20December 1988. After a cross check on the DNA database found that the DNA from the murder scene showed a partial match with that of a relative of Lace, detectives requested a sample from Andrina Foster, Lace's biological sister, which gave a familial match with the murderer's DNA. As a result of this development, Lace's body was exhumed on 12 August 2009 for DNA testing as part of Operation Iceberg.|$|E

25|$|Major {{isostatic}} adjustments of the lithosphere {{during the}} Quaternary glaciation {{were caused by}} the weight of the ice, which depressed the continents. In Canada, a large area around Hudson Bay <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> below sea level, as was the area in Europe around the Baltic Sea. The land has been rebounding from these depressions since the ice melted. Some of these isostatic movements triggered large earthquakes in Scandinavia about 9,000 years ago. These earthquakes are unique in that they are not associated with plate tectonics.|$|E

The market for such ships <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> after the war, however, so {{he took a job}} with the Navy as chief naval constructor at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1817, which he probably viewed as a temporary position until the market improved for privately built ships. While there, he and his apprentice Isaac Webb oversaw construction of the schooner , launched in 1821 and considered one of the fastest schooners of the day until she capsized and sank in a storm with the loss of all hands off Charleston, South Carolina, in 1843.|$|E

To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles II, Spanish power and {{prestige}} declined at an accelerated pace, that started {{in the last years}} of Count-Duke of Olivares' prime ministership in the 1640s. The economy, on the whole, <b>was</b> <b>depressed</b> between 1650 and 1700, with low productivity, famines, and epidemics. Spain's economy (especially in Castile) crumbled. This was partially due to plague outbreaks, for example during 1676–1685, and partially due to the heavy taxation and huge casualties caused by the almost continuous warfare. The period 1677–1686 was the lowest point; there was famine, natural disasters, and economic chaos. Emigration to the New World increased; with the population of Spain decreasing by nearly two million people during the 17th century: nearly 1.25 million from plagues, and 300,000 from the expulsion of the Moriscos. Spanish territory shrank with the loss to France of some territories in the Spanish Netherlands.|$|E
