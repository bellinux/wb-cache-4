Bertrand Russell, T.H. Huxley, and Benedetto Croce, who wrote for the Britannica? Or ... EssJay?" ...|$|E

I mean, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> die—would you rather us die than them?" [...] This was taken from an {{argument}} dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.|$|E

500|$|Following the 2005–06 {{television}} season, PTC {{issued a}} report Faith in a Box that analyzed depictions of religion in primetime television. The study stated that most positive references to religion were on reality shows such as , while claiming that scripted shows {{tended to be more}} negative towards it. The report also ranked Fox as the [...] "most anti-religious network", followed by NBC, UPN, ABC, CBS, and the WB. In 2008, PTC published a report titled Happily Never After, using analysis of several primetime shows early in the 2007-2008 television season to assert that extramarital sex is favored on television shows. Ian O'Doherty of The Irish Independent asked regarding the PTC's marriage depiction study: [...] "After all, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> watch people having fun or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> watch a realistic depiction of marriage, which...would simply be an hour of two people sullenly chewing their food, pausing occasionally only to throw each other filthies and occasionally grumbling under their breath how the biggest regret of their life was ever setting eyes on you and that their mother was right all along?" [...] PTC released a report in October 2009 stating that prime-time television shows on broadcast networks had twice as many depictions of violence against women in 2009 than in 2004.|$|E
500|$|The {{final act}} of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of Tennent's Super - a high-alcohol-content lager - to London's street {{drinkers}} on Christmas Day 1995. [...] However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near Waterloo station on the South Bank — was unusually devoid of homeless people, {{many of whom were}} in homeless shelters for the day. [...] "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. [...] "If you are down-and-out, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> have a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent's?" [...] The Sunday Times later called the scheme [...] "ethically dubious".|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Daily Chronicle in 1906 remarks: [...] "'If not yourself, who <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> be?' was a {{favourite}} {{question of}} the confession album of the seventies." [...] A. A. Milne (1882–1956) looked back in 1921 on the album as something from his childhood: ...|$|E
2500|$|Cray {{had always}} {{resisted}} the massively parallel solution to high-speed computing, offering {{a variety of}} reasons that it would never work as well as one very fast processor. He famously quipped [...] "If you were plowing a field, which <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> use: Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?" [...] By the mid-1990s this argument was becoming increasingly difficult to justify, and modern compiler technology made developing programs on such machines not much more difficult than their simpler counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, torture porn has {{increasingly}} become a DVD-oriented subgenre. For example, [...] (2011) was released direct-to-DVD, unlike the previous {{films in the}} series. The film received less negative attention in the press {{as a result of}} its lower-profile release. Other recent torture porn films include <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> <b>Rather</b> (2012), Shiver (2012), and The Collection (2012). As fewer and fewer high-profile cinematic torture porn films are being released, the subgenre is slowly dying out as many journalists have proposed.|$|E

2500|$|After this trial, Edwards gained {{national}} attention as a plaintiff's lawyer. He filed {{at least twenty}} similar lawsuits {{in the years following}} and achieved verdicts and settlements of more than $60 million for his clients. Similar lawsuits followed across the country. When asked about an increase in Caesarean deliveries nationwide, perhaps to avoid similar medical malpractice lawsuits, Edwards said, [...] "The question is, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> have cases where that happens instead of having cases where you don't intervene and a child either becomes disabled for life or dies in utero?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{graduate}} student Richard Terrile remembers that Westphal [...] "not only taught me about astronomy and science, {{but also about}} more down-to-earth topics like self-reliance, dealing with people, and how to keep focused when things go bad. Jim had a wonderful way of reducing a problem to its most basic form. He said, 'There are always two {{ways to deal with}} a problem: You can get angry and upset and then try and fix it, or you can just fix it. Which way <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> work on it?'".|$|E

Moyles jokingly asked Ferdinand: [...] "If you had to, who <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rather</b> go out with – Smudger [...] or Scholesy ?". Ferdinand replied: [...] "That is not my bag that, that is not my game, talking about going out with geezers" [...] and when Moyles suggested he would always prefer Smith, Ferdinand declared: [...] "You’re a faggot." [...] He quickly apologised {{for what he had}} said, stating [...] "I'm not homophobic".|$|E
