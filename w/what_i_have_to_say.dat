He said, “If I {{make any}} {{statement}} {{it will be}} in a way the people can hear me and understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and not have to depend on some parts of the press which might fail to report all I have to say.” ...|$|E
500|$|According to Emily Jupp of The Independent, despite various {{changes in}} musical direction, an [...] "unconventional fashion sense" [...] {{has been a}} {{constant}} in Diamandis's career. In the video to [...] "How to be a Heartbreaker," [...] she [...] "subverts the norm" [...] by wearing more clothes than male models in the background; she reflected that [...] "I don’t think it suits me to wear very little clothing, it just wouldn’t feel right. I’d rather people listen to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> instead of staring at my bum." [...] In 2011, when promoting The Family Jewels, Diamandis [...] described her fashion styles as [...] "vintage, cheerleader, and cartoon." [...] Four years later, she described her costumes then as [...] "very badly put together vintage, kind of glittery ensemble", and her outfits for Froot as a [...] "mix of '70s with digital fiberware...something surreal and '70s." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson's third studio album, My December, was {{released}} on June 22, 2007. The album relied on darker themes and features a heavier rock sound. Clarkson replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks. She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators. Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis. He noted the album's lack of professional production input and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused. Clarkson defended, [...] "I've sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I couldn't give a crap about being a star. I've always just wanted to sing and write." [...] The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore. Clarkson later hired the services of talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management. Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend. Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as [...] "a key advisor" [...] in her success.|$|E

'Sir,' {{said the}} little man, rising, 'I wish to address <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{to you and}} not to our worthy {{chairman}}, because our worthy chairman is in some measure--I may say in a great degree--the subject of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> or I may say to--to--' 'State,' suggested Mr. Jingle.|$|E

I was not afraid of the shabby coat, and had no yearnings after gallant greys. My whole manner of {{thinking}} of our late misfortune was changed. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, was, to show my aunt that her past goodness <b>to</b> me <b>had</b> not been thrown away on an insensible, ungrateful object. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, was, to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work with a resolute and steady heart. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, was, to take my woodman's axe in my hand, and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty, by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora.
