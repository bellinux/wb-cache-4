50|$|<b>Fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> play an {{important}} part in firefighting tactics due to their versatility. The wide variety of <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> manufacturers allows them to accommodate different sizes of fire hose- most often attack hand line- and streams and are capable in both fire protection and attack. With regard to flow rate, it is imperative to be sure that each <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> be able to handle the flow rate of its water supply because the master stream devices to which they are sometimes attached can expel up to 2000 gal per minute. Nevertheless, as with almost all <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles,</b> those on master stream devices come with either automatic or manual spray pattern and stream adjustments. However, one significant disadvantage of <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> is that Compressed Air Foam (CAF) bubbles' ratio of surface area to volume (which are formed by mixing air into a solution of water and foaming agents at the pump) exceeds that of <b>fog</b> nozzles' <b>water</b> droplets; therefore, the mechanical deflection in the nozzles themselves causes a loss of bubble structure, thereby reducing the CAF's ability to absorb heat. Despite this drawback, provided an appropriate nozzle pressure and <b>water</b> supply, <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> are effective for any ground fire situation.|$|R

50|$|A <b>fog</b> <b>nozzle</b> is a {{firefighting}} hose {{spray nozzle}} that breaks its stream into small droplets. By doing so, its stream achieves a greater surface area, {{and thus a}} greater rate of heat absorption, which, when {{compared to that of}} a smoothbore nozzle, speeds its transformation into the steam that smothers the fire by displacing its oxygen. Specially designed <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> (with no stream adjustment) have been certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) for use on Class B & C hazards.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spray {{droplet size}} {{has long been}} {{recognized}} as an important variable that applicators of vector control sprays {{must be aware of}} to make the most effective spray applications. Researchers and applicators have several different techniques available to assess spray droplet size from spray nozzles. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the droplet size spectrum produced by three nozzles commonly used in vector control in a high-speed wind tunnel, when characterized using three different laser-based droplet size measurement systems. Three droplet sizing systems: Malvern Spraytec laser diffraction, Sympatec HELOS laser diffraction, and TSI Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA), were simultaneously operated, but under different operating conditions, to measure the spray droplet size-spectra for three spray nozzles. The three atomizers: a TeeJet ® 8001 E even flat fan nozzle, a BETE ® PJ high pressure <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and a Micro-nair ® AU 5000 rotary atomizer were evaluated in a high speed wind tunnel at airspeeds of 53 and 62 m/s (120 and 140 mph). Based on the results of this work, only the BETE ® PJ high pressure <b>fog</b> <b>nozzles</b> met the label requirements for both Fyfanon ® and Anvil®. While the other nozzle might met the Dv 0. 5 (VMD – volume median diameter) requirement for Fyfanon®, the resulting Dv 0. 9 values exceeded labeled size restrictions.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a review of}} research into, and application of, a three dimensional (3 D) <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique for firefighting. The impact of <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> characteristics associated with properties of the nozzle (e. g., droplet size, momentum, flow rate, spray angle and pattern) and discharge techniques (e. g., discharge angle, and discharge duration related to the bursts) on performance of the 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique are discussed. Potential use of numerical computer studies to help understand and improve this technique is also reviewed and discussed. The 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique is not designed to replace the direct fire attack but rather to complement existing forms of fire attack {{in an effort to}} increase the safety and effectiveness of fire fighting teams. Compared to the traditional straight-stream attack, the 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> technique has advantages in controlling steadily growing fires where the space can still be entered, but where the seat of the fire cannot be attacked directly. It has also been used for offensive attack to control flashover. However, there is not sufficient research to evaluate its capabilities in other fire scenarios, such as reducing the likelihood of backdraft, and in controlling fire threats in low visibility scenarios. Research on the effects of the nozzle type, application techniques and fire conditions on the performance of the 3 D <b>water</b> <b>fog</b> tactic is also very limited. Further research efforts, including both experimental and numerical studies, can help firefighters understand how to most effectively use this technique and also help to improve its performance in firefighting.
