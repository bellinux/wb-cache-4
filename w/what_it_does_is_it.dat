5000|$|So, we got {{the higher}} thrust engines, {{finished}} development on that, we're in testing. What we're also doing is modifying the structure a little bit. I want to be building only two versions, or two cores in my factory, any more than {{that would not be}} great from a customer perspective. It's about a 30% increase in performance, maybe a little more. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> allows us to land the first stage for GTO missions on the drone ship.|$|E
50|$|Well, what Secretary Powell and the US {{seems to}} have said is that he now has grave doubts about the {{accuracy}} of the case he put to the United Nations about the claim that Iraq possessed biological weapons laboratories - the so-called mobile trailers. And here in Australia, that formed also part of the government's argument on the war. I think <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> adds to the fabric of how the Australian people were misled about the reasons for going to war.|$|E
40|$|British journalist, broadcaster, and {{political}} aide Alastair Campbell {{has said the}} Guinness photo call opportunity by politicians visiting Ireland, most recently and famously by US President Barack Obama, sends out the wrong message on alcohol. In Dublin recently to support the Reduce Your Alcohol Use campaign, Campbell queried: “I am not criticising Guinness, but if a British politician comes to Dublin and wants a photo call, {{what are you going}} to do?” ”Go to a pub and buy him a pint of Guinness and it’s nice and touchy-feely, and it’s warm and it’s blah, blah, blah. But actually <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> sends a message that that’s what you do when you come to Dublin — have a drink. ” Responding to a question on whether politicians should champion the campaign to tackle alcohol abuse, the former British Labour party spin doctor said it would help if there were more politicians who saw this as a significant issue and spoke about it publicly...|$|E

30|$|The {{effective}} {{solution to}} this obstacle in training deep network was first proposed by Hinton [28]. It applied greedy layer by layer pre-training of the layers in unsupervised fashion. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> adjusts {{the weight of the}} network to the comparable value instead of feeding inputs to network with randomly generated weights. Then, in second stage, supervised training is performed with the labeled data to fine tune the weights. Hence, deep neural networks trained in this way can effectively find the optimal representation of the network parameters.|$|R

The tenant would obviously, to the annoyance of the landlord, be entitled to the somewhat cumbersome procedural advantages of the Act, but <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to delay or suspend the exercise of the landowner's full proprietary rights until a determination had been made {{as to whether or}} not it was just and equitable to evict the unlawful occupier, and under what conditions.

Times of India wrote: [...] "The visuals lack sheen, the editing is jerky and at times disorienting, actors' voices change perceptibly in the same scene with someone else dubbing over the lines which include facts and figures, {{and there is an}} unmistakable late 80s ethos in the filmmaking".
