25|$|Śrīrāghavāvataraṇam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवावतरणम्). The first fifteen verses glorify {{the city}} of Ayodhyā {{on the banks of}} river Sarayū. Daśaratha is the ruler of the kingdom of Ayodhyā. Daśaratha does not have any son for many years. He {{approaches}} his Guru Vasiṣṭha and expresses his unfulfilled desire. Vasiṣṭha assures him that he will soon get four sons. After performing the Asvamedha, Viśvajit and Rajasuya sacrifices, Vasiṣṭha calls the sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to perform the Putreṣṭi sacrifice for Daśaratha. Agni manifests {{at the end of the}} sacrifice <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> Pāyasa. Daśaratha gives half of the Pāyasa to Kausalyā, a fourth to Kaikeyī, and two one-eighth portions to Sumitrā. The three queens become pregnant. Meanwhile, various Devatās take Avatāra in Vānara families, with Śiva being born as Hanumān. After twelve months of the queens' pregnancy, on the ninth day of the bright half of the Caitra month (Rāmanavamī), Rāma manifests as a sixteen-year-old, bearing bow and arrows. On the request of Kausalyā he assumes the form of an infant. Kaikeyī gives birth to Bharata, and Sumitrā delivers two sons – Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna. The deities and the subjects of Ayodhyā rejoice at the birth of the four princes. Paraśurāma regales in the meditation of Rāma's child form on Mahendra mountain, singing his glory in 16 verses (11.84–11.99).|$|E

'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break.
