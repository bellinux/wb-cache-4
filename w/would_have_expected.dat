5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> {{to find in the}} seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E

Indeed, the skull and teeth of most Neanderthal specimens are better preserved than the post-cranial body, especially its fragile bones such as the hyoid and the cervical vertebrae.

The settlement excluded any reversionary rights that might become due {{for the benefit of}} either her or her heirs if such rights were to become enacted. The settlement paid Montgomery a flat sum of $18,000; at the time an amount she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> to see earned from her works during her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In December 1924, {{several days}} after the last ship left the port, Welch treated a few {{children}} for what he first diagnosed as sore throats or tonsillitis, initially dismissing diphtheria since it is extremely contagious and he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> {{to see the same}} symptoms in their family members or other cases around town. In the next few weeks, as the number of tonsillitis cases grew and four children died whom he {{had not been able to}} autopsy, Welch became increasingly concerned about diphtheria.|$|E

25|$|During {{the year}} 2004 South Africa had a {{significantly}} less successful run in ODI cricket than they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected,</b> with a 5–1 series loss to New Zealand and a 5–0 series loss to Sri Lanka. They had beaten the West Indies 3–1 earlier in the year, but South African cricket was described as being {{in a state of}} 'freefall'. In Test matches also South Africa suffered a poor run with series losses to England, India and Sri Lanka. They did nevertheless win a home Test series against the West Indies (with Smith and Gibbs sharing their third 300-run opening partnership).|$|E
25|$|According to Lucian Boia, Arbore's public stances {{under the}} actual German {{occupation}} were surprisingly toned down. His one article for Lumina (November 1917) reviewed the Russian issue in quite different terms, prophesying that a multinational federation could be effected around the Russian Provisional Government. His 1918 public lectures on Bessarabia {{were focused on}} geographic and statistical information—"one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> more", Boia notes. Arbore was more outspoken during the interwar period: his December 1918 speech demanded the guarantee of minority rights in Greater Romania, saluted the policies of Soviet Russia as a liberating force, and predicted a Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War. On the occasion, Arbore also demanded the release of Socialist Party activists held in Romanian custody, {{as well as the}} freeing of Transylvanian collaborationist Slavici.|$|E

25|$|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was {{developed}} by Ubisoft Montreal. Montreal also worked on both of the other main Assassin's Creed games in the series and was thus chosen to lead production for the third installment. A new Assassin's Creed episode featuring multiplayer was announced during Ubisoft's 2009 fiscal third quarter results while not revealing its name. In early May 2010, a GameStop employee published on the internet some images of a pre-order box featuring the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood title while Ubisoft was teasing the game on Facebook and Twitter. Ubisoft then confirmed the authenticity of these pictures. Brotherhood has not been numbered unlike Assassin's Creed II because players, and even developers themselves <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> a new setting and a new ancestor while {{this is only the}} continuation of Ezio's story.|$|E
25|$|Still, when {{after the}} death of William in 1584, and {{subsequently}} the end of the search for a new sovereign after the departure of Leicester the States General reluctantly accepted that they had to be sovereign in 1588, the office took on a vestigial character. Had it not been that the stadtholder of Holland was usually also elected to the confederal office of Captain general of the Union, which was an important office in time of war, one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> that the office might have been left vacant much earlier than eventually happened. However, in the circumstances of the ongoing war with Spain, the Captain-general was indispensable. And the office of stadtholder remained an important power-base, enabling its holder to exert an influence far beyond its formal powers.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines {{were the}} first to make a move when John VIII and his advisors made a risky {{decision}} by inciting a rebellion within the Ottoman Empire. In August 1421, they backed a man named Mustafa who claimed to be a long lost son of Bayezid the Thunderbolt. In Europe, Mustafa's rebellion worked well and he gathered some support. However, in August 1422, Murad II had this rebellion crushed and Mustafa received the traditional execution (hanging) shortly after, something any rebel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected.</b> Murad II was enraged and had an army sent to Constantinople and to Thessalonika, the latter falling in 1430. Murad II was unable to take Constantinople by force. Nonetheless, the situation in the Capital was dire enough for Manuel II to come out of retirement and incite yet another rebellion in Asia Minor under Murad II's brother, Kucuk Mustafa. Initial rebel success, including a siege of Bursa was too much for Murad II to ignore so the siege of Constantinople was lifted to deal with this threat, and to the Byzantines' greatest despair, dealt with it indeed.|$|E

25|$|The first Tour de France {{was staged}} in 1903. The plan was a five-stage race from 31 May to 5 July, {{starting}} in Paris and stopping in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux and Nantes {{before returning to}} Paris. Toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern France from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Stages would go {{through the night and}} finish next afternoon, with rest days before riders set off again. But this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most and only 15 competitors had entered. Desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea. Instead, he cut the length to 19 days, changed the dates to 1 to 19 July, and offered a daily allowance to those who averaged at least 20km/h on all the stages, equivalent to what a rider <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> to earn each day had he worked in a factory. He also cut the entry fee from 20 to 10 francs and set the first prize at 12,000 francs and the prize for each day's winner at 3,000 francs. The winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year. That attracted between 60 and 80 entrants– the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out– among them not just professionals but amateurs, some unemployed, some simply adventurous.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{exit from}} the FA Cup the {{previous}} weekend, a trip to Pride Park to play bottom-placed Derby County on 15 March looked {{to be the perfect}} opportunity for the Red Devils to bounce back and show their title credentials. However, the game did not prove as simple as one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected,</b> as United had to work hard for their narrow 1–0 victory. As was the case with many of Manchester United's games in the 2007–08 season, luck was not on their side in the opening exchanges of the game. United goalkeeper Ben Foster, making his debut due to the unavailability of Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak, then staked his claim to the number 1 jersey with a pair of fine saves from Derby striker Kenny Miller. Cristiano Ronaldo proved to be the thorn in Derby's side on a number of occasions, testing former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with a curling effort hit with the outside of his foot and a 40-yard free kick. The breakthrough finally came in the 76th minute, Ronaldo scoring a deserved goal from a Wayne Rooney cross. With Arsenal only managing a draw against ten-man Middlesbrough in the day's late kick-off, United's win put them on top of the table on goal difference with a game in hand.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps, {{the biggest}} upset {{in the history}} of One Day Internationals, Mashrafe Mortaza shocked the Sophia Gardens crowd when he had Adam Gilchrist plumb on the second ball of the second ODI, taking the first Australian wicket without a run yet on the {{scoreboard}} – and it was to set the tone of the match. Most people <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> Australia to swamp Bangladesh, especially after the 10-wicket defeat the Bangladeshi Tigers endured in the opening match with England, but a maiden from Mortaza gave them some hope, at least. Things looked to be going the right way for Australia when Matthew Hayden took a boundary off Tapash Baisya, but another maiden followed, and in the sixth over Ricky Ponting padded up to Tapash Baisya – resulting in an lbw decision given, and Australia were 9 for 2. Cautious batting from Hayden and Damien Martyn followed, but some expensive bowling from Baisya relinquished the initiative, as Australia recovered. They survived through 15 overs, Hayden being caught off a no-ball from Tapash, but in the 16th, he was bowled by Nazmul Hossain for 37 off an inside edge, just as Hayden were looking to get himself in. Some economical bowling from Mohammad Rafique who bowled ten overs for 31 runs, along with excellent bowling from Mortaza at the death, resulted in Australia finishing on 249 for 5, losing Martyn to Baisya for 77 and Clarke to the same man for 54. In fact, Michael Hussey with 31 not out off 21 balls and Simon Katich with 36 not out off 23 ensured that they got a competitive target.|$|E
