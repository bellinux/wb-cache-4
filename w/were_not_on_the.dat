5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev {{was perhaps the}} best defenceman in the tournament {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{was born}} into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales. His surname {{is believed to have}} possibly derived from that of Francis Henry Marsh, whose property Camira was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range. Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.|$|E
5|$|The Ring named Baldomir's {{victory over}} Judah the upset {{of the year}} for 2006. Judah's IBF and WBA belts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line, because Baldomir did not pay sanctioning fees to the IBF and WBA. Baldomir did win the lineal, WBC and The Ring titles, while the WBA (Super) title was vacated after Judah's loss (WBA (Regular) titleholder Luis Collazo became the sole WBA Champion), but the IBF still {{recognized}} him as their champion.|$|E

5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor {{out of the ring}} onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{delivers}} Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, whereupon it {{is revealed}} {{that she is}} the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mondoshawans' ship, as they entrusted the stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna, an opera singer. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain the stones, but their surviving compatriots determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro, Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury cruise; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple designed to house the stones, then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the cruise liner.|$|E

5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be seen that the two structures <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise {{the fact that the}} Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{release in}} Japan, the game entered {{the top ten}} best-selling titles of the week at #3, with 21,445 units sold. It had a {{sell-through}} rate of just over 48%. The following week, it had dropped to #8, selling a further 8,436 units. By {{the end of the}} year, it was among the top 1000 best-selling games of 2011, with total sales of 46,834 units. At its debut in the United Kingdom, it performed poorly, reaching only #38 in the charts. According to Xseed, the game's sales in North America were favorable, although they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same level as The Last Story. In an interview, Xseed said that it might have done better if it had been released in the 2012 holiday season.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was joined}} by his skipper Yardley and after playing defensively for a period, the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs in 100 minutes. After the loss of four quick wickets, the Compton and Yardley elected to not play at any balls that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line of the stumps, and Lindwall and Johnston were taken off to recuperate ahead of the second new ball. Australia {{had the option of}} taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to {{replenish}} their energy levels. Meanwhile, Johnson and Toshack operated, and the English duo played them cautiously and comfortably. At tea, England had recovered to be 129/4, with Compton on 51 and Yardley 42. The English captain had been particularly successful against Johnson, capitalising on a series of overpitched balls and driving them away for runs. After tea, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball, but the former appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, ending his innings for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. Evans came to the crease and tried to counter-attack, hitting Lindwall for a boundary past square leg. Johnston then removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller from a swing of the bat wide outside off stump, leaving the hosts at 145/7.|$|E

5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, {{as well as the}} following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams.|$|E
