40|$|In the Nile Delta of Egypt, the {{estimated}} command water requirements for irrigation and other purposes dissimulate the actual supply. Yet, the canal diversion requirements are practically planned {{according to some}} historical records, disregarding {{the estimated}} command requirements. This study aims at diagnosing the reasons for dissimulating the actual situation in the estimated command requirements for a case study canal in the Eastern Nile Delta (Bahr Mouice Canal). The crop <b>water</b> <b>duties</b> were firstly reviewed and verified since they are considered, together with the cropping pattern, as the main influential parameters for estimating the command requirements. The actual water supply from the available resources {{during the period from}} 1989 to 1993 was analyzed in consideration of the command requirements. The monthly and annual canal efficiencies were employed as the chief indicators to conduct the analysis and suggest better method for water diversions' estimate. The effect of gradual crop planting was suggested as an important reason for the dissimulation. In order to avoid such an effect, it is therefore suggested to use the annual canal efficiency instead of any periodic estimate. The annual efficiency of Bahr Mouice Canal was estimated as high as 85. 5 percent, which is quite acceptable in view of the extensive official and unofficial reuse of irrigation water. The study ends with suggesting some areas for future research, particularly in updating crop <b>water</b> <b>duties</b> and developing a convenient method for simulating the effect of gradual planting in the planned scenario...|$|R

50|$|In {{regions with}} a {{structural}} water scarcity, {{the principle of}} <b>water</b> <b>duty</b> is often applied, whereby the duty per ha per season is {{only a fraction of}} the full irrigation need per ha (i.e. the irrigation intensity is less than 100%). Thus, farmers can irrigate only part of their land or irrigate their crops with a limited amount of water, whereby they may choose between crops with a high consumptive use (e.g. rice, sugarcane, most orchards) or a low consumptive use (e.g. cereals - notably barley, millet, and sorghum - or cotton). In India, such practice is called protective irrigation, which aims at equal distribution of scarce means and prevention of acute famine.|$|E

40|$|Water is an {{essential}} resource that requires careful management at all golf courses located in southern Arizona. The Arizona Department of Water Resources, through its enforcement of irrigation water duties, is forcing the golf industry to reduce water usage. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate turfgrass performance and the potential for soil salinization, when high maintenance desert turf systems are irrigated in accordance with the present Tucson area <b>water</b> <b>duty</b> of 1. 4 ha-m/ha/yr (4. 6 ac-ft/ac/yr). Two large weighing lysimeters supporting year-round turf systems consisting of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x transvalensis (L.) pers.) overseeded with intermediate ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum x perenne) were irrigated at rates not to exceed the ADWR <b>water</b> <b>duty</b> using either low salinity (EC = 0. 25 dS/m) groundwater or higher salinity effluent water (EC = 1. 0 dS/m). Irrigation treatments were initiated in August 1997 and continued through September 1998 and consisted of applying water daily at rates set by applying appropriate crop coefficients to values of reference evapotranspiration generated by an on-site weather station. Soil moisture and salinity regimes were monitored weekly using the lysimeter subsurface sampling system and time domain reflectometry (TDR). Water percolating below the root zone was quantified and sub-sampled to facilitate assessment of leaching fractions and total lysimeter salt balance. For the year ending 30 Sept. 1998, each lysimeter received — 1729 mm (68 in.) of water comprised of 1296 mm (51 in.) of irrigation water and 433 mm (17 in.) of precipitation. Turfgrass evapotranspiration (ET) totaled 1419 mm (56 in.) for the lysimeter irrigated with groundwater (east lysimeter) and 1466 mm (58 in.) for the lysimeter irrigated with effluent (west lysimeter). Approximately 421 and 311 mm of drainage water was removed from the east and west lysimeters, respectively, establishing leaching fractions of 0. 24 in the east lysimeter and 0. 18 in the west lysimeter. Salts accumulated in both lysimeters over the course of the study; however, the substantial amount of drainage did not allow for salts to accumulate to harmful levels. Turfgrass performance, as quantified by turf quality and growth was acceptable or better during most months of the study. Crop coefficients (Kcs) were slightly higher than previous years, however, Kcs compared favorably to previous research at the study site. Summer Kcs averaged 0. 79 and were significantly higher than winter Kcs that averaged 0. 73. Turf irrigated with effluent produced better quality turf and used slightly more water than turf irrigated with groundwater. These data indicate that the present ADWR <b>water</b> <b>duty</b> of 1. 4 ha-m/ha/yr (4. 6 acre-ft/acre/yr) is adequate to replace turfgrass evapotranspiration and provide for leaching of salts when rainfall exceeds normal amounts, assuming no water loss due to irrigation and plumbing inefficiencies...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater is {{becoming}} an essential water resource in Egypt due to the deficit in water balance. It is planned to increase withdrawal in 2017 to 7. 5 BCM and 3. 5 BCM from renewable and non-renewable groundwater aquifers, respectively. In recent years there have been efforts to protect this water resource. The main objective {{of this paper is}} studying the impacts of reusing treated wastewater in irrigation after natural attenuation through the vadose zone. Hydrogeological data were collected to characterize the aquifer in Sadat City. A field program was conducted to identify the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer and the contaminant concentrations in groundwater. Field investigations were conducted by drilling five boreholes in the study area and five monitoring wells were installed. Groundwater flow and solute transport were simulated by VISUAL MODFLOW and MT 3 D. Four contaminants of concern were selected for simulation: magnesium, chloride, iron and nitrates. Seven irrigation scenarios were tested: primary treated wastewater, secondary treated wastewater, oxidation pond wastewater, tertiary treated wastewater, tertiary for double field <b>water</b> <b>duty,</b> irrigation with two-year rotation (primary treated wastewater and groundwater) and in the last scenario the study area is divided into 3 zones and irrigated with tertiary treated wastewater, oxidation pond wastewater and groundwater.

40|$|A JASSA {{assessment}} of factors leading to poor performance of irrigation agriculture by small-holder farmers in rural Zimbabwe. A study {{was carried out}} on two smallholder surface irrigation schemes; Murara in Mutoko District and Nyamatanda in Mudzi District, north east Zimbabwe, between 1999 and 2001. The objective was to investigate possible causes of poor performance, emphasis on water management along the conveyance and distribution infrastructure. The methodologies used included a socio-economic survey questionnaire, an inventory of the existing infrastructure and {{assessment of}} its hydraulic suitability, monitoring of the irrigation process and practices, and calibrating the infrastructure for easy use by the farmers. Results showed that the farmers have {{an appreciation of the}} irrigation process and the flow in the canals was adequate for irrigation with <b>water</b> <b>duty</b> of at least 8. 2 l/s/ha in an eight hour day, for both irrigation schemes against a demand of two l/s/ha. Between the two schemes an average of 60 percent of the canal slopes are outside the recommended 1 : 300 to 1 : 2 000 limits that seriously affects water management. It was also observed that both irrigation schemes have distribution and regulation structures that lack water-measuring mechanisms and the water control mechanism is poorly defined, resulting in poor water management. Evidence of poor water management was observed in poor crop yields, use of lost water for fish farming at Murara Irrigation Scheme and loss of about two ha of irrigated fields at Nyamatanda Irrigation Scheme due to waterlogging. Our general recommendations are to rehabilitate the irrigation infrastructure that does not meet design specifications, improve on water management through proper use, repair and maintenance of the infrastructure and generally to educate the farmers {{to take responsibility for their}} schemes...|$|E
