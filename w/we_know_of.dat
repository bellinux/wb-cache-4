5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} elsewhere {{and he was a}} servant of the regime. He was not exactly a shining liberal or Social Democrat. Mostly, he was interested in his career.|$|E
5|$|During series two, the Torchwood website, www.torchwood.org.uk also hosted an {{interactive}} online game written by series writer Phil Ford. Updated weekly with the airing {{of the new}} episodes, the website features specially shot footage with Gareth David-Lloyd in character as Ianto debriefing and informing the 'player' with regards to their mission. Throughout both series one and two, the interactive websites co-written by James Goss featured electronic literature content (such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters) which depict aspects of Ianto and the other Torchwood characters' work and personal lives. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature in hardback form, along with new original material, some of which expands on what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> Ianto. For example, it introduces his sister, Rhiannon and brother-in-law Johnny; Rhiannon and Johnny later appear in 2009's third televised series.|$|E

25|$|Josquin des Prez was {{the most}} celebrated {{composer}} during the High Renaissance, and during his career enjoyed the patronage of three popes. Equally at ease in secular and religious music, he can be considered the first musical genius <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{relations}} between the people inhabiting the British Isles {{for as much as}} <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> their history. A Romano-Briton, Patricius, later known as Saint Patrick, brought Christianity to Ireland and, following the fall of the Roman Empire, missionaries from Ireland re-introduced Christianity to Britain.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advance}} of Large-scale {{sequencing}} strategies, genomes of microorganisms in the acid mine drainage community are directly sequenced from the environment. The nearly full genomic constructs allows new understanding {{of the community and}} able to reconstruct their metabolic pathways. Our knowledge of Acidophiles in acid mine drainage remains rudimentary: <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> many more species associated with ARD than we can establish roles and functions.|$|E

5000|$|Love {{comes back}} to his vacant dwelling, The old, old Love that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> yore! <b>We</b> see him stand by the open door, With his great eyes sad, and his bosom swelling. He makes as though in our arms {{repelling}} He fain would lie as he lay before; Love {{comes back to}} his vacant dwelling, The old, old Love that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> yore! Ah ! who shall help us from over-spelling That sweet, forgotten, forbidden lore? E'en as we doubt, in our hearts once more, With a rush of tears to our eyelids welling, Love comes back to his vacant dwelling.|$|R

25|$|The Fifty Bibles of Constantine were Bibles in the Greek {{language}} commissioned in 331 by Constantine I {{and prepared}} by Eusebius of Caesarea. They {{were made for}} the use of the Bishop of Constantinople in the growing number of churches in that very new city. Eusebius quoted the letter of commission in his Life of Constantine, and it is the only surviving source from which <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the existence of the Bibles.|$|E
25|$|Fearchar of Ross or Ferchar mac in tSagairt (Fearchar mac an t-sagairt, often anglicized as Farquhar MacTaggart), was {{the first}} of the Scottish Ó Beólláin (O’Beolan, Beolan) family who {{received}} by Royal Grant the lands and Title of Mormaer or Earl of Ross (1223–1251) <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> from the thirteenth century, whose career brought Ross into the fold of the Scottish kings for the first time, and who is remembered as the founder of the Earldom of Ross.|$|E
25|$|In the 10th century, the Buwayhid dynasty {{encouraged}} the undertaking of extensive works in astronomy, {{such as the}} construction of a large-scale instrument with which observations were made in the year 950. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> this by recordings made in the zij of astronomers such as Ibn al-Alam. The great astronomer Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi was patronised by prince Adud o-dowleh, who systematically revised Ptolemy's catalogue of stars. Sharaf al-Daula also established a similar observatory in Baghdad. And reports by Ibn Yunus and al-Zarqall in Toledo and Cordoba indicate the use of sophisticated instruments for their time.|$|E

6000|$|In short, {{little as}} <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the {{youngest}} Miss Piper, {{he was the}} last man we should have suspected her to select as an admirer. What <b>we</b> did <b>know</b> <b>of</b> their public relations, purely commercial ones, implied the reverse of any cordial understanding. The provisioning of the Piper household was entrusted to Del, with other practical odds and ends of housekeeping, not ornamental, and the following {{is said to be a}} truthful record of one of their overheard interviews at the store:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Security: [...] "We {{preferred}} {{to be conservative}} about security, {{and in some cases}} did not select algorithms with exceptional performance, largely because something about them made us 'nervous,' even though <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> no clear attack against the full algorithm." ...|$|R
25|$|The next episode <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> in Huxley's {{life when}} he {{suffered}} a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS Rattlesnake in 1848. Huxley had further periods of depression {{at the end of}} 1871, and again in 1873. Finally, in 1884 he sank into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of only 60. This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate bi-polar disorder) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{recorded}} rituals <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> is Niiname-sai, the ceremony in which the Emperor offers newly harvested rice to the kami to secure their blessing for a bountiful harvest. A yearly festival, Niiname-sai is also performed when a new Emperor comes to power, in which case it is called Onamesai. In the ceremony the Emperor offers crops from the new harvest to the kami, including rice, fish, fruits, soup, and stew. The Emperor first feasts with the deities, then the guests. The feast {{could go on for}} some time; for example, the Showa Emperor's feast spanned two days.|$|E
25|$|His death date, as {{mentioned}} above, {{derives from the}} Annals of Ulster, which notes s.a. 1020 Finnloech m. Ruaidhri, ri Alban, a suis occisus est, that is, that Findláech was killed by his own people. No {{reason for this is}} given, but the logical thing is to conclude that his successor, his nephew Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti, {{had something to do with}} it. Indeed, the Annals of Tigernach tell us that the sons of Máel Brigte were responsible; the only sons <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> are Máel Coluim and Gille Coemgáin, both of whom evidently benefited from the killing, as both succeeded to the throne.|$|E
6000|$|... "The facts {{bearing on}} that inquiry. Those are"--Mr. Guppy tells them {{off on his}} fingers--"what <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> his habits, when you saw him last, what his {{condition}} was then, the discovery that we made, and how we made it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --We <b>knew</b> {{perfectly}} well <b>of</b> course that {{though it was}} bound {{to come to the}} light he would find considerable difficulty in endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> course {{perfectly well}}-- ...|$|R

25|$|The Old Elamite period began around 2700 BC. Historical records {{mention the}} conquest of Elam by Enmebaragesi the Sumerian king of Kish in Mesopotamia. Three dynasties ruled during this period. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> twelve kings {{of each of the}} first two dynasties, those of Awan (or Avan; c. 2400 – c. 2100) and Simashki (c. 2100 – c. 1970), from a list from Susa dating to the Old Babylonian period. Two Elamite dynasties said to have {{exercised}} brief control over parts of Sumer in very early times include Awan and Hamazi; and likewise, several of the stronger Sumerian rulers, such as Eannatum of Lagash and Lugal-anne-mundu of Adab, are recorded as temporarily dominating Elam.|$|E
25|$|The first ajaw, or king, of B'aakal that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> was K'uk Balam (Quetzal Jaguar), who governed {{for four}} years {{starting}} in the year 431. After him, a king came to power, nicknamed Casper by archaeologists. The next two kings were probably Caspers sons. Little was known about the first of these, B'utz Aj Sak Chiik, until 1994, when a tablet was found describing a ritual for the king. The first tablet mentioned his successor Ahkal Mo' Naab I as a teenage prince, and therefore {{it is believed that}} there was a family relation between them. For unknown reasons, Akhal Mo' Naab I had great prestige, so the kings who succeeded him were proud to be his descendants.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} Pyramid is {{interpreted}} by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed– hence {{the title of his}} book Pyramid of Secrets. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin {{and there is no way}} of knowing what might have been contained in the chambers that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> today. Once again, Alford’s theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is central to his case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J.P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid’s masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers.|$|E
6000|$|A faint snuffling sound, as before, {{was heard}} from the officiating priests, but <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> nothing more. It is said that old Louis Philippe was {{standing}} at the catafalque, whither the Prince de Joinville advanced and said, [...] "Sire, I bring you the body of the Emperor Napoleon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of,</b> but I {{believe she}} did tell him everything, and I think, Flora, {{he ought to}} know everything, {{especially}} now. I never could bear the way the Mackenzies used to have of thinking their parents must be like enemies, and keeping secrets from them." ...|$|R

25|$|Some of the {{philosophical}} languages of the 17th–18th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages {{as well as to}} disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; Solresol by François Sudre (1787–1862), a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.|$|E
25|$|While Buddhist art is stylistically {{distinct}} from secular art, {{the style of}} paintings in the caves often reflects that of contemporary secular painting (insofar as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> this), especially those depicting secular scenes. Donor figures are generally depicted in secular style, and may include secular events associated with them. For example, scenes depicting General Zhang Yichao, who ruled over Dunhuang in a quasi-autonomous manner during the Late Tang period, include a commemoration of his victory over the Tibetans in 848. The portraits of donors increased in size during the period ruled by the Cao family who succeeded the Zhang family. The Caos formed alliances with the Uyghurs (Uyghur Gansu Kingdom and Kingdom of Qocho) and the Saka Kingdom of Khotan and their portraits are featured prominently {{in some of the}} caves.|$|E
25|$|Cap {{formation}} {{is now seen as}} {{closely related to}} the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 micrometre in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell’s dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In view of what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle moves {{toward the back of the}} cell.|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite," [...] said Soames in a {{suitably}} low voice, [...] "but {{we shall}} have to begin again to get evidence.
