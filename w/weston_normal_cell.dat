40|$|Killing of proliferating <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> limits {{chemotherapy}} of cancer. Several {{strategies to}} selectively protect <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> were previously suggested. Here we further explored {{the protection of}} <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> from cell cycle-specific chemotherapeutic agents such as mitotic inhibitors (MI). We focused on a long-term cell recovery (rather than on a short-term cell survival) after a 3 -day exposure to MI (paclitaxel and nocodazole). In three <b>normal</b> human <b>cell</b> types (RPE, NKE, WI- 38 t cells) but not in cancer cells with mutant p 53, pre-treatment with nutlin- 3 a, a non-genotoxic inducer of wt p 53, caused G 1 and/or G 2 arrest, thus preventing lethal mitotic arrest caused by MI and allowing <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> to recover after removal of MI. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, potentiated the protective effect of nutlin- 3 a in <b>normal</b> <b>cells.</b> Also, a combination of rapamycin and metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, induced G 1 and G 2 arrest selectively in <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> and thereby protected them from MI. A combination of metformin and rapamycin also protected <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> in low glucose conditions, whereas in contrast it was cytotoxic for cancer cells. Based on these data and {{the analysis of the}} literature, we suggest that a rational combination of metformin and rapamycin can potentiate chemotherapy with mitotic inhibitors against cancer, while protecting <b>normal</b> <b>cells,</b> thus further increasing the therapeutic window...|$|R

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} the radiation-induced bystander effect in mitochondrial mutant <b>cells</b> and in <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> treated with mitochondrial inhibitors. Although much {{research has been}} performed on the bystander effect, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Cells without intact mitochondrial DNA {{have been shown to}} lack the bystander effect, which is an energy-dependent process. Based on these findings, cells harboring mutations in the mitochondrial genes responsible for ATP synthesis, and <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> treated with mitochondrial inhibitors, were hypothesized to show a decreased bystander effect when compared to <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> that were not treated with the mitochondrial inhibitors. Radiation-induced bystander effects were analyzed in normal and mitochondrial mutant human lymphoblastoid cells using the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. The results indicate that the mitochondrial mutant cells do not exhibit the bystander effect while the <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> do. Both the normal and mitochondrial mutant cells were found to show a dose-responsive increase in DNA damage upon direct exposure to radiation. The generation of and response to bystander signals in the normal and mitochondrial mutant cells were then analyzed by evaluating the radiation-induced bystander effects between each possible pair-wise combination of <b>normal</b> and mutant <b>cell</b> lines. <b>Normal</b> <b>cells</b> were found to generate and to respond to bystander signals, while the mitochondrial mutant cells neither generated nor responded to bystander signals. To determine whether <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> behave similar to the mutant cells when their mitochondrial ATP synthesis is inhibited, the radiation-induced bystander effect in <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> treated with mitochondrial inhibitors was evaluated. The results indicate that the <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> treated with rotenone or oligomycin do not exhibit the bystander effect. To determine the time period during which the inhibition was effective, <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> were treated with the inhibitors at different times before, during and after radiation. The results indicate that <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> do not exhibit the bystander effect when the inhibitors were added 24 hours before radiation and were removed immediately after radiation. Similarly, <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> treated with the inhibitors after radiation did not exhibit the bystander effect. However, when the inhibitors were added just prior to radiation and were removed immediately after radiation, <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> did not show an inhibition of bystander effect, indicating that this short period of treatment might not be sufficient to cause the inhibition.

Finding tumor-spe-cific therapy and exploiting the differences between <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> and tumor cells has led to strategies targeting oncogenic mutations or the deficiency of tumor suppressor pathways in cancers. Alternatively, focusing efforts to protect <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> from {{the side effects of}} chemotherapy has gained much interest, and harnessing cell cycle checkpoints to target tumor <b>cells</b> while sparing <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> is an attractive strategy.

An unlimited supply of <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> {{is useful to}} produce biological tissues, study metabolic pathways, test drugs, produce biomolecules, etc. Strategies currently available transform rather than merely immortalize cells. Immortalization and tumor transformation are two distinct, yet partly overlapping processes. <b>Normal</b> <b>cells</b> work on a biological clock that controls timing and number of replication cycles. Once the maximum number is reached, cells come to age and die. During immortalization, cells undergo continuous replication but maintain morphology and metabolism of <b>normal</b> <b>cells.</b> Cells that replicate continuously has a higher probability to accumulate gene mutations and genomic alterations, therefore, immortalized cells may eventually acquire irreversible changes such as tumor features. As a result, tumor cells {{have little in common}} with <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> and this makes transformed cells unusable for most of the studies. During my dissertation internship I have developed a system to induce <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> to replicate and live beyond physiological lifespan without altering their normal phenotype. The idea derives from previous observations showing that specific genes induced in <b>normal</b> <b>cells</b> and expressed constantly and at high levels transform at high efficiency. The system developed delivers the same group of genes but their expression is controlled by an inducible promoter activated by a doxicicline induced transactivator. Transient expression of these genes induces cells to replicate and cell cycling continues as long as these genes are expressed. The <b>cells</b> retain their <b>normal</b> phenotype and capacity to replicate in time. I’ve tested the immortalization system in human fibroblasts and I have found that replication can be induced in time. During treatment, cells tend to form cellular aggregates as tumor cells. These <b>cells</b> return to <b>normal</b> morphology within two days after removal of activator. The induced immortalization did not change genomic, morphological and metabolic features compared to <b>normal</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
