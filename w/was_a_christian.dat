5|$|Gil's {{religious}} beliefs have changed significantly over his lifetime. Originally, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian,</b> but was later influenced by Eastern philosophy and religion, and, later still, explored African spirituality. He {{is now an}} agnostic. He practices yoga and is a vegetarian.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with Sigebert, Ecgric {{seems to have}} remained a pagan. There {{is no evidence that}} he was baptised or that he promoted Christianity in East Anglia, according to D. P. Kirby, who notes that Bede wrote nothing that could imply that Ecgric <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian,</b> in contrast to his praise of Sigeberht’s efforts to establish Christianity in East Anglia.|$|E

50|$|Lin's {{relation}} with Christianity {{changed over the}} years. His father, of course, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> second-generation <b>Christian,</b> but at Tsinghua, Lin asked himself {{what it meant to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> in China. <b>Being</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> meant acceptance of Western science and progress, but Lin became angry that being <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> also meant losing touch with China's culture and his own personal identity.|$|R
5|$|Notable Scientists have {{included}} Directors of Central Intelligence William H. Webster and Admiral Stansfield M. Turner; Richard Nixon's {{chief of staff}} H. R. Haldeman; and Chief Domestic Advisor John Ehrlichman. the viscountess Nancy Astor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> Scientist, as was naval officer Charles Lightoller, who survived {{the sinking of the}} Titanic in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was a Protestant Christian and {{a member}} of the Church of South India (CSI). Whilst {{studying}} in Colombo he became a member of the Church of England as the CSI had no presence in the capital. Later, when the CSI established a church in Colombo, Chelvanayakam worshipped there. Though a Christian, Chelvanayakam absorbed many of the values of Hinduism. He claimed he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> by religion and a Hindu by culture.|$|E
5|$|In about 630, Christianity was {{permanently}} re-established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly. Ecgric, who {{may have}} been a sub-king until the abdication of Sigeberht in around 634, seems to have remained a pagan. There is no evidence that Ecgric adopted or promoted Christianity: Bede wrote nothing to imply that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian,</b> in contrast to his praise of the devout Sigeberht, the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
5|$|Offa <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> {{king who}} came into {{conflict}} with the Church, particularly with Jaenberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Offa persuaded Pope Adrian I to divide the archdiocese of Canterbury in two, creating a new archdiocese of Lichfield. This reduction {{in the power of}} Canterbury may have been motivated by Offa's desire to have an archbishop consecrate his son Ecgfrith as king, since it is possible Jaenberht refused to perform the ceremony, which took place in 787. Offa had a dispute with the Bishop of Worcester, which was settled at the Council of Brentford in 781.|$|E
5|$|Salih's wazīr <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> named Tadrus ibn al-Hasan, who wielded {{significant}} influence over him, according to Ibn al-'Adim, and accompanied Salih {{on all of}} his military campaigns. Aleppine Christians would largely monopolize the post of wazīr under later Mirdasid rulers, {{and members of the}} community managed significant parts of the emirate's economy. Their major role in the emirate indicated Salih's reliance on local Christian support, the existence of a large Christian minority in Aleppo and an effort to establish friendly ties with the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was {{punched in the}} midriff by the first person he spoke to, so he decided that Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E
5|$|Alt Clut (named {{after the}} Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, the Medieval {{capital of the}} Strathclyde region) may have had its origins with the Damnonii people of Ptolemy's Geographia. Two kings are known from near {{contemporary}} sources in this early period. The first is Coroticus or Ceretic (Ceredig), known as the recipient of a letter from Saint Patrick, and stated by a 7th-century biographer to have been king of the Height of the Clyde, Dumbarton Rock, placing him {{in the second half}} of the 5th century. From Patrick's letter it is clear that Ceretic <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian,</b> and it is likely that the ruling class of the area were also Christians, at least in name. His descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba.|$|E
5|$|Around 1563 Lopez married Sarah Anes (b. 1550), {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of another New Christian refugee from the Portuguese Inquisition, the merchant Dunstan Anes, who {{had settled in}} London in 1540. According to Samuel, both the Anes and Lopez households secretly practised Judaism, which was then illegal in England, while outwardly conforming as Anglicans. Other scholars are ambivalent on the matter; Lopez would always insist that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian.</b> Roderigo and Sarah had four sons and two daughters, of whom at least the eldest five—Ellyn (Elinor), Ambrose, Douglas, William and Ann—were baptised within the hospital precincts at St Bartholomew-the-Less between 1564 and 1579. Lopez's brother Lewis lived with them in Holborn; a second brother, Diego Lopes Aleman, became a merchant in Antwerp and Venice.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} when Æthelberht became a Christian. It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he already <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed Æthelberht to {{consider}} becoming a Christian {{before the arrival of}} the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha was that Æthelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that Æthelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence, might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control. It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation—he turned back to Rome, asking to be released from the mission—is an indication that Æthelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.|$|E
5|$|She worked {{steadily}} for {{the next}} two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism and as an adult she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> Scientist for some time.|$|E
