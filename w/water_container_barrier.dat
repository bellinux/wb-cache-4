Liquid damper properties can be widely changed using different shapes of <b>water</b> <b>containers,</b> additional <b>barriers</b> inside, different types of liquid etc. Different types of liquid dampers exist or are proposed by researchers. Main types of liquid dampers are observed and compared in the paper. One of the main disadvantages {{of the majority of}} liquid dampers is that only one main oscillation frequency is damped, that is not enough for the structures, where different vibrations modes are essential simultaneously. Existing solutions of this problem are examined in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{composite}} materials {{are made by}} sintering method. In this research, {{in order to make}} composite material for magnetic refrigeration, we carried out several experiments for the powder consolidation using the shock compaction method and numerical analysis for the behavior of underwater shock wave. The shock compaction method is to consolidate metal powder using underwater shock wave including an ultra-high pressure and high velocity generated by detonation of explosive. Generally, the magnitude of peak pressure and the pressure distribution of underwater shock wave depend on the inner shape of <b>water</b> <b>container</b> {{which is one of the}} parts of high pressure generating device. In this study, we have investigated several <b>water</b> <b>containers</b> using numerical analysis and observation experiments. Therefore, underwater shock wave is affected by the reflected wave generated from the wall of <b>water</b> <b>container</b> and the magnitude of reflected wave depends on the inner angle θ of <b>water</b> <b>container.</b> The pressure and velocity of reflected wave is gradually increased with increasing inner angle θ of <b>water</b> <b>container...</b>|$|R

To assess these possible impacts we undertook detailed household surveys of Ae. aegypti immatures, <b>water</b> storage <b>containers</b> and various socioeconomic factors in three rural communes in southern Viet Nam.
