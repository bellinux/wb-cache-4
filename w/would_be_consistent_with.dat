5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E

This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the conjecture that Attalus' father had been Philetaerus' heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus I was too young when his father died.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> his baptism in 597, which is {{in accord with the}} tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{treating}} Prokofiev as {{a fugitive}} or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider {{him as a}} general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned the compliment by registering in France as {{a citizen of the}} Soviet Union, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and the states of the former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the political developments in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded VIP status when he paid his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the official Soviet concept of art.|$|E
5|$|The {{subjective}} test was rejected {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the {{subjective test}} to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner. If the subjective test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E

5|$|Yule {{asserts that}} the {{additional}} Fulin embassies during the Tang period arrived in 711 and 719 AD, with another in 742 AD {{that may have been}} Nestorian monks. Adshead lists four official diplomatic contacts with Fulin in the Old Book of Tang as occurring in 643, 667, 701, and 719 AD. He speculates that the absence of these missions in Western literary sources can be explained by how the Byzantines typically viewed political relations with powers of the East, as well as the possibility that they were launched on behalf of frontier officials instead of the central government. Yule and Adshead concur that a Fulin diplomatic mission occurred during the reign of Justinian II (r. 685–695 AD; 705–711 AD). Yule claims it occurred in the year of the emperor's death, 711 AD, whereas Adshead contends that it took place in 701 AD during the usurpation of Leontios and the emperor's exile in Crimea, perhaps the reason for its omission in Byzantine records and the source for confusion in Chinese histories about precisely who sent this embassy. Justinian II regained the throne with the aid of Bulgars and a marriage alliance with the Khazars. Adshead therefore believes a mission sent to Tang China <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Justinian II's behaviour, especially if he had knowledge of the permission Empress Wu Zetian granted to Narsieh, son of Peroz III, to march against the Arabs in Central Asia {{at the end of the}} 7th century. The 719 AD Fulin embassy ostensibly came from Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741 AD) to the court of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712–756 AD), during a time when the Byzantine emperor was again reaching out to Eastern powers with a renewed Khazar marriage alliance. The year of this embassy coincided with Xuanzong's refusal to provide aid to the Sogdians of Bukhara and Samarkand against the Arab invasion force. An embassy from the Umayyad Caliphate was received by the Tang court in 732 AD; the Arab victory at the 751 AD Battle of Talas and the An Lushan Rebellion crippled Tang Chinese interventionist efforts in Central Asia.|$|E

25|$|Kelly's {{theory is}} {{sustained}} by the record of archaeological changes and level of activity registered at Stonehenge.

25|$|Based on {{the view}} that the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit is {{identical}} with that of the Book of Esther, some have also identified him as Nebuchadnezzar's ally Cyaxares (ruled 625–585BCE). In certain manuscripts of Tobit, the former is called Achiachar, which, like the Greek Cyaxares, is thought to be derived from Persian Huwaxšaϑra. Depending on the interpretation of Esther 2:5–6, Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish was carried away from Jerusalem with Jeconiah by Nebuchadnezzar, in 597BCE. The view that it was Mordecai <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the identification of Ahasuerus with Cyaxares. Identifications with other Persian monarchs have also been suggested.|$|E
25|$|There {{has always}} been {{speculation}} on why this sacrifice of male mates might occur despite the obvious disadvantage to the sacrificial males. One theory is that once the male has mated, he is unlikely to mate again and so any further extension of his life is of lesser evolutionary benefit than his indirectly contributing nutrition to the eggs. Having more offspring would give the male the advantage of having his genes passed on over other males that might avoid being eaten. This scenario <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Roberts’ hypothesis that old or unfit males get eaten, whilst younger and fitter ones may survive to mate again.|$|E

25|$|The revised 2016 dating of 50,000 {{years ago}} {{is close to the}} time that modern humans reached the area, {{suggesting}} that the initial encounter with H.sapiens caused or contributed to the demise of H.floresiensis.

Skeletal material from modern humans dated to 46,000 years ago has been recovered from the Liang Bua cave, strengthening the evidence for a role for modern humans in the extinction.

25|$|On a {{utilitarian}} basis, {{which has}} traditionally been used in welfare economics, an argument {{can be made for}} richer countries taking on most of the burdens of mitigation (Halsnæs et al., 2007).

If an approach is taken where the interests of poorer people have lower weighting, the result {{is that there is a}} much weaker argument in favour of mitigation action in rich countries.
