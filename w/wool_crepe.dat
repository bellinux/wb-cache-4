40|$|Two {{methods of}} skin {{autograft}} donor site management were evaluated in 40 {{patients in a}} prospective randomised double-blind clinical trial. Donor sites were dressed using either a standard dressing of Jelonet, gauze, <b>wool</b> and a <b>crêpe</b> bandage or Jelonet, Whitehead's varnish (compound iodoform paint BPC), gauze, <b>wool</b> and a <b>crêpe</b> bandage. Donor site pain was assessed daily using a linear analogue scale, and the healing time of the donor area was recorded. Whitehead's varnish significantly reduced donor site pain compared to the standard dressing (P = 0. 0006). Although overall healing time was not statistically different in the two groups, larger donor sites treated with Jelonet and Whitehead's varnish healed more quickly than those treated with the standard dressing alone...|$|R
30|$|The patient {{consented to}} {{exploration}} of the knee, bearing retrieval/exchange or revision to total knee replacement. The knee joint was explored through the old mini anteromedial incision. Both femoral and tibial components {{were found to be}} well-fixed with no macroscopic evidence of burnishing, abrasions or scratching over the metal surfaces. The anterior cruciate ligament and collateral ligaments were intact. Intraoperatively, the dislocated bearing could not be retrieved through the mini anteromedial approach. A trial reduction with a size 7 medium meniscus provided a stable articulation with no impingement, no varus or valgus instability, and no lift off of the trial meniscus. It was decided not to explore the knee through a posterior approach to retrieve the meniscus. A definitive bearing was inserted and the wound was closed in layers. The knee joint was supported with <b>wool</b> and <b>crepe</b> bandages. Total surgical time for the procedure was 1  h and no additional antibiotics were administered.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Postoperative knee {{swelling}} {{is common}} and impairs early postoperative function following total knee arthroplasty. It was hypothesised {{that the use}} of a short-stretch, inelastic compression bandage would reduce knee swelling and improve pain and early function. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide preliminary data and test feasibility with a view to informing a larger, future trial. Methods Fifty consecutive patients selected for primary total knee arthroplasty underwent distance randomisation to receive a short-stretch, inelastic compression bandage or a standard <b>wool</b> and <b>crepe</b> bandage for the first 240 h postoperatively. Study feasibility including recruitment rates, retention rates and complications were analysed. The Oxford Knee Score, the EQ- 5 D- 3 L index score, knee swelling, knee range of motion, visual analogue pain score and length of stay were compared between groups. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed adjusting for the preoperative measurement. Results Sixty-eight percent of eligible patients were recruited into the trial.

Quidam was the first Cirque du Soleil show to use everyday clothing for the outfits, although those in the acrobatic acts are modified.

40|$|Background: Enhanced {{recovery}} programmes {{in total}} knee arthroplasty are well established. Post-operative knee swelling is common and impairs early post-operative function. The {{use of a}} short-stretch, inelastic compression bandage is hypothesised to reduce knee swelling and improve pain and early function. A {{study was designed to}} test feasibility with a view to informing a larger, future trial and to provide preliminary data. Methods/design: This is a randomised controlled feasibility study. Fifty consecutive patients selected for primary total knee arthroplasty will be enrolled in the trial. Patients with a BMI > 35, latex allergy or neurological or peripheral vascular disease are excluded. Patients are randomised by distance randomisation to receive a compression bandage for 24 hours after surgery or a standard <b>wool</b> and <b>crepe</b> bandage. The bandages are applied by one of two consultant surgeons who have had training with their application. Knee swelling, range of motion and pain scores will be compared pre-operatively and at day 1, day 2 and at 6 weeks between groups. The Oxford knee score and EQ- 5 D health status will be compared pre-operatively and at 6 months between groups. Recruitment rates, retention rates, resource allocation, completeness of data collection, and tolerance and complications with the compression bandage are recorded. Descriptive statistics are used to calculate a standard deviation for post-operative knee swelling in the groups and to perform a power calculation incorporating anticipated patient retention rates to inform a future trial. Preliminary data will be analysed using the independent samples t-test for equal distributions and the Mann-Whitney U for unequal distributions with the significance denoted at P < 0. 05. Discussion: Enhanced recovery programmes have revolutionized the management of total knee arthroplasty. There is a paucity of clinical data regarding the efficacy of compression bandages. Large, randomised controlled trials are uncommon in orthopaedic surgery. The results of this study will provide feasibility and preliminary data prior to the construction of a larger, multicentre study. ...|$|R
50|$|The idea of unisex {{dressing}} {{originated in}} the 1960s when designers such as Pierre Cardin and Rudi Gernreich created garments, such as stretch jersey tunics or leggings, meant to be worn by both males and females. The impact of unisex expands more broadly to encompass various themes in fashion including androgyny, mass-market retail, and conceptual clothing. The fashion trends of the 1970s, such as sheepskin jackets, flight jackets, duffel coats, and unstructured clothing influenced men to attend social gatherings without a tuxedo jacket and to accessorize in new ways. Some men's styles blended the sensuality and expressiveness despite the conservative trend, the growing gay-rights movement and an emphasis on youth allowed for a new freedom to experiment with style, fabrics such as <b>wool</b> <b>crepe,</b> which had previously been associated with women's attire was used by designers when creating male clothing.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline of}} formal wear {{led to the}} rise of streetwear fashion. High-end and luxury brands are {{starting}} to develop “luxury sportswear”, for example Alexander Wang, Gucci, and DKNY. Among this type of “luxury sportswear”, luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like silk organza, washed satin, leather, neoprene, and <b>wool</b> <b>crepe</b> were used to produce the “luxury sportswear”. These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season. Details of the designs in “luxury sportswear” looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, “luxury” and “minimalism” were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences. Common mix-and-match combination of “luxury sportswear” on streetwear are track pants under basketball shorts, with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; And light colored pencil skirts, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, which is cut in satin or tweed for women.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConclusionThree-layer {{compressive}} bandages {{are slightly}} {{more effective than}} four-layer compressive bandages for healing venous leg ulcers. SummaryOne hundred thirty-three patients with venous ulcers treated in a single clinic were stratified according to ulcer size and then randomized to receive three-layer or four-layer bandages. Ulcers were stratified by calculating the maximum length and breadth of the ulcer and multiplying these values. Ulcers were grouped into small (> 0. 25 –< 2. 5 cm 2), medium (2. 5 - 25 cm 2), and large (25 - 100 cm 2) groups. Ulcers smaller than 0. 25 cm 2 or larger than 100 cm 2 were excluded. Patients were excluded if they had diabetes, connective tissue disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, or human immunodeficiency virus, or were positive for sickle cell disease. Three-layer bandages consisted of a hypoallergenic paste, followed by a compression bandage, followed by Tubigrip. Four-layer bandages were comprised of orthopedic <b>wool,</b> a <b>crepe</b> bandage followed by a compressive bandage, and finally a Coban bandage. Patients were followed up for 1 year. Time to complete healing, defined as “restoration of entirely unbroken skin integrity without any purulent discharge after removal of all scabs,” was the primary end point. Complete ulcer healing occurred in 80 % of patients treated with three-layer bandages and 65 % of patients treated with the four-layer bandaging technique (P =. 031). The median time to complete healing was 12 and 16 weeks, respectively (P =. 04). The difference in healing did not become apparent until after 20 weeks of treatment. Large venous ulcers {{were less likely to}} heal. The adverse effect of ulcer size on healing was apparent in both the three-layer and four-layer bandage groups. Previous venous thrombosis or popliteal reflux did not affect ulcer healing. CommentBoth four-layer and three-layer bandaging techniques are effective in management of venous leg ulcers, with three-layer bandages apparently slightly more efficacious. Neither technique is suitable for all patients. In some patients allergy will develop to the paste component of the three-layer bandage, and other patients find the four-layer bandage bulky and uncomfortable. Not all forms of compression therapy are suitable for all patients. Physician and patient willingness to explore alternative management techniques is crucial to success of conservative therapy of venous ulcers...|$|R
40|$|IN {{the past}} 30 years {{there has been}} an {{increasingly}} scientific approach to sporting activities of all types, and athletes and their advisers have begun to ask for a number of specialist services. With this in mind it was decided to open a sports injury clinic, initially as a pilot scheme, in the accident and emergency department of the Belfast City Hospital. All acute or serious sporting injuries referred to this hospital are treated in the accident and emergency department in the first instance, but this clinic was started with the main objective of following up these acute injuries more closely and treating the more chronic injuries. Through the goodwill of other departments particularly physiotherapy, the clinic provides the facilities and expertise to deal with these problems. This paper reviews the work carried out by the clinic during its first 2 V 2 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinic takes place on Monday afternoons in the accident and emergency department. In one session I see all the new patients including some acute injuries from the weekend. A second session is devoted to reviews and consultation with the physiptherapist. Initially the clinic was "open to all " but soon, due to rapidly increasing numbers, this immediate facility had to be curtailed and a referral system adopted. Patients are now referred by either their general practitioners, the university student health centre, or coaches. Investigations, apart from radiographs, have been minimal, and the clinic has not placed an unreasonable burden upon supporting services. Treatment provided consists of physiotherapy, supportive measures, drugs and advice. Close liaison is maintained with the physiotherapist who may treat a proportion of the patients, after clinical assessment, on the day of their initial visit and then continue on a regular out-patient basis. The physiotherapeutic techniques available include ultrasound, infra-red, faradism, massage, friction, weight training, supervised exercise, stretch/mobilisation, and general advice on training. Supportive treatment consists of <b>wool</b> and <b>crepe</b> bandages, plaster of Paris, tubular supports and various conventional splints. The drugs mainly used are analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents. Local steroid injections are given when necessary...|$|R
