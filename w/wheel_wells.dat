25|$|The crew did {{not notice}} that the left brakes had been dragged during its take off roll and had {{overheated}}. The overheated brakes were retracted by the crew and entered the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> The <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> subsequently closed to secure the wheels. The <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> did not have sufficient cooling, and so {{the temperature of the}} brakes continued to rise, reaching as high as 600 degree Celsius.|$|E
25|$|This {{calculation}} is not {{commonly used}} to get the outer diameter for a regular vehicle. Though, the truck builders and off-road fans use it {{to find out the}} right wheel diameter, that will fit right into the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> For the US vehicles, the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> capacity is measured in inches, so when the outer tire diameter is calculated, it is normally compared with the wheel well index. This is done in order to prevent tire from rubbing against control arms and fenders.|$|E
25|$|The {{undercarriage}} mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage {{doors were}} bowed {{in cross section}} allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> and landing gear pivot points.|$|E

25|$|Fender skirts {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front fender skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|E
25|$|Because of heat {{generated}} at Mach 2 cruise, {{not only the}} crew compartment, but the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> and electronics bay were pressurized and air conditioned. The B-58 utilized {{one of the first}} extensive applications of aluminum honeycomb panels, which bonded outer and inner aluminum skins to a honeycomb of aluminum or fiberglass.|$|E
25|$|When {{air flows}} around the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> it gets {{disturbed}} by the rims of the vehicles, and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow smoother around the wheel well smooth wheel covers are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are hub caps with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag, however, it may cause the brakes to heat up quicker because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. This is why this modification is more commonly seen with high efficiency vehicles, rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The Bf 109 G-series was {{developed}} from the largely identical F-series airframe, although there were detail differences. Modifications included a reinforced wing structure, an internal bullet-proof windscreen, the use of heavier, welded framing for the cockpit transparencies, and additional light-alloy armour for the fuel tank. It was originally intended that the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> would incorporate small doors to cover the outer portion of the wheels when retracted. To incorporate these the outer wheel bays were squared off. Two small inlet scoops for additional cooling of the spark plugs were added {{on both sides of}} the forward engine cowlings. A less obvious difference was the omission of the boundary layer bypass outlets, which had been a feature of the F-series, on the upper radiator flaps.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the stressed-skin construction, Reggiane introduced several advanced features on the Re.2000, such as a modern structure, which was considerably more advanced than the ones used in Macchi's and other Italian fighters of the time, along with an elliptical wing profile. Overall, the design possessed greater aerodynamic sophistication in comparison to other Italian rivals rivals such as the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200. The Re.2000 was furnished with retractable landing gear; the main gear retracted via the Curtiss method, the wheels rotating around to face flat within the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> when retracted. The atypical fairing covered the landing gear's actuation mechanism, while the legs incorporated hydraulic shock absorbers and drag struts to effective absorb loads; pneumatic brakes were also fitted. The tail wheel was both retractable and steerable.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} sound {{generated}} by flow over cavities {{at high speed}} has been well funded {{by the federal government}} so a considerable amount of effort has been made. The problem relates to flow over aircraft cavities in flight such as bomb bays or <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> Flow over a cavity in a surface can result in excitation of a feedback loop and nearly pure tones. Unlike the edge tone noted above, the cavity edge is typically square, but also can be an edge as part of a thin structural shell. Cavities can be separated into shallow or deep ones, the difference being that for deep cavities a Class III (acoustical) feedback path may be controlling. Shallow cavities are addressed here and are those in which the cavity length L is greater than the cavity depth D.|$|E

25|$|While {{on a tour}} of the United States, Caldwell visited Curtiss-Wright in Buffalo, New York. On August 6, 1942, he {{was invited}} to come on an {{acceptance}} re-flight of a Curtiss C-46 Commando, the latest transport aircraft destined for overseas use. The aircraft was also loaded with Curtiss executives, and flown by Chief Production Test Pilot Herbert O. Fisher. The landing gear became stuck in a three-quarters down position, and after an extended eight-hour attempt to release the gear, Fisher calmly belly-landed the C-46. With the weight of the aircraft gently pushing the gear back into the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells,</b> a minimum of damage resulted. Caldwell had taken over as the co-pilot on the eight hours of circling over Buffalo, receiving certification that he was checked out on the C-46, under the tutelage of Fisher. Finishing his tour at Curtiss-Wright, Caldwell went on to visit the North American Aviation factory and was able to personally evaluate their new P-51 fighter, then in development.|$|E
25|$|A {{new body}} style for 1953 was the Skylark convertible. The Buick Roadmaster Skylark {{was one of}} three {{specialty}} convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta and the Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado. The Skylark featured open <b>wheel</b> <b>wells,</b> a drastically lowered belt line, a four-inch-chop from the standard Roadmaster's windshield, the absence of VentiPorts and a new Sweepspear that anticipated Buick’s 1954 styling. Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels and a solid boot cover were standard. At $5,000 only 1,690 units were produced. The following year, and for one year only, it would become its own series built on a Century body. This was the last year for the Roadmaster Estate, and it was the last wood-bodied station wagon mass-produced in the United States. Its body was a product of Ionia Manufacturing which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964. Priced at $4,031, the Estate was second in price only to the Skylark, with 670 being sold. Overall Roadmaster sales bounced back up to 79,137.|$|E
500|$|VOSES uses miniature, {{all-weather}} audio speakers {{that are}} placed on the hybrid's <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> and emit specific sounds based on the direction the car is moving {{in order to minimize}} noise pollution and to maximize acoustic information for pedestrians. If the car is moving forward, the sounds are only projected in the forward direction; and if the car is turning left or right, the sound changes on the left or right appropriately. The company argues that chirps, beeps and alarms are more distracting than useful, and that the best sounds for alerting pedestrians are carlike, such as [...] "the soft purr of an engine or the slow roll of tires across pavement." [...] One of the EVA's external sound systems was designed specifically for the Toyota Prius.|$|E

25|$|On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420, a Metro II {{flying from}} Dorval International Airport (now Montreal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, {{experienced}} a left <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> fire when the overheated brake and wheel assembly was retracted into the enclosed <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> The heat dissipated to the tire {{and the surrounding}} structures, eventually causing a fire. During the attempted emergency landing at Mirabel Airport, the landing gear was extended on short final and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards, the fuselage pivoted {{to the left and}} struck the ground. All 11 occupants were fatally injured.|$|R
2500|$|The final B-body Caprice was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a [...] "beached whale" [...] and [...] "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being {{the removal of the}} skirted rear <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> in favor of more conventional, open <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> This applied only to the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan {{in the form of a}} restyled side window between the back door and C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had 4 sides and lacked the sharp corner pointed toward the rear), and the wagon was given the same mirrors as the sedan. In 1996 the Impala SS was exported to Middle Eastern markets badged as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel & the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} retracted into bays {{on either}} side of the fuselage and could be easily removed, saving [...] of weight when the aircraft was operating as a pure flying-boat. The Seagull was also fitted with an arrestor hook for carrier landings; mounting points for JATO rockets were located just above the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A brake {{overheat}} warning system should have warned the crew. However, [...] a brake {{overheat warning}} system was not required {{on the type of}} the aircraft, so the crew of Flight 420 did not know that a fire had developed. Since hydraulic lines were located near the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells,</b> the fire ruptured the aircraft's hydraulic line, which caused the fire to intensify.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{almost all}} modern cars mount their side mirrors on the doors, {{normally}} at the A-pillar, {{rather than the}} wings (fenders - portion of body above the <b>wheel</b> <b>well),</b> the [...] "wing mirror" [...] term is still frequently used.|$|R
50|$|The {{manually}} retractable {{main undercarriage}} {{is composed of}} a single 350 x 135mm diameter wheel retracting backwards into the <b>wheel</b> <b>well,</b> which is closed off by doors operated by the undercarriage legs, and a fixed 200 X 50mm tail-wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Finding {{room for}} the KY-28 in fighter {{aircraft}} was difficult. The Navy improvised successfully, for example tucking KY-28s into the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> of F-4 Phantoms, while the Air Force initiated a formal modification program that took years to complete.|$|R
2500|$|Approximately 4586 PCC {{cars were}} {{purchased}} by United States transit companies – 1052 Pullman Standards and 3534 by St. Louis. [...] Most transit companies purchased one type, but Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Shaker Heights operated both examples. [...] The Baltimore Transit Co. (BTC) considered the Pullman cars of superior construction. [...] The St. Louis cars {{had a more}} esthetically pleasing design with a [...] more rounded front and rear plus other fancy frills. [...] The BTC found the Pullman cars easier to work on. [...] St. Louis cars had compound curved <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Debonair {{was largely}} {{the result of}} former General Motors {{designer}} Hans S. Bretzner, while the result was largely influenced by the 1961 Lincoln Continental designed by Elwood Engel, {{as evidenced by the}} slab-sided body panels, squared <b>wheel</b> <b>wells,</b> extended protrusions {{at the front of the}} vehicle, wraparound turnsignals in the front, and tapered fins at the rear, with a rear tail light cluster, exhibiting a [...] "Continental-esque" [...] appearance.
