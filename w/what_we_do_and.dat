25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: [...] "You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> will turn against us.

2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen {{the way that it}} does.|$|E

2500|$|NetherRealm Studios {{collaborated with}} DC Comics {{throughout}} Injustice 2s entire development process, including conceptualizing characters and determining {{the direction of}} the story. As with Injustice: Gods Among Us, NetherRealm was afforded a lot of freedom with DC Comics' properties when designing characters. Lead Designer John Edwards stated that all of their design ideas had to pass through DC Comics' approval process; though, the company had rarely rejected them. This allowed the developers to create a large variety of costume variations and visually distinct items inspired by decades of source material. “It's a mutual respect,” explained Art Director Steve Beran. “They respect <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> we respect all their characters. We are fans of their characters and, I think, art-wise and design-wise, we put a lot of detail that hardcore fans will like. We tried to really honor every character.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The term “open” in open theism {{involves}} {{two important}} ideas: (1) God {{is open to}} what creatures do (God is affected by creatures) and (2) the future is open in that there are multiple possible futures (the branching tree model of the future or like a create your own story book). [...] Because God is open to us, God enters into genuine give-and-receive relations with creatures. For example, God truly responds to our prayers. God responds to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> adjusts the divine plans, if necessary. For Sanders, God has flexible strategies for accomplish divine goals (there {{is more than one}} route to the destination). There is not a blueprint which God is following for the construction of the kingdom. Rather, it “is a lot like jazz, a melody with a good deal of improvisation.” Open theists are clear to affirm with other freewill theists, however, that even though God has changing emotions, plans, and actions, the divine nature does not change. God’s love, wisdom, power, faithfulness, etc. are unchangeable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights nearly {{resulted in the}} band breaking-up once again, but also saw HIM playing the United States for the first time; a one-off show organized by professional skateboarder and television personality Bam Margera. Following a two month break in early 2002, HIM regrouped and began rehearsing material for another album. Valo later credited the tour for Deep Shadow and Brilliant Highlights for bringing the band closer together, which culminated in their fourth album, entitled Love Metal. The album saw HIM once again working with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, and was viewed by the band {{as a reaction to}} the difficulties they faced during Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights. According to Valo: [...] "After what we considered a disappointment with Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, because there were so many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that we control <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> everybody else can fuck-off." [...] Love Metal was also the band's first album to make prominent use of the band's logo, the heartagram, on its cover, which Valo called [...] "a statement of intent [...] musically, visually and ideologically." ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with Just So You Know, Gaskarth said the album title [...] "summarizes {{the theme of the}} songs, most of which centralize around escapism; running from my problems, burning bridges because of those problems; and the realization that its hard work to rebuild after those problems have torn people apart." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaskarth said that the title was inspired [...] "by the subject matter on the record, where it's this toss-up of being wrapped up in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> having the fun and the good times, and kind of pulling that blindfold down in order to ignore the fact that other problems are crumbling around you". Gaskarth also said [...] "one of the big things that came along with this album ... a lot of anxiety. About where were we going to go". Gaskarth said the band purposely sought to [...] "step outside of the box and do some things that were a bit scary." [...] He mentioned that [...] "there's one [...] that starts with classical guitar playing something that sounds like it could be out of vaudeville and it's that kind of thing that we really decided to go for on this record." ...|$|E

When I heard the twist they put on it, man, {{it was kind of}} a no-brainer." [...] T.I. also chose the record for its crossover ability, which he has always been successful with in the past: [...] "It sounds like hip-hop with an international twist to it, and I'm known for taking those types of records and bridging that gap between <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> what they do," [...] he explained, dropping in a couple of examples. [...] "From M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' to 'Swagga Like Us,' we took [...] 'Gypsy Woman' for 'Why You Wanna.'" [...] Over the drum-heavy sample, Lamar and Bobby Ray join T.I. in sharing some nostalgic stories, which he says reminds him of some of a few renowned MCs and their classic projects: [...] " [...] taking turns on our story about a female that we knew years, years, years ago before we were who we are today. It kinda puts me in the mind of the 'Da Art Of Storytellin' [...] from Outkast and Slick Rick. It puts me in the mind of that." [...] The song, which failed to make the album's final track listing probably due to sample clearances, is titled [...] "Memories Back Then". On December 17, 2012 T.I. stopped by Sway Calloway's Sway In The Morning radio show to promote the album, while there he premiered [...] "Memories Back Then".|$|E
