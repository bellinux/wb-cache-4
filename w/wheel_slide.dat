2500|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>Slide</b> Protection (WSP) {{equipment}} is fitted to passenger trains {{to manage the}} behaviour of wheel sets in low adhesion conditions. [...] When the train is braking, it behaves like the ABS system in cars by releasing the brake on any axle if it detects that it is locking up. [...] WSP can also control the traction system to prevent wheel spin when applying power.|$|E
500|$|Front {{brakes on}} many {{inexpensive}} bikes are {{not strong enough}} so, on the road, they are the limiting factor. Cheap cantilever brakes, especially with [...] "power modulators", and Raleigh-style side-pull brakes severely restrict the stopping force. In wet conditions they are even less effective. Front <b>wheel</b> <b>slides</b> are more common off-road. Mud, water, and loose stones reduce the friction between the tire and trail, although knobby tires can mitigate this effect by grabbing the surface irregularities. Front <b>wheel</b> <b>slides</b> are also common on corners, whether on road or off. Centripetal acceleration adds to the forces on the tire-ground contact, and when the friction force is exceeded the <b>wheel</b> <b>slides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Single-track {{vehicles}} have unique dynamics that, in {{the case}} of wheeled vehicles, are discussed at length in bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, that usually require leaning into a turn, and that usually include countersteering. Single-track vehicles can roll on <b>wheels,</b> <b>slide,</b> float, or hydroplane.|$|R
40|$|Railroad cars in coal {{service in}} the northeastern United States are often shopped for wheel defects such as slid flat, built up tread and spalling. Previous work found that these defects {{can be caused by}} <b>wheel</b> <b>sliding</b> after air {{pressure}} leaks through defective service and emergency brake valve portions into the brake cylinder. Another important factor in the creation of wheel defects from <b>wheel</b> <b>sliding</b> is the car’s empty braking ratio. If a car is excessively braked when empty, or has lost weight, there will be a greater chance for <b>wheel</b> <b>sliding</b> and damage. <b>Wheel</b> changeout data for different car classes were reviewed and several coal cars in the classes with the most wheel repairs were selected for detailed testing. The cars were given a complete air brake test, including a brake cylinder pressure test, and the brake system and wheels of each car was inspected. A static brake shoe force test was then conducted on each car {{in order to determine the}} current empty braking ratio, loaded braking ratio and hand braking ratio. A second set of static brake shoe force tests was also conducted using a new device that does not require removal of brake shoes and the results were compared to the first method. The potential use of the new brak...|$|R
2500|$|The loss of {{friction}} between wheels and rail results in loss of tractive force — the wheels begin to spin, {{and in some}} instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss {{of friction}} results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases the wheels may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with <b>Wheel</b> <b>slide</b> protection to counter slippery rail conditions. [...] Locked wheels can self-grind flat spots on the steel tyres, especially if the wheels are still sliding when arriving at a non-greasy section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. [...] This causes the wheels to go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for the wheels to be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense.|$|E
50|$|Bearingless speed sensors may {{be found}} in almost every {{wheelset}} of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> protection and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> protection system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable.One special feature of rotary speed sensors that are used for <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> protection is their integrated monitoring functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels. Occasionally it is necessary to take off the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> protection signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the <b>wheel</b> <b>slide</b> protection electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized.|$|E

50|$|The lowsider or lowside {{is a type}} of {{motorcycle}} crash usually {{occurring in}} a turn. It is caused when either the front or rear <b>wheel</b> <b>slides</b> out as a result of either too much braking into the corner, too much acceleration through or out of the corner, or too much speed carried into or through the corner for the available grip. It may also be caused by unexpected slippery or loose material (such as oil, water, dirt or gravel) on the road surface.|$|R

5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front <b>wheel</b> <b>slides</b> more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|R

50|$|When {{performing}} a bert the skateboarder crouches down while doing a frontside carve, plants their front {{hand on the}} ground and extends their back foot and torso making the back <b>wheels</b> <b>slide</b> out. After the slide the skateboard has made a 180 degree sweeping turn and the skateboarder pushes back up and continues in the starting direction. When performed in a transition it is possible to convert a bertlemann slide into a grind by timing the slide so that during the apex of the sweep the back truck hits the coping.|$|R

50|$|An {{escapement}} is {{the mechanism}} in a mechanical clock {{that gives the}} pendulum precise impulses to keep it swinging, and allows the gear train to advance a set amount with each pendulum swing. The Riefler escapement was an improvement of the deadbeat escapement, the standard used in precision clocks. In the deadbeat, the force to keep the pendulum swinging is applied by {{the teeth of the}} escape <b>wheel</b> <b>sliding</b> alternately against two angled pallets on arms attached to the pendulum. Therefore, slight variations in the friction of the pallets and in the torque from the escape wheel are passed on to the pendulum, disturbing its motion.|$|R

Long-pitch corrugation is a significant cause of vibration and noise pollution in the railway infrastructure. Therefore {{it is very important}} to understand the formation and development of this imperfection of the rails. Measurements were carried out in curves of small radii on several tracks in the Czech Republic. In addition to the measurement of the surface of the rail head a number of supplementary parameters was evaluated for each section, such as curve radius, superelevation, track gauge etc. and the speed of passing trains as well. This paper describes rail corrugation defect and its development. Our early results are presented in the Conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present in}} this work the {{performances}} of a mobile omnidirectional robot through evaluating its management of the redundancy of actuation. Thus {{we come to the}} predictive control implemented. The distribution of the wringer on the robot actions, through the inverse pseudo of Moore-Penrose, corresponds to a « geometric ›› distribution of efforts. We will show that the load on vehicle wheels would not be equi-distributed in terms of wheels configuration and of robot movement. Thus, the threshold of sliding is not the same for the three wheels of the vehicle. We suggest exploiting the redundancy of actuation {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>wheels</b> <b>sliding</b> and to ameliorate, thereby, its accuracy of displacement. This kind of approach was the subject of study for the legged robots. Keywords—Mobile robot, actuation, redundancy, omnidirectional, inverse pseudo Moore-Penrose, reductive control. I...|$|R
