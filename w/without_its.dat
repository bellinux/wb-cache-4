5|$|As {{a result}} of these collaborations, Rock Steady touches on many musical styles, {{focusing}} on electropop, dancehall, and new wave. The band attempted to capture the vibe of Jamaican dancehall music, and experimented with writing songs <b>without</b> <b>its</b> standard instrumentation. Singer Gwen Stefani wrote her lyrics quickly in comparison to previous records, and dealt with topics ranging from partying to ruminations on her relationship with Gavin Rossdale.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{reorganisation}} of {{the army}} the 64th, like most regiments, found itself <b>without</b> <b>its</b> flank (grenadier and light infantry) companies which had been detached to form part of the 2nd Grenadier and 2nd Light Infantry Battalions respectively. All three battalions {{took part in the}} 1776 capture of New York and the 64th was engaged in the later Battle of Ridgefield.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} plates {{were included in}} The Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not <b>without</b> <b>its</b> disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.|$|E

5|$|Additionally {{in early}} May, Charles assented to an {{unprecedented}} Act that forbade {{the dissolution of the}} English Parliament <b>without</b> <b>its</b> consent. In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Although not <b>without</b> <b>its</b> critics, his {{architecture}} is widely appreciated. He {{was awarded the}} Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA's) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. He twice declined the offer of a knighthood.|$|E
5|$|As reviewers would note, the {{production}} was not <b>without</b> <b>its</b> faults. One error occurred with the photographer improperly {{taking pictures of}} the mermaid. The developed photographs of the mermaid were also impossible given the distances involved. A more minor error {{in the operation of}} the hotel was given by the office boy who handled the arriving guests with remarkable speed. Despite these errors, the company was {{at the forefront of the}} Independent producers and given great praise by Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company in The New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his early}} success, sales later {{declined}} and Muntz's creditors refused to provide further financing in 1954. Muntz admitted his business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953, {{and although he}} tried to reorganize, Muntz TV filed bankruptcy and {{went out of business}} in 1959. (The company would be reorganized and last through the 1960s, but <b>without</b> <b>its</b> namesake at the helm.) However, Muntz's success continued in the sales of cars and general consumer electronics.|$|E
5|$|Fleetwood {{continued}} to grow <b>without</b> <b>its</b> principal investor, albeit slowly. As a port, it soon faced competition from Lytham and Preston. In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood {{on their way to}} London from Scotland, but that year saw the decline of the town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were now able to travel over hilly terrain, and the railway was extended over Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer needed as a sea link.|$|E
5|$|Following the election, Mat Herben {{was chosen}} as LPF party leader as Fortuyn's successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the {{governing}} coalition, and supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, health and sports. But <b>without</b> <b>its</b> original leader and lack of a clearly defined organisational structure, the LPF soon succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October2002, the break-up of the government coalition was triggered by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.|$|E

5|$|Her first {{position}} as a professor was at Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1963. The appointment was not <b>without</b> <b>its</b> drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues {{because she had a}} husband with a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In 1449 Alexander, Lord of the Isles granted part of {{the island}} to Torquil MacNeill of Taynish, the {{remainder}} being owned by the monks of Paisley. In 1493 the whole island came under MacNeill control and it remained in their hands, with various brief interludes, until the 19th century. This prize was by no means <b>without</b> <b>its</b> hazards. In 1530 the notorious pirate Ailean nan Sop murdered MacNeill of Taynish and numerous island residents. A dozen years later the title deeds were lost when eleven gentlemen of Gigha were slain by raiders.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{was signed}} into law, {{granting}} funding to the nationwide Interstate Highway System. <b>Without</b> <b>its</b> Oklahoma link, the Kansas Turnpike {{was in danger}} of being bypassed by the Interstate System entirely. However, at the end of 1956, the Bureau of Public Roads and the state of Kansas agreed to route I-35 along the turnpike south of Emporia and I-70 along the piece east of Topeka. The state insisted on a separate Emporia–Kansas City alignment, and the mileage that would have been used to build I-35 from Wichita to Emporia via Newton was instead used for Interstate 35W (now Interstate 135) from Wichita via Newton to Salina. Oklahoma's first piece of Interstate 35, from the state line to U.S. Highway 177 at Braman, opened April 22, 1958.|$|E

On 27 July the regiment, <b>without</b> <b>its</b> machine-gun section which had been detached to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, was sent to Gebel Habeita to relieve the 9th Light Horse Regiment. After undertaking {{the first part of}} the journey to Seraphum by train, they marched the rest of the way. In early August, Ottoman forces launched an attack in the Battle of Romani. During this fighting, the 12th Light Horse Regiment provided flank protection, carrying out patrols, and was not directly engaged except for its machine-gun section.|$|E

The HV reinforced the 133rd Home Guard Regiment with a battalion of the 150th Brigade enabling the regiment to achieve its objectives of the previous day, partially encircling the ARSK force in Vrhovine. The 154th Home Guard Regiment was mobilized and deployed to the Ličko Lešće area. The 9th Guards Brigade (<b>without</b> <b>its</b> 2nd Battalion) {{advanced to}}wards Udbina Air Base, where ARSK forces started to evacuate.

5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton.

It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat <b>without</b> <b>its</b> assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E
