25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{chromatic}} number of the plane {{must be at least}} four follows from the existence of a seven-vertex unit distance graph with chromatic number four, named the Moser spindle after its discovery in 1961 by the brothers William and Leo Moser. This graph consists of two unit equilateral triangles joined at a common vertexx. Each of these triangles is joined along another edge to another equilateral triangle; the vertices y and z of these joined triangles are at unit distance from each other. If the plane could be three-colored, the coloring within the triangles would force y and z to both have the same color as x, but then, since y and z are at unit distance from each other, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a proper coloring of the unit distance graph of the plane. Therefore, at least four colors are needed to color this graph and the plane containing it. An alternative lower bound {{in the form of a}} ten-vertex four-chromatic unit distance graph was discovered at around the same time by Solomon W. Golomb.|$|E

He voiced concerns that the paratroopers were threatened with annihilation and noted that all attempts to open a corridor for the bridges had failed. Gonen rejected the suggestion, stating that, [...] "If we knew in advance {{this was going to}} happen <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> started the crossing operation, but now that we have crossed then let us follow through to the bitter end." [...] Bar-Lev concurred with Gonen, and Dayan decided not to press his suggestion. At around 6:00 AM, Golda Meir telephoned Dayan to inquire about the situation. Dayan informed her that the bridges had not yet been laid and that the Egyptians had closed the routes leading to Deveroir. He also stated there were high hopes that Egyptian resistance would be overcome and that the bridges would be laid during the morning. Dayan also told her that Matt's paratrooper brigade had crossed to the west bank without encountering resistance and that Southern Command, as yet, had no intentions of withdrawing the brigade, even if the bridge-laying was delayed.|$|E

2500|$|As much as Saadia's Judeo-Arabic {{translation}} of the Pentateuch (Tafsīr) has brought relief and succor to Jews living in Arabic-speaking countries, his identification of places, fauna and flora, and the stones of the breastplate, has found him at variance with some scholars. Abraham ibn Ezra, in his own commentary of the Pentateuch, wrote scathing remarks on Saadia's commentary, saying: [...] "He doesn't have an oral tradition [...] perhaps he has a vision in a dream, while he has already erred with respect to certain places therefore, we will not rely on his dreams." [...] However, Saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty odd unclean fowl that are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Leviticus 11:1319; Deuteronomy 14:1218), his translation {{was based on an}} oral tradition received by him. In fact, Saadia's method of conveying names for the fowls based on what he had received by way of an oral tradition, prompted him to add in his defense: [...] "Every detail about them, had one of them merely come unto us , <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to identify it for certain, much less recognize their related kinds." [...] The question often asked by scholars now is whether Saadia applied this principle in his other translations. Ra'em (Heb. [...] ), as in Deut. 33:17, improperly translated as [...] "unicorn" [...] in some English translations, is a word that is now used in Modern Hebrew to represent the [...] "oryx," [...] although Saadia understood the same word to mean [...] "rhinoceros", and writes there the Judeo-Arabic word אלכרכדאן for the creature.

2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were [...] "discussing freely" [...] among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien {{revealed}} {{himself to}} be a staunch [...] "hard federalist" [...] favoring a strong federal government {{at the expense of the}} provinces, much along the same lines as his predecessor Trudeau. However unlike Trudeau, Chrétien supported the Charlottetown Accord of August 1992, which proposed devolving federal powers to the provinces and once again recognized Quebec as a [...] "distinct society". At the urging of Pelletier, Chrétien met secretly with Trudeau at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, where the two men argued about the meaning of [...] "distinct society" [...] for more than two hours. While the two did not resolve their differences, Trudeau promised to refrain from undermining Chrétien's authority in public. Trudeau denounced the Accord at the Maison Egg Roll in Montreal on October 1, 1992. Chrétien had major reservations about the Charlottetown accord, but as his opposition to Meech had done him much damage in Quebec, he was anxious not to be seen as an opponent of another set of constitutional amendments designed to secure Quebec's ratification of the 1982 constitution, especially as Charlottetown was very similar to the amendments that Chrétien had proposed to Meech Lake in 1990. Chrétien endorsed the Charlottetown accord on the rather negative grounds that the constitutional debate of the late 1980s-early 1990s were destroying Canada, saying it [...] "was bleeding the nation to death" [...] and that Charlottetown was the best way of ending that debate in order to move political debate back to the economic recession, which had begun in 1990. At a Liberal caucus meeting on September 8, 1992, Chrétien declared that [...] "if we had been the government <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made this deal", and that only reason to support Charlottetown was that to reject it would increase support for Quebec separatism. [...] The unity minister Joe Clark recalled that Chrétien did not champion the Charlottetown accord in the 1992 referendum with any great conviction or passion, stating: [...] "We were trying to bring everybody into the tent on it, and I made a practice taking proposals to the other party, particularly Chrétien...I just didn't think he was following the issue...I don't know what it was...But it left me with was the belief that here was a guy for whom the substance of things doesn't matter much." [...] During the 1992 referendum, Chrétien kept a low profile, and delivered only a few speeches in favor of Charlottetown.|$|E
