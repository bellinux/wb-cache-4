5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{demands a}} high level of {{physical}} activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.|$|E

Initially livid, Charuseela is impressed when Harsha succeeds in persuading her uncle's family not to migrate to the city to live with their employed son and instead makes their son agree to visit them every possible weekend. Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going to take over all the agricultural land around the village for political gain since the value of the land <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor. Harsha confronts them and warns them not to interfere in his work of developing the village.|$|E
5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, {{it will be necessary}} to skip two Weeklies (short films), these having come forward to ourselves from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> our position on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by at the best of times, and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E

The Ga place drops of water and alcohol onto the child's tongue to symbolize teaching them the difference between good and evil, and they may also place a piece of food such as kenkey so the child <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> a staple food of the Ga. Some groups practice raising the baby toward the sky three times to introduce them to heaven and Earth. Libations are also poured and live sacrifices of chickens or goats are made to ensure good health and protect the child from evil. The father or an elder will call out the child's name for the guests to repeat aloud to formally welcome the child into the community. After the naming concludes, friends and relatives give gifts to the family, and feasting and dancing follows.|$|E

Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "a formulaic album from the kings of slaughterhouse rap-rock, but fans <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> the extra enthusiasm from the duo, the bounty of filth, and maybe most of all, the reviving of the Dark Carnival mythos."

500|$|The main theme {{emphasized}} in the series is the environment. Holmes says that by [...] "coming up with a series about a different animal {{gave me a chance}} to explore some themes that don't fit so easily into Warriors. In particular, the environment." [...] Holmes says that she has always been keen on recycling and saving the planet so she wanted to explore the ways bears and other animals might react to humans destroying their homes and habitats. Many reviewers have picked up the theme. Publishers Weekly found that [...] "readers <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> the bears' struggle to survive, along with Hunter's environmental theme." [...] Booklist also commented on each separate story of the three bears touch on environmental problems and issues.

500|$|Okereke's lyrics {{attempt to}} {{juxtapose}} the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors {{and waiting for}} a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration {{to try to make}} a personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other... Although I might be speaking through the voice of a character, I'm still expressing, perhaps, my sentiments." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in Ars Technica, Kyle Orland called Depression Quest [...] "one of {{the most}} {{gripping}} and educational views on the subject [...] ". Adam Smith, in Rock, Paper, Shotgun, wrote that Depression Quest was [...] "'game' as communication, comfort and tool of understanding". In Giant Bomb, Patrick Klepek praised Depression Quests writing, and said that [...] "by the end, [...] was able to say [...] understood depression a bit better". He also warns players not to expect the game to be enjoyable, saying: [...] "Playing Depression Quest isn't 'fun', like watching Schindler's List isn't 'enjoyable'. They're important for different reasons, and it's okay if they exist for the small audiences who <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> them as they are." [...] Depression Quest designer Quinn also headed a Playboy article which featured several video games dealing directly with the subjective experience of depression, in which she noted [...] "I'm very interested in games that aren't there to make the player feel exceptional." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Jason Bovberg praised the episode for its [...] "spooky wonderfulness", {{stating that the}} episode scared his daughter.

[...] Mavis added, [...] "I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass, the voice actor for Squidward, gets quiet and {{manipulative}} when he's shining SpongeBob on, and here's {{one of the best}} examples of that." [...] He praised Count Orlok's cameo, [...] "especially when they animate the vampire's face into a goofy, giddy smile." [...] Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his [...] "personal faves." [...] He also said [...] " [...] has everything that makes the show great: funny dialogue (the whole story of the Hash-Slinging Slasher is hilarious), clever sight gags (especially SpongeBob's regenerating limbs), and that aforementioned outta-nowhere ending that made me bust a gut." ...|$|E

500|$|Masashi Hamauzu, the {{composer}} for Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, was not {{expecting to be}} assigned the soundtrack to the game. [...] In the liner notes for the original soundtrack album, he states that he was [...] "still in high school when that lovable character first made his debut in Final Fantasy", but that the [...] "Chocobo Theme" [...] made a big impression on him, leading him to often think to himself that he would [...] "love to try {{doing this kind of}} work". The soundtrack was the first solo album that Hamauzu had produced. When he wrote his own Chocobo themes for the Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack, he decided to arrange the opening and ending of the album for a fifty-piece orchestra, which lead {{to the creation of the}} orchestrated Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli album. [...] In the liner notes for that album, he explains that his motivation for creating the orchestral works was because [...] "Demand for classical music in Japan is still low compared with other countries" [...] and he wanted [...] "to spread the word on this style of music by any means necessary". He ends the note by exhorting his listeners to [...] "take your time" [...] with classical music such as the album, so that one day they <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> it.|$|E
500|$|Ariel has {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the character, writing that [...] "Ariel is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently, even rebelliously, instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny". James Bernardelli of Reelviews wrote that Ariel {{can be viewed as}} a template for future Disney heroes and heroines. He also praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance for the character. In an article for Empire, Levi Buchanan stated that Ariel is [...] "powerful and self-reliant". Janet Maslin of The New York Times complimented Ariel, stating that [...] "teenagers <b>will</b> <b>appreciate</b> the story's rebellious heroine" [...] and went on to praise Ariel's wit. Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend wrote favorably about Ariel although he believed that the character was eroticized, stating, [...] "The scene where Ursula rips out her throat and gives her extremely naked parts below the waist is almost titillating, though I'm sure to little kids it seems entirely innocent". Similarly, reviewer John Puccio said that [...] "Ariel is perhaps the sexiest-looking animated character the Disney artists have ever drawn". In his review of Ariel's Beginning, James Plath of DVD Town wrote, [...] "For little girls, Ariel is one of the most beloved of Disney princesses, and she holds a warm place in the hearts of parents as well". Rory Aronsky of Film Threat praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance in Ariel's Beginning, writing that [...] "Benson adds more to the appeal of Ariel for older fans, and younger girls just learning about her, as well as generations not born yet who will undoubtedly become attached to her, ensuring the continued existence of the franchise".|$|E
