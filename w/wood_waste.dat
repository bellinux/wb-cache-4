Various studies have assessed the energy potential and/or climate impact of energy recovery from <b>waste</b> <b>wood.</b> This paper aims to assess the long-term potential of <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> for energy production and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction in Switzerland. Material flow analysis (MFA) is applied for modelling the metabolism of <b>wood</b> and <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> in the Swiss anthroposphere over one century. The energy and climate impacts are estimated for 32 scenarios which assume different forest harvesting variants and <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> treatment options. The scenario analysis shows that <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> treatment options are more beneficial {{in the long term}} in terms of energy production (by energy recovery from <b>waste</b> <b>wood)</b> and of GHG emission reduction than the increase in the quantities of <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> generated in the future caused by the advocated strategies of increased forest harvesting. By using the Maximin criterion, the long-term optimal additional potential for energy recovery from <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> is estimated at 2110 GWh/year of useful energy, which offers a reduction of 364 tonnes of CO 2 equivalents per year. As prerequisites, the nominal installed capacity of the <b>waste</b> <b>wood</b> boilers needs to be raised and their efficiency and {{as well as those of}} incineration plants need to be increased. In addition, the sustainable potential of Swiss forests must be fully exploited.

The present study was conducted by using Hong Kong as an example to assess the environmental sustainability of converting recycled <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> (from construction and demolition activities and other <b>wood</b> product <b>wastes)</b> to produce <b>wood</b> pellets for direct energy generation. The chemical and physical characteristics of different types of <b>wood</b> product <b>wastes</b> were tested. An attributional lifecycle assessment approach was used to assess and compare the environmental impacts and sustainability for heat generation from the pelletized bio-fuel and coal. The test results showed that the energy content, chemical compositions and the trace metal concentrations all met the relevant standards. The results also showed that significant impacts on health, ecosystem, climate change and resources damage can be potentially avoided by using wood pellets instead of coal for energy generation. The overall findings demonstrated that the proposed "energy recovery" approach for using wood pellets as a bio-fuel in Hong Kong is environmentally sustainable, which can provide an alternative route for managing <b>wood</b> product <b>wastes</b> with the added benefits of energy recovery, and may be more applicable in mega cities especially when city-based incineration is a concern.

It was founded that by a total substitution of polymers, the WP can be used (300  µm at 850  kg/mm 3) as a filtrate reducer of mud because the WBM filtrate obtained exhibits a minimum and having requested values for such formation. According to the comparison of the cost price of a WBM containing <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> (by 100 % substitution of all polymers used) with that currently used for drilling oil wells in Algeria, it appears that the <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> can be used at least as viscosifier agent or filtrate agent for drilling mud without disturbing the main rheological properties of mud.|$|R
