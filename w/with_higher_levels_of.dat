25|$|Research {{suggests}} that specific leisure interventions enhance feelings of SWB. This {{is both a}} top-down and bottom-up effect, in that leisure satisfaction causally affects SWB, and SWB causally affects leisure satisfaction. This bi-directional effect is stronger in retired individuals than in working individuals. Furthermore, it appears that satisfaction with our leisure at least partially explains the relationship between our engagement in leisure and our SWB. Broadly speaking, researchers classify leisure into active (e.g. volunteering, socializing, sports and fitness) and passive leisure (e.g. watching television {{and listening to the}} radio). Among older adults, passive leisure activities and personal leisure activities (e.g. sleeping, eating, and bathing) correlate <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> SWB and feelings of relaxation than active leisure activities. Thus, although significant evidence has demonstrated that active leisure is associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> SWB, or happiness, {{this may not be the}} case with older populations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} issue <b>of</b> whether {{countries}} <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social capital give more foreign aid than others. It is often {{argued that in}} countries <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social capital (as measured, for example, by trust, civic norms and membership <b>of</b> community groups) <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cooperation and altruistic behaviour will be higher. This paper explores whether such altruistic behaviour extends to giving foreign aid. Cross-country data are used to assess whether countries <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social capital give more foreign aid, {{as a proportion of}} GDP, than countries where social capital is lower...|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding happiness and leisure relies on subjective well-being (SWB) as an appropriate measure of happiness. Research has demonstrated {{a wide variety of}} contributing and resulting factors in the relationship between leisure and happiness. These include psychological mechanisms, and the types and characteristics of leisure activities that result in the greatest levels of subjective happiness. Specifically, leisure may trigger five core psychological mechanisms including detachment-recovery from work, autonomy in leisure, mastery of leisure activities, meaning-making in leisure activities, and social affiliation in leisure (DRAMMA). Leisure activities that are physical, relational, and performed outdoors are correlated with greater feelings of satisfaction with free time. Research across 33 different countries shows that individuals who feel they strengthen social relationships and work on personal development during leisure time are happier than others. Furthermore, shopping, reading books, attending cultural events, getting together with relatives, listening to music and attending sporting events is associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> happiness. Spending time on the internet or watching TV is not associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> happiness as compared to these other activities.|$|E

40|$|Selective {{attention}} is atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions. Evidence suggests {{this is also}} the case for those <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> autistic traits. Here we investigated the neural basis of spatial attention in those <b>with</b> <b>high</b> and low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-reported autistic traits via analysis of ERP deflections associated with covert attention, target selection and distractor suppression (the N 2 pc, NT and PD). Larger N 2 pc and smaller PD amplitude was observed in those <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> autistic traits. These data provide neural evidence for differences in spatial attention, specifically, reduced distractor suppression in those <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> autistic traits, and may provide insight into the experience of perceptual overload often reported by individuals on the autism spectrum...|$|R

Those from families with both parents present, from high socioeconomic backgrounds, who performed better at school, were more religious, who had higher parental expectations, and felt like their parents care, showed lower levels of sexual activity across all age groups in the study (age 13-18). In contrast, those <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> body pride, showed higher levels of sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{constraints}} {{in building}} technology, early shophouses in the 19th and early 20th centuries were generally low rise buildings with numbers of floors averaging {{between one and}} three, with two storey variations being the most abundant. Three storey shophouses are most common in central cores of towns and cities <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> prosperity and population density, and pre-war shophouses with up to four storeys existed later {{in the first half}} of the 20th century with the advent of modern construction materials like reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|Nature {{connectedness}} {{is related}} to subjective well-being and other indicators of positive functioning such as solving a problem in one's life. Subjective well-being is defined as feeling pleasant emotions or having pleasant experiences. To assess well-being, participants complete measures of how often they feel positive emotions (an affective measure), how often they feel negative emotions (an affective measure), and how satisfied they are with their lives (a cognitive measure). Individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> well-being typically indicate that they are satisfied with their lives, feel more positive emotions, and less negative emotions.|$|E

The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the Tank Top—the inner bottom of the ship's hull—provided the {{platform}} on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing.

25|$|Differences in {{education}} levels are also highly correlated to PC and Internet access: those <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> education {{are more likely}} to have ICTs at home and/or at work. Education is closely correlated to income, which obviously facilitates the purchase of ICTs and inclusion in the work environment. However, when income levels are taken into account, those with higher educational attainment will have higher rates of access. 91 percent of Chinese Internet users have a high school or above degree. A ZEF study on telephone access in rural China shows that heads of farm households with a primary level of education were more likely to subscribe to telephones than those without any level of education.|$|E
25|$|The Commission {{found that}} an average of 40% of school-aged {{children}} were infected with hookworm. Areas <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> hookworm infection prior to the eradication program experienced greater increases in school enrollment, attendance, and literacy after the intervention. Econometric {{studies have shown that}} this effect cannot be explained by a variety of alternative factors, including differential trends across areas, changing crop prices, shifts in certain educational and health policies and the effect of malaria eradication. No significant contemporaneous results were found for adults who should have benefited less from the intervention owing to their substantially lower (prior) infection rates. The program nearly eradicated hookworm and would flourish afterward with new funding as the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Division.|$|E

By contrast conventional high-speed trains {{such as the}} TGV are able to run, albeit at reduced speeds, on existing rail infrastructure, thus reducing expenditure where new infrastructure would be particularly expensive (such as the final approaches to city terminals), or on extensions where traffic does not justify new infrastructure. John Harding, former chief maglev scientist at the Federal Railroad Administration, claimed that separate maglev infrastructure more than pays for itself <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> all-weather operational availability and nominal maintenance costs.

25|$|One {{recent study}} of neuroplasticity {{involves}} work done {{by a team of}} doctors and researchers at Emory University, specifically Dr. Donald Stein and Dr. David Wright. This is the first treatment in 40 years that has significant results in treating traumatic brain injuries while also incurring no known side effects and being cheap to administer. Dr. Stein noticed that female mice seemed to recover from brain injuries better than male mice, and that at certain points in the estrus cycle, females recovered even better. This difference may be attributed to different levels of progesterone, <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> progesterone leading to the faster recovery from brain injury in mice. However, clinical trials showed progesterone offers no significant benefit for traumatic brain injury human patients.|$|E
25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences.
