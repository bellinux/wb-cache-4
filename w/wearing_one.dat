5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was <b>wearing</b> <b>one.</b> During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E
25|$|The crown {{is wrong}} in the Queen's {{portrait}}. When the new coin portrait was first issued in 1990 (see above), a legend surfaced that the artist had simply added {{the image of a}} crown to a portrait of the Queen, and that she was never meant to be seen wearing that headgear. This is patently false; she posed personally for the portrait <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> of her usual crowns.|$|E
50|$|All {{students}} {{except the}} monitors <b>wear</b> <b>one</b> badge {{on a red}} tab on the right collar of the jacket. This is because students of lower rank would have carried rifles over one shoulder, thus damaging the additional badge, while monitors would instead be armed with pistols. House monitors <b>wear</b> <b>one</b> badge each side and school monitors <b>wear</b> <b>one</b> badge on each side with blue collar tabs. The school captain <b>wears</b> <b>one</b> crown on each blue collar tab. All the buttons are silver in colour, and are manufactured by Stokes & Sons.|$|R

25|$|Shoes {{also play}} an {{important}} role in the fairy tales Cinderella and The Red Shoes. In the movie adaption of the children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a pair of red ruby slippers play a key role in the plot. The 1985 comedy The Man with One Red Shoe features an eccentric man <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> normal business shoe and one red shoe that becomes central to the plot.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, teams {{began the}} {{practice}} of <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> of two different uniforms, one when they played in their own baseball stadium and a different one when they played on the road. It became common to wear white at home and one of gray, solid dark blue, or black on the road. An early example of this is the Brooklyn Superbas, who started to use a blue pattern for their road uniforms in 1907.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, Dreamer {{took part}} in the ECW brand's {{elimination}} chase to name a number one contender to the ECW Championship. During the series of matches, also involving Stevie Richards, Elijah Burke, and Kevin Thorn he added a bandana, worn on his head, to his ring gear. He received the original one from a young boy with a brain tumor, and from then on began <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> as a sign of solidarity and strength to anyone going through that struggle. Dreamer emerged victorious in the final match against Burke, only to be surprised by ECW's general manager Armando Estrada forcing him to face Big Daddy V, who promptly beat him for the number one contendership.|$|E
50|$|A {{shoulder}} belt was worn in various configurations, depending on army and rank.

25|$|Water {{skiing is}} a sport where {{one or more}} persons is pulled behind a motor boat or a cable ski {{installation}} on {{a body of water}} <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> or more skis. Water skiing began in 1922 when Ralph Samuelson used two boards as skis and a clothesline as a tow rope on Lake Pepin in Lake City, Minnesota. The sport remained a little-known activity for several years. Samuelson took stunts on the road, performing shows from Michigan to Florida. In 1966 the American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson as the first on record. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, first to go over a jump ramp, first to slalom ski, and the first to put on a water ski show.|$|E
25|$|This {{depiction}} of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons {{were linked to}} the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia. Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps. The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons. Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings {{by the fact that}} they are <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons (Amazonomachy) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae, now in the British Museum), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at Athens it was represented on the shield of the statue of Athena Parthenos, on wall-paintings in the Theseum and in the Stoa Poikile. There were also three standard Amazon statue types.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Wood {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Shotgun Wedding, an exploitation film about hillbillies marrying child brides, and Wood's transitional film, once again combining two genres, horror and grindhouse skin-flick, was 1965's Orgy of the Dead, originally titled Nudie Ghoulies. Wood handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film {{begins with a}} re-creation of the opening scene from the then-unreleased Night of the Ghouls. Criswell, <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). The film also features a Wolf Man and a Mummy. Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted. Venus Flytrap (1970), a US/Japan horror film, {{was based on an}} unproduced Wood screenplay from the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Frehley {{spent the}} early 1970s {{in a series}} of local bands {{including}} one called Molimo who recorded half an album for RCA Records in 1971. In late 1972, his friend, Chris Cassone, spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in The Village Voice and showed the ad to Frehley. Frehley went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar. Frehley auditioned for a band later named Kiss members Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (bass guitar) and Peter Criss (drums). Frehley, who showed up with best friend Chris Cassone, <b>wearing</b> <b>one</b> red and one orange sneaker, was less than impressive visually, but the band liked what they heard from his playing. About three weeks later, the band named Frehley as their lead guitarist. By January 1973, and they didn't have a name but later came up with the name Kiss. Frehley designed the band's double-lightning-bolt logo, which was polished up by Paul Stanley. The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances, and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes. When the group eventually decided to adopt stage personas to match their makeup and costumes, Frehley became Space Ace. Later his stage persona was also known as The Spaceman.|$|E

5000|$|From the {{creation}} of the United States Army to 1821, non-commissioned officer (NCO) and staff non-commissioned officer (SNCO) rank was distinguished by worsted epaulettes. Corporals <b>wore</b> <b>one</b> green epaulette on his left shoulder, sergeants <b>wore</b> <b>one</b> red epaulette on his right, while SNCOs (i.e., sergeants major quartermaster sergeants, drum majors, and fife majors) wore a red epaulette on each shoulder. In 1780, the sergeant major insignia received a brass half-crescent placed on the skirt of the epaulette. From 1787-1821, NCO and SNCO rank was indicated by either white or yellow epaulettes (white for foot regiments and yellow for mounted regiments). Corporals <b>wore</b> <b>one</b> epaulette on the left shoulder, while sergeants <b>wore</b> <b>one</b> on the right. SNCOs wore an epaulette on both shoulders, with the sergeant major receiving either a nickel or brass (nickel with white and brass with yellow, again depending upon whether belonging to a foot or mounted regiment) full-crescent on the epaulette's skirt.
