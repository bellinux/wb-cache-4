The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release. Toy Story 3 was released in 2010, which was also critically and commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, American {{director}} George Lucas had released Star Wars, a <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> {{science fiction}} film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, among other works. Lucas, {{like many other}} New Hollywood directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked {{to discover that the}} Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: Kagemusha, the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Coppola as co-producer.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts was <b>wildly</b> <b>successful,</b> {{shipping}} {{more than}} four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited {{as one of the}} highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time. The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements. Kingdom Hearts was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of Kingdom Hearts in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven Kingdom Hearts games and Nintendo's Mario & Luigi series. She has also worked on many other projects, such as Heroes of Mana and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall. She performed songs from games such as Kingdom Hearts, Live a Live, and Street Fighter II. During the Beware the Forest's Mushrooms performance from Super Mario RPG, Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow game composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who played the Irish bouzouki. She most recently composed and produced the majority of the score for Final Fantasy XV, which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.|$|E

25|$|The {{features}} {{listed above}} and growing market support from application software developers made Windows 3.0 <b>wildly</b> <b>successful,</b> selling around 10 {{million copies in}} the two years before the release of version 3.1. Windows 3.0 became a major source of income for Microsoft, and led the company to revise some of its earlier plans. Support was discontinued on December 31, 2001.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one of {{the best-known}} {{pictures}} printed in the magazine was Alfred Eisenstaedt's photograph of a nurse in a sailor's arms, snapped on August 14, 1945, as they celebrated Victory over Japan Day in New York City. The magazine's role in the history of photojournalism is considered its most important contribution to publishing. Life was <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> for two generations before its prestige was diminished by economics and changing tastes.|$|E
25|$|The CPP {{adopted the}} red cockerel as its symbol – a {{familiar}} icon for local ethnic groups, and {{a symbol of}} leadership, alertness, and masculinity. Party symbols and colours (red, white, and green) appeared on clothing, flags, vehicles, and houses. CPP operatives drove red-white-and-green vans across the country, playing music and rallying {{public support for the}} party and especially for Nkrumah. These efforts were <b>wildly</b> <b>successful,</b> especially because previous political efforts in the Gold Coast had focused exclusively on the urban intelligentsia.|$|E
25|$|The {{first film}} Perret {{distributed}} with Franco-Film, Morgane la sirène, was <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> in France, England and Canada, which confirmed the young company's international ambitions. Printemps d’amour, the first French color film {{using the new}} American technology Technicolor, came out that same year starring Louis Lagrange and the American actress Hope Hampton. Afterwards Léonce produced his last two silent films: La Danseuse Orchidée (with the American actor Ricardo Cortez as well as Xenia Desni and Marcya Capri) and another film adaptation of a Henry Bataille play called La Possession (with the Italian actress Francesca Bertini).|$|E
25|$|The Kurfürstendamm {{commercial}} district glitters with neon {{signs and}} reflected sun light, yet these citizens of Berlin use the street's full name {{in their daily}} lives, not the abbreviated slang of the native. Nazi Berlin is a culturally-vibrant city offering resident and visitor a <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> musical about Churchill and Stalin and cosmopolitan cuisines, but under the Reinheitsgebot, the nation's medieval beer-purity law, Japanese beer is illegal for importation to the Reich; American fast food is a rarity, because of the American economic collapse on its World War II defeat, however eateries such as The Greasy Spoon do exist.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1903, Colonel Arthur E. Randle {{formed the}} United States Realty Company, bought out the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate {{properties}} and East Washington Heights Traction Company, and founded {{the settlement of}} Randle Highlands. Randle, who only arrived in Washington in 1885, had previously founded Congress Heights in 1890. The Congress Heights development was <b>wildly</b> <b>successful,</b> and Randle invested heavily in the Belt Railway, a local streetcar company. In 1895, the Capital Railway Company extended its streetcar lines over the Navy Yard Bridge and down Nicholls Avenue to Congress Heights. Randle sold {{his interest in the}} Capital Railway in 1899, and used this fortune to buy out the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate.|$|E
25|$|The Green Gables {{farmhouse}} {{is located}} in Cavendish, Prince Edward Island. Many tourist attractions on Prince Edward Island have been developed based on the fictional Anne, and provincial licence plates once bore her image. Balsam Hollow, the forest that inspired the Haunted Woods and Campbell Pond, the body of water which inspired The Lake of Shining Waters, both described in the book, {{are located in the}} vicinity. In addition, the Confederation Centre of the Arts has featured the <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> Anne of Green Gables musical on its mainstage every summer for over five decades. The Anne of Green Gables Museum {{is located in}} Park Corner, PEI, in a home that inspired L.M. Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|Tobin's anti-communism led him {{to attempt}} to {{dismantle}} Local 574, which had led the successful Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. The local (led by Carl Skoglund, Farrell Dobbs and the Dunne Brothers) was avowedly Trotskyist, but had successfully led the union through the general strike. Alarmed at the local leadership's political views, Tobin revoked Local 574's charter {{and set up a}} competing local (Local 500). But after Local 574 secured a jurisdictional agreement in early 1935 from the Minneapolis Central Labor Union, it undertook a <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> organizing campaign and thrived. The AFL and the Minnesota Federation of Labor were alarmed at the growth of the Trotskyist-led union, and demanded action. In October 1935, the Teamsters international union passed a resolution denying membership to communists. Tobin also agreed to let an AFL organizer attempt to raid Local 574. The AFL and Local 574 engaged in mutual acts of violence. But {{when it became clear that}} Local 574 could not be raided and that the CIO might offer membership to the renegade local, Tobin convinced Local 574 leader Victor Dunne to merge with Local 500. A year later, the newly formed Local 544 had organized 250,000 truckers in the Midwest and formed the Central Conference of Teamsters. But after several of Local 544's leaders left the organization, Tobin trusted the local in 1941 and ejected the remaining Trotskyist leadership. When the CIO offered the ousted leaders a role in the newly formed United Construction Workers Organizing Committee, Tobin used his influence with the federal government to secure a federal indictment of sedition under the Smith Act. Several of the men were convicted (although most were acquitted or had charges dropped), and the local broken.|$|E
500|$|Along with 42 Entertainment's {{previous}} ARG {{known as}} The Beast, I Love Bees {{is credited with}} bringing greater attention to the fledgling marketing form; I Love Bees not only helped assuage fears by marketers about the costs of ARG failure, but attracted interest from other game developers in using alternate reality games to promote their own products. Before I Love Bees, The Guardian stated that [...] "ARGs were destined to join Letsbuyit.com and Barcode Battlers in the e-dustbin of nice ideas that never really caught on"; the explosion of broadband internet access and {{a renewed interest in}} codes allowed I Love Bees to become <b>wildly</b> <b>successful.</b> Bungie would later use another ARG called [...] "Iris" [...] to promote Halo 2s sequel, Halo 3.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, {{one year}} after the album's release, Warner Chappell {{reported}} that although most people paid nothing for the download, pre-release sales for In Rainbows were more profitable than the total sales of Hail to the Thief, and that the [...] "discbox" [...] had sold 100,000 copies. In 2009, Wired reported that Radiohead had made an [...] "instantaneous" [...] £3 million from the album. In 2016, Pitchfork wrote this [...] "proved Radiohead could release a record on the most secretive terms, basically for free, and still be <b>wildly</b> <b>successful,</b> even as industry profits continued to plummet. They were able to take that risk partly due to the fan sites and their communities, which offered a solid bedrock of support." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1761, Boydell {{decided that}} he would attempt to trade with the French in kind—something they had refused in the past because of the poor quality of British engravings. To inaugurate this change, he had to have a truly {{spectacular}} print. [...] To this end, he hired William Woollett, the foremost engraver in England, to engrave Richard Wilson's Destruction of the Children of Niobe. Woollett had already successfully engraved Claude Lorrain's 1663 painting The Father of Psyche Sacrificing at the Temple of Apollo for Boydell in 1760. Boydell paid him approximately £100 for the Niobe engraving, a staggering amount compared to the usual rates. [...] This single act of patronage raised engravers' fees throughout London. The print was <b>wildly</b> <b>successful,</b> but more importantly, the French accepted it as payment in kind. [...] In fact, it was the first British print actively desired on the Continent. By 1770, the British were exporting far more prints than they were importing, largely due to Boydell.|$|E
500|$|When {{they hear}} that special effects artist Tom Savini is {{to appear at}} The Android's Dungeon, they plot to sneak in, but are rebuked at the door. During the interview, Savini {{repeatedly}} plays tricks on Comic Book Guy, which causes him to get enraged due to the wounding of his pride, and as he lashes out at Savini and {{everyone else in the}} comic book store, he suffers a heart attack. Dr. Hibbert tells Comic Book Guy that he needs to take a break from running the store and to leave it in the care of friends. Since he actually doesn't have any friends, Comic Book Guy reluctantly leaves the store in Bart and Milhouse's care. The store becomes <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> under the management of the two boys, only to lose much of its newfound prosperity after Milhouse goes overboard in ordering a shipment of two thousand comics depicting [...] "Biclops", a superhero with thick glasses, which flops spectacularly.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{generally}} unimpressed with the series premiere. Mike Hale of the New York Times critically panned the episode, writing, [...] "An interesting drama {{could be made}} about Mr. Hefner's success in fusing sex, privilege and pseudo-cool into a <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> commercial empire during a conservative time, but The Playboy Club sets out to do much less, and succeeds." [...] Similarly, Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten, signifying a [...] "bad" [...] rating. Amitin stated that he was disappointed with its delivery, opining that while there were some potential in the show, it would [...] "take a lot more work to get this show off the ground." [...] Meredith Blake of The A.V. Club reacted mildly to the episode, expressing that it was [...] "glossy" [...] but dull and mediocre. Fellow writer Phil Nugent echoed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "The only outrageous thing about The Playboy Club is the scale of its miscalculated reverence for the sanctimonious mythology it's trying to peddle." [...] In conclusion, Blake and Nugent gave the episode a 'C' grade.|$|E
500|$|The Iron Giant was a {{commercial}} failure during its theatrical release, resulting from poor promotion from Warner Bros. This was largely {{attributable to the}} reception of Quest for Camelot; after its release, Warner would not give Bird and his team a release date for their film until April 1999. After <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> test screenings, the studio {{was shocked by the}} response: the test scores were their highest for a film in 15 years, according to Bird. They had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for the film—such as cereal and fast food tie-ins—with little time left before its scheduled release. Bird remembered that the studio produced only one teaser poster for the film, which became its eventual poster. Brad Ball, who had been assigned the role of marketing the film, was candid after its release, noting that the studio did not commit to a planned Burger King toy plan. In an interview with IGN, Bird stated that it was [...] "a mis-marketing campaign of epic proportions at the hands of Warner Bros., they simply didn't realize what they had on their hands." ...|$|E

Rackham spent {{the rest of his life}} as a philanthropist, giving money to children's charities, the University of Michigan, and other causes. At the time of his death, Rackham's wealth was valued at an estimated $16.5 million.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the unique}} {{instrumentation}} of the OSUMB, all music for performances must be custom-arranged. The band typically plays {{a wide variety of}} music throughout the season, and employs the expertise of a number of local and well-known arrangers. The first arranger of the OSUMB, Richard Heine, is considered to be most responsible for the unique sound of the band. All staff arrangers since Heine have kept true to the same style of arranging, while broadening the repertoire of the band. John Tatgenhorst became a staff arranger after his <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> arrangement of [...] "Hang On, Sloopy!" [...] in the mid 1960s. Other arrangers include world-renowned concert band composer James Swearingen, Dr. Ted McDaniel, Ken McCoy, Steve Pfaffman, Lisa Galvin, and John Brennan.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the [...] "pony car" [...] market dominated by the <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> Ford Mustang, DeLorean turned to the 14th Floor for permission to offer a smaller version of the Pontiac Banshee Show car for 1966. DeLorean's version was rejected because of GM's concern that his design would take away sales from the Corvette, their flagship performance vehicle, so instead they forced him {{to work with the}} existing Camaro design. He could only make changes to the front and rear of the car and even had to use the same fenders. Suspension was a whole different story as the Firebird has front and rear suspension differences compared to Camaro. The vehicle, the Pontiac Firebird, introduced for the 1967 model year became even more popular throughout the 70s.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Australia remains a {{constitutional}} monarchy under the Australian Constitution adopted in 1901, with {{the duties of}} the monarch performed by a Governor General selected by the Australian Government. Australian republicanism which had been a feature of the 1890s faded away during the First World War. [...] Support for the Monarchy in Australia [...] peaked during the Menzies years with the <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> 1954 tour by Queen Elizabeth II. Prince Charles attended school in Australia during the 1960s. The issue of a republic did not arise again until the 1970s.

2500|$|After Romancing, the {{director}} suddenly had the clout to direct his time-traveling screenplay, which was titled Back to the Future. Starring Michael J.

Before the Back to the Future sequels were released, Zemeckis collaborated with Disney and directed another film, the madcap 1940s-set mystery Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which painstakingly combined traditional animation and live action; its US$70 million budget made {{it one of the}} most expensive films made up to that point. The film was both a financial and critical success, and won three Academy Awards. In 1990, Zemeckis commented, when asked if he would want to make non-comedies, [...] "I would like to be able to do everything.

2500|$|Leal and Irene Guenther both quote Arturo Uslar-Pietri, who {{described}} [...] "man as a mystery surrounded by realistic facts. A poetic prediction or a poetic denial of reality. What {{for lack of}} another name could be called a magical realism." [...] It {{is worth noting that}} Pietri, in presenting his term for this literary tendency, always kept its definition open by means of a language more lyrical and evocative than strictly critical, as in this 1948 statement. When academic critics attempted to define magical realism with scholarly exactitude, they discovered that it was more powerful than precise. Critics, frustrated by their inability to pin down the term's meaning, have urged its complete abandonment. Yet in Pietri's vague, ample usage, magical realism was <b>wildly</b> <b>successful</b> in summarizing for many readers their perception of much Latin American fiction; this fact suggests that the term has its uses, so long as it is not expected to function with the precision expected of technical, scholarly terminology.|$|E
