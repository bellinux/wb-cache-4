The building remains a commercially successful rental office building, as it was when it was first built.|$|E
5|$|Flat Bastion Magazine {{had been}} {{abandoned}} for years when geology enthusiast Freddie Gomez undertook its restoration. Gomez, whose interests include both history and geology, converted the magazine to a geological research facility and exhibition centre. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the contents of the}} large collection of rocks and minerals are from his collection, other specimens have been donated. The men of the 150 (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment also spent a day performing repairs at the magazine. Gomez aspires to open the site to the public.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} times, Māori had a rich {{knowledge of}} the cabbage tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, {{the use of the}} tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is becoming more common.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty. This tension led to a series of succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, {{the entire}} {{cast and crew}} joined with studio {{executives}} for a traditional wrap party. Four hundred people attended the gathering, which spilled over into two restaurants in Beverly Hills. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the crew readied for post-production, Wise and Roddenberry were grateful {{for the opportunity to}} take a short vacation from the motion picture before returning to work.|$|E

50|$|Stevns is {{also home}} to Elverhøj (Elves' Hill), <b>while</b> not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an attraction, it is famous for the fairy tale The Elf Mound by H.C. Andersen and the Danish {{national}} play Elves' Hill, both of which in Danish share the name Elverhøj.|$|R
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the {{construction}} in these sites {{is consistent with}} common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what {{seems to have been}} a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{including}} a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried {{over from the}} convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E

5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of}} the Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the major}} {{architecture}} of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes. Some mounds were destroyed {{in order to build}} the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were robbed of stone that was reused in modern construction. There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} the sheep {{industry}} in Australia was explosive. In 1820, the continent held 100,000 sheep, a decade later it had one million. By 1840, New South Wales alone kept 4 million sheep; flock numbers grew to 13 million in a decade. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the growth in both nations {{was due to the}} active support of Britain in its desire for wool, both worked independently to develop new high-production breeds: the Corriedale, Coolalee, Coopworth, Perendale, Polwarth, Booroola Merino, Peppin Merino, and Poll Merino were all created in New Zealand or Australia. Wool production was a fitting industry for colonies far from their home nations. Before the advent of fast air and maritime shipping, wool {{was one of the few}} viable products that was not subject to spoiling on the long passage back to British ports. The abundant new land and milder winter weather of the region also aided the {{growth of the}} Australian and New Zealand sheep industries.|$|E

5|$|When Adelaide {{was first}} planned and mapped out by Col. William Light, Mount Osmond {{received}} the three allotments 1070, 1277 and 1278. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Adelaide was relatively quickly bought (but not necessarily settled) Mount Osmond {{did not enjoy}} any early buyers. The first reported activity in the area was after the mining rush of Glen Osmond due to the Wheal Watkins and Wheal Gawler mines. Lot 1277 yielded a mine in Slaughterhouse Gully but it was worked only briefly. Subsequent finds of bluestone proved fruitful and the mineral was extracted until 1900, when mining ended and {{the last of the}} mines were either filled in or cordoned off.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Ibn Tulun in May 884, the two caliphal generals Ishaq ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu'l-Saj sought to take {{advantage}} of the situation and attacked the Tulunid domains in Syria, but their initial gains were rapidly reversed. In the spring of 885, Abu'l-Abbas was sent to take charge of the invasion. He soon succeeded in defeating the Tulunids and forcing them to retreat to Palestine, but after a quarrel with Ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu'l-Saj, the latter abandoned the campaign and withdrew their forces. In the Battle of Tawahin on 6 April, Abu'l-Abbas confronted Ibn Tulun's son and heir, Khumarawayh, in person. The Abbasid prince was initially victorious, forcing Khumarawayh to flee, but was in turn defeated and fled the battlefield, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his army was taken prisoner. After this victory the Tulunids expanded their control over the Jazira and the borderlands (the Thughur) with the Byzantine Empire. A peace agreement followed in 886, whereby al-Muwaffaq was forced to recognize Khumarawayh as hereditary governor over Egypt and Syria for 30 years, in exchange for an annual tribute. Over the next couple of years, Abu'l-Abbas was involved in his father's ultimately unsuccessful attempts to wrest control of Fars from Saffarid control.|$|E
5|$|Most of the storm's {{effects were}} felt in Florida where it made {{landfall}} {{on the morning}} of June 18, causing gales, heavy rains, flooding, beach erosion and tornadoes. The highest winds were recorded at 41mph (66km/h) and up to 48mph (77km/h) during a thunderstorm at Macdill Air Force Base in Tampa on June 18. Rainfall peaked at 10.72inches (272.28mm) in Desoto City, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest of the state}} reported between 15inches (25125inches) of precipitation. High tides and waves caused flooding and beach erosion from Naples to the Tampa Bay area. Some waterfront buildings suffered damage from undermining including widespread damage of marinas and some boats. Several bulkheads and rock revetments experienced minor damage in Naples and Marco Island. Several man‑made dune structures seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line in Collier County received minor damage at Vanderbilt Beach and Marco Island. Three people were killed in Florida in association with the subtropical storm with a further thirteen people injured. A Brevard County woman died when a canoe overturned and an Orange County child was killed when he was swept into a drainage ditch. 130 families were evacuated a few days after the storm from the Arcadia River area because the Peace River crested above flood stage.|$|E
