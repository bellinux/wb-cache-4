2500|$|After {{three weeks}} <b>work,</b> <b>positions</b> {{in the front}} line had been {{improved}} and a frost made the ground harder, until a thaw made the ground even worse than before. The 51st Division stores obtained enough gumboots for a brigade of infantry but many {{were lost in the}} mud as men struggled to get free. The division wore highland kilts, which left the top of the leg bare underneath and the edges of the boots chafed the skin and caused septic sores, until [...] of trousers were issued. Wearing the boots and standing for long periods made men's feet swell, to the point that walking became almost impossible. Buses were brought up to Pozières to collect soldiers, as they straggled back from the front line during a relief. Food containers proved too heavy to carry [...] into the front line and had to be replaced by [...] "Tommy Cookers", cans of solidified alcohol with which soldiers could heat tins of food. Quartermasters improvised large numbers of extra cookers, so that the troops in the line could eat hot food when they pleased but the improvements made little difference to sickness wastage. The division began to relieve battalions after [...] with [...] rest before and after each period in the line. On 11 December, the front of the division was reduced to two battalions, with the front of each battalion area being held by a company and two Lewis-gun crews. The strength of companies had declined to [...] so few and thinly spread, that a stray German soldier taken prisoner near a brigade headquarters, had seen no sign of British troops until he was captured. In December and January, casualties due to enemy action were [...] fewer than those due to the weather and illness; the division was relieved by the 2nd Division on 12 January.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} various combinations of {{levels of social}} isolation in private life and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> as predictors of disability pension (DP). A second aim was to test the potential interaction effects (above additivity) of social isolation and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> on the future risk of DP, and to provide results {{for men and women}} by age. The study was based on a sample of 45567 women and men from the Swedish population who had been interviewed between 1992 and 2007. Further information on DP and diagnoses was obtained from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's database (1993 - 2011). The studied predictors were related to DP using Cox's proportional hazard regression. The analyses were stratified on sex and age (20 - 39 years, 40 - 64 years), with control for selected confounders. Increased risks of DP were found for most combinations of social isolation and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> in all strata. The hazard ratios (HRs) for joint exposure to high degree of social isolation and a peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> were particularly strong among men aged 20 - 39 (HR 5. 70; CI 95 % 3. 74 - 8. 69) and women aged 20 - 39 (HR 4. 07; CI 2. 99 - 5. 56). An interaction effect from combined exposure was found for women in both age groups as well as a tendency in the same direction among young men. However, after confounder control the effects did not reach significance. Individuals who were socially isolated and in a peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> had an increased risk of future DP. The fact that an interaction effect was found among women indicates that a combination of social isolation and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> may reinforce adverse health effects. There was no evidence that a peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> can be compensated by a high degree of social intergration in private life...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategy}} for approaching a manual <b>work</b> <b>position</b> {{is an important}} reference for describing a goal-directed task. However, knowledge on this aspect of human behavior is scarce. The objectives {{of this study are}} twofold: (1) to describe and understand the strategy people tend to adopt for approaching a manual <b>work</b> <b>position</b> from different directions when their initial standing position is three meters away, and (2) to describe the working posture they tend to adopt when operating a pistol-grip hand tool at different heights. An experiment involving eight participants was conducted to measure the whole-body position and orientation when approaching a <b>work</b> <b>position</b> from five directions. The working posture adopted when operating a pistol-grip hand tool at six working heights was examined. The results indicate that the final whole-body position and orientation (while performing the operation) was affected significantly by the approach direction. A linear relationship between the approach direction and the final whole-body orientation was obtained. The participants adopted a strategy combining the work efficiency and comfort strategies. They deviated from the least-distance (straight line) walking path and re-oriented their whole body for the operation when approaching the <b>work</b> <b>position.</b> The working posture was significantly affected by the working height. The working postures at six working heights were established. The participants adopted a standing posture when the working height was between eye and hip height, and a stooping or squatting posture when operating at knee and ankle height. The results of this study can be used to enhance digital human modeling motion generated for human movement simulation. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
