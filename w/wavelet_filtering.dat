Methods: 128 -channel SEPs elicited by electrical stimuli {{of the left}} posterior tibial nerve were recorded from 11 healthy subjects. Probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) {{was used as a}} spatial filter to isolate SEP-related independent components (ICs), and <b>wavelet</b> <b>filtering</b> was used as a time-frequency filter to further enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs. Results: SEP-related ICs, identified using PICA, showed typical patterns of cortical SEP complex (P 39 -N 50 -P 60) and scalp topography (centrally distributed with the spatial peak located near vertex). In addition, <b>wavelet</b> <b>filtering</b> significantly enhanced the SNR of single-trial SEPs (p= 0. 001). Conclusions: Combining PICA and <b>wavelet</b> <b>filtering</b> offers a space-time-frequency filter {{that can be used to}} enhance the SNR of single-trial SEPs greatly, thus providing a reliable estimation of single-trial SEPs. Significance: This method can be used to detect single-trial SEPs and other types of evoked potentials (EPs) in various sensory modalities, thus facilitating the exploration of single-trial dynamics between EPs, behavioural variables (e. g., intensity of perception), as well as abnormalities in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. © 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In data acquisition (DAQ) system, the data can be acquired, measured and analyzed from electrical, mechanical and physical phenomena. In this paper, acoustic signal is generated from pencil lead break at different locations on metal sheet. Acoustic emission (AE) sensor is used to acquire the data of physical phenomenon. It converts the physical parameters into the electrical signal, which is very small (in mV). This has been amplified by using a preamplifier of suitable gain. Amplified signal is transformed into digital signal by using USB data acquisition module. But this signal contains noise. So for processing, digitized signal is connected to computer using USB and processing is done in Matlab software.
