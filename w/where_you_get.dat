500|$|The episode's {{synthesized}} orchestral {{score was}} written by Christopher Lennertz, Kripke's friend and next-door neighbor. The two attended USC School of Cinematic Arts together, and worked together on various projects afterwards. Lennertz described Supernatural as [...] "one of those dream situations <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to work with someone who you admire, but also {{have a relationship with}} already", and noted he and Kripke [...] "were already on the same page without even talking about [...] ".|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} 2014's The Endless River, Nick Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets as his favourite of Pink Floyd's studio albums. “I {{think there}} are ideas contained there that we have continued to use {{all the way through}} our career,” he says. “I think [...] was a quite good way of marking Syd ’s departure and Dave ’s arrival. It’s rather nice to have it on one record, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> both things. It’s a cross-fade rather than a cut.” ...|$|E

500|$|The clip {{starts with}} a {{helicopter}} landing on a black helipad bearing Furtado's name {{on top of a}} building, and Furtado getting out. She is shown {{on the roof of the}} building throughout the video, with the Los Angeles skyline in the background. The video features mostly face shots of her and Timbaland intercut with shots of dancers, under the careful guidance of internationally acclaimed Puerto Rican choreographer Gabriel Rivera. Furtado described the clip as [...] "a throwback to the '80s ... the more surreal side" [...] because the shots of her and Timbaland reminded her much of those of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart in videos for Eurythmics' singles, and [...] "the strange relationship [...] had, <b>where</b> ... <b>you</b> <b>get</b> this intense vibe from it. And Tim and me, we're partners, we vibe on a serious creative level, so the video captures that energy." [...] The video ends with Furtado climbing back into the helicopter, which flies off.|$|E
500|$|The album {{marked a}} {{departure}} in Fall Out Boy's sound {{in which the}} band implemented a diverse array of musical styles. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound. Infinity on High {{has been compared to}} the work of pop punk bands such as Green Day, with Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commenting, [...] "Whatever snot and feedback courses through these songs, sweetness always triumphs, carried forth by bubblegum bass lines, snappy drums and tunes as comforting as lullabies." [...] Stump explained that the album contains a variety of different moods: [...] "It’s one of those things <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> older as a band and you do your own thing...The older Fall Out Boy elements, from the early records, are definitely there, and this album is an extension of that." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the {{goal is to}} try to make it {{an engaging}} movie <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film is to give the story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} stages of production, Foreman said that the record was going to sound {{different}} sonically, initially [...] "shaping up to be more acoustic AND more electronic".

2500|$|Episode one of {{the series}} was {{released}} on October 3, 2014, with additional episodes released weekly online.

He explained, [...] "We {{want to give you}} the same experience you get from a great HBO or Netflix series, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> caught up with the characters and the thing unfolds week after week, but with a true story, and no pictures.

If you start that, where do you end up? Do we go back and say the ball wasn’t on the ground when we touched it and they got a free or whatever? It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right {{at the end of a}} game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{since the}} band {{had not yet}} signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant paid for the {{sessions}} entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: [...] "I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because I knew exactly what I {{wanted to do with}} these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ... It wasn't your typical story <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> an advance to make an album – we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic's reaction was very positive – I mean they signed us, didn't they?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

2500|$|The poet Gunnar Ekelöf {{wrote about}} Torsten Billman: [...] "To those, who {{with the word}} art visualise large, magnificent, 'striking' canvases Torsten Billman doesn't have not much to offer. His art serves the simple, neglected, {{homeless}} of existence. It features the fellows from the Nippon and other ships, marked by the hard life in ports {{as well as on}} board. His art shows the interiors of East End bars, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> acquainted with the dark side of life. His art however isn't any 'social' [...] art of the arrogant, placarding character there was so much of especially during the 1920's and 30's. It's social, not in attitude or trend, but with objectivity and revealing sharpness in the human portrayal that sometimes seems almost brutal - repulsive, but sadly true. Yet it's, however always carried by compassion. Never by sentimentality. This involves a simple statement of: 'Such is man'. But from the ravaged features, and the gout-ridden limbs stiff from work there's still a notion emanating of how man should look like and could look like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writers Allan Prior and Robert Holmes {{returned}} {{for the new}} series. New to the series were Ben Steed, a short story writer who had also written for Coronation Street, and Crown Court; Tanith Lee, a successful fantasy novelist; James Follet, who had written science fiction serials for radio, notably Earthsearch; Trevor Hoyle, who had published two novelisations of Terry Nation's Series One scripts and John Fletcher. Chris Boucher intended to write two scripts, one {{of which would be}} City on the Edge of the World. This script was prompted by a request by Michael Keating, who later recalled, [...] "...my daughter, who was about five or six at the time, thought Vila was stupid; Chris Boucher said, 'I'll write you a story <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the girl'". Difficulties arose with Robert Holmes' story, entitled Sweetly Dreaming... Slowly Dying, and John Fletcher's story about Hell's Angels in space. Both scripts were abandoned. Ben Steed was commissioned to write the replacement for Sweetly Dreaming... Slowly Dying which became Moloch, while Boucher replaced the Fletcher script with Death-Watch.|$|E
2500|$|On May 14, 2016, {{the band}} {{were forced to}} cancel their {{headlining}} slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast, as Kiedis {{was rushed to the}} hospital prior to the band appearing on stage. It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery soon however the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016 (rescheduling it for May 26). Kiedis and the Chili Peppers returned to the stage on May 22, 2016 in Columbus, OH. According to the band's drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis was suffering from a stomach flu a few weeks earlier and it had returned on the night they were set to perform. In a May 20, 2016 interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, his first since being released from the hospital, Kiedis said that his illness was brought on by an [...] "inflammation in my guts" [...] which he said was complicated by a recent stomach virus and existing scar tissue from previous hernia operations which required his stomach being pumped at the hospital due to his food not being able to properly digest. [...] "That becomes an incredibly painful situation <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a fever and pass out... Lo an behold, I'm on the mend" [...] He went on to say [...] "so it turned out to be a good thing, albeit painful and very sad to have to cancel a show. We don't really do that. I'd rather play deathly ill than not play at all, but in this particular instance, I was starting to go down, as in to the ground, so I got rushed to the hospital, got some help, and now I get to figure things out." ...|$|E
