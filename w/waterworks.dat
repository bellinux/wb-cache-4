5|$|The <b>Waterworks</b> River {{underwent}} considerable {{change over}} the years. In 1850, it left the channel of the Old River Lee much further to the north, to the south-west of Temple Mills railway depot. It was called Lead Mills Stream at this point. Near Temple Mills bridge, now on the A12 road, Channelsea River split off. The two channels ran parallel to the Old River Lee, before Channelsea River turned to the south-east. There was another small connection between the Old River Lee and the <b>Waterworks</b> River called Bully Fence, where the northern Channelsea River is shown on modern maps. By 1870, it was called <b>Waterworks</b> River {{as far north as}} Temple Mills depot, and by 1896, its present connection to the old river near to Carpenters Road had been established. Twenty years later, the northern <b>Waterworks</b> River rejoined the Lee at Bully Fence, and the section between there and Carpenters Road had been filled in. At some point, the connection at Bully Fence became the main source for the Channelsea River, although the 1953/66 map still shows it connected to the remnants of the system to the north, for drainage. Administrative boundaries still follow the northern course of the <b>Waterworks</b> River.|$|E
5|$|The Chelsea <b>Waterworks</b> Company {{occupied}} a {{site on the}} north bank of the Thames opposite the Red House Inn. Founded in 1723, the company pumped water from the Thames to reservoirs around Westminster through a network of hollow elm trunks. As London spread westwards, the former farmland to the west became increasingly populated, and the Thames became seriously polluted with sewage and animal carcasses. In 1852 Parliament banned water from being taken from the Thames downstream of Teddington, forcing the Chelsea <b>Waterworks</b> Company to move upstream to Seething Wells.|$|E

5|$|The Presque Isle Light was {{constructed}} in 1872 {{on the north side}} of Presque Isle and was lit on July12, 1873. This light is , with a red brick house that was used as a lighthouse keeper residence, and later a park residence. Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and flashes a white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie. The light station is open to public tours from Memorial Day through Labor Day on weekends, weather permitting (see presqueislelighthouse.org). A third, smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the Erie <b>Waterworks</b> on the Presque Isle Bay side of the peninsula.

5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the <b>Waterworks</b> River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in <b>Waterworks</b> River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on <b>Waterworks</b> River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and <b>Waterworks</b> River were made twice that width.|$|E

40|$|From {{the results}} of {{monitoring}} {{of the quality of}} surface water in the Hnilec and Hornád rivers and their tributaries followed that in addition to industrial toxic substances, it were the heavy metals from localities of former and still continuing mining, treatment or metallurgic activities that significantly influence a long-term polution. The subsequent project showed a need to monitor the impact of anthropogenic activity, namely on the <b>Waterwork</b> (VD) Ruín I. It was a task of our institution to judge the quality of sediment loads in the <b>waterwork</b> area. The first samples of sediment loads of the <b>waterwork</b> were taken in 1994. The sampling process then continued on the same places in following years. The special methods of sampling of sediment loads (sediments) from the <b>waterwork</b> bed were worked out depending on the locality of sampling. The total analysis of obtained air-dried samples was caried out using the AAS method. The heavy metals were also analysed. In the consent with standards and requiremnts of the co-ordinator of task, the sediment deposits were assessed in consent with Decree of the Ministry of Land Managment of the Slovak Republik 531 / 1994 - 540 on the highest admissible values of harmful subsatances in land. Comparing {{the results of}} sampling we have observed that the critical values have been achieved in case of Cu. Its high values were found in the branches of Hnilec and Hornád rivers, as well sa in the branch of Opátka. The increased contents of Co are in Beliansky and Opatsky branches, at the inflow of Hnilec and Folkmarsky brook into the <b>waterwork.</b> The position of Hg is interesting, as it was the main contaminating element of The Hornad river and its sediments in the past. Hg is not currently present at significant quantities. The vertical sampling was also carried out in the course of research. It was proved that the content of contaminating elements in sediments of <b>waterwork</b> originates in the industrial activity perfomed 15 - 25 ago. At present these sources of contamination are non-active. Special dumps-sludge basins represent an exeption, as they are sources of pollution of surface water, as well as of uderground water. In consent with the valid legislation, the supervision over the sludge-basins is performed by the sludge-basin keepers, who prepare assessment reports, available only to a limited number of experts. The results characterising waste waters from the sludge-basins in Smolník and Rudòany show that the water draining through a drainage system from the sludge-basins may significantly influence the quality of surface streams. From the mentioned facts follows {{that it is necessary to}} remove the contaminated sediment loads from VD Ruín I. The alternatives have been suggested. The contamination of sediment loads in VD Ruín I. continues, so that the requirement for continuing far in monitoring its surface layer and water at least in 3 year intervals is substantiated. The evaluation of results of monitoring of waters leaving the sludge-basin will show, which of them decisively contribute to the contamination of sediment loads in the reservoir of VD Ruín I. This should enable to prepare technical measures to capture the substantial quantity of contaminanting elements, so that in the future it would not be necessary, for the exploaitation of further sediment loads, to use expensive treatment procedures, this would result in the improvement of environment in the <b>waterwork</b> and its surrounding area...|$|R

The master thesis defines in the first chapter some of the legal terms that are important for the successful implementation of the building project. The main objective of this chapter was {{to determine how the}} legal acts regard the legal term port. Thesis also defines the legal concept of <b>waterwork.</b> The definition of the <b>waterwork</b> is very important {{due to the fact that}} under the law the port is considerated as a water work.
