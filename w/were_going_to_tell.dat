60|$|CUTHBERTSON (to {{help them}} out). You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about Grace, Charteris.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; the knights, you know: You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{me about}} them. A while back, you remember. Figuratively speaking, game's called." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather," [...] {{said little}} Alice, looking fearfully into his face, [...] "your voice {{sounds as though}} you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us {{something}} awful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "what I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>is</b> the truth. What I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you I'd as soon {{say in the}} {{presence}} of the lady as here." ...|$|R
60|$|Admiral Harrington here <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you {{all that}} I have left untold. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you all that I know, {{and then he}} will follow up with such rags and {{remnants}} as he can find, and {{tell you what he}} knows.|$|R
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his mother. On {{the landing}} {{he met his}} brother Basil.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't look so ashamed," [...] he said, smiling faintly. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} of him. What is it you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! I knew that," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} my eyes are make for? I thought you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me something I didn't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{us how you}} {{won that}} medal, Dad," [...] said Jack, after breakfast was over and his two uncles had said good-bye to {{everybody}} and left. [...] "What about it?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{this is all}} I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you about}} how Reddy Fox went fishing.|$|R
60|$|And {{this is all}} I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you about}} the fuss in the big pine.|$|R
60|$|It {{was through}} my glass {{partition}} that I {{first saw the}} gentleman whose story I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|Oh, my dear madam! {{you thought}} we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. Pooh! nonsense!--no such thing! not {{for two or}} three and seventy pages or so,--when, perhaps, you MAY know what Mrs. Catherine never would have done.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, he wouldn't. Nobody would {{suppose that}} anybody would pick {{me out for}} this kind of thing. If I'd known that you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me such a story as this I wouldn't have come with you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were about}} to honour me," [...] he said, [...] "by taking me into your confidence." [...] Mr. Vimpany stared in tipsy bewilderment. Mountjoy tried again in plainer language: [...] "You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me a secret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Una!' Dan called back. 'Sir Richard says he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what {{happened}} <b>to</b> Weland's sword. He's got it. Isn't it splendid?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. He {{thinks there}} is some mystery about his parentage--that's all. Jude <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him when he is a little older." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't say you will, my good fellow,' {{returned}} his father, crossing his legs, 'or you certainly will not. You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me'-- ...|$|R
60|$|You see, I {{expected}} a pompous couple who {{knew all about}} everything and <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me exactly how Egypt ought to be governed. A Member of Parliament doesn't inspire confidence in the worried bosom of a Government official.|$|E
60|$|I thought no {{one knew}} but me till this morning, {{when you were talking}} to Arthur. Then I thought you must know too. My heart was in my mouth, I was afraid you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him. But you didn't, and I thought I'd been mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{pretty in}} an unformed way, {{which is more}} to the purpose," [...] Mrs. Chudleigh rejoined. [...] "I heard the old woman abusing the manager because one of her ridiculous pets is missing. But this is of no consequence. You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about your African plans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{surprised}} our secret," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "but anyhow, Stephen <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you to-day. We {{were married}} {{the day before}} yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} you might be more happy as Mrs. Sowerby of Chaldicotes than you can be as Miss Dunstable--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Her head concedes it, and Volumnia is enchanted. A story! Oh, he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{something}} at last! A ghost in it, Volumnia hopes? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} were delightfully lucid," [...] she said. [...] "I quite understood, and on the whole I think I agree with you. I don't think that the sentimental side of me has been {{properly}} developed. By the bye, you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about that pretty girl I saw at Enton--Lady Caroom's daughter, wasn't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{one that}} was ever an {{ornament}} to human life,' says Mr Wegg, again holding out Mr Venus's palm as if he <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his fortune by chiromancy, and holding his own up ready for smiting it when the time should come; 'as one that the poet might have had his eye on, in writing the national naval words: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And of course, whether {{things go}} right or not, she'll {{find out that}} I've got a husband living, that I never met you in New York, but on the steamer, and that you've lied. I don't see the USE of it. You said you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the whole thing {{squarely}} and say the truth, and that's why I came to help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your spies {{are pretty}} smart, but I expect our colloquial English puzzled them," [...] Kit remarked, smiling. [...] "However, I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The story I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, boys, <b>is</b> an old fable {{about making}} enemies. It is called ‘The Bear and the Tomtit.’ ” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The entertainment," [...] he said, [...] "will incur {{no greater}} {{hardship}} upon you {{than a little}} patience. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you a story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay!" [...] said Mr. Redlaw, {{resuming}} {{his place}} at the table, more, it would have seemed from his manner, to reassure the old keeper, than in any remembrance of his own appetite. [...] "Spare me another moment, Philip. William, you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me something to your excellent wife's honour. It will not be disagreeable to her to hear you praise her. What was it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was your}} honesty," [...] she continued. [...] "You {{remember}} that night upon the roof at Blenheim House? You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a lie for me, and I {{know how you}} hated it. You love the truth, you are truthful naturally; I would rely upon you wherever I was. I know that you would keep your word, I know {{that you would be}} honest. A woman loves to feel that about a man--she loves it--and I don't want you to be brought near the people who sneer at honesty and all good things. I don't want you to hear their point of view. You may be simple and commonplace in some respects; I want you to stay just as you are. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
5000|$|We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you earlier. (past {{form of the}} going-to future, {{formed with}} the past copula were) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> up <b>to</b> the house, {{if there}} is one," [...] said McTurk, pushing through the hollies. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> this Colonel Dabney." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, of course," [...] {{answered}} Shep. [...] "But er---it all fits in {{with what}} I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you about in the first place." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>to</b> keep away, but he relented as {{he looked}} down at the {{harmless}} little man, with his thin, boyish face.|$|R
