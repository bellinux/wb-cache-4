It resembles the closely related golden-crowned warbler (the two {{sometimes}} hybridize), but its underparts are entirely whitish instead of yellow. Recently, the South American Classification committee of the AOU reclassified the <b>white-bellied</b> <b>warbler</b> as a subspecies of the golden-crowned warbler based on studies by Lovette et al. and Vilaca and Santos.|$|E
