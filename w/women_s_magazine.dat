By traveling through spaces of time, an advertisement from previous years is possible to come up again in many years after. This occurence happens in some U. <b>S.</b> <b>women</b> <b>magazine</b> advertisements. Meanwhile through spaces of location, U. <b>S.</b> <b>magazine</b> advertisements can also be published in magazines from other nations with almost no real difference in its visualizations, like what happens in Indonesian women magazines. Scholars claim the occurrence {{is influenced by the}} American hegemony phenomena. Working under the American Studies discipline, the researcher chooses a total of 3621 women magazine advertisements from the 2007 - 2008 issues of U. S. Ladies Home Journal, O: The Oprah Magazine, Cosmopolitan; Indonesian Cosmopolitan, Kartini, and Femina, as well as 1960 Ladies Home Journal to become the main data for research. In her research, a thread of popular culture, consumer culture and gender ideology perspectives are found. First, through popular culture, the advertisements gain an easy access for transnationality and globalization. Second, through consumer culture, the researcher finds that women are acknowledged as the highest potential as consumers because they are the decision makers of their own family’s household expenses. Third, by dissecting and analyzing the advertisements in more detail, the research also finds that gender ideology confirms how society still want women to maintain the traditional roles of women as mothers and housewives...|$|R
40|$|With {{the trend}} of media globalization, {{international}} women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> have extended the Chinese market with Chinese editions that reflected the local situation; {{while at the same}} time they inherited some global characteristics from their global editions. In addition, international women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> also influenced the Chinese local women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> through their reliance on advertising, as well as the presentation of content, style and cultural values.

One purpose of this study was to examine how women were presented through the comparison of popular global and local women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazine</b> covers in China. The sample for the study included a Western magazine, a Japanese magazine and a Chinese local magazine: Cosmopolitan, Rayli-Fashion and Beauty and City Beauty.

40|$|In {{the context}} of globalization, commercialization, and the {{increasing}} presence of Western and Japanese male images in Chinese society, this study {{is an attempt to}} examine how local and global force interact and how masculinities are constructed in men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> in Taiwan. Methodologically, this study sees in-depth interviews, content analysis, and semiotic analysis as complementary methods in the study of construction of masculinity in Taiwan. Results of the interviews showed that multiple types of masculinity exist in Taiwan and traditional Chinese masculinity has evolved and changed in the contemporary Taiwanese society. Based on the male images (N= 1, 284) from a stratified sample of four months in 2009 in four men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines,</b> results of the study showed that editorials and male images in Western and hybrid men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> were also different from those in the local men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazine.</b> Close examination of individual advertisements form semiotic analysis showed that advertisers try to relate muscle building to Wu masculinity; athleticism, male bonding, feminine masculinity are promoted by advertisers; metrosexuality seems the ideal masculinity in Taiwanese society. In conclusion, the study suggested that (1) international men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines,</b> either from the West or Japan, can be seen as culture hybrid to construct masculinity in their contents. Although international men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> are all hybrid, hybridity in men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> that are from countries that are geographically close are much influential than hybrid magazines from geographically far away; (2) the Chinese masculinity should not be labeled as feminine masculinity because it is ordinary manhood from the Chinese Wen tradition...|$|R

40|$|Theories of {{sexuality}} and consumption are increasingly entwined in the critical discourse of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines.</b> This reflects the growing importance {{of sexuality}} in the shifting representation of femininity. Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> are seen as pivotal, not only in charting women 2 ̆ 7 s lives, but also in asserting the importance of consumption in constructing femininity. Contemporary women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> in Western societies feature the dominance of sexual images, from sexy models to the discussion of sex. Underpinning this trend {{is the notion that}} sexuality sells. Sexuality thus becomes a dominant phenomenon in the commodification of Western femininity. In this paper, I want to question the universality of this phenomenon in the context of franchised magazines. The result of internationalization has precipitated the flow of images across overseas editions. Imported into the local editions, do these images {{of sexuality and}} sex necessarily sell {{in the same way as}} they do in the parent titles? Existing research around women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> concentrates on the sale of sexuality in the Western culture, without questioning its relevance to overseas editions. As a result, it neglects the importance of social and cultural specificities which affect the reading of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines.</b> Using Cosmopolitan Hong Kong as an example, I will redress this monolithic view by examining how a non-Western culture responds to the inflow of Western elements. Positing sexuality as a site for cultural debate, I will investigate the extent to which sexy images and sex articles pose a problem for the local edition, and how the edition has to repackage these images to cater for local readership. The analysis of images in the Hong Kong edition seems particularly urgent, as it is situated in a society which is under-going rapid political and economic changes. In so doing, I will also demonstrate the dynamism of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> as a form of business as well as cultural commodity...|$|R

Using Hofstede's cultural dimension of masculinity/femininity, the hookup culture (i. e., the relational context of sex, emotional context of sex, specific sexual activities, and contraceptives) was examined in 2, 496 stories from all 2006 through 2008 {{issues of the}} three most popular U.
