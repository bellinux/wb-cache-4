5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna walking {{at night in}} the middle of the street of an American city {{surrounded}} by skyscrapers and wind. Then she finds herself in another dimension, as moving flowers surround her. As the video advances, Madonna <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> other different kinds of roads. She <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> a path of red flowers in the sky, and then <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> her knees on a deep, blue colored sea, as she is followed by little white fairies. At the end of the video, when there is destruction in the real dimension, Madonna finds peace and is surrounded by the fairies. When they go away, Madonna disappears altogether.|$|E

40|$|A {{classical}} lazy random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> cycles {{is known}} to mix to the uniform distribution. In contrast, we show that a continuous-time quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> cycles exhibit strong non-uniform mixing properties. Our results include the following: - The instantaneous distribution of a quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> most even-length cycles is never uniform. - The average distribution of a quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> any Abelian circulant graph is never uniform. As a corollary, the average distribution of a quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> any standard circulant graph, such as the cycles, complete graphs, and even hypercubes, is never uniform.

40|$|We study biased random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> {{subcritical}} and supercritical Galton-Watson trees {{conditioned to}} survive in the transient, sub-ballistic regime. By considering offspring laws with infinite variance, we extend previously known results for the <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the supercritical tree and observe new trapping phenomena for the <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the subcritical tree which, in this case, always yield sub-ballisticity. This is contrary to the <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the supercritical tree which always has some ballistic phase. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> top of the towers and, once this was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an alternative site in early July.|$|E
5|$|When {{hiding in}} the dark is a {{gameplay}} element, light and shadow become important parts of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players {{must be able to}} hear the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was moved}} to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he {{remained}} {{for the next three}} years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need for fewer guards. Hess was allowed <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed himself with a bread knife. The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent that Germany was losing the war, he took no food for the next week, only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.|$|E

5|$|Nine power-ups each supply Mario with {{a special}} costume that grants him {{temporary}} abilities. For example, special mushrooms bestow the player with a Bee, Boo, or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to temporarily hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the Boo Suit allows him to float through the air, as well as become transparent and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would be otherwise inaccessible, yet lowering his mobility. The recurring Fire Flower allows Mario to throw fireballs at enemies, and the newly introduced Ice Flower allows Mario to create hexagonal tiles of ice to cover any liquid surface he <b>walks</b> <b>on.</b> The Rainbow Star grants Mario invincibility, allowing him to destroy any enemies that he touches, {{as well as being}} able to run faster.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|The telethon's {{talent pool}} becomes {{so low that}} Leslie is forced to flip a coin {{in front of the}} camera and talk about her {{favorite}} episodes of Friends. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being awake for two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so they could talk about Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E

40|$|For a symmetric, {{homogeneous}} and irreducible random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> d-dimensional integer lattice Z^d, having {{zero mean}} and a finite variance of jumps, we study the passage times (with possible infinite values) {{determined by the}} starting point x, the hitting state y and the taboo state z. We find the probability that these passages times are finite and analyze the tails of their cumulative distribution functions. In particular, {{it turns out that}} for the random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> Z^d, except for a simple (nearest neighbor) random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> Z, the order of the tail decrease is specified by dimension d only. In contrast, for a simple random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> Z, the asymptotic properties of hitting times with taboo essentially depend on the mutual location of the points x, y and z. These problems originated in our recent study of branching random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> Z^d with a single source of branching...|$|R

25|$|The {{atypical}} tarantulas, or purseweb spiders, (family Atypidae) build a silken tube {{parallel to}} the surface of the ground. While up to 8cm of the tube lie on the ground, about 20cm are buried vertically. The spider rests at the bottom of the tube. When prey <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> the exposed part, the spider, alerted by the vibrations, stabs it through the silk, cuts the web and drags it inside to be eaten.|$|E
25|$|Aside from routing, {{there exist}} many {{algorithms}} that exploit {{the structure of}} the overlay network for sending a message to all nodes, or a subset of nodes, in a DHT. These algorithms are used by applications to do overlay multicast, range queries, or to collect statistics. Two systems that are based on this approach are Structella, which implements flooding and random <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> a Pastry overlay, and DQ-DHT, which implements a dynamic querying search algorithm over a Chord network.|$|E
