As the game's music budget was low, a small Los Angeles orchestra {{was used to}} record the music; {{the sound of the}} each instrument was doubled during production. Inon Zur described the music as having [...] "some uniqueness to it, that basically it developed throughout the game [...] the [...] of more instruments, taking flutes and percussion and combining them with the standard orchestra." [...] Zur later said, [...] "I thought that we definitely met some high standards; <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> our products to big budget films scores," [...] and, [...] "in the end we were quite happy." [...] The game features voice work from Gabrielle Carteris, Peter Stormare, and Grey DeLisle, among others.|$|E

The house was careful, in the attitude of its senior partner, not to distinguish between us, and we were not slow to perceive the tact used in managing us; we had our own joke of it; <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> notes to find whether we were equally used in this thing or that; and we promptly shared the fun of our discovery with Fields himself.|$|E

I said I loved beautiful scenery and all beautiful things, and the pointing note in my voice made her laugh. She told me I had bold eyes, and so far as I can remember I said she made them bold.

60|$|Here I may {{state that}} Bastin was quite right, as we proved {{subsequently}} when <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> {{the head of}} the fetish, which, as it will be remembered, he had brought away with him, with that of the statue. Allowing for an enormous debasement of art, they were essentially identical in the facial characteristics. This would suggest the descent of a tradition through countless generations. Or of course it may have been accidental. I am sure I do not know, but I think it possible that for unknown centuries other old statues may have existed in Orofena from which the idol was copied. Or some daring and impious spirit may have found his way to the cave in past ages and fashioned the local god upon this ancient model.|$|E
