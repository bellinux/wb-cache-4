5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, <b>which</b> <b>states</b> that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time.

Ambushing Nelson and his sidekicks, they commence saturation bombing with water balloons. Nelson's thugs surrender, and Nelson is taken prisoner. He threatens {{to beat up}} Bart {{as soon as he}} is untied. Herman drafts the armistice treaty, <b>which</b> <b>states</b> that Nelson will retain his position and name, but will not hold any actual power. Then, Bart and Nelson sign the treaty.

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, <b>which</b> <b>states</b> {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E

To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E

5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of matter, <b>which</b> <b>states</b> that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms.

5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity result that applies to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs.

5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), <b>which</b> <b>states</b> that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E

50|$|The {{comparative}} {{impairment test}} asks <b>which</b> <b>state's</b> policies would suffer more if their law was not applied. This {{is similar to}} interest analysis, in that {{the interests of the}} state are taken into account - however, this test does not look to see <b>which</b> <b>state</b> benefits more from the application of its laws, but rather for situations in <b>which</b> the other <b>state's</b> interests will actually be harmed by the application of the laws of the forum state.|$|R
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, <b>which</b> <b>states</b> that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
