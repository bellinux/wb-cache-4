5|$|Murukan {{is known}} from Sangam Tamil literature. The {{earliest}} reference to Murukan {{was as a}} god who was propitiated to help in good hunting. He was the primary god of hunter-gatherer people from the mountainous region of southern Tamil Nadu {{very much like the}} Veddas of Sri Lanka. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> of settled agriculture, Murukan became identified with the tribal chieftains as a god of war, becoming popular among all segments of the society. He was worshiped symbolically as lance and trees such as the Kadamba Neolamarckia cadamba) were considered to be sacred to him. Birds such as the peafowl or rooster were also identified with the deity. Velans were a special class of priests identified with his worship.|$|E

The laser rangefinder is a component of FCS, and can accurately determine the range of the target, thereby calculating how much elevation the gun needs, making today's guns highly accurate.|$|R
25|$|Mawson's {{ideas of}} global glaciation, however, {{were based on}} the mistaken {{assumption}} that the geographic position of Australia, and that of other continents where low-latitude glacial deposits are found, has remained constant through time. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> of the continental drift hypothesis, and eventually plate tectonic theory, came an easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments — they were deposited at a point in time when the continents were at higher latitudes.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{the sweep}} takes the simple {{form of an}} {{advancement}} of the surface, such that the surface is expanded in a symmetric manner about its advancement axis, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> rate set by a volume attributed to each ion detected and identified. This causes the final reconstructed volume to assume a rounded-conical shape, similar to a badminton shuttlecock. The detected events thus become a point cloud data with attributed experimentally measured values, such as ion time of flight or experimentally derived quantities, e.g. time of flight or detector data.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} {{status of}} Auslan has gone hand-in-hand <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> of the Deaf community in Australia, {{beginning in the}} early 1980s. In 1982, the registration of the first sign language interpreters by NAATI, a newly established regulatory body for interpreting and translating, accorded a sense of legitimacy to Auslan, furthered by the publishing of the first dictionary of Auslan in 1989. Auslan began to emerge as a language of instruction for Deaf students in secondary schools in the 1990s — mainly through the provision of interpreters in mainstream (hearing) schools with deaf support units. Boosted by the 1992 enactment of the federal Disability Discrimination Act, sign language interpreters are also increasingly provided in tertiary education.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} reptiles, {{chameleons}} are poikilotherms meaning their body temperature is completely dependent on environmental temperature. A {{large amount of}} lizards {{are expected to be}} affected by climate change in the near future, especially in Southern Africa where this species is found. If temperatures rise by 1-3 degrees Celsius, then it is expected that Cape Dwarf Chameleon running speed will increase as well. Although speed would be better, bite and grip force would become worse. Chameleons are adapted to current habitat temperatures and conditions, but shifting to a higher temperature would actually benefit some of their traits and abilities. This shows that future persistence of this species is very likely even <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> of global warming.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1946, Rickey signed {{four more}} black players, Campanella, Newcombe, John Wright and Roy Partlow, {{this time with}} much less fanfare. After the {{integration}} of the major leagues in 1947, marked by the appearance of Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers that April, interest in Negro league baseball waned. Black players who were regarded as prospects were signed by major league teams, often without regard for any contracts that might have been signed with Negro league clubs. Negro league owners who complained about this practice were in a no-win situation: they could not protect their own interests without seeming to interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> of players to the majors. By 1948, the Dodgers, along with Veeck's Cleveland Indians had integrated.|$|E

25|$|Fly {{fishing is}} most renowned {{as a method}} for {{catching}} trout, grayling and salmon, {{but it is also}} used {{for a wide variety of}} species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. Many fly anglers catch unintended species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for 'main target' species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> of technology and development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become target species on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.|$|E

500|$|Tucker's premier {{literary}} work was The Valley of Shenandoah (1824), the first fictional tale {{of life in}} Virginia. In relating the downfall of an aristocratic family in the Commonwealth's valley, it drew upon his personal witness of the financial ruin of his in-laws, the family of Charles Carter, and described the inability of an estate owner to manage his monetary affairs, such as he had personally experienced. Tucker further used the novel's characters, again reflecting personal experience, to emphasize that happiness in love and life resulted from the moderation of one's passions. The Valley stressed Tucker's professorial objective, that history must inform the reader with [...] "the progress of society and the arts of civilization; <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> and decline of literature, laws, manners and commerce." [...] He also conveyed through the fiction his view that gentility was independent of wealth, {{that the relationship between}} masters and slaves was imbued with mutual trust and happiness, and that the strong currents of socio-economic change were on the whole beneficent.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "chemical substance" [...] became firmly {{established}} {{in the late eighteenth}} century after work by the chemist Joseph Proust on the composition of some pure chemical compounds such as basic copper carbonate. He deduced that, [...] "All samples of a compound have the same composition; that is, all samples have the same proportions, by mass, of the elements present in the compound." [...] This is now known as the law of constant composition. Later <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> of methods for chemical synthesis particularly in the realm of organic chemistry; the discovery of many more chemical elements and new techniques in the realm of analytical chemistry used for isolation and purification of elements and compounds from chemicals that led to the establishment of modern chemistry, the concept was defined as is found in most chemistry textbooks. However, there are some controversies regarding this definition mainly because the large number of chemical substances reported in chemistry literature need to be indexed.|$|E
2500|$|Panopticon was an overtly {{political}} release, {{and arguably}} the clearest statement made within their music yet.

Bentham described the Panopticon as [...] "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example." [...] Quizzed on government conspiracies, Turner states: [...] "I do believe that each and every day our government and the huge corporate entities of this country lie to us about numerous subjects.
