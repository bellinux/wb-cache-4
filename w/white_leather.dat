[...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked.

500|$|Hendrix's {{performance}} {{featured a}} {{rendition of the}} U.S. national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", during which he used copious amounts of amplifier feedback, distortion, and sustain to replicate the sounds made by rockets and bombs.

The air is slightly static, see". Immortalized in the 1970 documentary film, Woodstock, his guitar-driven version would {{become part of the}} sixties Zeitgeist. Pop critic Al Aronowitz of the New York Post wrote: [...] "It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock, and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties." [...] Images of the performance showing Hendrix wearing a blue-beaded <b>white</b> <b>leather</b> jacket with fringe, a red head-scarf, and blue jeans are widely regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era. He played [...] "Hey Joe" [...] during the encore, concluding the 3½-day festival. Upon leaving the stage, he collapsed from exhaustion.
