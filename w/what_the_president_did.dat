5000|$|In a December 2013 congressional hearing, {{responding}} to a question from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) about the danger posed by President Barack Obama's apparent unilateral modification of laws passed by Congress, Turley said: The danger is quite severe. <b>The</b> problem with <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> is <b>doing</b> is that he's not simply posing {{a danger to the}} constitutional system. He's becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid. That is the concentration of power in every single branch. This Newtonian orbit that the three branches exist in is a delicate one but it is designed to prevent this type of concentration. There [...] two trends going on which should be of equal concern to all members of Congress. One is that we have had the radical expansion of presidential powers under both President Bush and President Obama. We have what many once called an imperial presidency model of largely unchecked authority. And with that trend we also have the continued rise of this fourth branch. We have agencies that are quite large that issue regulations. The Supreme Court said recently that agencies could actually define their own or interpret their own jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|If {{the debt}} ceiling is {{inconsistent}} with existing spending and taxing laws, <b>what</b> must <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>do?</b> In earlier work, we argued that when Congress creates a “trilemma” — {{making it impossible for}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to spend as much as Congress has ordered, to tax only as much as Congress has ordered, and to borrow no more than Congress has permitted — the Constitution requires <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to choose <b>the</b> least unconstitutional path. In particular, he must honor Congress’s decisions and priorities regarding spending and taxing, and he must issue enough debt to do so. Here, we extend the analysis in two ways. First, we rebut several recently-advanced arguments that purport to dissolve the trilemma. We explain that upon close inspection some such arguments amount to non-sequiturs, while one potentially promising solution would merely substitute a nondelegation violation for a separation-of-powers violation. Second, we ask whether our original analysis changes if both Congress and <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> when they pass the annual appropriations measures, knowingly create a trilemma. We conclude that the answer does not change, that is, that spending and taxing laws must still take precedence over the debt ceiling. Accordingly, the debt ceiling is effectively a dead letter, and both Congress and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> should treat it as such...|$|R

40|$|This article, {{published}} in Law 2 ̆ 6 Contemporary Problems, {{was presented at}} a Duke Law School conference, The Constitution Under Clinton: A Critical Assessment. It examines a recurring, unsettled issue of executive power: how <b>the</b> <b>President</b> best fulfills his constitutional responsibilities when confronted with the enforcement of a statute that he believes is unconstitutional. <b>What</b> should <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>do</b> if he believes enforcing a statutory provision would violate the Constitution? Should, for example, a President comply with a congressional command that he believes would violate the constitutional rights of individuals or compromise presidential power? The article examines the two prevailing approaches taken in the academic literature to this longstanding issue of the constitutional allocation of powers, described here as mandatory enforcement and routine non-enforcement of constitutionally objectionable statutes. It then draws upon executive branch policy and practice to develop a third approach: a context-dependent approach that views <b>the</b> <b>President</b> 2 ̆ 7 s non-enforcement authority and responsibility as dependent on the specific statutory provision at issue, including {{the circumstances surrounding the}} law 2 ̆ 7 s enactment. It suggests first the general principles and then particular factors that should guide presidential non-enforcement decisions. The article concludes with an application of those principles and factors to a recent, particularly difficult and close case confronted by President Clinton: a statutory provision (since repealed) that required the discharge of members of the armed forces who were HIV-positive...|$|R
40|$|On December 20, 1860, South Carolinians {{voted to}} abandon the Union and sparked the deadliest war in American history. Led by a proslavery {{movement}} that viewed Abraham Lincoln’s place {{at the helm of}} the federal government as a real and present danger to the security of the South's system of slavery, southerners—both slaveholders and nonslaveholders—willingly risked civil war by seceding from the United States. Rather than staying within the fold of the Union and awaiting <b>the</b> new <b>president’s</b> conduct regarding slavery in the territories and in the slave states, secessionists took bold action to change their destiny. By acting on their expectations of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> new <b>president</b> would <b>do</b> instead of waiting for his actual policy initiatives, they wagered on the possibility of a different future. This dissertation contends that the southern fear of slave insurrection, which was influenced by the Haitian Revolution, and the belief that northern antislavery forces would use violent uprising to end southern slavery shaped the planter ethos over the arc of the antebellum period, affecting national politics. Furthermore, this project explains why secessionists viewed Abraham Lincoln's support of the Wilmot Proviso as a valid reason for disunion...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change may}} soon have its “lawmaking moment” in the United States. The {{inherent}} problem with such lawmaking moments, however, is just that: they are moments. <b>What</b> Congress and <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>do</b> with much fanfare can quickly and quietly slip {{away in the}} ensuing years. This is famously so for environmental law. Subsequent legislative amendments, limited budgets, appropriations riders, interpretive agency rulings, massive delays in rulemaking, and simple nonenforcement are more than capable of converting a seemingly uncompromising legal mandate into {{nothing more than a}} symbolic aspirational statement. Climate change legislation is especially vulnerable to being unraveled over time for a variety of reasons, but especially because {{of the extent to which}} it imposes costs on the short term for the realization of benefits many decades and sometimes centuries later. To be successful over the long term, climate change legislation will need to include institutional design features that insulate programmatic implementation to a significant extent from powerful political and economic interests propelled by short-term concerns. Such design features should include a variety of asymmetric precommitment strategies, which deliberately make it hard (never impossible) to change the law in response to some kinds of concerns while simultaneously providing avenues for change in response to other longer term concerns that are in harmony with the law’s central purpose—to achieve and maintain greenhouse gas emissions reductions over time. The traditional objection to lawmaking precommitment strategies—that the present should not be allowed to bind future lawmakers—also has little force in the climate change context, where the purpose of such strategies is not to protect the present at the expense of the future, but the precise opposite: to protect the future at the expense of the present...|$|R
