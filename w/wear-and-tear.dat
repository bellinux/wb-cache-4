The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from <b>wear-and-tear</b> and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E

25|$|The {{flight of}} the Question Mark did spark an {{interest}} in aerial refueling by the Royal Air Force, seeking to minimize takeoff weights of its bombers and reduce <b>wear-and-tear</b> on its grass airfields, but {{after a series of}} experiments between 1930 and 1937 they abandoned testing. The development of better engines, variable-pitch propellers and all-metal low-wing monoplanes capable of greater range deferred further military interest in aerial refueling, but when the next war turned out to be global in scale, also resulted in lack of capability for many ferrying, antisubmarine, and bombardment operations requiring extended range.|$|E
25|$|DJ turntablism has {{origins in}} the {{invention}} of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to <b>wear-and-tear</b> and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.|$|E

The Light Fleets were cheaper to operate than the armoured fleet carriers while providing a similar sized air group, but during the war proved to be slower, less comfortable, and more prone to <b>wear-and-tear</b> than other RN carriers.

Iqaluit has no public transportation, although there is citywide taxi service. (There used to be bus service in the city, but the service was cancelled due to low ridership.) Motor cars are increasing in number, {{to the extent of}} causing occasional traffic jams known locally as [...] "the rush minute". However, the cost of shipping automobiles and the <b>wear-and-tear</b> of the harsh Arctic climate combined with its notoriously rough roadways mean that snowmobiles remain the preferred form of personal transportation. All-terrain vehicles are also increasingly common in most of the Canadian Arctic. Snowmobiles are used to travel within the city and in the surrounding area. In winter, dog sleds are still used, but primarily for recreation. In winter, the nearby Qaummaarviit Territorial Historic Park and the more remote Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve are only accessible by snowmobile, dog sled or foot. In the summer, both are accessible by boat.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 December 2004, {{a massive}} {{submerged}} earthquake and ensuing tsunami waves {{swept across the}} Indian Ocean basin, causing widespread devastation and killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries. The military element of humanitarian and relief effort was designated Operation Unified Assistance {{under the direction of}} Combined Support Force 536 (CSF-536). On 28 December 2004, Carrier Strike Group Nine set sail from Hong Kong and arrived off the coast of Indonesia near Banda Aceh, Sumatra, on 1 January 2005. Rear Admiral William D. Crowder, was designated as commander, Combined Support Group Indonesia, as part of CSF-536. [...] Abraham Lincolns Air Transportation Office coordinated the flow of supplies into the region, and the carrier provided air traffic control for the relief effort. SH-60 helicopters Seahawks from squadrons HSL-47 and HS-2 ferried supplies from collection points in Sumatra for trans-shipment to disaster victims in the vicinity. The intensive nature of the support missions drove the Seahawks to log over 1,000hours, {{more than three times the}} expected <b>wear-and-tear</b> of standard deployments. HSL-47 itself logged over 600hours during the month of January 2005. Strike group ships, such as the destroyer Benfold, served as re-fueling stations for helicopters involved in relief efforts. Benfold provided 155gallons (586.7liters) of fuel a day, accounting for more than 14,500gallons (54,888.47liters) of fuel since this disaster relief operation began. [...] Benfold also served as a mothership for Naval Oceanographic Office team conducting safety of navigation surveys of the altered Indonesian coastlines that had been affected by the tsunami at the request of the Indonesian government. The fast combat support ship Rainier provided underway replenishment support to 32 American, British, and Australian warships involved in Operation Unified Assistance. Also, sailors and Marines from Carrier Strike Group Nine went ashore to provide humanitarian assistance. Sailors from the Abraham Lincolns Engineering Department Repair Division designed a potable water manifold to help bring fresh water to Aceh Province, Sumatra, with the system beginning to ship the much-needed fresh water on 4 January. Also, teams from the strike group, including the destroyer Benfold, flew into Banda Aceh daily to work at the Sultan IskandarMuda Air Force Base to unload humanitarian aid from trucks to waiting helicopters that deliver the aid to survivors in remote locations.|$|E

60|$|The island {{itself as}} plainly showed the {{overwhelming}} {{power of the}} earthquake, as the beach did that of the consequent great wave. The ground in many parts was fissured in north and south lines, perhaps caused by the yielding of the parallel and steep sides of this narrow island. Some of the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide. Many enormous masses had already fallen on the beach; and the inhabitants thought that when the rains commenced far greater slips would happen. The effect of the vibration on the hard primary slate, which composes {{the foundation of the}} island, was still more curious: the superficial parts of some narrow ridges were as completely shivered {{as if they had been}} blasted by gunpowder. This effect, which was rendered conspicuous by the fresh fractures and displaced soil, must be confined to near the surface, for otherwise there would not exist a block of solid rock throughout Chile; nor is this improbable, as it is known that the surface of a vibrating body is affected differently from the central part. It is, perhaps, owing to this same reason that earthquakes do not cause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as would be expected. I believe this convulsion has been more effectual in lessening the size of the island of Quiriquina, than the ordinary <b>wear-and-tear</b> of the sea and weather during the course of a whole century.|$|E
