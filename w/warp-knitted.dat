In a circular <b>warp-knitting</b> machine, geometric parameters such as the diameter of the patterning rings and the distance between the patterning rings and the needles can significantly affect the patterning capability of the machine.

A set of mathematical equations governing the geometric relationship that determines the limits of the motion of the patterning rings is presented.

A series of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics was produced on a double-needle bar Raschel warp knitting machine by varying their structural parameters, including spacer monofilament inclination and fineness, fabric thickness, and surface layer structure. A drop-weight impact tester was used to test these fabrics with predefined impact energy. The impact process of a typical spacer fabric was analyzed based on its impact contact force-displacement curve, energy absorbed-contact force curve and transmitted force-time curve. The effects of the structural parameters on the impact compressive behavior of the <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics were also discussed. The relationship between the peak transmitted force and peak contact force was established for these fabrics. The study shows that the <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics {{can be used as a}} type of effective material for human body protection due to their high energy absorption capacity and reduction of the contact peak force.

The first part, as presented in the current paper, focuses on {{the establishment of a}} constitutive model that can give accurate compressive stress–strain relationships of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics. Based on the analysis of three existing models for polymeric or metallic foams, a constitutive model consisting of seven parameters was firstly proposed for spacer fabrics. The effect of each parameter on the regressive stress–strain curves was then parametrically studied. Experimental validation was finally conducted by using 12 <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics produced with different spacer monofilament diameters and inclination angles, fabric thicknesses, and outer layer structures to identify the physical sense of the parameters. The analysis has showed that an excellent agreement exists between the regressive and experimental results, and all seven parameters have a quantitative effect on a particular phase of the resultant compressive stress–strain curves of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics.

This work explores {{the differences between the}} tensile properties of weft inlay <b>warp-knitted</b> fabrics of high-strength glass and carbon rovings as concrete reinforcements. In this study, 12 types of <b>warp-knitted</b> fabrics with different stitch patterns, including tricot, cord, and pillar stitches, were produced. The effect of the stitch type on the tensile properties of the fabrics was examined. The stitch type was found to significantly affect the tensile properties of the <b>warp-knitted</b> fabrics. The results showed that the tensile strength of fabrics with tricot and cord stitches is greater than that of fabrics with the pillar stitch. The increase in tensile strength was 14 % for fabrics made of glass roving and 21 % for fabrics made of carbon rovings. A similar gradation was observed for the Young’s modulus of the fabrics.

Preclotting efficiency, surgical handling characteristics, thrombogenicity, and 56 -day healing in the descending thoracic aorta of mongrel dogs were measured for seven different arterial prostheses of the same basic design constructed to test the influence of decreased porosity produced by increased yarn denier at a constant needle density. The six prototypes tested were 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, and 280 denier. The 140 denier prosthesis (Bionit, C. R. Bard, Inc., Billerica, MA) served as the control. The water porosity of these prostheses varied from 2036 ml/cm 2 /min at 120 mmHg for the control to 286 for the 280 prototype. The preclotting efficiency increased with decreased water porosity and with increased outer-wall filamentousness. Desirability of surgical handling characteristics decreased with lowered water porosity, while the degree of outer-wall filamentousness had little influence. All the prostheses showed excellent through-wall healing at 56 days, including endothelialization.
