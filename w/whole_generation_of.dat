5|$|Several journalists {{hypothesized}} that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a <b>whole</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|For the Burmese, {{the treaty}} {{was a total}} humiliation and a {{long-lasting}} financial burden. A <b>whole</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> men had been wiped out in battle.

25|$|In the end, West's anti-Communism {{remained}} {{the centerpiece of}} her politics because she so consistently challenged the Communists as legitimate foes {{of the status quo}} in capitalist countries. In West's view, Communism, like fascism, was merely a form of authoritarianism. Communists were under party discipline and therefore could never speak for themselves. And West was a supreme example of an intellectual who spoke for herself, no matter how her comments might injure her. Indeed, few writers explicitly acknowledged how much West's embrace of unpopular positions hurt her on the left. A <b>whole</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> writers abandoned West and refused to read her, as Doris Lessing suggested.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, the Burmese put up {{the best}} fight in the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826), the longest and most {{expensive}} war in British Indian history. The campaign cost the British five million to 13 million pounds sterling (roughly 18.5 billion to 48 billion in 2006 US dollars), and 15,000 men. But for the Burmese, {{it was the beginning}} of the end of their independence. Not only did they lose their entire western and southern territories by the Treaty of Yandabo, a <b>whole</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> men had been wiped out on the battlefield. After 30 years of growing technology gap, the outcome of Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852) was never in doubt. Lower Burma was lost. Another three decades later, the Third Anglo-Burmese War (1885) lasted less than a month. The entire country was gone.|$|E

He had inspired a <b>whole</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Burmese nationalists and writers by his work mainly written in verse, fostering immense pride in their history, language and culture, and urging them to take direct action such as strikes by students and workers. It was Hmaing as leader of the mainstream Dobama who sent the Thirty Comrades abroad for military training, and after independence devoted his life to internal peace and national reconciliation until he {{died at the age of}} 88 in 1964.
