40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} invertibility of graphs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> unique <b>perfect</b> matching, i. e. graphs having a unique 1 -factor.

We characterize all graphs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> unique <b>perfect</b> matching on m< 6 vertices with respect to their positive and negative invertibility.
