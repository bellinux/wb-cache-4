25|$|In a {{shocking}} twist however, the entire {{chain of events}} is revealed to have been engineered {{by none other than}} Argus Pytel himself: a top ranking intelligence officer and a Collaborationist, he engineered for both Resistance groups to embark on suicidal missions, confident of the Empire's chance to recover quickly from any damage via its control over the timeline. The rebel crew member aboard the Cobalt King was actually killed by Pytel and not the other <b>way</b> <b>around,</b> <b>a</b> fact he took advantage of to trick his father's faction into action. The plan however took yet another unexpected turn when, surprising the attacker of the Domus and shooting him down with a barrage of missiles, he was horrified to discover he had just killed his own father. Meanwhile, approximately a thousand years later, Akyta was herself met with a defeat as the Ophan, upon critically malfunctioning, activated the Project's self-destruct system, detonating the facility and killing the Enkie slaves, effectively eradicating the entire Enkie race.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, the {{majority}} of the officers of the Task Force, both French and British, admired Beaufre as an elegant yet tough general with a sharp analytical mind who always kept his cool. Most of the officers of the Anglo-French Task Force expressed regret that it was Beaufre who was Stockwell's deputy rather the other <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> <b>A</b> major problem both politically and militarily with the planning for Musketeer was the one-week interval between sending troops to the eastern Mediterranean {{and the beginning of the}} invasion. Additionally, the coming of winter weather to the Mediterranean in late November would render the invasion impossible, which thus meant the invasion had to begin before then. An additional problem was Eden, who constantly interfered with the planning and was so obsessed with secrecy that he refused to tell Keightley what his political objectives were in attacking Egypt, namely was he interested in retaking the Suez canal or toppling Nasser, or both. Eden's refusal to explain to Keightley just what exactly he was hoping to accomplish by attacking Egypt exasperated Keightley to no end, and greatly complicated the planning process.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the start}} of Parks and Recreation, Ron has two ex-wives, {{both of whom are}} named Tammy, which is also the name of Ron's mother. Ron despises and fears both of his ex-wives, and they are among the few {{individuals}} in the world who can break Ron's usually unwavering stoicism. Nevertheless, Ron shares an extremely passionate sexual connection with his second ex-wife; he compared having sex with her to [...] "doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours," [...] and added, [...] "That woman really knows her <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> penis." [...] Ron is so susceptible to Tammy 2's sexual temptations that he made a video-tape warning himself about her to play in case he ever got back together with her. Ron plays the saxophone, and secretly performs at out-of-town jazz clubs under the name Duke Silver, which he keeps secret from his colleagues in Pawnee. He wears a trilby hat and suit jacket while playing, fronts a band called the Duke Silver Trio, and has released such albums as Memories of Now, Smooth as Silver, and Hi Ho, Duke. His music is especially popular with older women (among them being April's mother), who find Duke Silver extremely attractive.|$|E

500|$|In a 2010 column, Colum Lynch of Foreign Policy {{magazine}} {{criticized the}} resolution {{as one of}} the ten worst UN resolutions in history. After the Soviet Union ended its boycott of the council, it used its veto power to block any further resolutions against North Korea. In response, Acheson introduced a new procedure to the UN General Assembly to allow a member state to bypass the UNSC and seek approval in the General Assembly, including recommendations on the use of force, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377. When this was passed, it allowed for open-ended General Assembly emergency special sessions to address threats to international peace and security for which the UNSC was unable to pass a resolution. Lynch wrote that the creation of this rule caused unintended negative consequences for the United States [...] in 1997 when several Arab states began the Tenth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to address the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This session, convened as a <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> US veto, spanned 30 meetings over the next ten years, and has never formally been closed.|$|E

He went on to conclude [...] "even though her 'act' is to be far too revealing about her dirty habits, she has still managed to create something of a mystique cloud around herself". Billboard magazine's Monica Herrera was impressed with the song, calling it [...] "blissful". She went on to compliment the song for its strong chorus that has the ability to [...] "stick with the listener for days". Sara Anderson of AOL Radio called the song [...] "a playful take on a teen love obsession", complimenting [...] "Kesha's signature auto-tuned vocals and casual chatty ad-libs". Anderson commented on the chorus of the song calling it [...] "a modern Cyndi Lauper-inspired chorus". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was positive in his review of the song, calling it [...] "a fun little disco tune", and wrote that the singer [...] "isn't reinventing the wheel {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, but she has her share of catchy would-be hits." ...|$|E

[...] We then have a statue depicting Saint Veronica but this is broken and faces the wrong <b>way</b> <b>around,</b> <b>a</b> statue of John the Evangelist of which the head is broken and a seated Saint Yves which has also suffered damage. Then comes a statue of the Virgin Mary with two devils one of which is the devil of the temptation of Eve. Next is a scene depicting the resurrection although Jesus has lost his head. He is stepping from the tomb and is surrounded by two sleeping soldiers. We also have a scene showing the mouth of hell and the descent into limbo and a depiction of the Virgin Mary with child accompanied by one magi.|$|E
