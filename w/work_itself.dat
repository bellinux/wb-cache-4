5|$|Mendelssohn {{originally}} {{proposed the}} idea of the violin concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{contains}} Southey's {{bias against}} superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. He {{believed that the}} <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's political views. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many saying that there were beautiful scenes, but many feeling that the language fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E

5|$|The work survives in six manuscripts {{that range}} in date from about 1200 to around 1330, {{belonging}} to two different manuscript traditions. Besides the six surviving manuscripts, three others {{were known to}} scholars in the 17th and 18th centuries, but have not survived to the present day. Two other separate copies may also have existed. The complete <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> was first printed in 1644, but an earlier partial edition appeared in 1628. The Leges is the first legal treatise in English history, and has been credited with having the greatest effect on the views of English law before the reign of King Henry II than any other work of its kind.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{maintenance}} fully {{reverted to}} DOT. With the state facing financial {{difficulties in the}} slow economy, Governor David Paterson decided that DOT could save a few million dollars doing the <b>work</b> <b>itself.</b> In August of that year, the department bought $6 million worth of new equipment and hired 54 new employees to handle maintenance duties on the highway.|$|E

50|$|When {{exchange}} rates {{are free to}} shift, an imbalance in international payments <b>works</b> <b>itself</b> out by a shift in {{exchange rates}}. When exchange rates are fixed by the gold standard, an imbalance in international payments <b>works</b> <b>itself</b> out by shifts in internal price levels (i.e. inflation or deflation). Fluctuating price levels (especially deflation) are bad for the economy, and so in 1929-36, countries went off the gold standard. (p65-66) A gold standard requires special conditions in order to function, and these conditions were disappearing by 1900 and largely gone after the economic changes brought about by World War I. (pp65-66) Quigley elaborates on this in the following section.|$|R

25|$|Reward-based {{systems are}} {{certainly}} {{the more common}} practice for attempting to influence motivation within an organization, but some employers strive to design the <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> to be more conducive. There are multiple ways an organization can leverage job design principles to increase motivation. Three of the predominant approaches will be discussed here: the Humanistic Approach, the Job Characteristics Approach, and the Interdisciplinary Approach.|$|E

25|$|The {{story is}} framed by its preface and coda as a puppet show {{taking place at}} a fair; the cover {{illustration}} of the serial instalments was not of the characters but of a troupe of comic actors at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. The narrator, variously a show manager or writer, appears at times within the <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> and is highly unreliable, repeating a tale of gossip at second or third hand.|$|E

25|$|The TtEias (1979) were {{intended}} {{not only to}} create volume, but to draw lines that are nearly invisible. True to Neo-concrete art, {{there is a relationship}} between the viewer and the art as the lighting of the prisms changes according to the viewer's position in the exhibition space, accentuating the spatial relationship between the viewer and the <b>work</b> <b>itself.</b> The spectacular shimmering lines of TtEias(1979) and the effect they produce in the viewers has been compared in lightness and weight to cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|Many style guides do {{not provide}} {{guidance}} on sentence spacing. In some cases, the spacing of the volume or <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> provides an indication on the recommendation for usage of sentence spacing. A lack of guidance on sentence spacing is also notable for style guides in languages which did not adopt double sentence spacing to accommodate the mechanical limitations of the typewriter, and which conform to the current convention for published work, single sentence spacing. Most language guides for languages with prescriptive guidance provided by an academy also {{do not provide}} advice on sentence spacing.|$|E
25|$|Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was {{responsible}} for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{hoped that}} private shipyards {{would be able}} to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This {{turned out not to be}} the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries had no choice but to do the <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> on a cost-plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.|$|E

The organisation proposes that sex <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> be decriminalised, but that clients of sex workers become criminally liable.|$|E
25|$|In 1168, Maimonides (Rambam) {{published}} a comprehensive {{commentary on the}} Mishnah. It was written in transliterated Judeo-Arabic (using Hebrew letters) {{and was one of}} the first commentaries of its kind. In it, Rambam condensed the associated Talmudical debates, and offered his conclusions in a number of undecided issues. Of particular significance are the various introductory sections – as well as the introduction to the <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> – these are widely quoted in other works on the Mishnah, and on the Oral law in general. Perhaps the most famous is his introduction to the tenth chapter of tractate Sanhedrin where he enumerates the thirteen fundamental beliefs of Judaism.|$|E
