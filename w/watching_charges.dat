5000|$|Human {{rights groups}} hold Habré {{responsible}} for the killing of thousands of people, but the exact number is unknown. Killings included massacres against {{ethnic groups in the}} south (1984), against the Hadjerai (1987), and against the Zaghawa (1989). Human Rights <b>Watch</b> <b>charged</b> him with having authorized tens of thousands of political murders and physical torture. Habré had been called [...] "the African Pinochet," [...] in reference to former Chilean ruler Augusto Pinochet.|$|R
5000|$|The watch has 9 axis {{movement}} sensors (gyro, accelerometer, compass), barometer, {{and heart rate}} sensor. The watch has a microphone which is used with Google Now's speech recognition. Unlike newer Wear devices it doesn't have a speaker, it can only vibrate for alerts.The <b>watch</b> <b>charges</b> through contacts on its back, which connect via sprung [...] "pogo" [...] pins to a magnetically clamped puck, and the puck has a microUSB connector and thus requires an external power source.|$|R
50|$|Jordanian {{policies}} {{came under}} fire in 2006, when a report by Human Rights <b>Watch</b> <b>charged</b> officials with {{trying to keep a}} large number of Iraqi refugees practically invisible. The report stated that wealthy Iraqis were able to buy residency permits, opening the way to better lives, work, and access to Jordanian public services. Poorer Iraqis were unable to afford residency permits, and without legal status have no guarantee of jobs, health care, or education for their children. This sector is especially vulnerable to harassment and deportation.|$|R

In a dazed way he <b>watched</b> <b>charge</b> after charge disposed of with lightning quickness. But were they never going to reach his business? And then suddenly he saw the little scarecrow man of last night advancing to the dock between two policemen, more ragged and miserable than ever by light of day, like some shaggy, wan, grey animal, surrounded by sleek hounds.|$|R
50|$|Conservative legal group Judicial Watch filed {{a federal}} lawsuit seeking information. This {{happened}} in 1995, wherein they filed an {{action in the}} United States District Court for the District of Columbia under the Freedom of Information Act seeking information from the Department of Commerce regarding the department's selection of participants for foreign trade missions. In May 1995, following a search in response to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests, the Department produced approximately 28,000 pages of nonexempt information and withheld about 1,000 documents as exempt. Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of Commerce's search, and Judicial <b>Watch</b> <b>charged</b> that some Department officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents.|$|R

40|$|Programs {{teaching}} {{teenagers to}} "just say no" to sex before marriage are threatening adolescent health by censoring basic {{information about how}} to prevent HIV/AIDS, Human Rights <b>Watch</b> <b>charged</b> in a new report released today. The forty-seven page report focuses on federally funded "abstinence-only-until-marriage" programs in Texas, where advertising campaigns convey the message that teenagers should not use condoms because they don't work. Some school-based programs in Texas do not mention condoms at all. Federal health agencies share the broad scientific consensus that condoms, when used correctly, are highly effective in preventing the transmission of HIV. Yet the U. S. government currently spends more than $ 100 million each year on "abstinence-only-until-marriage" programs, which cannot by law "promote or endorse" condoms or provide instruction regarding their use. The Bush administration is advocating a 33 percent increase in funding for these programs...|$|R
5000|$|The Battle of Amoaful {{was fought}} on 31 January. A road was {{cut to the}} village and the Black Watch led the way, forming square in the {{clearing}} with the Rifle Brigade, while flanking columns moved around the village. With the pipes playing [...] "The Campbells Are Coming" [...] the Black <b>Watch</b> <b>charged</b> with bayonets and the shocked Ashantis fled. The flank columns were slow moving in the jungle and the Ashantis moved around them in their normal horseshoe formation and attacked the camp 2 mi to the rear. The Royal Engineers defended themselves until relieved by the Rifle Brigade. Although there was another small battle two days later, the Battle of Ordashu, the action had been decisive and the route to Kumasi was open. There were three killed and 165 wounded Europeans, one killed and 29 African troops wounded.|$|R

2500|$|During the IDF's {{operations}} in the camp, Palestinian sources alleged that a massacre of hundreds of people had taken place. A senior Palestinian Authority official alleged in mid-April that some 500 had been killed. During the fighting in Jenin, Israeli officials had also initially estimated hundreds of Palestinian deaths, but later said they expected the Palestinian toll to reach [...] "45 to 55." [...] In the ensuing controversy, Israel blocked the United Nations from conducting the first-hand inquiry unanimously sought by the Security Council, but the UN nonetheless felt able to dismiss claims of a massacre in its report, which {{said there had been}} approximately 52 deaths, criticising both sides for placing Palestinian civilians at risk. Based on their own investigations, Amnesty International and Human Rights <b>Watch</b> <b>charged</b> that some IDF personnel in Jenin had committed war crimes but also confirmed that no massacre had been committed by the IDF. Both human rights organizations called for official inquiries; the IDF disputed the charges.|$|R

In December 1998, following discovery, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Judicial Watch and ordered DOC to perform a new search. During the investigation, Nolanda B. Hill, a business partner of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown testified that Brown {{had told her that}} first lady Hillary Clinton was {{the driving force behind the}} efforts to raise as much money as possible for President Clinton's reelection and the DNC. And further that, [...] "...companies were being solicited to donate large sums of money in exchange for their selection to participate on trade missions of the Commerce Department." ...|$|R

60|$|While she thus spoke, the scrip, {{which had}} {{produced}} {{the means of}} striking fire, furnished provision for a meal; of which she herself scarce partook, but anxiously <b>watched</b> her <b>charge,</b> taking a pleasure, resembling that of an epicure, in each morsel which he swallowed with a youthful appetite which abstinence had rendered unusually sharp. Roland readily obeyed her recommendations, and ate the food which she so affectionately and earnestly placed before him. But {{she shook her head}} when invited by him in return to partake of the refreshment her own cares had furnished; and when his solicitude became more pressing, she refused him in a loftier tone of rejection.|$|R
50|$|At dawn, the {{artillery}} {{was brought to}} bear against the Mahdist skirmishers and they were driven back. The infantry (which included the Black Watch) then formed into two infantry squares each of brigade-size and advanced. One square was commanded by Colonel Davis, with General Graham, and the other by Colonel Buller. A scouting party discovered that {{the main body of}} the Mahdist force was hidden in a nearby ravine, whereupon General Graham ordered the Black <b>Watch</b> to <b>charge</b> to clear those Mahdists out, leaving a wide gap where they had been stationed in the square. A sudden onslaught of Mahdists rushed into this gap.|$|R

50|$|Ireland’s {{reporting}} on Iran in the {{several years after}} 2005 drew harsh rebuttals {{from a number of}} Iranian activists, as well as from Scott Long, director of the LGBT Rights Program at Human Rights <b>Watch.</b> They <b>charged</b> that Ireland and Gay City News generally were uncritical in relying on sources who maintained that two young men hanged in Mashhad, Iran in mid-2005 -- after being convicted of raping an underage boy {{at a time when they}} themselves were underage -- had in fact been involved in consensual sex. Long and some other human rights advocates criticized activists and reporters, including Ireland and controversial British campaigner Peter Tatchell, saying they were engaging in unwarranted speculation about the motives for the case.|$|R
50|$|In {{the panel}} {{discussion}} {{that followed the}} airing of the film Stolen by PBS World {{as part of the}} AfroPoP series, Eric Goldstein, the Deputy Director of Human Rights <b>Watch</b> in <b>charge</b> of the Middle East/North Africa desk noted that when he had {{brought to the attention of}} officials in the camp an incident in which a dark skinned woman had been denied the ability to marry, they immediately took steps to remedy the situation. He also noted that this practice was the only vestige of slavery that he had found in his investigation of the camps. Bakary Tandia, a human rights activist in the movement against slavery, originally from Mauritania, commented in the post film discussion that Stolen depicts slavery in the POLISARIO camps as it is practiced in Mauritania.|$|R

5000|$|Seeing {{his fellow}} cavalrymen humiliated and repulsed, General Gessler, Frederick's chief of cavalry, {{took it upon}} himself to order a general charge with all his {{remaining}} squadrons. Gessler had evidently been stung by a reprimand on his courage by the Prussian King a few days before and was anxious to amend the insult. He was also merely obeying Frederick's standing order to all of his cavalry to never let a check go unanswered, but to always attack on its own initiative. So filtering all of his 7,200 troopers through the Prussian infantry, Gessler led a massive charge down into the floodplain. As he <b>watched</b> this <b>charge</b> unfold, Frederick was said to have exclaimed, [...] "My God, what is my cavalry doing! They're attacking a second time, and nobody gave the order!" ...|$|R
