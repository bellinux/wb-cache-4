500|$|Bechdel {{wrote and}} {{illustrated}} Fun Home over a seven-year period. Her meticulous artistic process made {{the task of}} illustration slow. She began each page by creating a framework in Adobe Illustrator, on which she placed the text and drew rough figures. She used extensive photo reference and, for many panels, posed for each human figure herself, using a digital camera to record her poses. Bechdel also used photo reference for background elements. For example, to illustrate a panel depicting fireworks seen from a Greenwich Village rooftop on July 4, 1976, she used Google Images to find {{a photograph of the}} New York skyline taken from that particular building in that period. She also painstakingly copied by hand many family photographs, letters, local maps and excerpts from her own childhood journal, incorporating these images into her narrative. After using the reference material to draw a tight framework for the page, Bechdel copied the line art illustration onto plate finish Bristol board for the final inked page, which she then scanned into her computer. The gray-blue ink wash for each page was drawn on a separate page of <b>watercolor</b> <b>paper,</b> and combined with the inked image using Photoshop. Bechdel chose the bluish [...] wash color for its flexibility, and because it had [...] "a bleak, elegiac quality" [...] which suited the subject matter. Bechdel attributes this detailed creative process to her [...] "barely controlled obsessive-compulsive disorder".|$|E

2500|$|Because it was cheaper for Ira Turek {{to trace}} {{photographs}} {{to create the}} backgrounds, Bakshi and Johnnie Vita walked around {{the streets of the}} Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem to take moody snapshots. Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds stylized realism that had never been portrayed in animation before. After Turek completed a background drawing in ink on an animation cel, the drawing would be photocopied onto <b>watercolor</b> <b>paper</b> for Vita and onto animation paper for use in matching the characters to the backgrounds. When Vita finished his painting, Turek's original drawing, on the cel, would be placed over the watercolor, obscuring the photocopy lines on the painting. However, not every background was taken from live-action sources. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced by the [...] "Ash Can style" [...] of painters, which includes George Luks and John French Sloan. The film also used bent and fisheye camera perspectives in order to replicate the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city.|$|E

50|$|A form of blotter paper {{commonly}} known as <b>watercolor</b> <b>paper</b> is produced for its absorbent qualities, allowing much better absorption of water and pigments than standard art or drawing papers.
