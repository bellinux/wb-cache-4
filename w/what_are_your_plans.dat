6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] she said, [...] "as a friend, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans?</b> Forget that I am {{interested}} in politics altogether. I simply {{want to know how}} you are spending your time for the next few months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Sophy," [...] I said, [...] "tell me {{all about}} yourself; {{where have you been}} living, and how have you been getting on all this time, and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> for the future? Your little child, too, Sophy? What has become of it? You have not lost it, have you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ali Akbar Velayati: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> {{for more}} joys and {{fun in the}} community?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> the most {{important}} step for sports development? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] went on Zinti presently, [...] "beyond {{the neck}} of the hill yonder lies the secret kraal of Bull-Head. Say, now, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> when you reach it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} {{she is in a}} swoon," [...] {{answered}} Leonard; [...] "but for heaven's sake be quick, Otter, for I am being frozen on this ice. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well enough," [...] he answered. [...] "And now, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans?</b> The {{river is}} in flood, {{you will find}} it {{difficult}} to cross. Still it can be done, for I hear that the white man, Ishmael, of whom you told me, forded it this morning with a company of armed men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] began Mr. Tristram, {{when they}} had tested the {{decoction}} which he had caused to be served to them, [...] "now just {{give an account of}} yourself. What are your ideas, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans,</b> where have you come from and where are you going? In the first place, where are you staying?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{may be at}} the Château de Brestalou in the keeping of M. le Comte de Cambray: {{and this}} I shall find out first of all. But I must not stand gossiping any longer. I must see Colonel de la Bédoyère and get the men I want. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans,</b> my dear Clyffurde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{that you}} have a right, Brother, who are far above us all. But when you <b>are</b> a king, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan?</b> Do you purpose to strive to conquer me and rule over Tavantinsuyu, as perchance you could do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Tonight we {{mentioned}} Afghanistan. We believe that Osama bin Laden is hiding {{perhaps in a}} cave somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border. If you get a second term, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> to capture him and then to neutralize those who have sprung up to replace him? ...|$|R
5000|$|Mohsen Rezaee: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> government's <b>plan</b> {{to provide}} housing and curb prices? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Leonard, [...] "to tell me {{that you}} have murdered my best friend, and one who was but lately your god. I thank you for your news, Nam, and now, if I might make bold to ask it, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> with {{reference}} to ourselves--I mean until it suits you to send us after our companions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{all that}} you have told me," [...] I said, [...] "I will not ask you to admit me any further into your {{confidence}} until we meet again. Only let me hear how I can relieve your most pressing anxieties. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans?</b> Can I {{do anything to help}} them before you go to rest to-night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When Josie and Duncan had gone, Uncle James {{called his}} nephew and niece into the parlour, {{and sat down}} before them with {{approving}} eyes. [...] "I {{want to have a}} little talk with you two. I'm sorry I've let so many years go by without making your acquaintance, because you seem worth getting acquainted with. Now, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> for the future?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good," [...] I said, [...] "now we understand--not much, but a little. Tell us next <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan?</b> How <b>are</b> we to {{come into}} the place where this great ape lives? And if we come there, how are we to kill the beast, seeing that <b>your</b> successor, Komba, <b>was</b> careful to prevent us from {{bringing}} our firearms to your land?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Mr. President, {{my mother}} and sister {{traveled}} abroad this summer and, when they got back, they talked to us about how shocked {{they were at the}} intensity of aggravation that other countries had with how we handled the Iraq situation. Diplomacy is, obviously, something that we have to really work on. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan</b> to repair relations with other countries, given the current situation? ...|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{relying on}} search engines, directories, and advertising, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> six-month <b>plan</b> for {{increasing}} the number of visitors to your website? ...|$|R
6000|$|He laughed. [...] "From the stone's {{point of}} view," [...] he answered, [...] "I never {{could see the}} {{advantage}} of being smothered in moss. I should always prefer remaining the stone, unhidden, able to move and see about me. But now, to speak of other matters, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> for the immediate future? Your opera, thanks to the gentlemen, the gods have dubbed 'Goggles,' will, I fancy, run through the winter. Are you getting any salary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, Father," [...] he said {{somewhat}} brusquely, [...] "as you see, I {{have got}} rid of those slaves. It was impossible to take them with us, and now they must shift for themselves: at any rate, they are better off than they were yonder. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans?</b> You have behaved well to us, but I cannot forget that we found you in bad company. Perhaps you wish to return to it, {{and in that case}} your way lies eastward," [...] and he nodded towards the Nest.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I didn't mean {{to preach}} a sermon, {{but just to}} give you an idea of why Pat and I prefer to be savages, if you please, and spend our lives with nature. Now, Pat, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans?</b> When do you start in for camp? Haven't heard a word since you left from"--he paused at a warning wink from Pat, and then finished--"your partner. Big Jim was down from the lumber camp this week and {{reported}} seeing a silver gray. If you could catch a couple of those fellows that problem of going away to school would pretty nearly settle itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled and}} dropped her hand. [...] "No, no. You've said good-by to the cinch, I can see that. You're {{on the road}} to opera boxes and limousines. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan?</b> <b>What</b> would you advise Wayland to do if you knew I was hard against his marrying you? Come, now, I can see you're a clear-sighted individual. What can he do to earn a living? How will you live without my aid? Have you figured on these things?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ali Akbar Velayati: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> government's action <b>plan</b> to curb inflation? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> may <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> but {{you ought}} to go into steam. When a man has got his master's {{certificate}} it's the proper time. If I were you I would go into steam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, dear father," [...] {{she said}} as lightly as she could for she still felt very faint and ill, [...] "I am quite well, I assure you [...] . . . please [...] . . . please [...] . . ." [...] she urged earnestly, [...] "do not worry about me now, but tell me quite clearly--and as briefly as you can--exactly <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> at this moment [...] . . . yours and Gaston's, {{with regard to the}} {{expedition}} against the Stuart prince [...] . . . you spoke of a duel just now [...] . . . and then of Monsieur de Stainville's enthusiasm and courage.

6000|$|... "Friends," [...] {{repeated}} Mademoiselle Virginie, {{with another}} laugh. [...] "And now for business," [...] she continued, getting {{a row of}} pins ready for use by putting them between her teeth. [...] "I am here, I believe, {{for the purpose of}} ruining the late forewoman, who has set up in opposition to us? Good! I will ruin her. Spread out the yellow brocaded silk, my dear, and pin that pattern on at your end, while I pin at mine. And <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans,</b> Brigida? (Mind you don't forget that Finette is dead, and that Virginie has risen from her ashes.) You can't possibly intend to stop here all your life? (Leave an inch outside the paper, all round.) You must have projects? What are they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, I am satisfied. I {{know now}} {{to whom it}} must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That Mansfield should have done so much for--that you should have found your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, {{and you do not}} want for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good. The Bertrams are {{undoubtedly}} some of the first people in this country. She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world. But go on, go on. Tell me more. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans?</b> Does she know her own happiness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} greatly, señor. I will at once order {{a number of}} men {{to set to work}} casting bullets and {{preparing}} cartridge-cases. In the meantime, please let me hear <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> general's <b>plans</b> for the defence of Portugal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A nice bit of mythology, I am sure," [...] said Leonard. [...] "Our {{old friends}} the Darkness and the Dawn in an African shape, I suppose. But listen to me, mother. This stone, {{if it is}} genuine, is worth many ounces of gold, {{but there are other}} stones so like it that none who are not learned can tell the difference, and if it be one of these it is of little value. Still it may happen that this, and the others of which you speak, are true rubies; at any rate I should be willing to take my chance of that. But now, tell me, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>plan?</b> This <b>is</b> a very pretty story, and the rubies may be there, but how am I to get them?" ...|$|R
40|$|<b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> summer <b>plans?</b> Hanging out poolside {{with a nice}} cold one in {{hand and}} buds in ears won’t cut it anymore. Snagging an {{internship}} will increase your chances of landing a good post-graduate job. “When you’ve been with a company for an internship they already {{know if you can}} do the job,” Jewlie Williams, assistant internship coordinator for Anthropologie, says. “They want to see you succeed and they feel as though they’re taking less of a risk by hiring you because they know you. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your adventures {{are both}} singular," [...] the trader {{said when they}} had finished. [...] "Yours, Don Geoffrey, are extraordinary. It is marvellous {{that you should have}} been picked up in that terrible fight, and should have shared in all the perils of that awful voyage back to Spain without its being ever {{suspected}} that you were English. Once landed in the service as you say of Senor Burke, it is not so surprising that you should have gone freely about Spain. But your other adventures are wonderful, and you and your friend were fortunate indeed in succeeding as you did in carrying off the lady he loved; and deeply they must have mourned your supposed death {{on the deck of the}} Moorish galley. And now tell me <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> when you arrive in Spain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{had entered}} the Castle. Idris stood at a window that over-looked the park; her {{maternal}} eyes sought her own children among the young crowd. An Italian lad had got an audience about him, and with animated gestures was describing some scene of horror. Alfred stood immoveable before him, his whole attention absorbed. Little Evelyn had endeavoured to draw Clara away to play with him; but the Italian's tale arrested her, she crept near, her lustrous {{eyes fixed on the}} speaker. Either watching the crowd in the park, or occupied by painful reflection, we were all silent; Ryland stood by himself in an embrasure of the window; Adrian paced the hall, revolving some new and overpowering idea--suddenly he stopped and said: [...] "I have long expected this; could we in reason expect that this island should be exempt from the universal visitation? The evil is come home to us, and we must not shrink from our fate. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> <b>plans,</b> my Lord Protector, for the benefit of our country?" ...|$|E

40|$|A 59 ‑year‑old gentleman {{presented}} with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in both eyes for one year, worsening {{over the past}} three months. Except for a history of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in his left eye, medical, surgical and ocular history was unremarkable. Best corrected visual acuity was 3 / 10 and 6 / 10 with + 3. 50 ‑ 0. 75 × 180 and − 0. 50 ‑ 0. 75 × 180 in the right and left eyes, respectively. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit lamp examination revealed 2 + nuclear sclerosis (NS) and 2 + posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract in the right eye and a well‑positioned posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL) in his left eye. Intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg in both eyes. On the fundus examination, the media were clear and the optic discs had normal appearance. Vertical cup‑to‑disc ratio was about 0. 4 in both eyes. Figures 1 ‑ 4 show color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography images of both eyes, respectively. Question 1 : How do you explain findings evident on the fundus photograph [Figure 1 a and b], OCT [Figure 2 a and b], FA [Figure 3 a and b] and ICG [Figure 4 a and b]?
