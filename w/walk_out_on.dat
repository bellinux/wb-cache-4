5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then tried to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while they searched for a new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving coach Steve Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties for a month and oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the top table, however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held the unwanted distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E

Venables succeeded Allison as manager in June 1976. It {{proved to be a}} busy month for Venables, as he turned down the surprise offer to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Palace to succeed Bertie Mee as Arsenal manager and also had a para-sailing accident in Majorca which required 40 stitches.|$|E

He announced his retirement from Grand Prix racing and took a holiday in America. At the same time, Auto Union were having to rely on inexperienced drivers. Following the Tripoli Grand Prix they contacted Nuvolari who, having been refreshed from his break, agreed to drive for them. Nuvolari found further success with Auto Union; now driving a faster and more reliable car that enabled him to compete for victories, Nuvolari won his home Grand Prix at Monza and won the Donington Grand Prix in England.|$|E

25|$|The fresh {{change at}} the club was about to bear fruit, when Sydney {{announced}} they had signed Czech Republic manager Vítězslav Lavička. Lavicka completely changed {{the structure of the}} club, and for its first time turning it into a serious, European style football club. He kept faith in Steve Corica and John Aloisi and several others who had threatened to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the club, and as a result, Sydney FC won its first premiership in the club's history. Sydney made it to the Grand Final of the fifth season of the A-League after defeating Wellington Phoenix in the preliminary final. The Grand Final was played against Melbourne Victory at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne. Sydney took the lead after 61 minutes through a Mark Bridge header, just seconds after Melbourne had a goal disallowed for offside. Melbourne equalised through Adrian Leijer in the 81st minute, and the game went on to a penalty shootout with no goals scored in extra time. Melbourne skipper Kevin Muscat missed his penalty, with his shot hitting the post. Sydney FC won the Grand Final 4–2 on penalties which handed the club its second Hyundai A-League Championship.|$|E

On March 10 at Lockdown, Team TNA, consisting of Sting, Eric Young, James Storm, Magnus, and Samoa Joe defeated Aces & Eights, consisting of Devon, DOC, Garett Bischoff, Mike Knox, and Mr. Anderson in a Lethal Lockdown match. After Bully Ray won the World Heavyweight Championship and revealed himself {{as the leader of}} Aces & Eights later that night, Hulk Hogan blamed Sting as he had encouraged Hogan to give Ray the title shot while also encouraging Hogan to support Ray's marriage with his daughter Brooke. Sting proceeded to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Hogan. Sting returned on the April 25 Impact Wrestling, saving Hogan from an attack by the Aces & Eights.

25|$|On the August 3 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Triple H and his wife, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, along with Kurt Angle, were booked in a Six-man tag team match by Commissioner Mick Foley, against the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) and Lita which Triple H, McMahon, and Angle won. After the match, as Triple H left the ring, Angle and McMahon hugged in a victory celebration, {{frustrating}} Triple H and marking {{the beginning of}} a Triple H-Angle feud. On the August 7 edition of Raw is War, Angle and Triple H were booked in a triple threat match, along with Chris Jericho, to determine the number one contender for a WWF Championship match against the defending champion, The Rock. Both Angle and Triple H simultaneously pinned Jericho, which made both Angle and Triple H co-number one contenders; in frustration, Rock delivered a Rock Bottom on Triple H, Angle, and McMahon, who was at ringside during the match. Later that week on SmackDown!, the match was made official for SummerSlam by Commissioner Foley. He also booked a tag team match, where Angle and Triple H would team up against Rock and The Undertaker. During the match, Angle accidentally attacked Triple H, causing Triple H to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the match and a loss for Angle. The following week on Raw is War, Angle, Triple H, and Shane McMahon were booked in a Six-man Tag Team match against the Dudley Boyz and Rock, with the stipulation that if Angle or Triple H walked away from the match, they would lose their number one contender status.

Four years later, when the tide was lower than usual, her friends persuaded her to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the sand where she found the ring inside a scallop.

500|$|Despite this, the battalions of 4th Brigade {{remained}} in good defensive positions.

Having the furthest to travel, at one stage two companies of 18th Battalion got lost before making their way to the safety of the rear of Servia Pass and their transport.

O'Brien was informed that he had been hired by NBC not long before the recording session for this episode began, and he was forced to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> his contract.

500|$|Jackson had to {{deal with}} Presley's absence from rehearsals at Graceland and concert soundchecks.

Presley {{sometimes}} turned {{to the side of the}} stage to ask Jackson to make changes, and a few times he stopped the show to have Jackson come out and stand center stage and listen carefully to the monitors while Presley sang to 20,000 people. One night in Fort Worth, Texas, Presley led the audience in singing [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in honour of the engineer's birthday—an [...] "amazing, and very embarrassing" [...] occasion for Jackson. Jackson can be seen at his side-stage mix position in Presley's 1977 [...] "CBS Special" [...] TV show.

500|$|Before their arrival, Hartlepools {{had been}} forced to apply for {{re-election}} to the Football League six times in the previous seven years, and Taylor stated that the squad were all free transfer signings and some of the players struggled with [...] "drink, debt or abandoned wives". The two gradually turned around the club's fortunes, and started by painting Victoria Park. Taylor had little chance to show his skills in the transfer market as the club only had £7,500 to spend, £4,000 of which went on centre-half Johnny Gill. Other signings included two of Taylor's former players at Burton, defender Tony Parry and goalkeeper Les Green; Parry would go on to win the club's Player of the Year award. The pair went on to lead the club to an eighth-place finish in the Fourth Division in 1966–67 after replacing most of the playing staff, an improvement on 1965–66 when the pair had only managed an 18th-place finish. Clough had initially wanted to quit the club numerous times due to interference from chairman Ernest Ord, but Taylor insisted that they stay as they could not <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> their first job in management. After Ord resigned as chairman Clough wanted to remain at Hartlepools, but Taylor persuaded him to take the offer to manage Derby.|$|E
