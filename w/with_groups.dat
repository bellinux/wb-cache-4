Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle, the city's downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of phytase on the growth performance, bone mineralization, digestion and metabolization of nutrientsubstance in Avian broilers. Each of 400, 1 day old male Avian broilers and 400, 1 day old female Avian broilers was randomly divided into 5 groups (Group I, available phosphorus-adequate group without phytase; Group II, available phosphorus-deficient group without phytase; Group III, available phosphorus-deficient <b>group</b> <b>with</b> 250 U kg - 1 phytase; Group IV, available phosphorus-deficient <b>group</b> <b>with</b> 500 U kg - 1 phytase; Group V, available phosphorus-deficient <b>group</b> <b>with</b> 750 U kg - 1 phytase). Each group included 4 replicates, each with 20 broilers. The results showed that the effect of phytase on the growth permance in male broilers was more obvious than that of female. Dry tibia weights of male and female broilers fed <b>with</b> <b>Group</b> II and III diets were decreased compared <b>with</b> <b>Group</b> I; Group IV and V were increased compared <b>with</b> <b>Group</b> I.

Mötley Crüe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under Lock and Key, Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800° Fahrenheit, and Autograph's second album That's The Stuff.

Publicity campaigns {{around the world have}} aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections.

It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was francium (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939. However, plutonium, produced synthetically in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring element in 1971.|$|E

5|$|The phylum has a {{wide range}} of body forms, {{including}} the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed <b>with</b> <b>groups</b> of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. Most species are hermaphrodites, and juveniles of at least some species are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. This combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.|$|E
5|$|The social {{organisation}} of the blue-faced honeyeater {{has been little}} studied to date. Encountered in pairs, family groups or small flocks, blue-faced honeyeaters sometimes associate <b>with</b> <b>groups</b> of yellow-throated miners (Manorina flavigula). They mob potential threats such as goshawks (Accipiter spp.), rufous owls (Ninox rufa), and Pacific koels (Eudynamys orientalis). There is some evidence of cooperative breeding, with some breeding pairs recorded {{with one or more}} helper birds. Parents will dive at and harass intruders to drive them away from nest sites, including dogs, owls, goannas, and even a nankeen night heron (Nycticorax caledonicus). A study published in 2004 of remnant patches of forest in central Queensland, an area largely cleared for agriculture, showed a reduced avian species diversity in areas frequented by blue-faced honeyeaters or noisy miners. This effect was more marked in smaller patches. The study concluded that conserved patches of woodland containing the two aggressive species should be larger than 20ha (44acres) to preserve diversity.|$|E
