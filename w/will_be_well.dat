25|$|A simple {{example of}} the central limit theorem is rolling {{a large number of}} identical, {{unbiased}} dice. The distribution of the sum (or average) of the rolled numbers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>well</b> approximated by a normal distribution. Since real-world quantities are often the balanced sum of many unobserved random events, the central limit theorem also provides a partial explanation for the prevalence of the normal probability distribution. It also justifies the approximation of large-sample statistics to the normal distribution in controlled experiments.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of repercussion, {{the power of}} animal metamorphosis, or of sending out a familiar, real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician, male and female, all the world over; and witch superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the {{phenomenon of}} repercussion is asserted to manifest itself {{in connection with the}} bush-soul of the West African and the nagual of Central America; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the nagual with a human being are not termed lycanthropy. Nevertheless, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>well</b> to touch on both these beliefs here.|$|E

A news article on October 11, 1912 stated that Worcester Mayor Philip O’Connell, [...] "believes it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>well</b> to have the fountain placed in use without ceremony.” This lack of a ceremony is presumably due to Harvey's suicide and the desire to not celebrate such an act.|$|E

These improvements and the growing population of Fairbanks — by 1905, it had 2,500 residents — allowed the Weekly Fairbanks News to expand to semi-weekly, then daily publication, in the process becoming the Fairbanks Daily News on July 1, 1905. On September 3, the News had its first competition when the Fairbanks Sunday Times began publishing on the sole day that the News did not. Other papers soon arrived in the area.

500|$|It also {{received}} praise by IGN's Jeremy Mullin, {{who gave it}} an overall 9 over 10, having had good opinion of the graphics used during the film and how the film expands Fullmetal Alchemists story. The film was compared to The End of Evangelion due to how both titles expand their anime's endings, resulting in a [...] "proper ending" [...] due to the characters' development featured in the film. Mullin also liked the audio from Conqueror of Shamballa, but added {{that some of the}} English voice actors lacked accents. DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. also liked the film as he was [...] "pleased to report that the story was handled nigh-flawlessly.

500|$|One of the family's keenest {{customers}} was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, {{a wealthy}} collector from Lincolnshire, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became {{disturbed by the}} family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, {{they were at the}} point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent.

[...] The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 20, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with the love affair of two young people, both of whose parents are anxious that they should wed. Young Marlow sent by his father to court {{the daughter of an}} old friend, Mr. Hardcastle. Marlow has spent very little time in the company of the fairer sex, and as a consequence thereof is always shy and nervous in their presence. He, therefore, accepts his father's orders unwillingly and, accompanied by his friend, young Hastings, rides out to meet his future bride. On the road the travelers encounter Hardcastle's stepson, Tony Lumpkin, who in revenge for punishment his stepfather has inflicted, directs Marlow and his friend to the Hardcastle mansion, claiming that it is an inn where they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>well</b> treated. In the meantime, great preparations are being made at the Hardcastle home for the reception of Hardcastle's old friend, and when Tony ushers in young Marlow, thinking Hardcastle merely the proprietor of an inn, he treats him with scant courtesy and orders him about, much to the older man's chagrin. Hardcastle is subjected to his daughter's extravagant costumes, and she appears on this memorable evening dressed in a simple dress and wearing the cap and apron that housewives in the neighborhood assume. This costume greatly pleases her father, but leads young Marlow further astray. He immediately jumps to the conclusion that she is a most attractive barmaid and loses his heart to her in short order. Upon the arrival of his father, Marlow learns his mistake as regards the inn question, but flatly refuses to marry Hardcastle's daughter, claiming that she is too grand for him, and citing his preference for the maid servant. While in the act of making love to the supposed barmaid he is discovered by his father, and, when told that this is the young lady his father had intended him to marry, he is overjoyed, as he feels sure that his bashful disposition would never have allowed him to woo and win her had he known her to be a lady of fashion." ...|$|E
