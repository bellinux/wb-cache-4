He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he will leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Pray, <b>when</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it was to}} be?' said Mr. Edmonstone. 'Upon my word, I {{never in}} all my days saw a lover like you, Guy!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{more than}} makes up," [...] {{declared}} Pat. [...] "'Tis a Christmas I'll never forget." [...] Then as he lovingly fingered a long desired book sent in by Doctor Merriam he added: [...] "But <b>when</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{of the tree}} idea? Was it in New York?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As willing, if not as sumptuous, a host as {{our present}} one," [...] said Iduna; [...] "and <b>when,</b> by-the-bye, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that your friend, the Lord Justinian, will arrive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] said Dick. [...] "Still, I wedged {{the thing}} up {{shortly before the}} accident. It has stood a number of shocks; in fact, it can't be {{loosened}} by pressure on the back. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the last blow was struck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{might get}} up the lakes," [...] the scout said; [...] "but the {{mischief}} {{would be in the}} woods. No, it never would do, captain. If we goes, it must be the three of us and no more. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of starting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I enjoy it," [...] Jack said; [...] "whenever I got {{a holiday}} at Southampton I {{used to go}} out sailing. I knew most of the {{fishermen}} there; they were always ready to take me with them as an extra hand. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we shall get to Dover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cel. You're most unconscionable: <b>When</b> then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{we shall}} come together? There's none {{but the old}} patriarchs could {{live long enough to}} marry you at this rate. What, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take me for some cousin of Methusalem's, that I must stay an hundred years, before I come to beget sons and daughters? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] agreed Josie, emphatically. [...] "We've got {{to stick}} up for our own {{families}} and fight for our good name <b>when</b> it's necessary. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'd let anybody {{get the best of}} a Jessup? Never in a thousand years!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Clarence Day, Jr: [...] "...outside {{green is}} the best color." [...] Mary Skinner: [...] "That's right. I {{never thought of it}} that way. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> of it - it's quite a thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we shall}} have them at an {{advantage}} there, for {{they would have to}} come up under our fire, and there are sure to be places where half a dozen men could keep fifty at bay. Very well, chief, that is settled. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we had better start?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well; but a man has to exert himself sometimes, let the penalty be what it may. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that Sir William {{will have to come}} again?" [...] Sir William, when he came, would come with his knife, and his advent was always to be feared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of {{them are}} dreadfully wounded," [...] she went on, her {{thoughts}} reverting to the hospital. [...] "It is terrible to think that when the great battle everyone seems looking forward to takes place, there may be thousands of wounded to be cared for. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it will be?" ...|$|E
5000|$|At the 1993 World Championships, Dominique was {{in first}} place in the all around competition, but slipped on her final vault, {{bursting}} into tears. A famous moment in gymnastics, Kelli encouraged her to be proud of her performance, telling her: [...] "It's okay, you gave it a good shot. <b>When</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be in that position? You have to be happy with yourself. Come on. Be happy. Stand up and wave." [...] Dominique was given a standing ovation from the crowd for doing so.|$|R
6000|$|I {{know your}} rage <b>when</b> they <b>did</b> me the honor to elect me {{a member of}} the [...] "Poluphloisboiothalasses Club," [...] and I ceased {{consequently}} to dine at home. When I DID dine at home,--on a beefsteak let us say,--I should like to know what you had for supper. You first amputated portions of the meat when raw; you abstracted more <b>when</b> cooked. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I was taken in by your flimsy pretences? I wonder how you could dare to do such things before your maids (you a clergyman's daughter and widow, indeed), whom you yourself were always charging with roguery.|$|R
6000|$|Their {{talk was}} {{for the most part}} frivolous, and their {{thoughts}} ephemeral; but again they were, with her at least, suddenly and deeply serious. Till then all things seemed to have been held in arrest, and impressions, ideas, feelings, fears, desires, released themselves simultaneously, and sought expression with a rush that defied coherence. [...] "Oh, why do we try to talk?" [...] she asked, at last. [...] "The more we say, the more we leave unsaid. Let us keep still awhile!" [...] But she could not. [...] "Bartley! <b>When</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> first <b>think</b> <b>you</b> cared about me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I suppose I {{forgot to}} put it on, one of those mornings on the march. Still, it's not very {{astonishing}} that the thing should worry me. I can't expect to stay on at this ranch. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I can get up and set out again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{compliments}} to your pronouns," [...] Seaman murmured, with {{a little}} bow. [...] "Apropos of what you were saying, you will never make an Englishman--I beg your pardon, one of your countrymen--realise anything unpleasant. He prefers to keep his head comfortably down in the sand. But to leave generalities, <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of going to Norfolk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} will be a little light, sir," [...] Mr. Ryan said, [...] "by the time we have got it {{perfectly}} smooth and even. Still, I have seen lighter spars in a ship of this size, and I certainly think we are most fortunate in getting such a stick. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you will get it ready, Watson?" ...|$|E

[...] And then, {{after the}} wont of very stupid people, M. de Galgenstein {{went on to}} explain to the Abbe his own pun. [...] "Well, but to proceed," [...] cries he. [...] "We lived {{together}} at Birmingham, and I was going to be married to a rich heiress, egad! <b>when</b> what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> this little Cat does? She murders me, egad! and makes me manquer the marriage. Twenty thousand, I think it was; and I wanted the money in those days. Now, wasn't she an abominable monster, that mother of yours, hey, Mr. a--What's-your-name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as I was saying, I {{went through}} every bush that {{stood in the}} way and had just made a leap that beat {{anything}} ever done by a member of my family <b>when</b> what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> I came within half an inch of jumping down the throat of Senator Bear, who was lying on the dry moss in the sun, enjoying himself. Of course, he came up on his feet like a steel spring when I flew past him; but he was too clumsy to do me any mischief and then I pulled up mighty short, for I knew there'd be quite a surprise party when Mr. Towser came along.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{did your}} work," [...] sneered the doctor. [...] "Why I do {{ten times the}} work that any one of you does. It's just the work that has ruined my digestion, the never getting a quiet meal, and never a whole night's rest. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I can sit at table and digest my dinner? I have to be off looking after people like you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{you have}} said enough," [...] {{returned}} the Secretary, with a quiet smile. [...] "You may understand your own women, no doubt, but not the Malagasy girls as well as I do. When a man has said enough to a woman he should stop and let it simmer. All the rest that he would say she will say to herself--and say it much better, too! But tell me, <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Ravoninohitriniony will meet Rafaravavy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I'm not blarneying you; upon my soul I'm not; that's not the {{way with}} me at all; and when you know me better you'll say so,--and you may be sure you shall have the farm by Michaelmas." [...] And then, in a voice which {{he tried to make}} as unconcerned as possible, he continued: [...] "By the bye, Colligan, <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> this affair of Anty's will be over? It's the devil and all for a man not to know when he'll be his own master." ...|$|E
3000|$|<b>When</b> asked, “How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> ‘Australians’ are {{coping with}} the influx of immigrants?” the participants’ {{responses}} were varied. Out of the 22 participants, two did not quite answer the question, three said {{that they believe that}} Australians overall are at ease with cultural diversity and are taking the inclusion of new immigrants into society in stride. One of them observed, “It’s been a bit of a success story, really.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{certainly}} nice," [...] Muriel rejoined, smiling. [...] "However, {{you might}} tell me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> of starting. I don't {{want you to}} be away when we have arranged something to amuse you; and then, as I know the mountains, I can indicate an interesting tour. You might miss much if you didn't know where to go and what you ought to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{could not}} be {{expected}} to have thought on the subject before; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> of it, <b>you</b> must see the importance of getting in the grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in harvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have lost}} no time," [...] {{the general said}} approvingly. [...] "You will, of course, ride to Chivasso. I {{will give you an}} order to the {{governor}} there, to take charge of your horses and clothes, telling him that you are about to proceed on a mission in disguise, and requesting him to send an officer to pass you through the outposts beyond the bridge across the Po, that is if the other side is not guarded by the Spanish troops. I should advise you to make straight south so as to strike the road from Casale two miles west of Turin. I do not like letting you go, lad, and yet I feel it is of such importance that the garrison should know that aid will be at hand before long, that I feel I ought not to prevent you from carrying out your enterprise. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of starting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3. There {{are also}} the angels of God, and by reason of them the gate is strait. The Lord Jesus calleth {{the end of the}} world his harvest; and saith, moreover, that the angels are his reapers. These angels are {{therefore}} to gather his wheat into his barn, but to gather the ungodly into bundles to burn them. (Matt 13:39,41,49) Unless, therefore, the man that is unsanctified can master the law, and conquer angels; unless he can, as I may say, pull them out of the gateway of heaven, himself is not to come thither for ever. No man goeth to heaven but by the help of the angels--I mean at the day of judgment. For the Son of man [...] "shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." [...] (Matt 24:31) If those that shall enter in at the strait gate shall enter in thither by the conduct of the holy angels, pray <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> those men will enter in thither, concerning whom the angels are commanded to gather them, to [...] "bind them in bundles to burn them?" [...] This, therefore, is a third difficulty. The angels will make this entrance strait; yea, too strait for the unjustified and unsanctified to enter in thither.|$|E

"Your visit {{has done}} your father good, Terence," [...] O'Flaherty said, as, {{after seeing the}} party safely on board ship, he {{returned}} to the town whence they were to march with the convalescents, sixty in number, among whom were five officers. [...] "He has brightened up a deal the last four days, and his wound looks distinctly more healthy. I have a strong hope that all those splinters have worked out now, and your being here has given him a fillip, so that he is altogether better and more cheerful. I hope by the spring {{he will be able to}} rejoin us. I can tell you I am mighty glad to be off again myself. It has been pretty hard work here, for I have had, for the last fortnight, a hundred and twenty men on my hands. At first there were three of us here, but two went off with the last batch of convalescents, and I have been alone since. Luckily Major Peters has been well enough to look after things in general, and help the commissariat man; still, with forty bad cases, I have not had much time on my hands. Of course I knew him and all the other officers, but they all belonged to other regiments, and it was not like being among the Mayos. And <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we will be starting again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do believe, Dorothy," [...] Sydney said, one day, [...] "that you are forgetting how to laugh. You walk like a machine, {{and seem}} afraid {{to move your}} hands or your feet except {{according}} to rule. I like you very much better as you were a year ago, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> yourself too fine for a romp, and could laugh when you were pleased. That dragon of yours is spoiling you altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Have {{you read}} it yet? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I <b>think</b> you'll find that it names you Governor of the jail, which is a high office, {{carrying}} much pay and place. You are in good favour, Olaf, and I hope that {{when you come to}} greatness you will not forget Martina. It was I who put it into a certain mind to give you this commission as the only man that could be trusted in the Court." ...|$|R
