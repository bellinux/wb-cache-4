40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{conventional}} drilling process and a circular milling process are compared {{with respect to}} delamination and fiber protrusion when machining carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). The tool design (tool <b>orthogonal</b> <b>clearance,</b> drill-point angle) and the parameters (feed rate, cutting speed) are varied when drilling. The axial feed force and the spiral angles of the cutting edges can cause damages to the CFRP when circular milling. In this study, the possibilities to reduce those errors by the application of end mills with no spiral {{angle at the circumference}} cutter and no feed in axial direction are investigated. This milling process requires pre-drilled holes, and the final rivet hole dimension is then machined by circled movements without any motion in axial direction. For this special circular milling process, the tool design (rake angle of the circumference cutters) as well as the setting parameters (depth of cut, feed rate, cutting speed, up and down milling) are varied. The machining quality of both processes is compared. This is done by measuring the delaminations using an optical microscope. The fiber protrusion are visually identified {{with the help of an}} adapted imageprocessing algorithm. The diameters of the rivet holes are measured on two planes of the hole by a coordinate measuring machine. The cylindricity of the holes is determined using an instrument for roundness measurement...|$|R

This antenna is able to radiate in vertical, horizontal, and dual polarization with a wide (or broad) radiation pattern form, i. e., presenting at least 60 deg angular beamwidth in the azimuth plane.

30|$|In {{the second}} cluster of MDD {{approaches}} we include works that apply MDD to {{other aspects of}} IoT applications. Among them we can mention a MDD approach {{for the analysis of}} IoT applications via simulation [27]. Prehofer and Chiarabini [28] compared the model-based and mashup approaches, considering tools and methodologies for the development of IoT applications, using UML and Paraimpu [29]. Again, our approach is <b>working</b> on <b>orthogonal</b> aspects with respect to these issues. However, it can integrate very well with them, thanks to the availability of formal semantics of IFML and of simulation solutions based on IFML [30]. Neither detailed formal specification nor simulation/validation tooling are needed for the proposed extensions for IoT, because we rely on existing resources and infrastructure about IFML. Viceversa, in our approach we concentrate on providing efficient design methods and executability.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article deals {{specifically}} with sectoral antennas {{and focuses on}} the ability to design a bipolar dual-band structure by combining double layers metallic partially reflective surface (MPRS) <b>working</b> on <b>orthogonal</b> polarizations as a superstrate with a frequency selective surfaces (FSS) as a substrate, thus making it possible to circumvent the narrow bandwidth problem. The use of metallic structures offers a new approach to industrial partners to reduce costs and to facilitate design techniques. This antenna provides vertical and horizontal polarizations with a sectoral radiation pattern presenting a half power beamwidth of at least 60 ° in the azimuth plane. We obtain the different operating frequencies by adjusting the distance of MPRS layers from FSS layer. The proposed structure presents more than 15 dBi directivity enhancement at 4. 8 and 5. 6 GHz as compared to those of a patch antenna with 8 dB directivity. The geometry and characteristics of the antenna are detailed and a design method is propose...|$|R
40|$|Other than lowest-energy {{stationary}} embedded wave functions {{obtained in}} Frozen-Density Embedding Theory (FDET) [T. A. Wesolowski, Phys. Rev. A 77, 012504 (2008) ] can {{be associated with}} electronic excited states but they can be mutually non-orthogonal. Although this does not violate any physical principles — embedded wave functions are only auxiliary objects used to obtain stationary densities — <b>working</b> with <b>orthogonal</b> functions has many practical advantages. In the present work, we show numerically that excitation energies obtained using conventional FDET calculations (allowing for non-orthogonality) can be obtained using embedded wave functions which are strictly orthogonal. The used method preserves the mathematical structure of FDET and self-consistency between energy, embedded wave function, and the embedding potential (they are connected through the Euler-Lagrange equations). The orthogonality is built-in through the linearization in the embedded density of the relevant components of the total energy functional. Moreover, we show formally that the differences between the expectation values of the embedded Hamiltonian are equal to the excitation energies, which is the exact result within linearized FDET. Linearized FDET is shown to be a robust approximation for a large class of reference densities...|$|R
40|$|Early {{visual cortex}} has been {{thought to be}} mainly {{involved}} in the detection of low-level visual features. Here we show that complex natural sounds can be decoded from early visual cortex activity, {{in the absence of}} visual stimulation and both when sounds are actually displayed and when they are merely imagined. Blindfolded subjects listened to three complex natural sounds (bird singing, people talking, traffic noise; Exp. 1) or received word cues (“forest”, “people”, “traffic”; Exp 2) to imagine the associated scene. fMRI BOLD activation patterns from retinotopically defined early visual areas were fed into a multivariate pattern classification algorithm (a linear support vector machine). Actual sounds were discriminated above chance in V 2 and V 3 and imagined sounds were decoded in V 1. Also cross-classification, ie, training the classifier to real sounds and testing it to imagined sounds and vice versa, was successful. Two further experiments showed that an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>working</b> memory task does not interfere with sound classification in early visual cortex (Exp. 3), however, an orthogonal visuo-spatial imagery task does (Exp. 4). These results demonstrate that early visual cortex activity contains content-specific information from hearing and from imagery, challenging the view of a strict modality-specific function of early visual cortex...|$|R
30|$|Another {{domain of}} {{denoising}} techniques {{studies on the}} principle of shrinkage [13]. The shrinkage method uses nonlinear thresholding approach to shrink the orthogonal wavelet coefficients as a denoising tool. This method relies on the idea that the energy of the function is often concentrated in a few wavelet coefficients while the energy of the noise is spread over all coefficients, therefore by selecting a suitable threshold value it is possible to reduce a significant amount of noise elements by using nonlinear thresholding in the wavelet domain [13]. However, the denoised signal in this case may contain spurious oscillations due to the translation variant property of the discrete wavelet transform. Afterwards, several approaches were proposed to overcome these problems of shrinkage but so far none of them guarantees the preservation of edges or sharp variations possibly due to their <b>working</b> in an <b>orthogonal</b> basis [13 – 17]. Fodor and Kamath presented a brief survey of some of these approaches [17]. More recently, Blu and Luisier presented {{the state of the art}} SURE-LET method for image denoising [18]. The performance of the SURE-LET method is quite outstanding in the presence of Gaussian noise. In the present study, we are addressing only 1 D signal therefore it is not possible to compare with the SURE-LET method. However in the future study, the extension of the proposed method for 2 D cases will give logical comparison of the two methods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Proportional poppet-type {{cartridge}} valves are the {{key elements}} of the energy-saving programmable valves, which {{have been shown to}} be able to achieve good motion control performance while significantly saving energy usage in our previous studies. Unlike costly conventional four-way valves, the cartridge valve has a simple structure and is easy to manufacture, but the complicated mathematical model of its flow mapping makes the controller design and implementation rather difficult. Although off-line individually calibrated or manufacturer supplied flow mappings of the cartridge valves can be used, neither method is ideal for wide industrial applications. The former method is time-consuming and needs additional flow sensors while the latter may lead to significantly degraded control performance due to the inaccuracy of the manufacturer supplied flow mappings. Furthermore, due to inevitable system worn out and/or changing working conditions, actual cartridge valve flow mapping may change significantly over the life span of the system and need to be updated periodically in order to maintain the same level of control performance. Sometime, it may be even impractical to do off-line calibrations once the valve leaves the manufacturing plant. To solve this practically significant problem, this paper focuses on the automated onboard modeling of the cartridge valve flow mappings without using any extra sensors and removing the valves from the system. The estimation of flow mappings is based on the pressure dynamics of the hydraulic cylinder with the consideration of effects of some unknown system parameters such as the effective bulk modulus of the <b>working</b> fluid. Localized <b>orthogonal</b> basis functions are proposed to bypass the lack of persistent exciting identification data over the entire domain of the flow mapping during onboard experiments. Experimental results are obtained to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed novel automated modeling method.
