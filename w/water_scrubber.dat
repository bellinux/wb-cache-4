5000|$|A wood {{gasifier}} takes wood chips, sawdust, charcoal, coal, rubber {{or similar}} materials as fuel and burns these incompletely {{in a fire}} box, producing wood gas, solid ash and soot, the latter of which have to be removed periodically from the gasifier. The wood gas can then be filtered for tars and soot/ash particles, cooled and directed to an engine or fuel cell. Most of these engines have strict purity requirements of the wood gas, so the gas often has to pass through extensive gas cleaning in order to remove or convert, i.e., [...] "crack", tars and particles.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis of a two-stage pilot plant for the removal of toluene and benzene from the exhaust air of an industrial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The two-stage air process combines a <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> and a biotrickling filter (BTF) in sequence, and treats air stripped from the liquid phase compartments of the WWTP. During the experimental period, the pilot plant treated an airflow of 600 Nm 3 h- 1. Average concentrations of the waste air stream entering the <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> were 10. 61 mg Nm- 3 benzene and 9. 26 mg Nm- 3 toluene. The <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> obtained medium-high removal efficiencies (averages 51 % and 60 %, for benzene and toluene, respectively). Subsequent passage through the BTF allowed a further reduction of average concentrations, which decreased to 2. 10 mg Nm- 3 benzene and to 0. 84 mg Nm- 3 toluene, thereby allowing overall average removal efficiencies (REs) of 80 % and 91 % for benzene and toluene, respectively. Results prove the benefits obtained from a combination of different removal technologies: water scrubbers to remove peak concentrations and soluble compounds, and BTFs to remove compounds with lower solubility, due to the biodegradation performed by microorganisms. © 2015, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi) ...|$|E

The pilot plant consisted of a <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> followed by a biotrickling filter (BTF). The exhausted air was drawn from the main works of the WWTP in order to prevent the free migration to the atmosphere of these volatile hazardous contaminants. Concentrations were detected at average values of 12. 4 mg Nm- 3 for benzene, 11. 1 mg Nm- 3 for toluene, 2. 7 mg Nm- 3 for ethylbenzene and 9. 5 mg Nm- 3 for xylene, with considerable fluctuation mainly for benzene and toluene (peak concentrations of 56. 8 and 55. 0 mg Nm- 3, respectively).

40|$|Poultry {{housings}} with litter are a {{major contributor}} to fine dust emissions (PM 10 /PM 2. 5) in the Netherlands. Poultry producers are in need of dust mitigation options that are cost effective. Such an option could be provided by adequately designed water scrubbers. Catchment of dust particles by water droplets and deposition of dust particles on the surface of wetted packing material will lead to removal of dust from ventilation air. The aim of this research was to test water scrubbers under real poultry farm conditions. Prototypes of two <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> concepts were tested: prototype A was based on treating outlet air in a cross flow scrubbing setup. Synthetic packing material is continuously drained with a specified large volume of water, that is recirculated from a storage basin below. Prototype B was based on spraying of water by high pressure nozzles in an open treatment chamber, through which the ventilated air was led. A drip catcher was constructed at the outlet of this chamber to prevent loss of water. For prototype A an indicative measurement scheme was carried out on a poultry farm with non-productive raising pullets on cages. Four measurements based on 24 h sampling periods were carried out during which dust removal was measured by a gravimetrical method. Mean removal percentages for PM 2. 5 and PM 10 amounted 9 and 62 % respectively. The observed removal percentage for PM 10 was in accordance with an earlier theoretical assessment study. It is concluded that this prototype {{can be used as a}} basis to develop of this <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> for use in poultry production. Prototype B was tested on a broiler farm. First measurements based on gravimetrical methods showed negative removal results. To avoid biasing effects of high humidity on the results, subsequent gravimetrical measurements in the outlet air of the scrubber were carried out after heating and drying the outlet air to lower humidity levels. Accompanying particle counter measurement in particle size classes from 1 to 25 micrometer were carried out in both untreated and treated air. PM 10 removal performance was negative, and particle numbers especially increased in the smaller size classes. Inspection of outlet dust samples by electron microscopy indicated that formation of salt aerosols might provide an explanation for this increase.

The upgrading of 300 Nm 3 /h of biogas generated from the anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge in a wastewater treatment plant {{was used as a}} model scenario for the comparative analysis. Despite the algal-bacterial photobioreactor entailed 1860 times higher land requirements, the two-stage physical/chemical technology exhibited × 3. 8 higher energy consumptions and larger environmental impacts in terms of material and water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (the latter by a factor of ~ 45). The investment cost for the algal-bacterial photobioreactor was 1. 6 times higher than that of its physical/chemical counterpart due to the biomass drying unit required to produce an algae-based fertilizer. However, the operating cost of the physical/chemical technology was ~ 7 times higher due to the frequent replacement of the activated carbon. A further analysis of the net present value (NPV 20) revealed that photosynthetic upgrading would yield revenues from year 5 of operation mainly due to the sale of the algal bio-fertilizer produced, even without tax incentives for bio-methane.

40|$|The biogas {{production}} in Sweden year 2014 was 1, 8 TWh where almost 1 TWh was upgraded to biomethane {{for use in}} vehicles. The production of biomethane is mainly located at the biogas plants that have a production over 200 - 400 Nm 3 /h. This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that the investment and operating costs becomes too high for the small producers with low biogas flows. The government of Sweden has a highly ambitious goal of having a vehicle fleet that runs on at least 80 % renewable fuels in the year 2030. To reach that goal even the small biogas producers needs to start upgrading their gas to be able to replace fossil fuels with renewable biomethane. The aim of this master thesis has been to supply enough information to Norrmejerier about whether or not to upgrade the biogas by summarizing relevant research papers and calculate energy flows and costs for each upgrading technology. The limitation of the thesis has been that the production of biogas with different incoming substrates have been neglected due to it being constant in each scenario that has been compared. After a thorough literature study about relevant upgrading technologies the <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> and membrane technology was chosen as the best fit for Norrmejerier’s biogas plant. This was mostly due to that the <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> is in no need for chemicals duting operation and that some waste water could be used from the dairy plant at Norrmejerier. In the case for the membrane technology it had a low investment cost coupled with a stable operation without the need for surveillance. A relatively new ash upgrading technique was also considered briefly where the need for ash was estimated to 10   000 – 17 000 metric tonnes a year with the assumed biogas production of Norrmejerier. The supply of ash in Umeå municipality were about 5000 metric tonnes which is far below the demand for the biogas upgrading plant. The production of biogas at Norrmejerier is enough to sustain all their own truck transports with biomethane plus that they can sell the excess to the public. The cost-estimates were calculated for the scenario if Norrmejerier builds their own refilling station and in the scenario if they would sell it to a fuel supplier instead. The cost of upgrading for both upgrading technologies ranged from 0, 53 to 0, 54 SEK/kWh independent of the two previously mentioned scenarios. Both technologies had a payback period of two years and a few months. The membrane technology however gave a higher economical value with a greater yearly capital income mainly because of its longer economical lifetime. The limited lifecyle assessment compared the different uses of the produced biogas to calculate the emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents for each scenario. The assessment revealed that the emissions can be reduced by about 1700 metric tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents per year if the biogas is upgraded to biomethane and Norrmejerier supplies its own trucks with this renewable fuel. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{provide the}} first process {{simulation}} able to depict a complete {{life cycle inventory}} of a biomass gasification {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant. The model predicts the detailed mass and energy balances, minor compounds emissions (such as NOx, SOx, aromatics,etc.). It is based on a phenomenological approach for dryer, reactors (gasification and combustion) and scrubber modeling. Process units are modeled with Aspen Plus models completed with dedicated Fortran sub-models when more details are required. The gasifier is a Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB). It is decomposed in three sections, describing the three main mechanisms occurring in the reactor: wood pyrolysis, secondary reactions and char combustion. At the outlet of the gasifier, the complete composition of the syngas is predicted, which includes water, permanent gases, inorganics, particles and tars (phenol, benzene, toluene, styrene, indene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene). Simulation results were validated against measurements from a pilot plant and other literature data.

The chemical and structural characteristics of carbon nanoparticles {{have been the subject}} of numerous works because these properties might be of relevance for particle reactivity and optical properties. Few information are available on their hydrophilic properties although these are of relevance for the human health, the climate change, in addition to the technological implementation of condensation nuclei particle counters in aerosol science, <b>water</b> <b>scrubbers</b> and electrostatic precipitators. The aim of this work is to investigate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic behavior of carbon nanoparticles formed in different flame conditions. Static contact angle measurements in addition to chemical and physical characterization of the carbon nanoparticles have been implemented. Results show that nanoparticles formed in richer flame conditions, are the most hydrophobic, whereas nanoparticles of organic carbon, formed in relatively leaner flame condition, appeared to be the most hydrophilic. The reason for a different water affinity of particles, and especially of the smaller organic carbon nanoparticles, has been discussed by analyzing the different material in terms of their chemical/structural composition and in terms of surface functionalities. While no significant differences have been found by Raman spectroscopy in terms of their carbon structure, the different hydrophilicity is explained in terms of the different amount of surface oxygen detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Combustion conditions are therefore very important in outlining the hydrophilic/hydrophobic tendency of the carbon particles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of both thermal and electrical power in pyro-gasification micro co-generative plants sized for small enterprises (sawmills, farms, cattle farms, etc.) is nowadays a growing trend. The electrical power {{is generated by}} an engine powered by the syngas produced through a pyro-gasification process; the nominal electric power of the considered plants is in between 30 and 90 kW. There are different types of plants currently available on the marketeither able to process only pure wood pellets either high quality virgin wood chips or raw and mixed bio-based materials, such as crops, secondary quality chips and other agricultural residues. In present framework our measurements {{are related to the}} third type, fed by secondary quality biomasses. The impact on the environment is due to the combustion of the syngas through the torch, switched on when the engine is off, due to the engineemissions, due to the tar and aromatic compounds intercepted by the filtering systems (according to the types either dry filters or <b>water</b> <b>scrubbers)</b> and finally due to the large amount of biochar resulting from the pyro-gasification process. In the present study the aero-dispersed pollutants measured are both dusts (in diametric classes from 1 to 10 μm) and the concentration of few chemical compounds (such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides). The concentration of atmospheric pollutants from the engine is related to the engine set-up and to the engine behavior and it is not only strictly related to the biomass quality.

Ammonia gas has a distinct, unpleasant odor and can become detrimental to the health of humans and animals at high concentrations. Ammonia emissions are of particular concern in manure drying systems, where large losses of nitrogen, in the form of ammonia can cause air quality concerns. The aim of this study was to develop an ammonia removal system for a poultry manure drying system. The thin layer drying of poultry manure in 1 - 3 cm thick layers resulted in effective sterilization; with the removal of 99. 44 - 99. 56 % of total bacterial count, 88. 51 - 93. 705 of yeast and mold cells, 99. 13 - 99. 565 of E. coli cells, and complete removal of Salmonellae.

In addition, particles and contaminants must be sepa-rated from the upgraded biogas. There are various methods for upgrading and this report compares six different methods with respect to environment and economy: <b>water</b> <b>scrubber,</b> Biosling, cryo technology, chemical absorption, Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and membrane separation. According to the used ORWARE model, chemical adsorption with amine has the least environmen-tal impact (methane emissions) and the lowest costs. The chemical used in the method is very good at reducing CO 2 and chemical adsorption gives an upgraded gas containing around 99 % methane. The downside of amine is that it contributes to the acidification of the environment and additional heat is needed to free the CO 2. It is also a small scale method. PSA and membrane separation shall be avoided when it comes to environmental impacts. When it comes to the economy, it is more dif-ficult to compare the methods.

The air stream was characterized by a very high variability of the inlet concentrations of toluene (range: 4. 35 - 68. 20 mg Nm- 3) with an average concentrations of 16. 41 mg Nm- 3. The pilot plant has proved its effectiveness in toluene removal, along a 90 days experimentation period, in steady-state conditions. The scrubbing pre-treatment has achieved an average removal efficiency of 69. 9 %, but in particular it has proven its suitability in the rough removal of the toluene peak concentrations, allowing a great stability to the following biological process.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the focus is}} on the {{particulate}} matter reduction of ships, as ships contribute significantly to the particulate matter concentration in ambient air. Because the fuel of sea ships contains a lot of ash, the emitted particulate matter will also contain a lot of ash. In car and truck applications the soot filters are cleaned by burning the particulate matter off of the filter. However, ash will not be burned off and accumulates in the filter. In the case of high-ash loads, like sea ships, a soot filter is not applicable, because the filters cannot be cleaned properly. The goal of the research was to develop a technology to reduce particulate matter that is fuel insensitive. In this thesis such a technology is described, tested and simulated for high-ash applications. The patented technology is based on coating particulate matter with water, and subsequently capturing by an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). In the present experimental set-up this was a two-stage ESP, which has a robust construction and a reduced risk of physical contact between the electrodes at different potential. The water-coated particles will flow off the collection plates, therefore allowing continuous operation of the ESP. The water stream needs to be cleaned before it is discharged in the surface waters. The required cleaning technology, however, is similar to the cleaning technologies used in sea <b>water</b> <b>scrubbers.</b> It is proven that the technology is capable of removing 80 % of particulate matter, including the fraction of particulate matter smaller than 1 micrometer in (mobility) diameter.

On the other hand, <b>water</b> powered <b>scrubbers</b> operating at higher water pressures of ? 1, 724 kPa (? 250 psig) in physical enclosures or ducts have previously been demonstrated to be very effective in removing airborne dust from the air. These higher operating water pressures are uncommon in many mines and mills, so their use is limited. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently investigated the performance of a lower-pressure, water powered inline series spray scrubber for removing localized airborne dust emitted at the source. Results showed noticeable improvements in airborne dust capture efficiency through the operation o f multiple inline series hollow cone spray nozzles within a round duct or pipe at the same water pressure as a single spray. Operating hollow cone spray(s) at higher water pressures noticeably improved airflow through the scrubber and yielded some additional scrubber efficiency improvements. Thus, in-line spray scrubber efficiency trade-offs were observed to be made by altering spray power components of water pressure and/or quantity (number of sprays).

Chemical scrubber, <b>water</b> <b>scrubber,</b> organic physical scrubber, membrane, pressure swing adsorption and cryogenic upgrading are different types of commercially used biogas upgrading technologies. The total life cycle cost for an upgrading plant is affected by different factors. This includes the investment cost and the operation and maintenance cost. There are three major consumables included in the operating cost; power, water and chemicals. In this thesis, ten different small-scale upgrading plants based on five different upgrading technologies are investigated. A life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is conducted for all the different upgrading technologies in order to find the most cost-effective system. Two different scenarios are analyzed; one where excess heat from the upgrading units is utilized, and one without heat recovery of the excess heat. By including heat recovery in the LCCA, it is possible to compare different upgrading technologies with respect to the whole biogas production plant. The data used in the analysis are collected from various manufacturers for biogas upgrading plants. All the costs associated with the investment, operation and maintenance are identified and used in the LCCA. The collected data was given either as a fixed average number, or as a range with a minimum and maximum value. To account for the uncertainties in the data, an uncertainty analysis was conducted using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. For this aim, statistical approaches were used by developing different codes in Matlab to perform the uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is done in order to test the outcome of the LCCA by changing the electricity cost and discount rate in the initial analysis. Results from this thesis is applicable for companies considering investing in a biogas upgrading plant. Information regarding the cost and consumables for different technologies are presented. Electricity price and access to water and chemicals, may affect the decision-making for selection of biogas upgrading technology. The LCCA shows that pressure swing absorption and <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> are the most cost-effective upgrading technologies for both with and without heat recovery. The least cost-effective technologies was found to be the cryogenic upgrading and amine scrubber...|$|E
40|$|The off gas {{treatment}} {{in the process of}} vitrification and incineration of nuclear waste has been studied for the purpose of the effectiveness treatment system evaluation and using its equipment. The off gas from vitrification process leaves the melter at temperature of 600 0 C composed of NOx, Ru and particle. The treatment consist of cooling, scrubbing and filtering of the off gas. The cooling is performed by air film cooler, the scrubbing is performed by a series of submerged bed scrubber, venturi scrubber and <b>water</b> <b>scrubber.</b> Then the un-scrubbed particles are captured by HEME and HEPA filters. Before entering the Ru srubber, the off gas is warmed up to a temperature of 65 0 C, scrubbing the Ru by silica gel and filtering the particles by HEPA filter. The off gas from the vitrification process has a fixed composition corresponding to the composition of the vitrified waste which has relatively fix composition. The off gas from incineration process leaves the incinerator at temperature of 1100 0 C composed of CO 2, NOx, CO, HCl, HF and SO 2 with the composition depend on the incinerated waste type. The treatment consist of cooling and filtering. The cooling is performed with the air injection by double fan. The treated off gas, either from the vitrification or incineration to be released into the environment via a stack. The off {{gas treatment}} system for vitrification process can be used for treatment of off gas from incineration process by passing the Ru scrubber, vice versa by connecting Ru scrubber after HEPA filter...|$|E
40|$|Oxidation {{mechanisms}} in air nonthermal plasma (NTP) {{at room temperature}} and atmospheric pressure were investigated in a corona reactor energized by +dc, -dc, or +pulsed high voltage. The two bromomethanes CF 2 Br 2 and CH 2 Br 2 were chosen as model organic pollutants because of their very different reactivities with OH radicals. Thus, they served as useful mechanistic probes: they respond differently {{to the presence of}} humidity in the air and give different products. By FT-IR analysis of the postdischarge gas the following products were detected and quantified: CO 2 and CO in the case of CH 2 Br 2, CO 2 and F 2 C=O in the case of CF 2 Br 2 center dot F 2 C=O is a long-lived oxidation intermediate due to its low reactivity with atmospheric radicals. It is however removed from the NTP processed gas by passage through a <b>water</b> <b>scrubber</b> resulting in hydrolysis to CO 2 and HF. Other noncarbon containing products of the discharge were also monitored by FT-IR analysis, including HNO 3 and N 2 O. Ozone, an important product of air NTP, was never detected in experiments with CF 2 Br 2 and CH 2 Br 2 because of the highly efficient ozone depleting cycles catalyzed by BrOx species formed from the bromomethanes. It is concluded that, regardless of the type of corona applied, CF 2 Br 2 reacts in air NTP via a common intermediate, the CF 2 Br radical. The possible reactions leading to this radical are discussed, including, for -dc activation, charge exchange with O- 2 (-), a species detected by APCI mass spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|Food {{industries}} like biscuit and confectionary use {{significant amount}} of fossil fuel for thermal energy. Biscuit manufacturing in India is carried out both by organized and unorganized sector. The ratio of organized to unorganized sector is 60 : 40 (1). The total biscuit manufacturing in the organized sector India in 2008 was about 1. 7 million metric tons (1). Accounting for the unorganized sector in India, the total biscuit manufacturing would have been about 2. 9 million metric tons/annum. A typical biscuit baking is carried in a long tunnel kiln with varying temperature in different zones. Generally diesel is used to provide the necessary heat energy for the baking purpose, with temperature ranging from 190 C in the drying zone to about 300 C in the baking area and has to maintain in the temperature range of +/- 5 C. Typical oil consumption is about 40 litres per ton of biscuit production. The paper discusses the experience in substituting about 120 lts per hour kiln for manufacturing about 70 tons of biscuit daily. The system configuration consists of a 500 kg/hr gasification system comprising of a reactor, multicyclone, <b>water</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> and two blowers for maintaining the constant gas pressure in the header before the burners. Cold producer gas is piped to the oven located about 200 meters away from the gasifier. Fuel used in the gasification system is coconut shells. All the control system existing on the diesel burner has been suitably adapted for producer gas operation to maintain the total flow, A/F control so as to maintain the temperature. A total of 7 burners are used in different zones. Over 17000 hour of operation has resulted in replacing over 1800 tons of diesel over the last 30 months. The system operates for over 6 days a week with average operational hours of 160. It {{has been found that}} on an average 3. 5 kg of biomass has replaced one liter of diesel...|$|R
40|$|Intensification of {{livestock}} production {{in combination with}} a decline in arable land {{has resulted in a}} discrepancy between excess load of nutrients from livestock production and the possibility to apply these nutrients in an environmental way on agricultural land. Consequently, the mineral input and output in livestock intensive regions is not balanced. The crop production systems rely on synthetic fertilizers for fertilization, whereas livestock production systems face problems in manure disposal. This dissertation aimed towards efficient use of resources by re-connecting crop and livestock production through animal manure processing. The processing results in animal manure derivatives such as liquid fraction (LF) of digestate, mineral concentrate and air <b>scrubber</b> <b>water,</b> that might have potential to be used as alternatives for synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers. The dissertation investigated N fertilizer performance of these materials with regard to crop yield and soil properties on laboratory, greenhouse and field scale. Results showed that LF of digestate, air <b>scrubber</b> <b>water</b> and mineral concentrate can be used as synthetic N fertilizer substitutes without adverse effects on crop yield. With regard to environmental aspects, it seems that these materials should not additionally increase the risk of nitrate leaching as compared to conventional fertilization practices. Some of their characteristics (e. g. form, nutrient concentration, stability) differ from the characteristics of synthetic N fertilizers, however their N performance indicates the potential of labelling LF of digestate, ASW and mineral concentrate as processed mineral fertilizers on European fertilizer market...|$|R
40|$|The Thermochemical Process Development Unit at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{converts}} biomass {{into energy}} by gasification or pyrolysis. The aqueous effluent generated in these processes must {{be disposed of}} as hazardous waste according to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act because certain components exceed the regulatory concentration limit. Gas stripping of the <b>scrubber</b> <b>water</b> was investigated {{as a method of}} reducing benzene and cresol levels. A custom-designed packed-bed column was built and a half-factorial experimental design was implemented {{to determine the effects of}} gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, and column packing height on the final benzene concentration in the liquid. The experimental results show that packing height had a significant effect on final benzene concentration; gas flow rate and liquid flow rate had little effect. The effects of each design variable on final cresol concentration were not determined. Although the current column design did significantly reduce the benzene and cresol levels in the <b>scrubber</b> <b>water,</b> it did not reduce the concentrations below the regulatory limits. A full-factorial experimental design will be implemented with an increased packing height. Other variables, including column diameter and packing type, will be investigated to determine their effects on final benzene and cresol concentrations. Once the packed-bed column is determined to be effective in reducing contaminant concentrations below the regulatory limit, photocatalytic oxidation will be explored for remediating the benzene and cresol from the gas stream...|$|R
