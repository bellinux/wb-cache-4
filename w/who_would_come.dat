5|$|Unlike the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, the game's sequel features a storyline {{although it is}} still not the series canon. However, certain characters' endings are canon, which are followed in the sequel game Tekken 7. In the story, Heihachi Mishima has developed a rejuvenation serum, which has the ability to regress his appearance and power. After consuming it, Heihachi hosts another King of Iron Fist Tournament, sensing powerful challengers <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's mother {{apprentice}}d her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew {{also became}} an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson {{lived with his}} mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.|$|E
5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series. She would question the setting from the audience's point of view and have it explained to them. She was written as the heroine, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, Shogo Makishima, and see their conflict from her own viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E

5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> out on top, the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to fly back to the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of Nestorian Christianity was somewhat {{different from that}} practiced in the West, and Europeans tended to regard Nestorianism as heretical for its beliefs {{about the nature of}} Jesus. However, the Europeans also had legends about a figure known as Prester John, a great Christian leader in the East <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to help with the Crusades.

The first was Thomas Weeding, a fellow doctor, and surgeon of the Glatton, one of the other ships in the convoy. The second was 26-year-old Charles Magniac who had arrived in Guangzhou at the beginning of 1801 to supervise his father's watch business in Canton in partnership with Daniel Beale.|$|E
25|$|Biblical {{inspiration}} is {{the doctrine}} in Christian theology {{concerned with the}} divine origin of the Bible and what the Bible teaches about itself. Different groups understand the meaning and details of inspiration in different ways. Most such as Evangelicals and Catholics, see the Bible as a truly human product whose creation was superintended by the Holy Spirit, preserving the authors' works from error without eliminating their specific concerns, situation, or style. This divine involvement, they say, allowed the biblical writer to reveal God's own message to the immediate recipients of the writings and to those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> later, communicating God's message without corrupting it.|$|E

At the university in 1919, other notables were Walther Nernst, Fritz Haber, and James Franck. Laue, {{as one of the}} organizers of the weekly Berlin Physics Colloquium, typically sat in the front row with Nernst and Einstein, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> over from the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik in Berlin-Dahlem, where he was the director. Among Laue’s notable students at the university were Leó Szilárd, Fritz London, Max Kohler, and Erna Weber. In 1921, he published the second volume of his book on relativity.|$|E
25|$|Wolverines coach Bump Elliott {{resigned}} {{after the}} 1968 loss and Michigan hired Miami (Ohio) head coach Bo Schembechler, {{who had previously}} been an assistant at Ohio State under Hayes, to revitalize its football program. On November 22, 1969, Hayes led his top-ranked Buckeyes into Michigan Stadium to face Schembechler's Wolverines in the first matchup between two coaches <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to define the rivalry between the two programs. The Buckeyes brought a 22-game winning streak into Ann Arbor, but behind an inspiring 60-yard punt return by Barry Pierson that set up a Wolverine touchdown in the second quarter, and a defense that intercepted Ohio State six times (three by Pierson), the Wolverines won a defensive battle (both teams were scoreless in the second half) for a 24–12 upset.|$|E

To his surprise, the movement leaders demanded acceptance of the entire petition. Sturdza withdrew to the army barracks and that evening took steps to crush the opposition. Several people were killed in brief fighting, and some 300 were arrested. Among those who fled, either to Transylvania or Bukovina, were Alecsandri and the young officer Alexandru Ioan Cuza, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to rule the United Principalities in the 1860s. Sturdza, now bent on permanently halting all dissent, made anyone even suspected of opposition subject to arrest, imposed strict censorship, and had students returning from France stopped at the border and interrogated before being allowed to proceed.|$|E

In the mid-1850s, the men <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to make up the X Club formed two distinct sets of friends. John Tyndall, Edward Frankland and Thomas Hirst, men who became friends in the late 1840s, were artisans who became physical scientists. Thomas Huxley, Joseph Dalton Hooker, and George Busk, friends since the early 1850s, had worked as surgeons and had become professional naturalists. Beginning in the mid-1850s, the network began to form around Huxley and Hooker, and these six men began helping one another, both as friends and professionals. In 1863, for example, Tyndall aided Frankland in getting a position at the Royal Institution. Spottiswoode, Herbert Spencer, and John Lubbock joined the circle of friends during the debates over evolution and naturalism in the early 1860s.|$|E
