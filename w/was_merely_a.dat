5|$|According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he {{intended}} to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> joke.|$|E

5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot {{injury in the}} Broncos Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the scene of a fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. The Broncos denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> bystander.|$|E

It was reportedly the size of a horse, with a spotted body covered in scales. Opinion on the creature's origin was divided, with some islanders believing it to be a sea serpent, while others opined that it <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> large seal.|$|E

Ocarina of Time 3D was developed by Nintendo EAD in partnership with Grezzo, an independent Japanese studio headed by Koichi Ishii. The game was released in Japan on June 16, 2011; Europe on June 17, 2011; the United States on June 19, 2011; and Australia on June 30, 2011 (June 24, 2011, at some stores).|$|E

Ben reveals to Sawyer that they are on a {{completely}} different island approximately twice the size of Alcatraz that overlooks the main island; escape is impossible. Upon asking why he was conned, Ben tells Sawyer that in order to gain a con artist's respect, they must be conned themselves.|$|E
5|$|A box set {{entitled}} The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Complete Radio Series {{was released}} on 3 October 2005. It contains fifteen CDs, subdivided per radio series, and bonus material exclusive to the box set. BBC Audio released a DVD version of the Tertiary Phase, featuring that series in 5.1 surround sound, in October 2006. Contrary to previous announcements, this <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> DVD-Video disc with Dolby Digital sound and other features, rather than a DVD-Audio disc. While it had been stated that BBC Audio plans on also releasing {{the fourth and fifth}} radio series on DVD, no dates have been set.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN aerial {{reconnaissance}} observed on November 27 that the Chinese {{forces on the}} UN right flank were moving rapidly into the Eighth Army's rear, Walker still ordered {{the rest of the}} Eighth Army to continue the offensive north. Convinced that the collapse of the ROK II Corps <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> small counterattack by the Chinese, Walker ordered the US I and IX Corps to shift eastward in order to cover the ROK II Corps' sector. By that time, however, the US I and IX Corps had already suffered heavy losses from the Chinese counteroffensive at Kujang-dong, Ipsok and Yongsan-dong.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|In his new positions, Khrushchev {{continued}} his kolkhoz consolidation scheme, which decreased {{the number of}} collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in Pravda in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.|$|E
5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> bump in the road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E

Downtrodden, Perry reminisces about {{previous}} battles with Doofenshmirtz when he was his nemesis, while Doofenshmirtz himself grows tired of Peter due to him being much less sympathetic then Perry. Perry and Doofenshmirtz decide to appear on the talk show Dr. Feelbetter, where they decide to once more become nemeses; however, Doofenshmirtz reveals that the whole situation <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> scheme to capture the world's top agents (who are in the audience) and freeze them with a large ray. This results in a largescale battle where the agents come out victorious.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2008, Ice {{was arrested}} in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for {{allegedly}} kicking and hitting his wife. He was released the following day after she declared {{that her husband had}} only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> verbal argument. Ice was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.|$|E

Visibly angered, V'Las lunges for the Kir'Shara, but is stunned by High-Minister Kuvak, who orders the fleet to stand down. Enterprise returns to Vulcan, and Koss visits to release T'Pol from their marriage. Meanwhile, the Vulcan High Command is dissolved, granting Earth greater autonomy, and the katra of Surak is transferred to a Vulcan high priest. V'Las, relieved of his post, meets secretly with Talok, revealed as a Romulan agent, who states that the reunification of their worlds {{is only a matter}} of time.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Romani has, however, been {{surrounded}} with controversy and criticism. It {{has been suggested}} that, like {{the attack on the}} Suez Canal in 1915, it <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> raid to disrupt maritime traffic rather than a determined attempt to gain control of the canal. That the Ottoman Empire's intention was to strongly occupy Romani and Kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of Palestine adjacent to, and extending into, the Sinai. These included extending the Palestine railway system to Wadi El Arish, with a good motor road beside the railway. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.|$|E
