6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{to live in}} such {{a strange}} place, dear father?" [...] asked the girl, laying her hand lovingly on the hermit's arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} sent the courier--and you were under an {{engagement}} {{to stay here}} as my guest. Answer me honestly once more. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What had young Jolly Forsyte {{to do with}} it? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> together?" [...] pursued Soames, uncannily relentless. [...] "I {{thought you}} weren't {{friendly}} with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't adore me at all, you know, if {{you leave}} me now. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go?</b> It's so charming here and we're so delightfully alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Newman, laughing, [...] "if you are {{determined}} it shall be bad, of course it will. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on painting badly?" ...|$|R
60|$|FRANKLYN. My dear Burge, I {{am not a}} child. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on {{wasting your}} party funds on the Strand? You know you cannot win it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop that talk, Brown!" [...] {{commanded}} Colonel Colby. [...] "I {{want you}} and Martell to answer my question. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{over there and}} shoot those cows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel {{says with}} relief. 'It is {{pleasant}} {{to see that}} you have come back, Dering. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away for such a long time?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This is {{the most}} hideous thing on earth,' said Elizabeth casually, 'but it will do to sit on. Now tell me: <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to Lady Wetherby's this afternoon?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{after that}} woman down to Hamworth? All {{the world is}} talking of you. At your age too! You {{ought to be ashamed}} of yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thats it, is it? <b>Why</b> <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out; take a cab; {{and go to}} Laurel Grove for her? There {{is nothing}} to prevent you taking her away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most likely theyll remain so. You {{all seem}} {{to stick to the}} little {{pictures}} tremendously. <b>Why</b> <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> in for high art? There's a big picture of Adam and Eve! <b>Why</b> <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> paint that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let him pass now," [...] said Low; [...] "that {{will come}} later on," [...] he added, unconsciously repeating her thought {{in a tone}} that made her heart sick. [...] "But tell me, Teresa, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to Excelsior?" ...|$|E
60|$|Em.: I wouldnâ€™t trust a {{child with}} any one who had a temper like hers. Oh, Dickie, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and have such a large family? You always said {{you wanted me to}} be the mother of your children.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have stayed. Now I think about it, Stannard rather persuaded me to go," [...] Jimmy agreed and looked at Deering hard. [...] "When you {{recently}} found out Stannard had gone to my help, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> after him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, but, my dear," [...] says I, [...] "you make me more uneasy {{now than}} before; for if you {{apprehend}} no danger, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> use this caution? {{and if you}} apprehend there is danger, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] {{he asked}} hoarsely, [...] "{{if you knew}} all these things, if you knew that Isaac Lalonde had {{committed}} this murder, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> about with your lips closed? Why haven't you told the truth? An innocent man might be arrested at any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me, Marian. You {{are in the}} blues. <b>Why</b> <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to Ned, {{and tell}} him that he is a {{cast-iron}} walking machine, and that you are unhappy, and want the society of a flesh-and-blood man? Have a furious scene with him, and all will come right." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} five days' journey {{they reached}} the old home where their father and mother dwelt alone. And {{the heart of their}} father rejoiced, and he said to them, 'Dear sons, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away and leave your mother and me to weep for you night and day?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why--you are sick, Roger--you are tired! Where {{have you}} been these many days? Why not keep me company a bit--my husband is much away? And we have hardly spoke at all of dear father and of your voyage to the New Land. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away so suddenly? There is a spare chamber at my lodging.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] says I. [...] "Now, Rebosa, I'm {{old enough}} to have owed money to your father. And that old, specious, dressed-up, garbled, sea-sick ptomaine prancing about avidiously like an {{irremediable}} turkey gobbler with patent leather shoes on is my best friend. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and get him invested in this marriage business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are sure}} to laugh at me, Joshua, because I think what terrible things might have {{happened}} to <b>you.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> putting yourself so forward in every danger, {{now that you have}} got somebody else to depend upon you and to care for you? It's very, very wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} hear of a man," [...] Jacob went on, [...] "who made his fortune with a smile? Of course not. You are {{probably}} the first. Look at me steadfastly. This {{is to be a}} heart-to-heart talk. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> about looking as though you were the most miserable creature on God's earth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do permit," [...] she murmured, [...] "only {{you must}} not say it very often--until I get used to it. Oh, my friend, how glad I am to see you, and yet how {{dangerous}} it is. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on filling all the newspapers in Europe with your letters from Theos, and your praises of the King? You have made enemies here. You are even now being sought for." ...|$|R
6000|$|Answers only {{rendered}} it worse, so my Lady had it her own way, and {{not being}} known {{to the public in}} St. Oswald's Buildings, did not trouble them much. Yet there was a certain deference to public opinion there, when Alda was heard pouting, 'Felix, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to that horrid Harper? Just fancy Miss Price seeing us!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pretty good!' said Bella. 'Not goodest good, {{because you}} {{hesitate}} about it. However, {{as you know}} your Catechism fairly, so far, I'll let you off the rest. Now, I am going to examine you {{out of my own}} head. John dear, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back, this evening, to the question you once asked me before--would I like to be rich?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} C. and I took the cars {{to go into}} the country, to Playford Hall. [...] "And what's Playford Hall?" [...] you say. [...] "And <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to see it?" [...] As to what it is, here is a {{reasonably}} good picture before you. As to why, it was for many years the residence of Thomas Clarkson, and is now the residence of his venerable widow and her family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{in those}} words, perhaps; but you looked it and thought it, though you phrased it more mildly. I {{deserved}} it, but I shall deserve it no longer. I am beginning to wake from my disgraceful idleness, and long for some work that shall {{make a man}} of me. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go?</b> I annoy <b>you</b> with my confessions. Pardon me. They are the first I ever made; they shall be the last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear mother, Ahasuerus {{would have}} been either fast asleep, or far too drunk to listen to me. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>go</b> yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} I love you. I think, surely, that never love was {{stronger}} than mine. If you can love me say but the one word, and you will make me absolutely happy. To have you for my wife is all that the world can give me now. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> from me? Is it {{to tell me that}} you cannot love me, Marion? Do not say that, or I think my heart will break." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord!" [...] he said, {{and stared}} at the rug. [...] "You'll take your oath----" [...] He glanced up and met my eye. [...] "Oh, of course it's all right what you say." [...] He was profoundly perplexed. He reflected. [...] "But then, I say Stratton, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> for Maxton at Blake's? That I had from an eye-witness. You can't deny a scrap like that--in broad daylight. Why did you do that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is really}} very well done," [...] she said, [...] "but what in goodness' name did they teach you drawing for!' What would be the use of it after leaving school? Well, yes, it might be useful in one way. It astonishes me to think how {{you were trying to}} live, Fan. You were {{certainly}} not fit for that hard rough work, and would have starved at it. You were made, body and mind, in a more delicate mould, and for something better. I think that with all you have learnt at school, and with your appearance, especially with those truthful eyes of yours and that sweet voice, you might have got a place as nursery governess, to teach small children, or something of that sort. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> starving about the streets, Fan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the course}} of conversation, as they were {{preparing}} to ride away, the queen asked Anne Maria if she was not surprised at being called up to go on such an expedition. [...] "Oh no," [...] said she; [...] "my father" [...] (that is, Gaston, the duke of Orleans) [...] "told me all about it beforehand." [...] This was not true, as she says herself in her own account of these transactions. She {{knew nothing about the}} plan until she was called from her bed. She said this, therefore, only to tease her aunt by the false pretension that the secret had been confided to her. Her aunt, however, did not believe her, and said, [...] "Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to bed, if you knew what was going on?" [...] "Oh," [...] replied Anne Maria, [...] "I {{thought it would be a}} good plan to get some sleep, as I did not know whether I should even have a bed to lie upon to-morrow night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{father looked}} at, and, I feared, {{was going to}} check her; but he only said, [...] "Proceed, Polly, proceed with that catechism--prove {{yourself}} the little wiseacre you are. If Miss Snowe were to blush and look confused, I should have to bid you hold your tongue; and you and I would sit out the present meal in some disgrace; but she only smiles, so push her hard, multiply the cross-questions. Well, Miss Snowe, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or, {{if you get}} {{a ticket}} from your priest they will give you meal twice a week at Clady. <b>You</b> know that. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>go</b> to Father Connellan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel sure of it. Therefore <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>go</b> to her?" [...] They {{walked along}} {{together}} {{for a few minutes}} under the rocks in silence, and then Mrs. Cornbury again repeated her question, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>go</b> to her?" ...|$|R
