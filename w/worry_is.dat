25|$|In Punjab the {{consumption}} of fertiliser per hectare is 223.46kg as compared to 90kg nationally. The state has been awarded the National Productivity Award for agriculture extension services for ten years, from 1991–92 to 1998–99 and from 2001 to 2003–04. In recent years a drop in productivity has been observed, mainly due to falling fertility of the soil. This {{is believed to be}} due to excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides over the years. Another <b>worry</b> <b>is</b> the rapidly falling water table on which almost 90% of the agriculture depends; alarming drops have been witnessed in recent years. By some estimates, groundwater is falling by a meter or more per year.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{external}} beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) is delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical linear accelerators which generate high energy x-rays. 2DXRT mainly {{consists of a}} single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. Conventional refers {{to the way the}} treatment is planned or simulated on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired plan. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The <b>worry</b> <b>is</b> that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning {{to such an extent that}} tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} psychophysiological {{correlates}} of worrying, the authors recorded heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), skin conductance level, and alpha electroencephalographic asymmetry in healthy males during baseline, relaxation, worry induction, and anticipation of an impromptu speech task. Compared with baseline, relaxation, and anticipation, <b>worrying</b> <b>was</b> {{associated with greater}} heart rate and lower RSA. <b>Worrying</b> <b>was</b> further characterized by higher skin conductance levels compared with baseline but lower levels than during anticipation. Finally, <b>worrying</b> <b>was</b> associated with relatively greater left frontal activity compared with anticipation. Trait public speaking anxiety {{was positively correlated with}} left frontal activity during worrying. These results support the notion that <b>worrying</b> <b>is</b> a unique emotional state that is different from fearful anticipation...|$|R

[...] When the interviewer said [...] "So it shouldn't be taught?" [...] he responded [...] "I don't think it should, actually. No, no. And that's different from saying–different from discussing, teaching about what creation means. For that matter, it's not even the same as saying that Darwinism is–is the only thing that ought to be taught.

2500|$|Contact with {{farm animals}} {{can lead to}} disease in farmers or others that {{come into contact with}} {{infected}} animals. [...] Glanders primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries and wool mills. Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to clamydiosis, or enzootic abortion, in pregnant women, as well as an increased risk of Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis in pregnant or the otherwise immunocompromised. Echinococcosis is caused by a tapeworm which can be spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated with feces or wool. Bird flu is common in chickens. While rare in humans, the main public health <b>worry</b> <b>is</b> that a strain of bird flu will recombine with a human flu virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. In 2017, free range chickens in the UK were temporarily ordered to remain inside due to the threat of bird flu. Cattle are an important reservoir of cryptosporidiosis and mainly affects the immunocompromised.|$|E

In the article, {{he argues that}} [...] "Our most {{powerful}} 21st-century technologies — robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech — are threatening to make humans an endangered species." [...] Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before it has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction, such as the nuclear bomb, were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, {{as well as the}} difficulty in acquiring the required materials. He also voices concern about increasing computer power. His <b>worry</b> <b>is</b> that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such dystopian scenarios as robot rebellion. He notably quotes the Unabomber on this topic. [...] After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Worrying</b> <b>is</b> {{the central}} feature of {{generalized}} anxiety disorder (GAD). Many people worry from time to time, but in GAD the <b>worrying</b> <b>is</b> prolonged and difficult to control. <b>Worrying</b> <b>is</b> a specific way of coping with perceived threats and feared situations. Meanwhile, it is {{not considered to be}} a helpful coping strategy, and the phenomenological account developed in this paper aims to show why. It builds on several phenomenological notions and in particular on Michael Wheeler's application of these notions to artificial intelligence and the cognitive sciences. Wheeler emphasizes the value of 'online intelligence' as contrasted to 'offline intelligence'. I discuss and apply these concepts with respect to worrying as it occurs in GAD, suggesting that GAD patients overrate the value of detached contemplation (offline intelligence), while underrating their embodied-embedded adaptive skills (online intelligence). I argue that this phenomenological account does not only help explaining why <b>worrying</b> <b>is</b> used as a coping strategy, but also why cognitive behavioral therapy is successful in treating GAD. </p...|$|R
