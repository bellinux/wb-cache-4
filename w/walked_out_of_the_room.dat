500|$|After {{completing}} the recording, McCartney {{was eager to}} gauge {{the reaction of the}} band's contemporaries. On 2 May, he played the song to Bob Dylan at the latter's hotel suite in London; as the track started, Dylan said dismissively: [...] "Oh, I get it. You don't want to be cute anymore." [...] According to Marianne Faithfull, who was also present, Dylan then <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> McCartney recalled that when the Beatles played the song to members of the Rolling Stones and the Who, they [...] "visibly sat up and were interested", whereas Cilla Black [...] "just laughed".|$|E
500|$|The theme, [...] "The X-Files", {{used more}} {{instrumental}} sections than most dramas. The theme song's famous whistle effect {{was inspired by}} the track [...] "How Soon Is Now?" [...] from The Smiths' 1985 album Meat Is Murder. After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a Proteus 2 rack-mount synth with an effect called [...] "Whistling Joe". After hearing this effect, Carter was [...] "taken aback" [...] and noted it was [...] "going to be good". According to the [...] "Behind the Truth" [...] segment on the first season DVD, Snow created the echo effect on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an echo effect setting. The resulting riff pleased Carter; Snow said, [...] "this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it." [...] The second episode, [...] "Deep Throat", marked Snow's debut as solo composer for an entire episode. The production crew was determined to limit the music in the early episodes. Likewise, the theme song itself first appeared in [...] "Deep Throat".|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up and <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room...</b> I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E

500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{one early}} meeting in Geneva, Zhou {{found himself in}} the same room with the staunchly anti-Communist American {{secretary}} of state, John Foster Dulles. After Zhou politely offered to shake his hand, Dulles rudely turned his back and <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> saying [...] "I cannot". [...] Zhou was interpreted by onlookers as turning this moment of possible humiliation into a small victory by giving only a small, [...] "Gallic-style" [...] shrug to this behaviour. [...] Zhou was equally effective in countering Dulles' insistence that China not be given a seat at the sessions. [...] Furthering the impression of Chinese urbanity and civility, Zhou had lunch with British actor Charlie Chaplin, who had been living in Switzerland since being blacklisted in the United States for his radical politics.|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have all}} these great stories in the book," [...] I told her, [...] "Why don't you use them in the song?" [...] I knew that Madonna was {{developing}} a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far {{she was willing to}} go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book and <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and didn't come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. [...] "My name is Dita," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll be your mistress tonight." [...] I knew that the original [...] "Erotica" [...] {{would never be the same}} again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Judge {{once said}} in an {{interview}} that Beavis [...] "is a zero" [...] when it comes to intelligence; indeed, Beavis is often oblivious to what should be obvious. Generally submissive to Butt-Head and willing to tolerate a large amount of physical and verbal abuse, Beavis nonetheless has limits. In [...] "Murder Site", Beavis was driven to attack and nearly kill Butt-Head, who ceaselessly called him [...] "Butt-knocker", a term which Beavis resents. Beavis also stood up to Butt-Head while they were watching the video for Rancid's [...] "Nihilism": Butt-Head kept talking about it derisively, prompting Beavis to tell Butt-Head to shut up. When Butt-Head reacted with fury, ordering Beavis never again to tell him to shut up and threatening to attack him, Beavis preemptively kicked Butt-Head in the testicles, told him to shut up again, and <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to get something to eat. In another episode, while the duo were watching a Bon Jovi video, Beavis claimed to like one part of the song, causing Butt-Head to slap him in disgust. After being struck a few times, Beavis kicked Butt-Head in the groin and proclaimed [...] "Bon Jovi rules!".|$|E
