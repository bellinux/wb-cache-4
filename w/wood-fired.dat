5|$|The River Street Bakery, {{also in the}} Mill Works Building and {{now owned}} by the Co-op, claims to have the only <b>wood-fired</b> brick oven in {{commercial}} use in Washtenaw County. Originally called the Depot Town Sourdough Bakery, the bakery was founded by Tom Kinney as an independent cooperative non-profit with a $20,000 loan from the Cooperative Whole Grain Education Association and pledges from prospective customers. To stretch the limited funds, the brick oven was built by hand in 1989. From the beginning, the Ypsilanti Food Co-op retailed the bread.|$|E
5|$|Born January 9, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, Matt Bevin was {{the second}} of six {{children}} born to Avery and Louise Bevin. He {{grew up in the}} rural town of Shelburne, New Hampshire, in a small farmhouse heated by <b>wood-fired</b> stoves. His father worked at a wood mill, and his mother worked part-time in a hospital admissions department. The family raised livestock and grew much of their own food. At age 6, Bevin made money by packaging and selling seeds to his neighbors. He credits his involvement in 4-H, where he {{served as president of the}} local and county chapters and as a member of the state teen council, with developing his public speaking and leadership skills. He was also involved with the county's Dairy Club.|$|E

25|$|Minas Gerais {{is known}} nationally for its cuisine. The {{cultural}} {{basis of its}} cuisine is the small farmhouse, {{and many of the}} dishes are prepared using locally produced vegetables and meats, especially chicken and pork.

From the festival village one could attend any number of craft workshops, pick up a copy of the daily Nambassa Waves newspaper, go buy fresh bread cooked in the <b>wood-fired</b> oven bakery constructed in a converted hay shed, go do some shopping, check out Radio Nambassaland, pick up some information from the mother centre, or just simply chill out and absorb the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|As {{a wealthy}} and {{powerful}} nation with limited winemaking resources, England had a marked {{influence on the}} development of sparkling Champagne. Non-sparkling Champagne became popular in London society following the arrival of epicurean Charles de Saint-Évremond in 1661. At parties and banquets, Saint-Évremond feverishly promoted the wines of the Champagne region. Soon some of the most powerful and fashionable men of London, such as the Duke of Bedford and the Duke of Buckingham as well as the Earl of Arlington were making regular orders of cases of Champagne. The wine was non-sparkling, or at least it was intended to be. Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels and merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, English glassmakers used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than <b>wood-fired</b> French glass. The English also rediscovered the use of cork stoppers, once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the fermentation process was prematurely halted, leaving some residual sugar and dormant yeast. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly.|$|E
500|$|In August 1901, Harvey's son Hal and {{brother-in-law}} Ernest Halliday {{opened a}} large bathhouse on Silver Springs Creek, across the lagoon from Hotel Monte Ne. The indoor pool {{was the first}} in Arkansas. It was 25 by 50ft (7.6 by 15m) and [...] deep and included springboards and slides. Water from the spring flowed into the swimming pool, half of which was sectioned off and featured heated water piped in from a <b>wood-fired</b> boiler. The bathhouse also had a two-lane bowling alley. The pool continued to be a popular attraction throughout the life of Monte Ne until the opening of an outdoor pool in Willola in 1923.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of these}} budget cutbacks, Southern Oregon has used tourism {{as a means}} of {{attracting}} small businesses and retirees. The movement of California retirees in particular has helped the economy grow. Although jobs have been created as a result, they are usually low-paying. [...] Today the principal industries are tourism, timber and agriculture. [...] Since about 1960, the community has evolved into a center for wine, retirement, tourism, and small businesses. [...] One timber mill remains in Cave Junction, Rough & Ready Lumber Co., located six miles (10km) south of town. [...] In November 2007, Rough & Ready completed a $6 million biomass plant to replace their existing <b>wood-fired</b> boiler, as market forces have increased demand for dry timber. It finally closed in November, 2016.|$|E
500|$|To {{the west}} of the mansio lay the public bath-house, {{separated}} from it by a cobbled road between [...] wide. From the street, a paved area led into a colonnade fronting the building on the east and continuing round the north side. Large doors in the centre of the eastern colonnade opened into a large, covered courtyard. This courtyard may have been a basilica; a settlement of this size would be expected to have one, and this is the only candidate on the site. At the far north end of the bath complex was the stoke-room or praefurnium, which contained the <b>wood-fired</b> furnaces of the hypocaust system. This underfloor heating system was present in the tepidarium, the caldarium and the laconicum where the floors were supported on pillars of tiles or pilae. The hot combustion gases from the stoke-room furnaces circulated under the floor between these pillars and were drawn up around the sides of the building through box tiles embedded in the walls, to escape finally through vents in the barrel-vaulted roof.|$|E

2500|$|These porcelains {{that came}} from East Asia, {{especially}} China, {{were some of the}} finest quality porcelain wares. The earliest European porcelains were produced at the Meissen factory in the early 18th century; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to [...] in a <b>wood-fired</b> kiln, producing a porcelain of great hardness, translucency, and strength. Later, the composition of the Meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz, allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures.

[...] After traveling to Italy, Waters decided to make an open kitchen featuring a Tomasso's-style pizza oven the focus of the new cafe she was opening above her main dining room. [...] Although prepared in classic fashion, her chefs added exotic fine ingredients to their single-serving pizzas and calzones, such as goat cheese and duck sausage. [...] Her cafe, and its pizzas in particular, were an instant success, attracting wide attention among food critics.|$|E
2500|$|New Haven's {{greatest}} culinary {{claim to}} fame may be its pizza, which has been claimed {{to be among the}} best in the country, or even in the world. New Haven-style pizza, called [...] "apizza" [...] (pronounced , [...] in the original Italian dialect), made its debut at the iconic Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (known as Pepe's) in 1925. Apizza is baked in coal- or <b>wood-fired</b> brick ovens, and is notable for its thin crust. Apizza may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of garlic and olive oil), and pies ordered [...] "plain" [...] are made without the otherwise customary mozzarella cheese (originally smoked mozzarella, known as [...] "scamorza" [...] in Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants on Wooster Street in the Little Italy section of New Haven, including Pepe's and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, which opened in 1934, is also well-known.|$|E
2500|$|In {{southern}} Britain, coppice was traditionally hazel, hornbeam, beech, ash or oak, grown amongst oak {{or sometimes}} ash or beech standards. In wet areas alder and willows were used. [...] These coppices provided wood for many purposes, especially charcoal, which before coal was economically significant in metal smelting. A minority of these woods are still operated for coppice today, often by conservation organisations, producing material for hurdle-making, thatching spars, local charcoal-burning or other crafts. The only remaining large-scale commercial coppice crop in England is sweet chestnut which is grown {{in parts of}} Sussex and Kent. Much of this was established as plantations in the 19th century for hop-pole production (hop-poles are used to support the hop plant while growing hops) and is nowadays cut on a 12 to 18-year cycle for splitting and binding into cleft chestnut paling fence, or on a 20- to 35-year cycle for cleft post-and-rail fencing, or for sawing into small lengths to be finger-jointed for architectural use. Other material goes to make farm fencing and to be chipped for modern <b>wood-fired</b> heating systems.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{were the}} first to see the {{tendency}} of wines from Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait and tried to understand why it produced bubbles. Wine was often transported to England in wooden wine barrels where merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, English glass production used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than the <b>wood-fired</b> French glass.

When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling and that by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it, nearly any wine could be made to sparkle. This is one of the first known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and even suggests that British merchants were producing [...] "sparkling Champagne" [...] before the French Champenois were deliberately making it.|$|E
