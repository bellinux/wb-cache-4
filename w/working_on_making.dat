2500|$|Full {{development}} of Rocket League started around 2013 and took around {{two years and}} under $2 million to develop, though they had tested various prototypes of a Battle-Cars sequel in the years prior, including an unsuccessful attempt at pitching the game's idea to Electronic Arts in 2011. Psyonix used some of the feedback from Battle-Cars to fine-tune the gameplay in Rocket League. A key requirement for Psyonix was to increase the game's frame rate from 30 to 60 frames-per-second, a known criticism from Battle-Cars and essential for newer hardware, according to Corey Davis, the design director at Psyonix. Hagewood recognized that Battle-Cars was considered [...] "too hardcore" [...] with the game becoming too inaccessible to novice players against skilled ones. They eased up on some aspects {{to make it more}} approachable, such as by slowing the pace of the game and allowing players of all skill levels to reasonably compete against each other while promoting team-based gameplay. Though they tried to add elements like power-ups, they found these to be too distracting to gameplay. They also explored other changes such as making the game more gritty, akin to Monday Night Combat, developing several mini-games related to handling of the car, <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>making</b> the graphics give a sense of scale to the players to give the impression they were controlling full-sized vehicles rather than radio-controlled cars, and creating an open world structure where the player would drive between stadium and stadium to participate in matches. Instead, the team opted to strip the game to its core, focusing on more visual elements to enhance the title. From Battle-Cars, Psyonix recognized very few players actually went online, and developed Rocket Leagues single-player season mode to encourage players to try online matches once they completed it.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, persons {{trained in}} the MOF  18 ‘Health {{occupation}}s’ would need {{to stay in their}} occupation more often. The projected stayer rate of 67.8 % in 2030 in the baseline scenario would have to increase to 71.9 %. This complements the results of the previous section: Because switches into these occupations are quite unlikely due to work regulations, the needed increase in stayers would only be achievable via an even greater occupational loyalty or increased training of new supply. Since outside wages are not significantly important to doctors and nursing staff, the results again stress the impact of other factors, as for example <b>working</b> conditions, <b>on</b> <b>making</b> these occupations more attractive for policy recommendations to realize the increase in labour supply.|$|R

50|$|Based on discoveries made, {{the oldest}} land in Anglet {{dates back to}} {{prehistory}} (mid-Paleolithic) and Mousterian culture (from 100,000 to 35,000 BC).
