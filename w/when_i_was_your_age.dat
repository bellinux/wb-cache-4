[...] "Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play for their kids and say, 'This is what I was listening to <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> Check it out, it’s still fucking cool.' We {{wanted to make a}} record you could pass down. There’s a lot of music out now that doesn’t feel like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' {{returned}} John, 'one and sixpence. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I {{had never}} seen so much money, in a heap. A shilling of it is in case of accidents--the mare casting a shoe, or the like of that. The other sixpence is to spend in the diversions of London; and the diversion I recommend {{is going to the}} top of the Monument, and sitting there. There's no temptation there, sir--no drink--no young women--no bad characters of any sort--nothing but imagination. That's the way I enjoyed myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> sir.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Is {{that another}} sort of joke?" [...] asked the old man. [...] "You've no excuse for being bored anywhere. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I {{had never heard of}} such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough, {{enough for}} t'e present, young comrate. Pusiness is {{standing}} still a little, for t'e want of my hant; {{step off the}} frame, lat, and let us get up t'ese pents, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>your</b> man {{for a week or}} a year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR AUGUSTUS--Your letter reached me yesterday. You seem to {{be making}} the most of your youth (as you call it) with a vengeance. Well! enjoy your holiday.

5000|$|Angus B. Noseworthy (Robert Higden): The Vice Principal {{in charge}} of discipline, however is laid back and has no self-discipline.

6000|$|... "You know, old chap," [...] said Joe, {{looking at}} me, {{and not at}} Mrs. Joe, with his bite still in his cheek, [...] "I Bolted, myself, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> age--frequent--and as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but I do say it. I've {{always been}} pulling the devil by the tail, and never yet got {{as much as}} a good hold on to that.

6000|$|... "You're right," [...] said Val suddenly; [...] "but things aren't {{what they}} were <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> There's a 'Tomorrow we die' feeling. That's what old George meant about my uncle Soames. HE doesn't mean to die tomorrow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] she replied. [...] "All {{young people}} boast of their health. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> every thought of illness was {{as black as}} a visitation of the devil.

6000|$|... "I {{can never}} {{do as much}} as this <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>your</b> countess," [...] she said to her future lord.
