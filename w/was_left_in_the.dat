5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 640s, the Irish monk Fursey, having {{spent a year}} as a hermit, left East Anglia for Gaul. His monastery at Cnobheresburg (identified by some with Burgh Castle) <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of his half-brother, Foillan. In 651, shortly after his departure, the heathen threat he had {{foreseen}} became a reality, when Foillan and his community were driven out by Penda's forces and Anna, who encountered Penda at Cnobheresburg, was exiled.|$|E
5|$|Following Walt Disney's passing, Wolfgang Reitherman {{continued}} as both producer {{and director of}} the features. The studio began the 1970s with the release of The Aristocats, the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney. In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms {{for the rest of the}} decade. The next feature, Robin Hood (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features. Both The Aristocats and Robin Hood were minor box office and critical successes.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{complicated}} marital {{situation and}} his high-handed {{dissolution of the}} monasteries angered the Pope and Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 Henry had agreed to attack France together with Emperor CharlesV, and English forces captured Boulogne at great cost in September, but soon England <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a separate peace.|$|E
5|$|London {{was also}} full of black powder, {{especially}} {{along the river}} front. Much of it <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> homes of private citizens {{from the days of}} the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them. Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{ceremony}} afterwards with speeches from politicians from Alfonsín's tenure {{and from the}} Kirchner administration. The ceremony was aired in cadena nacional.

People threw flowers to the coffin, fly Argentine and radical flags, and sung the national anthem.

5|$|While in Egypt, Bonaparte stayed {{informed}} of European affairs. He learned that France {{had suffered a}} series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition. On 24 August 1799, he {{took advantage of the}} temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, {{despite the fact that he}} had received no explicit orders from Paris. The army <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> charge of Jean Baptiste Kléber.|$|E
5|$|Bliss <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{strong room}} {{for three weeks}} wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs {{was so bad that}} the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company, and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans.|$|E

She {{attempts}} to tell Ryan that he is Lily's father, but is interrupted by Pat, who thinks Stacey is trying to seduce him and slaps her. Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she can call the police about Stacey. They argue, with Phil accusing Peggy of loving the pub more than she loves him and throwing a match to the alcohol-soaked floor to start a fire. It spreads quickly, causing an explosion. The customers flee the pub, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) is knocked to the ground and trampled in the process but is rescued by his father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and brother Tamwar (Himesh Patel).|$|E
5|$|The Judd School was {{established}} in 1888, but {{the need for a}} secondary school to supplement Sir Andrew Judd's Grammar School (now known as the famous Public School: Tonbridge School) was acknowledged as early as 1870, after it was revealed that only one in 200 of its students {{was the son of a}} Tonbridge tradesman. Tonbridge School was founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judd, who made a fortune in the Muscovy fur trade during the 16th century. His endowment <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of the Skinners Company, who agreed to fund the establishment of a commercial school in Tonbridge in 1875. However, the Charity Commissioners – empowered by the 1869 Endowed Schools Act to govern the establishment of charitably funded schools – directed that the £20,000 provided by The Skinners' Company for this cause be taken to neighbouring Tunbridge Wells, where it was used to establish The Skinners' School in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|The royal and baronial parties {{now both}} began {{preparations}} for war. In March, Gaveston settled at Scarborough, {{and began to}} fortify the castle. Around the same time, he was pronounced excommunicate by Archbishop Winchelsey at St Paul's. At the same meeting the barons – {{under the leadership of}} Lancaster – divided up the realm to oppose the King. Pembroke and Warenne were given the responsibility of capturing Gaveston. On 4 May, the King and Gaveston were at Newcastle, and barely escaped a force led by Lancaster, Henry Percy and Robert Clifford. Gaveston then returned to Scarborough, while the King left for York. Scarborough was soon besieged by Pembroke, Warenne, Percy and Clifford, and on 19 May Gaveston surrendered to the besiegers. The terms of the surrender were that Pembroke, Warenne and Percy would take Gaveston to York, where the barons would negotiate with the king. If an agreement could not be reached by 1 August, Gaveston would be allowed to return to Scarborough. The three swore an oath to guarantee his safety. After an initial meeting with the King in York, Gaveston <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> custody of Pembroke, who escorted him south for safekeeping.|$|E

Number 41 153 was listed on the books of the Czechoslovakian State Railways (CSD) after 1945.

5|$|In spring, however, Bardas Skleros, now {{appointed}} doux of Mesopotamia, rose in revolt {{and proclaimed}} himself emperor at his base in Melitene. Bourtzes was commanded by Constantinople {{to lead his}} force north, join the army of Eustathios Maleinos, now governor of Cilicia, and block the rebel from crossing the Antitaurus Mountains. Leaving his son in control of Antioch, Bourtzes complied and marched north. In the ensuing battle at the fortress of Lapara {{in the province of}} Lykandos (autumn 976), however, the combined loyalist force was routed, with Bourtzes being the first to retreat according to the chroniclers. As Skylitzes pointedly comments, Bourtzes' conduct during the battle was attributed either to cowardice or to malice; certainly soon after, he deserted the imperial camp and joined Skleros. According to the contemporary Yahya of Antioch, Bourtzes at first fled to a fortress in the Anatolic Theme, but was followed by Skleros and persuaded to come over to his side. Bourtzes's defection brought Skleros control of Antioch as well: Bourtzes commanded his son Constantine to join him, and the city <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of the Arab Kulayb, who was soon overthrown by another Arab, Ubaydallah, who also joined Skleros. In the summer of 977, Boutzes was deployed, along with Romanos Taronites, in command of Skleros's forces shadowing the operations of the imperial army advancing from Kotyaion to Ikonion. The presence of the tribute caravan from Aleppo entangled the two forces in an impromptu fight at Oxylithos, which ended in a bloody defeat for the rebels. After this, Bourtzes again switched sides and rejoined the imperial army, now led by Bardas Phokas.|$|E
