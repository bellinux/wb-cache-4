25|$|If disturbed, <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> {{caterpillars}} {{will roll}} {{into a tight}} spiral or drop from their perch suspended by a strand of silk. Isabella tiger moths (Pyrrharctia isabella) overwinter in the caterpillar stage. They can survive freezing at moderate subzero temperatures by producing a cryoprotectant chemical. The larvae of another species, Phragmatobia fuliginosa, may be found on snow seeking a place to pupate. Species in Arctic and temperate belts overwinter in larval stage.|$|E

5000|$|The extreme winter {{temperatures}} {{are not as}} detrimental to Gynaephora caterpillars as are the parasitoids. The larvae are extremely freeze-tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to -70°C. As temperatures decrease during the late arctic summer, the larvae start synthesizing cryoprotective compounds, such as glycerol, in addition to some unusual ones, e.g. betaine. Accumulation of these [...] "antifreezes“ is aided by bottle-necking of oxidative phosphorylation through mitochondrial degradation. The <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> resynthesize the mitochondria the following spring upon resumption of their activity.|$|R

30|$|London {{properties}} are more constant {{in terms of}} the number of traps laid over the years and the nature of the properties, so seemed possible to test whether the distributions of trapped insects show different statistics. The low catch of many insects restricted the chi-square test to a contingency table of the most abundant insects: <b>woolly</b> <b>bears,</b> booklice, silverfish and woodlice. The test suggested that counts of these insects from the seven London properties do not follow a consistent distribution (p[*]=[*] 0.001, Chi-squared test, DoF[*]=[*] 18). This lends support to the individualistic nature of the properties with respect to the insects trapped.|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "Woolly Worm" [...] {{refers to}} the <b>Woolly</b> <b>bear</b> caterpillar. The {{official}} mascot, [...] "Woolly the Woolly Worm," [...] used as an image on some local merchandise and flyers. A round hay bale caricature of him stands beside the welcome sign to Beattyville.|$|E
2500|$|Local {{folklore}} of the American Northeast and the American South {{hold that}} [...] "woolly bears" [...] (or [...] "wooly worms" [...] in the South) help humans predict the weather, {{similar to the}} groundhog. The forthcoming severity of a winter may be indicated {{by the amount of}} black on the Isabella tiger moth's caterpillar—the most familiar <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> in North America. More brown than black is said to mean a mild winter, while more black than brown is supposed to mean a harsh winter. However, the relative width of the black band varies among instars, not according to weather. The mythical qualities attributed to woolly bears in America have led to such things as the Woollybear Festival in Ohio, the Wooly Worm Festival in Beattyville, Kentucky and the Wooly Worm Festival in Banner Elk, North Carolina.|$|E
60|$|Though {{inclined}} to be dreamy and idle when alone, I was, of course, my own teacher too. My senses were seven in number, however few my wits. In particular I loved to observe the clustering and gathering of plants, like families, each of a shape, size, and hue, each in their kind and season, though tall and lowly were intermingled. Now and then I would come on some small plant self-sown, shining and flourishing, free and clear, and even the lovelier for being alone in its kind amid its greater neighbours. I prized these discoveries, and if {{any one of them}} was dwarfed a little by its surroundings I would cosset it up and help it against them. How strange, thought I, if men so regarded each other's intelligence. If from pitying the dull-witted the sharp-witted slid to mere toleration, and from toleration to despising and loathing. What a contest would presently begin between the strong-bodied stupid and the feeble-bodied clever, and how soon there would be no strong-bodied stupid left in the world! They would dwindle away and disappear into Time like the mammoth and the <b>woolly</b> <b>bear.</b> And then I began to be sorry for the <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> and to wish I could go and have a look at him. Perhaps this is putting my old head on those young shoulders, but when I strive to re-enter the thoughts of those remote days, how like they seem to the noisy wasting stream beside which they flowed on, and of whose source and destination I was unaware.|$|E
2500|$|The Arctiinae (formerly {{called the}} Arctiidae) {{are a large}} and diverse {{subfamily}} of moths, with around 11,000 species found all over the world, including 6,000 neotropical species. This group includes the groups commonly known as tiger moths (or tigers), which usually have bright colours, footmen, which are usually much drabber, lichen moths, and wasp moths. Many species have [...] "hairy" [...] caterpillars that are popularly known as <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> or <b>woolly</b> worms. The scientific name of this subfamily refers to this hairiness (Gk. αρκτος = a bear). Caterpillars may also go by the name [...] "tussock moths" [...] (more usually, however, this refers to the Lymantriidae).|$|R
40|$|The summer {{has flown}} by (as usual, it seems) and {{things at the}} FWG are slowing down {{as many of the}} birds leave and {{resident}} creatures find winter quarters. We try not to step on <b>woolly</b> <b>bears</b> or irritate busy red squirrels as we stroll around the garden enjoying the last warm days and beautiful colours of fall. What have we accomplished this year? Our plant sale in June was an overwhelming success, which means that many, many more people are growing native plants in their Ottawa gardens. Our own Backyard Garden is providing a stunning example of how and what to plant in your landscape to attract the bees and butterflies that need our help as well as other creatures, like chipmunks, toads, and rabbits, that continue to surprise and delight us and visitors. Some of us tried raising monarch caterpillars this year and were able to release half a dozen new adults in the garden.

50|$|Hazardia squarrosa {{grows in}} coastal and inland scrub and {{chaparral}} habitats. It a shrub of variable size, from low and clumpy to sprawling over 2 m tall. It {{is covered in}} thick, sharply toothed leaves a few centimeters long and is generally not very hairy or <b>woolly.</b> It <b>bears</b> numerous flower heads covered in greenish, pointed phyllaries and opening into an array of long yellow to slightly reddish disc florets but no ray florets.|$|R
60|$|Now, I {{know that}} cantankerous person, the {{universal}} objector, has all along been bursting to interrupt me and declare {{that he himself}} frequently finds no end of caterpillars, and has not the slightest difficulty at all in distinguishing them {{with the naked eye}} from the leaves and plants among which they are lurking. But observe how promptly we crush and demolish this very inconvenient and disconcerting critic. The caterpillars he finds are almost all hairy ones, very conspicuous and easy to discover--'woolly bears,' and such like common and unclean creatures--and the reason they take no pains to conceal themselves from his unobservant eyes is simply this: nobody on earth wants to discover them. For either they are protectively encased in horrid hairs, which get down your throat and choke you and bother you (I speak as a bird, {{from the point of view}} of a confirmed caterpillar eater), or else they are bitter and nasty to the taste, like the larva of the spurge moth and the machaon butterfly. These are the ordinary brown and red and banded caterpillars that the critical objector finds in hundreds on his peregrinations about his own garden--commonplace things which the experienced naturalist has long since got utterly tired of. But has your rash objector ever lighted upon that rare larva which lives among the periwinkles, and exactly imitates a periwinkle petal? Has he ever discovered those deceptive creatures which pretend for all the world to be leaves of lady's-bedstraw, or dress themselves up as flowers of buttonweed? Has he ever hit upon those immoral caterpillars which wriggle through life upon the false pretence that they are only the shadows of projecting ribs on the under surface of a full-grown lime leaf? No, not he; he passes them all by without one single glance of recognition; and when the painstaking naturalist who has hunted them every one down with lens and butterfly net ventures tentatively to describe their personal appearance, he comes up smiling with his great russet <b>woolly</b> <b>bear</b> comfortably nestling upon a green cabbage leaf, and asks you in a voice of triumphant demonstration, where is the trace of concealment or disguise in that amiable but very inedible insect? Go to, Sir Critic, I will have none of you; I only use you for a metaphorical marionette to set up and knock down again, as Mr. Punch in the street show knocks down the policeman who comes to arrest him, and the grimy black personage of sulphurous antecedents who pops up with a fizz through the floor of his apartment.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{reconstruct}} a phylogenetic hypothesis for the moth subfamily Arctiinae (tiger moths, <b>woolly</b> <b>bears)</b> to investigate the evolution of larval and adult pharmacophagy of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and the pathway to PA chemical specialization in Arctiinae. Pharmacophagy, collection of chemicals for non-nutritive purposes, is well documented in many species, including the model species Utetheisa ornatrix L. A total of 86 exemplar ingroup species representing tiger moth tribes and subtribes (68 genera) and nine outgroup species were selected. Ingroup species included the most species-rich generic groups to represent the diversity of host-plant associations and pharmacophagous behaviors found throughout Arctiinae. Up to nine genetic markers were sequenced: one mitochondrial (COI barcode region), one nuclear rRNA (D 2 region, 28 S rRNA), and seven nuclear protein-coding gene fragments: elongation factor 1 -a protein, wingless, ribosomal protein subunit S 5, carbamoylphosphate synthase domain regions, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. A total of 6984 bp was obtained for most species. These data were analyzed using model-based phylogenetic methods: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). Ancestral pharmacophagous behaviors and obligate PA associations were reconstructed using the resulting Bayes topology and Reconstructing Ancestral States in Phylogenies (RASP) software. Our results corroborate earlier studies on the evolution of adult pharmacophagous behaviors, suggesting that this behavior arose multiple times and is concentrated in th...|$|R

50|$|This {{concentration}} {{of evidence of}} full behavioral modernity, including figurative art and instrumental music among humans {{in the period of}} 40 to 30 thousand years ago, is unique worldwide and its discoverer, archaeologist Nicholas Conard, speculates that the bearers of the Aurignacian culture in the Swabian Alb may be credited with the invention, not just of figurative art and music, but possibly, the earliest religious practices as well. Within a distance of 70 cm to the Venus figurine, Conard's team also found a flute made from a vulture bone. Additional artifacts excavated from the same cave layer included flint-knapping debris, worked bone, and carved ivory as well as remains of tarpans, reindeer, cave <b>bears,</b> <b>woolly</b> mammoths, and Alpine Ibexes.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} found to contain organic {{material}} and a Mousterian hand axe {{was found in a}} good state of preservation. A further 30 Mousterian hand axes were found along with reindeer bones covered in cut marks. The animal remains have revealed the presence of woolly mammoths, <b>woolly</b> rhinoceros, brown <b>bears,</b> spotted hyenas and other smaller remains such as fish jaws, frog bones and several types of mollusc. Although the site contains such exotic animals the temperatures were still below those felt today as Norfolk was still in the clutches of the remnants of an Ice-Age. The average temperature in July has been estimated as 13 °C and the area would have been below freezing for most of the winter months. From plant and insect remains it has been deduced that the area was marshy and covered with small areas of open still water similar to the modern day broads.|$|R
