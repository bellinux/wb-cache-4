5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80–125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E

[...] The radio sound effects in the introduction were intended to create a mood and setting for the song. DJ Carter Alan noted that the sounds seemed to draw a connection from Achtung Baby, but Bono stated {{that it was not}} intentional and that he didn't want it to have [...] "anything to do with the past". [...] The lyrics in [...] "Zooropa" [...] begin with the Audi advertising slogan [...] "Vorsprung durch Technik" [...] ("Advancement through technology") and the first three verses feature references to slogans for other brands, including Colgate, Daz, Fairy, and Zanussi.|$|E

500|$|The adult of the {{nominate}} subspecies of the Alpine chough has glossy black plumage, a short yellow bill, {{dark brown}} irises, and red legs. It is slightly smaller than red-billed chough, at [...] length with a [...] tail and a [...] wingspan, {{but has a}} proportionally longer tail and shorter wings than its relative. It has a similar buoyant and easy flight. The sexes are identical in appearance although the male averages slightly larger than the female. The juvenile is duller than the adult <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> yellow bill and brownish legs. The Alpine chough {{is unlikely to be}} confused with any other species; although the jackdaw and red-billed chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the red-billed chough has a long red bill.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there are}} a few {{lookalike}} species with similar overall appearance, in the field, Gyroporus cyanescens is typically readily recognized by its characteristic straw-yellow color and nearly instantaneous dark blue bruising. G.phaeocyanescens is smaller, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> brownish-yellow cap. Although its flesh has a bluing reaction to injury, its yellow pore surface does not. It has larger spores, measuring 9–15 by 5–7µm. G.umbrinosquamosus, found along the Gulf Coast of the United States, is similar in appearance, but lacks the bluing reaction. Newly described from China in 2003, G.brunneofloccosus closely resembles G.cyanescens, and was frequently confused with that species. It has a smaller fruit body, with a brownish cap up to [...] in diameter. Its staining reaction involves a change from light turquoise to dark turquoise or dark blue. Its spores are 5–8.5 by 4–5.3µm. Suillus tomentosus has brownish pores that undergo a slower blue staining reaction. If the fruit bodies are not uprooted and only the top of the cap is examined, G.cyanescens can be confused with young Russula fellea mushrooms.|$|E

IGN ranked [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as the second worst Lost episode, above only [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", explaining [...] "Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles at this point in Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?... <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> story on the island and flashbacks weakly giving Hurley the requisite daddy issues so many of the other characters already had, it was clear Lost needed to make a big change soon to recapture what was special about the show. Thankfully, they did." [...] A similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode much higher at 31, writing [...] "The haters need to shut up. This is a nearly pure embrace of the Lost ethos.

500|$|The katipo is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} spider. The mature female has a body size of about [...] with a leg span of up to [...] The red katipo female, found in the South Island and the lower North Island, has a large black globular abdomen, {{about the size of}} a garden pea, with slender legs and a white-bordered orange or red stripe on its back that runs from the uppermost surface of the abdomen back to the spinnerets. The dark velvet-black abdomen is described as satin or silky in appearance, rather than being shiny. The underside of the abdomen is black and has a red patch or partial red hourglass-shaped marking. It has mainly black legs with the extremities changing to brown. The black katipo female, found in the upper North Island, does not have a red stripe on the top of her body, and the abdominal colouration is usually lighter, but is otherwise very similar in appearance to the red katipo. The hourglass pattern on the underside of the abdomen may also be less distinct, losing the middle section, and may even be absent. Variations also exist whose abdomen, cephalothorax, or entire body is brown, sometimes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> red or yellow stripe, or cream-coloured spots on its upper side. These different forms were at one point thought to be different species, but a 2008 study demonstrated they were different morphs of the same species.|$|E

500|$|The {{largest of}} the red robins, the flame robin is [...] long. It has a more slender build than {{other members of the}} genus Petroica, with {{relatively}} long wings and neck and small head. The male is easily distinguished by the bright orange-red plumage of the throat, breast and abdomen. The crown, nape, ear coverts, hindneck, and sides of neck are dark grey, and lores and chin are a grey-black. The grey feathers of the sides of the crown may be suffused with dull orange. The rest of the upperparts, comprising the wings, back and tail, are dark grey. There is a small white frontal spot above the bill, and the wing bar and outer tail shafts are white. The feathers of the posterior belly, flanks and vent are white with grey-black bases. The female is plainly coloured—pale brown overall, and a lighter buff underneath. The posterior belly, flanks and vent are off-white. As in the male, feathers {{on the side of the}} crown may be suffused <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> orange, and this may also occur with breast feathers. There are small off-white marks on the wings and above the bill. The bill, legs, feet and claws are black, and the eyes dark brown. A flame robin with an all lemon-yellow breast and otherwise female plumage was observed in a small flock of flame robins near Swansea in eastern Tasmania in September 1950.|$|E

[...] In addition, in 1797 a cannon manufacturer Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford demonstrated through the use of friction {{that it was possible to}} convert work to heat. He designed a specially shaped cannon barrel, thoroughly insulated against heat loss, then replaced the sharp boring tool <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> drill bit, and immersed the front part of the gun in a tank of water. To the amazement of observers, he brought cold water to a boil within two and one half hours, without the use of fire.|$|E

2500|$|A strong {{supporter}} of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Baudelaire called him [...] "a poet in painting". Baudelaire also absorbed much of Delacroix's aesthetic ideas as expressed in his journals. As Baudelaire elaborated in his [...] "Salon of 1846", [...] "As one contemplates his series of pictures, {{one seems to be}} attending the celebration of some grievous mystery.... This grave and lofty melancholy shines <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> light ... plaintive and profound like a melody by Weber." [...] Delacroix, though appreciative, kept his distance from Baudelaire, particularly after the scandal of Les Fleurs du mal. In private correspondence, Delacroix stated that Baudelaire [...] "really gets on my nerves" [...] and he expressed his unhappiness with Baudelaire's persistent comments about [...] "melancholy" [...] and [...] "feverishness".|$|E
2500|$|Architectural {{elements}} {{outlined by}} Conrad {{to achieve this}} goal included: brick construction over timber, with bare treatments to interior walls; large windows {{at the rear of the}} church and side windows on the chancel (rather than behind the altar); low-toned cathedral glass in simple leaded design where stained glass was not affordable, naves that were long rather than wide, and internal roofing wholly of wood, with heavy timber for open trussed roofs, stained <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> finish to create [...] "an interesting and dignified treatment". Such elements are readily apparent at St Paul's and other churches of the 1920s designed by Atkinson and Conrad. In particular, the use of substantial timber roof trussing in the nave (a word derived from the Latin word navis for ship), resembling the interior of a ship's hull, expressed the longstanding symbolism of the church as a ship, guiding its members to safe harbour.|$|E

[...] The New York Times critic John S. Wilson said in 1957 that Vaughan possessed [...] "what {{may well be the}} finest voice ever applied to jazz." [...] Age hardly affected Vaughan's voice.

2500|$|An exultant Stilwell {{immediately}} delivered {{this letter}} to Chiang despite pleas from Patrick J. Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering {{the message and}} work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang. Stillwell wrote in his diary about handing over Roosevelt's message: [...] "I handed this bundle of paprika to the Peanut and than sank back with a sigh. The harpoon hit the little bugger right in the solar plexus and went right through him. It was a clean hit, but beyond turning green and losing his powers of speech, he did not bat an eye". The British journalist Jonathan Fenby wrote about Roosevelt's letter: [...] "Unless the President was ready for America to take over effective control of China, or halt Lend-Lease supplies and abandon the KMT to its fate, his stern words merely amounted to bluff". Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation of China, Chiang gave a formal reply {{in which he said}} that Stilwell must be replaced immediately and he would welcome any other qualified U.S. general to fill Stilwell's position. Chiang called Roosevelt's letter the [...] "greatest humiliation I have been subjected to in my life" [...] and stated it was [...] "all too obvious that the United States intends to intervene in China's internal affairs". Chiang told Hurley the Chinese people were [...] "tired of the insults which Stillwell has seen fit to heap upon them". Chiang delivered a speech before the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which was leaked to the press, which called Roosevelt's letter a form of imperialism and stated that to accept Roosevelt's demands would make him no different from the Japanese collaborator Wang Jingwei in Nanking. On 12 October 1944, Hurley reported to Washington that Stilwell was a [...] "fine man, but was incapable of understanding or co-operating with Chiang Kai-shek", going on to say that if Stilwell remained in command, all of China might be lost to the Japanese. Before sending his cable, Hurley showed it to Stilwell who accused Hurley [...] to his face of [...] "cutting my throat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> knife".|$|E

A medium orange, narrow collar on the upper back borders the chestnut cap and ends {{at the side of}} the neck in a spot. A second collar, similar to that of the collared puffbird, is on the upper breast, wider on the sides, narrow under the throat, and deep black. The black collar is parallel to a second deep black stripe, an eye-stripe across the lower eye from the side to the bill. The deep chestnut cap and two black stripes enclose two parallel bright white stripes. The bill is stout, short and medium black, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decurved tip.
