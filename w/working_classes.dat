5|$|The {{want and}} {{suffering}} produced {{by such a}} condition of the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> is always an evil greatly to be deplored, but one, unfortunately, that cannot be reached by immediate legislation. The great and only remedy for unemployed labor, is the revival of business, and the encouragement of a judicious political system by which it will be brought about.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} attitudes of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women towards the women's {{movement}} {{in order to discuss}} their lack of participation. Since so many have claimed that <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women are more traditional, the concept of traditional <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women is explored. What {{does it mean to be}} more traditional? The effects class location has on participation in the women's movement will be discussed as an alternative to the idea that <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women are more traditional than middle class women. In doing so, the ways in which class location affects the ideology of its members and how those ideologies differ between middle class feminists and politically active <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women will be explored. In addition, it is hypothesized that there is a structural difference in the level of activity between the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> and the middle class, which ultimately leads to non-participation in the women's movement by <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women. Methodology includes interviews with <b>working</b> <b>class</b> women in the Fall of 1984. Ten women from two <b>working</b> <b>class</b> neighborhoods southwest of Philadelphia were interviewed...|$|R

The {{rest of the}} {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. By 1971, the middle class in Stretford had declined steadily to 14.9% whilst the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> had grown to 31.3% compared to 24% middle <b>class</b> and 26% <b>working</b> <b>class</b> nationally.|$|R
5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E

Hesketh was gradually becoming more interested in the lives and conditions of the <b>working</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{the social}} {{structure}} {{of the city in}} China is changing dramatically. Socio-economic situation of each class has changed greatly, with the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> falling from the upper to the lower social class. It is thought that this transition profoundly influenced the educational achievement of children from <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> In this study, by interview analysis of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> families from the city of Jinan, the possession of various capitals, which including physical, culture and social capitals, and the strategy of education of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> families were described. In addition, the position of each family in the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> was analyzed as well. The results suggested that the lack of capitals influenced the attainment of the children from <b>working</b> <b>class</b> greatly. At the same time, although belonging to the <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> the different social positions of each family also had a big influence on the attainment of the children...|$|R
40|$|My {{contention}} {{within this}} thesis {{is that there}} is an absence of literature on <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls within both the gender and education and social class and education literature. I draw on issues related to girls and education and on more recent issues on boys and education, to deternnine what has been said about <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls. It became apparent that there was very little written on <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls within the body of literature. Then I chose to explore social class and education to find out if <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls are discussed. It was also found that not much had been written on <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls in social class and education literature. In my final chapter I suggest ways to address the absence of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls by recommending some questions that can be addressed In future research, so that a real understanding of what is happening with <b>working</b> <b>class</b> girls within the education system can be achieved...|$|R

5|$|Unemployment {{resulting}} from the Great Depression caused unrest. The industrial growth spurt of the 1930s gradually slowed. The economic conditions of the 1930s contributed {{to the process of}} internal migration from the countryside and smaller towns to the cities, especially Buenos Aires, where there were greater opportunities for employment. The urban <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections. Traditional export agriculture stagnated at the outbreak of World War II and remained sluggish.|$|E
5|$|Wage growth {{beginning}} in 1950 pushed prices up. The inflation rate increased faster, and soon real wages fell. High inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy, {{a cut in}} public expenditures, and increases in taxes and utility prices. Increasing economic wariness as the 1950s progressed {{became one of the}} leading causes for Perón's downfall in the Revolución Libertadora of 1955, as the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> saw their quality of life diminished, thus stripping Perón from a large part of his popular support.|$|E
5|$|After World War I the Liberal Party {{began to}} disintegrate. As the Liberals {{splintered}} Labour emerged {{to become the}} party of progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> of the urban lowlands, {{and as a result}} the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared Bolshevik revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century. With all the main parties committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the National Party of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930. They joined together to form the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934 with the goal of creating an independent Scotland, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.|$|E

50|$|In modern-day America, {{a common}} view among {{some members of}} the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> or less privileged members of the {{statistical}} middle class is that while the professional middle class is paid better, they are less directly involved in the production of goods and services than those of the <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> This difference in pay coupled with the impression that professionals and managers are less hands-on in their work often evokes an image of unearned privilege in the minds of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons. Conversely, the fact that <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons generally work with their hands may lead those of the middle-class to assume that those of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> are incapable of abstract, intellectual reasoning. One must also consider that most professionals tend to work in their fields of interest; thus work may not be as perceived as dreadful and menial by them. For <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons, however, the contrary may be true. This difference in job satisfaction tends to be perceived by <b>working</b> <b>class</b> persons as further proof of unearned privileged among their professional managers, further adding to class tension.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} {{representations of the}} <b>working</b> <b>class</b> in three British films made in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. They are Brassed Off (1996), The Full Monty (1997), and Billy Elliot (2000). Although the films purport to be championing the <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> this dissertation will show how the films are more suited to a middle class audience as the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> is largely portrayed in a negative light. The reason the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> is portrayed in a negative light is so the hierarchical class divides remain in place and the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> are placed {{at the bottom of}} the social pile, subservient to the middle and upper class...|$|R
5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} {{a meeting at}} the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.|$|E
5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{amongst the}} <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> in Glamorgan had grown during the 1820s: although wages were impressive by contemporary standards during good years, they deteriorated quickly during depressions, plunging many into destitution; sanitation and health {{standards in the}} fast-growing industrial communities were appalling, child mortality rates were extremely high. 1831 saw a severe economic depression, with wages falling quickly and food prices rising, and complaints against the local debt courts and their bailiffs were numerous. Nationally, the electoral reform movement was making considerable protests and protests against the Corn Laws—which kept the prices of food high—were growing. In South Wales, several of the major ironmasters were associated with these movements, promoting reform under the Whig administration voted into power between April and June 1831.|$|E
50|$|Bourdieu {{claimed that}} state schools {{are set up}} to make {{everybody}} middle class, although only {{the middle class and}} some high achieving <b>working</b> <b>class</b> have the cultural capital to achieve this.

50|$|Criminal {{activity}} was common in <b>working</b> <b>class</b> demographics. The <b>working</b> <b>class</b> poor used crime to gain power. The police force were an enemy to the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> in Britain. They used oppression against criminals {{to continue to}} hold power and enforce the divisions of class. The police officers are used to enforce social norms that the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> continued to defy in Britain. Social conditions produced by the welfare state made the criminal {{a victim of the}} division of labour in Britain. Characters like Sillitoe's Smith were born into a <b>working</b> <b>class</b> culture that accepted and produced a criminal activity. The welfare state brought down the poverty rate this led the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> to often commit crimes out of choice rather than necessity. Characters like Smith chose to commit crimes to make a statement against the societal norms in Britain during the post-war period.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} recent claims by Jeffrey Smith that: (1) 'hegemonic masculinity' {{is an expression}} of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> counter-school culture; (2) some teachers are 'cultural accomplices' in constructing 'hegemonic masculinities' of anti-school <b>working</b> <b>class</b> boys, thereby contributing to their underachievement; and (3) these 'cultural accomplices' are an emerging response to recent moral panics and neo-liberal managerialism concerned with 'failing boys' at school. It is suggested that 'hegemonic masculinity' is not necessarily associated with anti-school values in <b>working</b> <b>class</b> culture. Many <b>working</b> <b>class</b> boys might subscribe to 'hegemonic masculinity' without rejecting learning. Contrary to Smith's emphasis on how <b>working</b> <b>class</b> culture generates anti-school 'hegemonic masculinity', there is the possibility that 'hegemonic masculinity' is fused with anti-school values produced by organisational differentiation. The continuing commonalities between <b>working</b> <b>class</b> anti-school boys and the 'gender regime' of some secondary schools for over 20 years implies something more enduring at work than recent moral panics...|$|R
5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses {{of the working class}} of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not only did the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the <b>working</b> <b>classes,</b> but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Reform Act 1832 {{increased}} the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was revived. Towards {{the end of the century}} Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included William Gladstone, and the Earl of Rosebery. In the later 19th century the growing importance of the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.|$|E

His task was to set up committees in every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions and sell the idea to the local public. The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees.

50|$|A skinhead is {{a member}} of a {{subculture}} originating among <b>working</b> <b>class</b> youths in London, England in the 1960s that soon spread {{to other parts of the}} United Kingdom, with a second <b>working</b> <b>class</b> skinhead movement spreading worldwide in the 1980s. Motivated by social alienation and <b>working</b> <b>class</b> solidarity, skins are defined by their close-cropped or shaven heads and <b>working</b> <b>class</b> clothing such as Dr. Martens boots, braces, high-ankle straight-leg jeans, and simple shirts.

5|$|While {{policies}} {{were brought in}} to improve the living conditions of the <b>working</b> <b>classes,</b> conversely many middle-class Bolivians {{felt that they had}} seen their social standing decline, with Morales personally mistrusting the middle-classes, deeming them fickle. A 2006 law reallocated state-owned lands, with this agrarian reform entailing distributing land to traditional communities rather than individuals. In 2010, a law was introduced permitting the formation of recognised indigenous territories, although the implementation of this was hampered by bureaucracy and contesting claims over ownership. Morales' regime also sought to improve women's rights in Bolivia. In 2010, it founded a Unit of Depatriarchalization to oversee this process. Further seeking to provide legal recognition and support to LGBT rights, it declared June 28 to be Sexual Minority Rights Day in the country, and encouraged the establishment of a gay-themed television show on the state channel.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s Romanticism was {{superseded}} by new literary styles. The first to appear was Realism, which had among its most notable writers Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis and Raul Pompeia. Newer styles that coexisted with Realism, Naturalism and Parnassianism, were both {{connected to the}} former's evolution. Among the best-known Naturalists were Aluísio Azevedo and Adolfo Caminha. Notable Parnassians were Gonçalves Crespo, Alberto de Oliveira, Raimundo Correia and Olavo Bilac. Brazilian theater became influenced by Realism in 1855, decades earlier than the style's impact upon literature and poetry. Famous Realist playwrights included José de Alencar, Quintino Bocaiuva, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Júlia Lopes de Almeida and Maria Angélica Ribeiro. Brazilian plays staged by national companies competed for audiences alongside foreign plays and companies. Performing arts in Imperial Brazil also encompassed the staging of musical duets, dancing, gymnastics, comedy and farces. Less prestigious, but more popular with the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> were puppeteers and magicians, {{as well as the}} circus, with its travelling companies of performers, including acrobats, trained animals, illusionists and other stunt-oriented artists.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s French sociologists, {{particularly}} {{those interested in}} critical theory, re-examined this historical legacy. The Annales School conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on {{the operation of the}} police, concepts of deviancy and religion. Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the <b>working</b> <b>classes.</b> Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse Lüsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent. This body of work influenced historian Simon Schama's 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille. The Bibliothèque nationale de France held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume summarising the current academic perspectives on the fortress.|$|E

5000|$|According to Marx, {{capitalism}} has critical failings — inner contradictions — {{which lead}} to its downfall. The <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> to which the capitalist class gave birth {{in order to produce}} commodities and profits, is the [...] "grave digger" [...] of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the [...] "unpaid labour of the working class." [...] The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the <b>working</b> <b>class.</b> The <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> to establish its own collective control over production.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} identifies {{strategies that}} schools {{have used to}} raise achievement among white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils in multiracial schools. The methodological approach comprises case studies of schools and focus group interviews to ascertain the views of teachers, parents and children about strategies that worked to raise achievement. The study identifies a number of successful strategies for promoting the achievement of white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils including strong leadership; an inclusive curriculum that {{meets the needs of}} white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils; engaging parents and breaking the cycle of low aspiration; supporting pupils through extensive use of teaching assistants and learning mentors and specific support for language development. The transition between primary and secondary school was also managed carefully so that support for white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils continued in a similar vein. This study also highlights that where achievement for white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> pupils was best, headteachers either had white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> roots themselves or a deep commitment to the issues of white <b>working</b> <b>class</b> communities. There were also many people from the local community working at the case study schools who were role models to children. Implications for policy and practice are given in the final section...|$|R
