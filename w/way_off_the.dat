5|$|During {{his stay}} at the Asian Branch headquarters, Allen's Innocence takes its true form: the , a cape-like Innocence which is armor and has a small claw (allowing Allen to perform new techniques). He rejoins his comrades in Edo, where the group is trapped in Noah's Ark. As they look for a <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Ark, Allen and his friends fight the Noah. In his rematch with Tyki, Allen {{transforms}} his left arm into a sword which exorcises evil (allowing him to win). When Cross appears and saves Allen from Tyki's new Noah appearance, he directs him to restore the falling Ark by playing a piano. Returning to headquarters, Allen learns {{that he is the}} host of the late 14th Noah (Nea), who betrayed the Earl, was killed and was related to Mana. Before his death, Nea implanted his memories in Allen so he would be reborn. All Exorcists are ordered to kill Allen before he begins transforming into a Noah. While Allen controls his body, he begins turning into Nea; Crown Clown's sword hurts him, despite its only affecting Noah and Akuma.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ship. Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield.|$|E
2500|$|In a bid {{to improve}} his bowling, he moved to England for a short stint with Worcestershire in 2006. A left-arm fast-medium bowler, Khan was {{best known for his}} ability to [...] "move <b>the</b> ball both <b>ways</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> wicket and swing the old ball at some pace".

5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} and travel around Sucia Island, a location Barred {{to the members}} of the player character's sect. Whilst searching for a <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> island, the game's ultimate goal, players can form alliances with the island's inhabitants and complete quests through combat or other means. Geneforge is played in 45° axonometric perspective, movement through the game's environs is real-time but switches to turn-based combat in the game's playing field. The game world is divided up into 77 areas accessible through a world map. The first two areas serve as the game's tutorial; introducing players to navigation, controls and shaping creations. Clearing areas by defeating guardians or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing travelling time. The game has an always-visible auto-map, which begins each area completely darkened, and is revealed as the player explores. As the player's party performs tasks or defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and additional skill points. The player character's skill points can be used to increase their statistics or to improve their aptitude in one of the fifteen available skills. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game.|$|E

25|$|Tug CSS Mosher {{pushed a}} fire raft against the {{flagship}} , and was rewarded for her daring by a broadside from the latter that {{sent her to}} the bottom. Hartford, while attempting to avoid the fire raft, ran ashore not far upstream from Fort St. Philip.

40|$|An {{important}} {{question in the}} study of driving anger is whether drivers express anger the same <b>way</b> on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road. With the aim of analyzing the between-group and within-group differences in a heterogeneous sample of 157 drivers divided in high, moderate and low-driving anger, four ways of expressing anger were assessed (verbally, physically, displacedly and adaptatively), both in general and behind the wheel. The between-group results showed that high anger drivers scored higher than low angered in all types of desadaptative expression on the road (η 2 =. 08 -. 16) {{as well as in the}} physical (η 2 =. 06) and displaced (η 2 =. 10) <b>ways</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road. The within-group comparisons evidenced high equivalence in each of the three groups about the preference of anger expressions on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road, concluding the apparent equivalence of the behavior in all the contexts. Clinical and road safety implications are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Mutai won {{his first}} World Marathon Major event in April 2011, taking the title at the 2011 London Marathon with a course record and new {{personal}} best time of 2:04:40. This made him the fourth fastest runner ever over the distance. He {{was one of the}} favourites for the Great North Run, but it was half marathon specialist Martin Mathathi who took the honours and Mutai finished in third. His next major race was the 2011 New York City Marathon and his time of 2:06:28 hours was faster than the course record, although he was second place to Geoffrey Mutai. He attempted to defend his title at the 2012 London Marathon, but ended up in seventh some <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> winner Wilson Kipsang. Following the injury of Moses Mosop, he was drafted into the Kenyan Olympic marathon team as a replacement.|$|E
25|$|The battle went on {{for some}} time with no clear victor, but the Syracusans {{eventually}} pushed the Athenian ships toward the coast, and the Athenian crews fled to the camp behind their wall. Demosthenes suggested that they man the ships again and attempt to force their way out, as now both fleets had lost about half their ships and Nicias agreed. The men themselves did not want to board the ship because they were afraid. They then decided to retreat by land. Hermocrates sent some supposed informers to the Athenians to falsely report that there were spies and roadblocks further inland, so the Athenians would be safer if they did not march away. Gylippus used this delay to build the roadblocks that did not yet exist, and the Syracusans burned or towed away the Athenian ships on the beach, so that they had no <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E
25|$|The {{team won}} their first game in 1953, against Murray State, and lost the {{rest for a}} record of 1–7. One {{of the most memorable}} games of the season came in a 59–6 loss against Tennessee. Unitas {{completed}} 9 of 19 passes for 73 yards, rushed 9 times for 52 yards, returned 6 kickoffs for eighty-five yards, 1 punt for three yards, and had 86 percent of the team's tackles. The only touchdown the team scored was in the fourth quarter when Unitas made a fake pitch to the running back and ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Unitas was hurt later in the fourth quarter while trying to run the ball. On his <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field, he received a standing ovation. When he got to the locker room he was so worn that his jersey and shoulder pads had to be cut off because he could not lift his arms. Louisville ended the season with a 20–13 loss to Eastern Kentucky. In his junior year, Unitas completed 49 of 95 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E

The first wave hit the beach near Agnone, about [...] from the bridge, at 22:00 hours and took fire from the Italian defenders almost immediately. Under the leadership of Durnford-Slater, Young and Lieutenant George Herbert, all experienced combat officers, the Commandos eventually managed to fight their <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> beach and push inland. The second wave followed a few hours later, also under fire, and despite {{one of the eight}} landing craft running aground on some rocks, most of the men were also able to get off the beach.|$|E

500|$|The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck {{stationed}} a lifeboat at Portland in 1826, {{which was}} withdrawn in 1851. Coastal flooding has affected Portland's residents and transport for centuries—the only <b>way</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> island by land is along the causeway in {{the lee of}} Chesil Beach. At times of extreme floods (about every 10 years) this road link is cut by floods. The low-lying village of Chiswell used to flood on average every 5 years. Chesil Beach occasionally faces severe storms and massive waves, which have a fetch across the Atlantic Ocean. Following two severe flood events in the 1970s, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Wessex Water decided to investigate the structure of the beach, and coastal management schemes that could be built to protect Chiswell and the beach road. In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to protect against a one-in-five-year storm would be practicable; it would reduce flood depth and duration in more severe storms. Hard engineering techniques were employed in the scheme, including a gabion running [...] to the north of Chiswell, an extended sea wall in Chesil Cove, and a culvert running from inside the beach, underneath the beach road and into Portland Harbour, to divert flood water away from low-lying areas.|$|E
