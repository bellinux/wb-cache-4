This {{typically}} takes tens of minutes. The part will shrink on cooling, coming away from the mold, and facilitating easy removal of the part. The cooling rate must be kept within a certain range. Very rapid cooling (for example, water spray) would result in cooling and shrinking at an uncontrolled rate, producing a <b>warped</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E

40|$|Some of {{the global}} aspects of the H I {{distribution}} in M 31 are discussed {{on the basis of}} the high-resolution survey of the 21 -cm line made with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope by Brinks and Shane (1984). The morphology of the H I kinematics and structure in M 31 can be modelled by a flat disk extending over the region at R < 16 kpc, and, at larger radii, a flaring warped gas distribution. The scale height of the gas in the <b>warped</b> <b>part</b> of M 31 increases approximately linearly with radius to a maximum scale height of about 1. 7 kpc. The maximum deviation of the warp from the plane of the extended inner disk is about 3. 8 kpc. These and other parameters of the warp in M 31 are similar to those in our Galaxy. The H I mass in the disk is about 2. 4 ?? 109 M_sun;; the H I mass in the warp is about 1. 5 ?? 109 M_sun;. As in our Galaxy, the flaring gas layer and the rather flat rotation curve in the regions of M 31 require that the total mass there resides in a halo. The 2 ??-symmetry and the general regularity of the warp in M 31 argue against it being a consequence of interaction with the small elliptical companion M 32...|$|E

40|$|Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) {{escaping}} {{away from}} the Galactic halo are dynamical products of interactions of stars with the massive black hole(s) (MBH) in the Galactic Center (GC). They are mainly B-type stars with their progenitors unknown. OB stars are also populated in the GC, with many being hosted in a clockwise-rotating young stellar (CWS) disk within half a parsec from the MBH and their formation remaining puzzles. In this paper, we demonstrate that HVSs can well memorize the injecting directions of their progenitors using both analytical arguments and numerical simulations, i. e., the ejecting direction of an HVS is almost anti-parallel to the injecting direction of its progenitor. Therefore, the spatial distribution of HVSs maps the spatial distribution of the parent population of their progenitors directly. We also find that almost all the discovered HVSs are spatially consistent with being located on two thin disk planes. The orientation of one plane is consistent {{with that of the}} (inner) CWS disk, which suggests that most of the HVSs originate from the CWS disk or a previously existed disk-like stellar structure with an orientation similar to it. The rest of HVSs may be correlated with the plane of the northern arm of the mini-spiral in the GC or the plane defined by the outer <b>warped</b> <b>part</b> of the CWS disk. Our results not only support the GC origin of HVSs but also imply that the central disk (or the disk structure with a similar orientation) should persist or be frequently rejuvenated over the past 200 Myr, which adds a new challenge to the stellar disk formation and provides insights to the longstanding problem of gas fueling into massive black holes.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} 3 D shape modeling to plan reconstructive facial surgery for children born with facial asymmetry. The study used 3 D images synthesized from high resolution CT scans. The images were manipulated using geometric morphometrics and the principal components of variation were derived. The software developed allows the user to either reconstruct how the whole face would appear without the presence of asymmetry, or to restrict the reconstruction to a smaller region that is surgically feasible to alter. The software aims to allow several observers to <b>warp</b> <b>parts</b> of the face along the principal components of variation until the most aesthetic result is achieved. The subjective assessment of an aesthetic result will be judged by surgeons and non surgeons. Having attained the optimum warp the type and amount of tissue required for surgery can be derived...|$|R
