5000|$|The old steppe was Asian and stateless; {{the current}} one was state-determined and claimed for European-Russian civilization. The world of {{comparison}} was now even more obviously that of the Western empires. Consequently {{it was all the}} more clear that the Russian empire merited its own New Russia to go along <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else's</b> New Spain, New France, and New England. The adoption of the name of New Russia was in fact the most powerful statement imaginable of Russia's national coming of age.|$|R
25|$|With {{the changes}} taking place on Britain's {{railways}} in the 1990s, the outlook changed for preserved diesel locomotives. In British Rail days no privately owned diesel locomotives were allowed to operate on its tracks. With privatisation came open-access railways—the track and infrastructure were {{owned and operated by}} Railtrack, who for a fee would allow approved locomotives and trains to operate on their track. Suddenly, the owners of preserved locomotives were on an equal footing <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> In fact, the characteristics of the Deltic locomotives, powerful and capable of cruising at , enabled them to fit more easily onto the modern rail network than other, slower, preserved diesels.|$|E
25|$|During this era, the Portuguese popularised {{the term}} Nair, {{referring}} {{to all of}} the locals who fought along with them as Nayari or Nayar, irrespective of strata or caste. The name Nayar existed prior to this merely as a title dispensed by kings to some families who had excelled in military matters. Those families, along <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> involved in the military, were known as Lokar. Other than this limited use of the Nayar title and the general use of Lokar to describe an occupational group, there is no certainty as to what the various castes which are now categorised as Nairs were called prior to the arrival of the Portuguese.|$|E

Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six months had given part of his ration {{and a piece of}} bread to Levi without asking for anything in return.

25|$|Interactions between {{ethnic groups}} in formal {{settings}} can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, a political scientist, who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed. She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to treat each other with respect, {{making it easier for}} individuals belonging to the minority group to reach out and form relationships <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.|$|E

Waiting gods such as Brahma and Indra were unable to trace the path Krishna took to leave his human incarnation and return to his abode.|$|E

500|$|Television critics scribed mostly {{positive}} {{reviews for}} [...] "Stowaway". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting {{in response to}} it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't {{know if she was}} planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E

The music is very good and there are moments that feel inspired by other acts like Kutless or Tenth Avenue North, among others, but theres also little here that actually screams, [...] "Ah, this is The Museum!" [...] Hopefully in subsequent releases, The Museum can better define their own sound and create a record that fits in <b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>elses</b> while still maintaining a distinct identity.
