Sustenance <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> employed chiefly for on-site preparation, road construction, foundation excavation, clearing timber from the reservoir basin, and on some concreting operations. Skilled <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> required on the dam for fixing the formwork where the concrete was poured. These <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> probably employed at normal day labour rates, the main employment method used on the project. Bulk handling of cement was also used {{for the first time in}} Australia, this saw a significant saving as opposed to bagged cement which was the standard practice of the day.|$|E

Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while offshore, <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1980s and {{increased}} prosperity on the mainland, Chinese domestic <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> dominant. Until the 1990s, workers then came {{primarily from the}} Philippines; the percentage is now shifting from Philippine workers to Indonesian and other nationalities. During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed the Filipino model of labour export to deal with domestic economic crises, and Hong Kong families began hiring workers from those countries as well. The Indonesians provided competition, since those <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> often prepared to accept half the minimum wage.|$|E

5000|$|Wages: In capitalism, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> rewarded {{according}} to their contract with their employer. Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> paid for precisely {{the value of their}} services. In reality, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference forming profit for the employer. In this sense, all paid employment is exploitation and the <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> [...] "alienated" [...] from their work. Insofar as the profit-motive drives the market, it <b>is</b> impossible for <b>workers</b> to <b>be</b> paid for the full value of their labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.|$|R

5|$|Security {{measures}} included Turkish war {{ships and}} Turkish commandos in rubber boats patrolling the Bosporus, AWACS surveillance planes and F-16 warplanes circling {{above the city}} in order to monitor a no-fly zone over the city, and the assignment of 23,000 to 24,000 police officers, supported by police helicopters and armoured vehicles. The Bosphorus Strait was also closed to oil tankers, the underground rail system was suspended and whole city districts were sealed off. Nevertheless, a small bomb or explosive devise blew up on an empty Turkish Airlines plane on June 29 as <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> cleaning it at the main Istanbul airport. Three of the <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> slightly injured.|$|E
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. <b>Workers</b> <b>were</b> soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E
50|$|<b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> more {{related to}} their own sons than to the queen's sons. However, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> more related to the queen's sons than sons of other <b>workers.</b> This <b>is</b> because swarm-founding colonies are {{typically}} large and have multiple queens, making workers more related to queens than other workers. Because {{of the difference in}} degree of relatedness, a <b>worker</b> would <b>be</b> more inclined to care for the queen’s sons than to a son of another worker. Worker policing effectively preserves the collective interests of the colony by controlling the production of males within a colony and limiting male production to only the queen. Another situation of <b>worker</b> policing <b>is</b> found in cyclical oligogyny, where males are only produced when there are multiple queens in the colony and <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> equally related to males and females. Workers typically participate in worker policing when the degree of relatedness between <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> relatively low.|$|R

5|$|The {{massacre}} at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, {{though there were}} incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> driven out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.|$|E
5|$|A {{major change}} {{was made in}} the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of their normal earnings.|$|E

Unsurprisingly, urban <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> on average more educated than migrants, with the difference in years of education being particularly large for the stayers of the two samples. It is also noteworthy that displaced workers on average have the least education whether we look at migrants or urban residents.|$|R
5|$|By mid 1916, the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly pressing for the German army. With the appointment of Erich Ludendorff to commander of the General Staff, the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL), in August 1916, the German administration began actively considering the idea of forcibly deporting Belgian workers to Germany to resolve the problem. The policy, encouraged by {{the high levels of}} unemployment in occupied Belgium, marked a wider turn towards more oppressive rule by the German administration. The deportation begun in October 1916 and lasted until March 1917. In all, as many as 120,000 workers had been deported to Germany {{by the end of the}} war. Of these, around 2,500 died from the poor conditions in which the <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> held. In addition, in the Staging Zone, around 62,000 <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> conscripted as forced labour on local military projects in poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E
