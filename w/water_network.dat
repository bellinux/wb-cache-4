5|$|Aleppo {{underwent}} major {{transformations in}} the Ayyubid period, specifically {{during the reign}} of az-Zahir Ghazi. Ayyubid architectural achievements focused on four areas: the citadel, the waterworks, fortifications, and the extramural developments. The total rebuilding of the city enclosure began when az-Zahir Ghazi removed the vallum of Nur ad-Din—which by then outlived its temporary need—and rebuilt the northern and northwestern walls—the most susceptible to outside attack—from Bab al-Jinan to Bab al-Nasr. He parceled out the building of the towers on this stretch of the wall to his princes and military officers; each tower was identified with a particular prince who inscribed his name into it. Later, az-Zahir Ghazi extended the eastern wall to the south and east, reflecting his desire to incorporate a dilapidated fortress, Qala'at al-Sharif, outside the city into Aleppo's enclosure. Bab Qinnasrin was completely rebuilt by an-Nasir Yusuf in 1256. This gate stands today as a masterpiece of medieval Syrian military architecture. Cumulatively, Ayyubid architecture left a lasting impression in Aleppo. The citadel was rebuilt, the <b>water</b> <b>network</b> was expanded, and streets and quarters were provided fountains and baths. In addition, dozens of shrines, mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums were built throughout the city.|$|E

The northern boundary consists of the mountains of Los Gigantes, and the southern boundary of the northern portion of the Sierra de Comechingones, with the Summits of Achala located in the central area of the region. It is a rugged area, whose small plains and low slopes are responsible for its classification as 'plains'. These slopes and plains allowed for the formation of an intricate underground <b>water</b> <b>network</b> that supplies a great number of springs. Within this region, there are numerous deep ravines with vertical walls between 600m and 800m high, many of which are more than 1,000m wide.

Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.|$|E
40|$|Potable <b>water</b> {{distribution}} <b>networks</b> (WDNs) {{and wastewater}} collection networks (WWCNs) {{are the two}} fundamental constituents of the complex urban water infrastructure.

Consequently, proper optimization methodologies are required to reduce the associated capital cost while also meeting the demands of acquiring clean water and releasing wastewater by consumers. In this paper, a systematic review of the optimization of both WDNs and WWCNs, from the preliminary stages of development through to the state-of-the-art, is jointly presented. First, both WDNs and WWCNs are conceptually and functionally described along with illustrative benchmarks. The optimization of <b>water</b> <b>networks</b> across both clean and waste domains is then systematically reviewed and organized, covering all levels of complexity from the formulation of cost functions and constraints, through to traditional and advanced optimization methodologies.
