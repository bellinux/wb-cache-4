50|$|The broader {{impact is}} an {{assessment}} of value through use, i.e. {{the extent to which}} research <b>is</b> <b>successfully</b> applied - that is recognition by qualified end-users that quality research has <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> applied.|$|R
30|$|In access mode, the {{secondary}} packet is transmitted {{along with the}} retransmission of the primary packet. Thus {{the secondary}} packet <b>is</b> <b>successfully</b> received at SR if R 3 i[*]>[*]Rs. The secondary packet <b>is</b> <b>successfully</b> decoded at SR if R 3 i[*]>[*]Rs and R 4 [*]>[*]Rp. Regardless whether the secondary packet <b>is</b> <b>successfully</b> decoded at SR or not, the system turns into cooperation mode and SR resets NC to zero.|$|R

An engine test facility is being built at Westcott and if all goes to plan, the first ground-based engine tests could happen in 2020, and Skylon could be performing unmanned test flights by 2025.|$|E
5|$|Building on Champollion's grammar, {{his student}} Karl Richard Lepsius {{continued}} {{to develop the}} decipherment, realizing in contrast to Champollion that vowels were not written. Lepsius became the most important champion of Champollion's work.

As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws.

5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds.

5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae <b>was</b> <b>successfully</b> evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E
