2500|$|Beckham {{was born}} at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England. He {{is the son of}} Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan [...] "Ted" [...] Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, July–September 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of Hackney in 1969. He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He {{regularly}} played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County High School. In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, [...] "At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What {{do you want to do}} when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do." [...] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as [...] "half Jewish" [...] and wrote in his autobiography [...] "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion". In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.|$|E

Every half an hour or so she would say, "Go on, tell me, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> do?" It's funny how people come up with the same joke, and then think {{it is the first time}} you have ever heard it: "I suppose it's a load of balls then. ...|$|R

I shall {{take care not to}} let you out of my sight, and if when we get there I find that this is any part of one of your confounded conspiracies you will find that the {{penalties}} for this sort of thing in England are pretty severe. However, no doubt you are well aware of that. The question is this. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want from me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered. [...] "You see, it's {{impossible}} to prove anything. After all, when one looks the thing {{squarely in the}} face, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> see and feel sure of? Why, just five natives looking down at you in the crater, on the very eve of a serious outbreak of the volcano. Well, nobody's bound to risk his life to rescue a stranger from the jaws of an eruption. As to the mask, the less said about that the better. People won't believe you: they'll say it's impossible. I believe you, because I understand Hawaiians down to the very ground: I know how skin-deep their civilization goes: but folks who don't, will think you're romancing. Besides, Kalaua wouldn't like it, of course. It's bad form to be a heathen in Hawaii. Whatever the natives may be in their own hearts, in their outer lives they prefer to be considered civilized Christians. There's nothing riles your true-born Hawaiian like a public imputation of cannibalism or heathendom." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'When we had quarrels--which we should, as we {{are both}} human--they wouldn't be {{over and done with}} in an hour. They would stick in your mind and rankle, because, you see, they might be proofs that I didn't really love you. And then when I seemed happy with you, you would wonder if I was acting. I know all this sounds morbid and exaggerated, but it isn't. What have you got to go on, as regards me? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> know of me? If {{something}} like this had happened after we had been married half a dozen years and really knew each other, we could laugh at it. But we are strangers. We came together and loved each other because there was something in each of us which attracted the other. We took that little something as a foundation and built on it. But what has happened has knocked away our poor little foundation. That's all. We don't really know anything at all about each other for certain. It's just guesswork.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Browning came to {{the rescue}} of the fiery old gentleman, and helped by Seymour Kirkup put him under very {{definite}} obligations by a course of very generous conduct. He was fully repaid in his own mind for his trouble by the mere presence and friendship of Landor, for whose quaint and volcanic personality he had a vast admiration, compounded of the pleasure of the artist in an oddity and of the man in a hero. It is somewhat amusing and characteristic that Mrs. Browning did not share this unlimited enjoyment of the company of Mr. Landor, and expressed her feelings in her own humorous manner. She writes, [...] "Dear, darling Robert amuses me by talking of his gentleness and sweetness. A most courteous and refined gentleman he is, of course, and very affectionate to Robert (as he ought to be), but of self-restraint he has not a grain, and of suspicion many grains. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> say to dashing down a plate on the floor when you don't like what's on it? Robert succeeded in soothing him, and the poor old lion is very quiet on the whole, roaring softly to beguile the time in Latin alcaics against his wife and Louis Napoleon." ...|$|E

"A common {{assumption}} is that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to induce a sense of flow is purely a personal issue, and ultimately <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> doesn’t <b>really</b> matter. <b>What</b> matters is the fact of psychological flow.

She related to Business Week that her choice to leave Kraft was based on a number of reasons. She had had a goal of retiring before age 50; she had dealt with the recent illness and death of her parents, some close friends and relatives. 'To be honest, I still haven't figured it out. ... It was definitely not dissatisfaction. It was stepping back and saying, [...] "What are you really here for? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to accomplish?"' She spent two years reconnecting with friends and family and delving into community work. Her charitable work included work with a number of organizations, including the Executive Leadership Council, a non-profit group of high-level African-American leaders in business, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and the United Way, among others.

5000|$|Kelly McGonigal defines willpower as [...] "the {{ability to}} <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to <b>do</b> when part of <b>you</b> <b>really</b> doesn’t {{want to do}} it." [...] It {{consists}} of three competing elements: 1) I will - the ability to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need to do; 2) I won’t - {{the other side of}} self-control; the inability to resist temptation; and 3) I want - your true want, the ability to remember the big picture of your life. Willpower is a resource that gets depleted, particularly when you are rundown or hungry. However, you may increase your capacity for willpower by engaging in activities such as mindfulness, meditation and exercise and/or by ensuring good nutrition and adequate sleep.|$|R
5000|$|McGonigal defines willpower as [...] "the {{ability to}} <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to <b>do</b> when part of <b>you</b> <b>really</b> doesn’t {{want to do}} it", and says that humans {{experience}} conflicts between impulse and self-control in personal and social contexts, giving examples such as: craving for sweet foods, the urge to be sarcastic or complaining, {{and the desire to}} procrastinate. Humans have evolved adaptations to control their instincts and successfully resist impulsive drives, because living in groups requires self-control and this—McGonigal says—means taking the harder option. According to McGonigal, willpower failure or success can spread through a group, because humans tend to mirror the behavior of those they are socially connected with.|$|R

As the steward of my university’s assessment program, I enjoy inquiring from such people what they seek in their new employees— that is, I seek to assess their employment goals—mostly with the hope of helping to inform my own university about external expec-tations, and maybe even to improve its performance with respect to them.

60|$|The {{point is}} here. If a child {{makes you so}} that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to spank it soundly, then soundly spank the brat.

The flashing interchange of anger between parent and child {{is part of the}} responsible relationship, necessary to growth. Again, if a child offends you deeply, so that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> can't communicate with it any more, then, while the hurt is deep, switch off your connection from the child, cut off your correspondence, your vital communion, and be alone. But never persist in such a state beyond the time when your deep hurt dies down. The only rule is, <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really,</b> impulsively, wish to do. But always act on your own responsibility sincerely. And have the courage of your own strong emotion. They enrichen the child's soul.|$|R
