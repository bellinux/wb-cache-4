Soldiers mustering for the Spanishâ€“American War were encouraged by 40,000 visitors and 500 soldiers took ill from the exposure. By {{the turn of the}} century, resentment of the newest immigrants began to take hold. Henry A. Castle wrote that the earliest immigrants, primarily from the British Isles, Germany, Scandinavia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France easily reached the standards expected of them. In contrast, by the 1880s, most new immigrants were unskilled workers from southern Europe, eastern Europe, and Russia. He described them as illiterate, unable to be assimilated into the city's culture, and often without families. He said they drained the economy by <b>working</b> <b>here</b> and sending money back to their homelands.|$|E
25|$|In February 1985, Tony secures {{himself a}} job renovating The Queen Victoria public house {{and gives the}} {{unemployed}} Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) a job as his aid. It is whilst he is <b>working</b> <b>here</b> that Tony gains {{the interest of the}} married landlady Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Angie has grown tired of her cheating husband, Den (Leslie Grantham), and whilst he is away on a holiday in Spain with his lover, Angie seduces Tony and the two embark on an affair. Tony takes the relationship seriously, but Angie is only using him to get back at Den and make him jealous. The affair is conducted in secret, but after Angie initiates a kiss in The Vic with Tony, she is caught by her daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean). Angie is forced to use bribery in order to keep her daughter from informing her husband, and even informs her about Den's current infidelity. Upon Den's return Angie calls off the affair but it isn't long before Sharon tells her father that Angie has been unfaithful. Unfortunately for Angie, Den cares more about his reputation than her and tells her that he doesn't care about the affair, so long as it is done discreetly. Tony is very hurt by the whole ordeal, but he is even more concerned for his own safety, should Den find out that it was him his wife was seeing. Fortunately for Tony his identity is never disclosed.|$|E
