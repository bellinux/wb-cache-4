In Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway, Ronald Berman compares Hemingway's treatment of landscape {{with that of the}} post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne. During a 1949 interview, Hemingway told Lillian Ross that he learned from Cézanne how to [...] "make a landscape." [...] In comparing writing to painting he told her, [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do in writing, this and this, and woods, and the rocks we have to climb over." [...] The landscape is seen subjectively—the viewpoint of the observer is paramount. To Jake, landscape [...] "meant a search for a solid form.... not existentially present in [...] life in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do for ourselves by the single {{fact that we have}} no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E

Samuel L. Jackson, who appeared as Nick Fury in the two previous Captain America films, said he was [...] "surprised" [...] to discover {{that he would not}} be in Captain America: Civil War, after [...] "the Russo Brothers told [...] was." [...] Moore stated that Fury was not included [...] "because he didn't add anything to the Civil War story they were telling", while Markus stated that they did not want him to choose any particular side because [...] "that's not his place in the universe". On each of the character's ties to the plot, Anthony Russo said that each character was examined on a personal level to see how they would respond to the idea of registration. On the portrayal of each character, Joe Russo said that he and his brother had strong [...] "emotional" [...] and [...] "psychological connection to [...] characters" [...] as children, adding, [...] "We want to reach into that and understand what elementally motivated you to love the character.

To turn our backs thereon wilfully and without cause, is the real unforgiveable sin against the Spirit. At least that is the best definition of the problem at which I in my simplicity can arrive.|$|E
