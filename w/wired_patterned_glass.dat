Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Pyrex glass were {{used to make the}} microthermostat, because PDMS is a cheap and mass-producible material and both PDMS and glass have very good biocompatibility compared to the more commonly used silicon. A heater made of Au <b>wiring</b> <b>patterned</b> on Pyrex <b>glass</b> was used to control the temperature. A PDMS replica molding technique was used to fabricate a reaction chamber with 3. 6 μl capacity. Restriction enzyme digestion was performed by using the fabricated microthermostat and by a conventional method. Then, using gel electrophoresis, we compared results between the microthermostat and conventional methods. It was found that restriction enzyme digestion using the microthermostat required 5 min of heating...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide greater meaning and {{significance}} to wire glass {{so that it}} may be preserved by exploring the historical origins and complexity of manufacture of the medium. The Industrial Revolution was a period of amazing evolution in the history of glass manufacture. Plate glass technology allowed for new design and building construction concepts, including the Crystal Palace, but this was an imperfect technology. As the brilliant minds of the Revolution struggled to grapple with the obstacles posed by plate glass, wire glass was eventually born. This new glass type spread across the United States in subsequent years, fueled by uniform manufacture standards on the city and state levels and the American mass media’s coverage of conflagrations, which led to the public’s association of wire glass with safety given its fire retardant and shatterproof qualities. Wire glass was technically incredibly difficult to produce, especially in mass production, and although inventors experimented with various treatments and <b>patterns,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> remained and was comparatively expensive (though people generally believed the safety benefits outweighed the costs). Wire glass fell into disfavor during the World Wars as it was replaced by newer types of glass that were more economical, but recent trends have sparked renewed interest in the use and hence preservation of wire glass. Original methods of wire glass manufacture using early <b>wire</b> netting <b>patterns</b> no longer exist, and so current methods of preservation and conservation involving replication through glass lamination methods using imported wire nettings and salvage are discussed. Possible conservation treatments for repair are debated and further research is concluded...|$|R

The study at hand is proposed {{to provide a}} new method and to introduce procedure {{to the design of}} <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> for a car seat heater for Kongsberg Automotive, KA. KA is a Norwegian company and a global provider of engineering, design, and manufacture for seat comfort, driver and motion control systems, fluid assemblies, and industrial driver interface products. The method that currently is used in the company to create a <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> is neither sufficient enough nor automated. In order to design the <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern,</b> at first procedure is handled by the designer. Secondly, car seat heater 2 D layout is imported and then, the dimensions of the elements are defined as constraints. Then VBA codes are opened and the program is run. The result will be a <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> in different 2 D layouts. To make the design process easier, we have modeled five different layouts; <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> of one element, two elements, three elements, five elements (with two back sides) and one element trapezoidal 2 D layout. The algorithm written in VBA (Visual basic for application) creates the pattern according to the dimensions of the elements which are used as inputs to define constrained parameters.

Whereas reducing energy consumptions is very crucial today, this article employs <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> technology which incorporates linear patterns throughout the exterior surface of glass to attenuate the solar {{effect on the}} interior thermal field based on theoretical and experimental studies. By periodically imposing linearly three-dimensional patterns over the outer surface of window glass, the analytical {{results indicate that the}} interior solar heat is able to be reduced, as the surface patterns increase the incident angle and/or decrease the solar energy loading on the <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> material. Moreover, the interior solar heat can be strongly affected by the pattern design. According to thermally measured results, the trapezoidal <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> having 3 -mm-top-edged patterned members yields lower temperature on the interior surface of glass comparing with that for the trapezoidal patterns having 6 -mm-top edges. Therefore, making the least non-sloped feature or flat plane appearing on the <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> helps decrease the interior temperature resulting from solar energy...|$|R

40|$|Neuronal {{networks}} are specified by unique <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns,</b> however, {{it is not}} clear how these patterns are encoded into topographic maps of synaptic connections. We found networks in vitro and in vivo, where multiple-neurites converge and intersect at single sites non-randomly. At these sites, the density and activity of axonal terminals increased exponentially with the number of converging neurites. Multiple-neurite intersections were formed by a directed growth of neurites toward neurite intersections, they facilitated target switching by axons, and their frequency was elevated by activity through NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. Thus, clustering and strengthening of synaptic connections by activity-reinforced multiple-neurite convergence may serve to imprint information onto <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> and synaptic maps...|$|R

40|$|Glazing energy {{resulting}} from solar radiation {{can be the}} main source to vary the thermal field inside of a building. As the glass material is loaded by intensive solar radiation, the glazing energy, greatly induced, {{will result in the}} drastic increase in interior temperatures and yield the energy demand for air conditioning loads. Reducing energy consumption is imperative; therefore, this article presents the <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> technology which incorporates linearly and uniaxially symmetric patterns throughout the exterior surface of glass to attenuate the solar energy entering indoors. By imposing the <b>patterns</b> over the <b>glass</b> surface, the glazing energy can be reduced due to the increase in the incident angle and the decrease in the solar energy loading on the glass. The thermal performance of the linearly <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> is evaluated by computational fluid dynamics technique. Based on computational fluid dynamics–evaluated results, as the <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> is applied on the window opening, the interior solar heat is able to be decreased. Moreover, the glazing energy can be strongly associated with the pattern design. Increasing the patterned angle and decreasing the patterned space help reduce solar effect on the interior temperatures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{mammalian}} brain, {{form and}} motion are processed through two distinct pathways at {{early stages of}} visual processing. However, recent evidence suggests that these two pathways may interact. Here we used dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns,</b> which have been previously shown to create the perception of coherent motion in humans, despite containing no motion coherence. <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> are static stimuli that consist of randomly positioned dot pairs that are integrated spatially to create the perception of a global form, whereas dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> consist of several independently generated static <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> presented sequentially. In the current study, we measured the detection threshold of five types of dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> and compared the rank order of the detection thresholds with those found for static <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> and real motion patterns (using random dot stimuli). With both the static <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> and dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns,</b> detection thresholds were lowest for concentric and radial patterns and highest for horizontal patterns. We also found that vertical patterns were better detected than horizontal patterns, consistent with prior evidence of a “horizontal effect” {{in the perception of}} natural scene images. With real motion, detection thresholds were equivalent across all patterns, with the exception of higher thresholds for spiral patterns. Our results suggest that dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> are processed primarily as form prior to input into the motion system...|$|R

40|$|Across {{the nervous}} system, neurons form highly stereotypic {{patterns}} of synaptic connections {{that are designed}} to serve specific functions. Mature <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> are often attained upon the refinement of early, less precise connectivity. Much work has led to the prevailing view that many developing circuits are sculpted by activity-dependent competition among converging afferents, which results in the elimination of unwanted synapses and the maintenance and strengthening of desired connections. Studies of the vertebrate retina, however, have recently revealed that activity can play a role in shaping developing circuits without engaging competition among converging inputs that differ in their activity levels. Such neurotransmission-mediated processes can produce stereotypic <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> by promoting selective synapse formation rather than elimination. We discuss how the influence of transmission may also be limited by circuit design and further highlight the importance of transmission beyond development in maintaining wiring specificity and synaptic organization of neural circuits...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the design and}} fabrication of transparent atom chips for atomic physics experiments. A fabrication process was developed to define the <b>wire</b> <b>patterns</b> on a transparent glass substrate to create the desired magnetic field for atom trapping experiments. An area on the chip was reserved for the optical access, so that the laser light can penetrate directly through the glass substrate for the laser cooling process. Furthermore, since the thermal conductivity of the glass substrate is poorer than other common materials for atom chip substrate, for example silicon, silicon carbide, aluminum nitride. Thus, heat dissipation copper blocks are designed {{on the front and}} back of the glass substrate to improve the electrical current conduction. The testing results showed that a maximum burnout current of 2 A was measured from the <b>wire</b> <b>pattern</b> (with a width of 100 μm and a height of 20 μm) without any heat dissipation design and it can increase to 2. 5 A with a heat dissipation design on the front side of the atom chips. Therefore, heat dissipation copper blocks were designed and fabricated {{on the back of the}} glass substrate just under the <b>wire</b> <b>patterns</b> which increases the maximum burnout current to 4. 5 A. Moreover, a maximum burnout current of 6 A was achieved when the entire backside glass substrate was recessed and a thicker copper block was electroplated, which meets most requirements of atomic physics experiments...|$|R
