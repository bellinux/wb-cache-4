The friction at play in the balanced-flow models is the one exerted by the roughness of the Earth's surface on the air moving higher above. For simplicity, <b>we</b> <b>here</b> assume that the frictional force (per unit mass) adjusts to the parcel's speed proportionally through a constant coefficient of friction K. In more realistic conditions, the dependence of friction on the speed is non-linear except for slow laminar flows.|$|E

The university opened with three houses: 86 St Stephen's Green, which was known as St Patrick's or University House, under the care of The Rev. Michael Flannery; 16 Harcourt Street, known as St Lawrence's under the care of The Rev. James Quinn, who also had his school there; and Newman's own house, 6 Harcourt Street, known as St Mary's under Newman's personal supervision.|$|E
