40|$|To {{summarize}} {{staff work}} {{to revisit the}} technical basis of the Pressurized Thermal Shock Rule and describe the staff's intended approach to reassess the rule's <b>screening</b> <b>criterion.</b> BACKGROUND: In the late 1970 s, the staff identified an issue concerning the integrity of embrittled pressurized water reactor (PWR) pressure vessels that involved a rapid cooldown of the inside wall of the vessel, accompanied by either sustained high reactor coolant system pressure or a subsequent repressurization of the system. The identification of this issue, termed pressurized thermal shock (PTS), resulted {{in the development of}} a proposed rule. This proposed rule was provided to the Commission in SECY- 82 - 465 (Pressurized Thermal Shock) and received subsequent Commission approval. The Pressurized Thermal Shock Rule, 10 CFR 50. 61, was established in 1983 as an adequate protection rule. The rule included a specified numerical value of a materials parameter (RT PTS) which would be used as a <b>screening</b> <b>criterion,</b> above which licensees would be required to demonstrate that their pressure vessels could be operated safely (Section 2 of the attachment summarizes key elements of the rule). RT PTS is a measure of the material toughness of the vessel at the end of its licensed life and the ability of the vessel materials to withstand a PTS event. The <b>screening</b> <b>criterion</b> (i. e., acceptable value of RTPTS) was set, in part, based on judgements regarding what frequency of vessel failure due to PTS was acceptable.

Although both the inner product and the correlation coefficient can reflect the relevancy, but in some cases, for the same signal and sensing matrix, the atoms they selected are different, just as the following example: There are two atoms X=(1, 2, 3), Y=(2, 2, 3), signal Z=(4, 5, 6), after normalizing them, we can get X∗,Y∗, and Z∗. If we use the inner product as <b>screening</b> <b>criterion</b> of atoms, the inner product of X∗ and Z∗ is 0.975 and the inner product of Y∗ and Z∗ is 0.995.The most matched atoms should be Y∗. However, when the correlation coefficient is used as <b>screening</b> <b>criterion</b> of atoms, the correlation coefficient of X∗ and Z∗ is 1 and the correlation coefficient of Y∗ and Z∗ is 0.866. The most matched atoms should be X∗. The results are different using two criterions. Then which one is better? To solve this problem, we need to analyze the process of signal reconstruction.|$|R

From Sept. 1990 onwards, this algorithm and <b>screening</b> <b>criterion</b> have been brought into effect by various laser stations for forming on-site normal points, and small variants of the algorithm are used by most analysis centers for forming normal points from full-rate data, although the data <b>screening</b> <b>criterion</b> they use ranges from about 2. 5 to 3. 0 x rms. At the CSTG Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) Subcommission, a working group was set up in Mar. 1991 to review the recommended screening procedure. This paper has been influenced by the discussions of this working group, although the views expressed are primarily those of this author.

Geomechanics study has, therefore, become a new requirement particularly {{for oil and gas}} field development.

Therefore, there is an urgent need of a quick geomechanics <b>screening</b> <b>criterion</b> {{to be used as a}} standard guideline to evaluate the high level geomechanical risks and suitable analysis can be recommended for the identified development fields. The aim of this paper is to propose a <b>screening</b> <b>criterion</b> for geomechanical risks study based on four key parameters, drilling, depletion, injection and storage and sand production. The screening approach is designed based on Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) risk screening where the likelihood is based on a set of scores developed to specific questions. The consequence for each failure scenarios is assessed based on educated estimation of the impact towards people, asset, environment and reputation. Recommendations for geomechanical study are made based on the severity of each failure category on the RAM risk matrix. Fourteen development fields in offshore Peninsular Malaysia, offshore Sarawak and offshore Sabah are selected for the assessment. Based on results, fields in offshore Sarawak and Sabah have higher potential for geomechacnical issues mainly because of their geological settings and formation characteristics. A set of geomechanical study is proposed for each individual field for prudent management of potential geomechanics risk associated with the depletion and EOR injection scheme planned for the fields...|$|R

We examined patterns of genetic variation in two sister species, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, both efficient natural vectors of human malaria in West Africa. We used the differentiation signature displayed by a known coordinate selective sweep of immune genes APL 1 and TEP 1 in A. coluzzii to design a population genetic screen trained on the sweep, classified a panel of 26 potential immune genes for concordance with the signature, and functionally tested their immune phenotypes. The screen results were strongly predictive for genes with protective immune phenotypes: genes meeting the <b>screen</b> <b>criteria</b> {{were significantly more likely}} to display a functional phenotype against malaria infection than genes not meeting the criteria (p = 0. 0005). Thus, an evolution-based screen can efficiently prioritize candidate genes for labor-intensive downstream functional testing, and safely allow the elimination of genes not meeting the <b>screen</b> <b>criteria.</b> The suite of immune genes with characteristics similar to the APL 1 -TEP 1 selective sweep appears to be more widespread in the A. coluzzii genome than previously recognized. The immune gene differentiation may be a consequence of adaptation of A. coluzzii to new pathogens encountered in its niche expansion during the separation from A. gambiae, although the role, if any of natural selection by Plasmodium is unknown. Application of the screen allowed identification of new functional immune factors, and assignment of new functions to known factors. We describe biochemical binding interactions between immune proteins that underlie functional activity for malaria infection, which highlights the interplay between pathogen specificity and the structure of immune complexes. We also find that most malaria-protective immune factors display phenotypes for either human or rodent malaria, with broad specificity a rarity...|$|R
