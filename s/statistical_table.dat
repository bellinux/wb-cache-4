2500|$|The Polish Underground State {{strongly}} opposed collaboration in anti-Jewish persecutions and threatened death to all informers against them, {{on behalf of}} the Polish military tribunals of the Home Army. Ot, widzi pan, sprawa jednej litery sprawia ogromną różnicę. Ratować i uratować! Ratowaliśmy kilkadziesiąt razy więcej ludzi, niż uratowaliśmy. – Władysław Bartoszewski}} However, the continued brutality of war led to the breakdown of traditional social norms and values. Some persons betrayed hidden Jews to the Germans, others made money as extortionists (szmalcownik), blackmailing Jews in hiding and Poles who protected them. Estimates of the number of Polish collaborators vary. The lower estimate of seven thousand is based primarily on the sentences of the Special Courts of the Polish Underground State, sentencing individuals for treason to the nation. The highest estimate yet of about one million collaborators, as proposed by a German historian, includes all Polish citizens who in some way contributed to the German activities, such as: low-ranking bureaucrats employed in Nazi German administration, construction workers, members of the Blue Police, slave laborers in German-run factories and farms and similar others (notably, the second figure originates from a single <b>statistical</b> <b>table</b> of outdated scholarship with a very thin source base). Relatively little active collaboration by individual Poles – with any aspect of the German presence – took place in Poland. All Nazi propaganda efforts to recruit Poles in either labor or auxiliary roles were met with almost no interest, due to the everyday reality of German occupation. The non-German Wachmänner guards in the extermination camps were mostly Ukrainian-speaking or native to the Baltic states. John Connelly, quoting Leszek Gondek, described the phenomenon of Polish collaboration as 'marginal' and stated that [...] "only relatively small percentage of Polish population engaged in activities that may be described as collaboration when seen against the backdrop of European and world history".|$|E

50|$|In their Seven Roles of Women: Impact of Education, Migration, and Employment on Ghanaian Mother (International Labour Office, 1987), Christine Oppong and Katherine Abu {{recorded}} field {{interviews in}} Ghana that confirmed a traditional view of procreation. Citing {{figures from the}} Ghana fertility survey of 1983, the authors concluded that about 60 percent {{of women in the}} country preferred to have large families of five or more children. A <b>statistical</b> <b>table</b> accompanying the research showed that the largest number of children per woman was found in the rural areas where the traditional concept of family was strongest. Uneducated urban women also had large families. On the average, urbanized, educated, and employed women had fewer children. On the whole, however, all the interviewed groups saw childbirth as an essential role for women in society, either for the benefits it bestows upon the mother or for the honour it brings to her family. The security that procreation provided was greater in the case of rural and uneducated women. By contrast, the number of children per mother declined for women with post-elementary education and outside employment; with guaranteed incomes and little time at their disposal in their combined roles as mothers and employees, the desire to procreate declined.|$|E

However, in the real worldapplication, it is often partially known or imprecise in nature giving rise to fuzzy relational database whichcontains imprecise micro data. Aggregation or statistical operation applied on micro data generates macro datacalled fuzzy statistic. In fuzzy statistics apart from fuzzy mean, fuzzy median primitive operation of counting oftuples in fuzzy relational database is an important aspect. In this context, we investigated the various approachesto cardinality of fuzzy sets which have been studied in the literature (e. g. sigmacount) and introduce the conceptof fuzzy cardinality in fuzzy relational database. The concept of fuzzy statistical database is developed, whichallows us to deal with the storage of vagueness or impreciseness associated with the statistical data.
