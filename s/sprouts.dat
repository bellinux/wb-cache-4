5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal <b>sprouts.</b> These <b>sprouts</b> can reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength. Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II muscle fibers to type I muscle fibers.|$|E

This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sprout</b> {{damage in}} durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) {{is caused by}} pre-harvest <b>sprouting.</b> It reduces seed quality and causes a loss of starch gel viscosity, which {{negatively}} affects the pasta industry.

30|$|<b>Sprouting</b> {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as a persistence mechanism for hardwood trees (Bond and Midgley 2001, Del Tredici 2001) and is commonly discussed as an important fire adaptation for several pine species (e.g., shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.), pitch pine (P. rigida Mill.); Mattoon 1915, Welch et al. 2000). However, <b>sprouting</b> of longleaf pine seedlings has received relatively little attention. Farrar (1975) used mechanical clipping to test for <b>sprouting</b> responses and reported that up to 60 % of small grass stage seedlings <b>sprouted,</b> with lower <b>sprouting</b> rates as tree size increased. We observed <b>sprouting</b> across all study treatments, including the control, but the rate of <b>sprouting</b> did not exceed 30 % of the original population for any seedling size and treatment combination. However, <b>sprouting</b> was more common for small seedlings and seedlings in the high-temperature burn treatment, suggesting that the <b>sprouting</b> response was associated with severity of seedling damage. Although <b>sprouting</b> appears {{to contribute to the}} short-term fire resistance of longleaf pine seedlings, additional {{research is needed to determine}} if <b>sprouting</b> affects the vigor, development, or survival of longleaf pine seedlings through time.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe study {{investigates the}} effect of seed <b>sprouting</b> on minerals, anti {{nutrients}} and pasting characteristics of flours produced from some tropical legume seeds.

The flours from <b>sprouted</b> and non-sprouted seeds were analyzed for the minerals, anti nutritional and pasting properties. The samples were found to differ significantly (p< 0. 05) in the minerals, anti nutritional composition and pasting properties of the flours. <b>Sprouting</b> increased the mineral contents of the flours generally the calcium content of non-sprouted red kidney beans (13. 8 mg/ 100 g) increased to 16. 1 mg/ 100 g in the <b>sprouted</b> flour.

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels <b>sprouts,</b> cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication.

5|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{a variety of}} food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees.

5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn <b>sprouts</b> another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E
