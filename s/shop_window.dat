5|$|For her thirteenth {{birthday}} on 12 June 1942, Frank {{received a}} book she had shown {{her father in}} a <b>shop</b> <b>window</b> a few days earlier. Although it was an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front, Frank decided she would {{use it as a}} diary, and she began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|Life's <b>Shop</b> <b>Window</b> was {{the first}} film produced, rather than simply distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex in a <b>shop</b> <b>window</b> {{in the third}} episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed {{to look like a}} charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the <b>shop</b> <b>window</b> before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges were placed on the glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, William Fox was {{operating}} the successful film distributor Box Office Attraction Film Rental Company. Box Office purchased films from studios such as Balboa Amusement Producing Company, showing them in Fox's New York area theaters and renting prints to exhibitors {{elsewhere in the}} country. Life's <b>Shop</b> <b>Window</b> may have originally been considered for production in this manner. However, Fox decided he was unwilling to depend on others for the products his business required, and instead prepared to produce his own films under the Box Office Attractions Company name. He purchased the Éclair film studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey and property in Staten Island, arranged for actors and crew, and began production with an adaptation of an established work, as was common at the time.|$|E

So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came to a stop at Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a <b>shop</b> <b>window</b> and broke a leg.|$|E

They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>shopping</b> <b>window</b> is to attract {{attention}} and interest to the store, hoping {{to get as many}} passersby as possible to become new customers or tempt old ones to new purchases. Today, the <b>shopping</b> <b>windows</b> most often have a display consisting of merchandise or services that the store sells. In some cases they take it a step further, adding a digital screen to allow a better display of a larger range of merchandise, {{with the help of a}} slideshow of pictures. There is however a limitation to this solution. You can’t control what pictures are shown when a specific individual is passing by the store, thus having the risk of losing a potential customer. We have together with a company named VisioSign explored different solutions on how to add interactivity to the <b>shopping</b> <b>windows,</b> allowing customers to view more specific merchandise or services that the store offers. We aimed to create an interaction that would allow the users to gain as much information as possible in a simple and entertaining manner. Different types of technology for interaction through a glass window were investigated and evaluated with respect to each other. Webcams, Kinect, mobile device connection through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, voice control, and touch screens were considered to be viable solutions. After researching them, we decided on a Wi-Fi connection between the <b>shopping</b> <b>window</b> screen and a mobile device running the Android OS. The main part of the project then revolved around the creation of an interaction between the <b>shopping</b> <b>window</b> screen and the user, using an Android device as the interaction medium. We put much time into designing the interaction, as well as implementing the applications. For communication between the Android device and the <b>shopping</b> <b>window</b> screen, we needed two applications, one server application for the screen, and one client application for the user’s device. Through iterations ending with company tests and feedback, as well as some user tests, we developed and improved the interactions. The final result was two applications allowing the user to browse through categories, save viewable information, and browse webpages on the <b>shopping</b> <b>window</b> screen by the use of his Android device...|$|R
