To quantitatively evaluate navigation integrity, an aircraft computes vertical and lateral protection levels as position-error bounds using integrity parameters broadcast by a nearby LAAS Ground Facility (LGF).

The new station attempted to affiliate with CBS, but the network refused, citing that the new station would not attract new viewers, and that the area was <b>sufficiently</b> <b>covered</b> by Syracuse-based WTVH. A petition filed by WTUV's owner, Mohawk Valley Broadcasting, against both the network and WTVH was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1984.

WTUV finally signed-on October 12, 1986 as an affiliate of the then-new Fox network, and has been with Fox ever since. However, as with other Fox affiliates, WTUV considered itself an independent station until Fox began its prime-time schedule in April 1987.

50|$|At {{about this}} same time, from 1856 to 1865, John Russell Bartlett, the Secretary of State of Rhode Island, {{published}} Records of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in New England, a ten-volume set. In 1862, volume 7, which covered the years 1770-1776 was released. Here, 136 pages covered the Gaspee affair, {{which included a}} few additional pages of correspondence (not found in Staples) surrounding {{the destruction of the}} Gaspee. George Bancroft assisted Bartlett by securing copies of documents in London. A year earlier, Bartlett had published exactly the same pages under the title A History of the Destruction of His Britannic Majesty’s Schooner Gaspee, in Narragansett Bay, on the 10th June, 1772. Almost identical to Staples’s work in content and layout, Bartlett provided more analysis and commentary than had the judge. He offered more comments in the footnotes, and laid out the text in one column instead of two, making it a 141-page book. In the introduction Bartlett justified the release of a book similar to Staples’s work, not because the latter was found wanting, but because it was scarce and out of print. Given the Whig view of the American Revolution shared by these two prestigious Rhode Islanders and most of their readers, they had <b>sufficiently</b> <b>covered</b> the topic for their era and no full-length treatment for an adult readership of the Gaspee was published thereafter. Their work reflected the more celebratory and confident attitude of the earlier part of nineteenth century, they did not seem to struggle with living {{in the shadows of the}} accomplishments of their parents and grandparents, as so many others of their generation did.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Mental {{imagery is}} the human ability to imagine and reason with visuo-spatial information.

This article presents a new theory of mental imagery, which in contrast to other con-temporary theories is formalized as a computational cogni-tive model.

40|$|Successful {{corporate}} acquisitions require its {{managers to}} achieve substantial performance improvements {{in order to}} <b>sufficiently</b> <b>cover</b> acquisition premiums, the expected return of debt and equity investors, and the additional resources needed to capture synergies and accelerate growth. Acquirers understand that achieving the performance improvements necessary to cover these costs and create value for investors will most likely require a significant effort from mergers and acquisitions (M&A) management teams. This understanding drives the common and longstanding practice of offering hefty performance incentive packages to key managers, assuming that financial incentives will induce in-role and extra-role behaviors that drive organizational change and growth. The present study debunks the assumptions of this common M&A practice, providing quantitative evidence that shared vision and autonomous motivation are far more effective drivers of managerial performance than financial incentives...|$|R
