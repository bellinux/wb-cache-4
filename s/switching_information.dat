Even the dedicated hardware can improve the performance of SDR implementation, there are some additional hardware costs. In this paper, to overcome the processing delay of the low-cost USRP platform and improve the communication efficiency, we not only optimize the frame transmission path as in [22], we also employ the packets pipelining transmission. Moreover, the transmission of robot control information and channel <b>switching</b> <b>information</b> wastes communication throughput if using the existing Zigbee or WiFi protocols.

This limitation of <b>switching</b> <b>information</b> leads to a mode mismatch between the plant and the controller, and the system may become unstable. A mode mismatch also {{makes it difficult to}} find an attractor set to which the state trajectory converges. A switching condition for stability is characterized by the total time when the modes of the plant and the controller are different. Under the condition, we derive an ultimate bound on the state trajectories by using a common Lyapunov function computed from a randomized algorithm. The switching condition can be reduced to a dwell-time condition. Comment: This journal-version paper is based on the conference paper (arXiv: 1403. 4691...|$|E

30|$|Challenges: Although SDR {{techniques}} are low cost and flexible, the proposing system still faces several challenges. First, the original data information {{has a high}} demand of communication throughput. However, the communication throughput of the low-cost SDR platforms is limited because of many kinds of latencies [5, 6]. Hence, packets pipelining transmission is proposed to improve the communication efficiency. Second, it is quite challenging for wireless communications under the circumstances of imperfect channels and unreliable links. As a result, retransmission and acknowledgement (ACK) are necessary. Moreover, wireless communications may be interfered by other wireless radios in the same crowded ISM band, and the channel reliability is dynamic and unpredictable. It is possible that even the best channel at this moment is less reliable than any other channels at the previous or the next moment. In this case, an observation on link quality is used to decide whether a channel switching will be taken. Last but not the least, the transmission of robot control information and channel <b>switching</b> <b>information</b> from the teleoperator to the telerobot can consume non-trivial communication throughput. Therefore, we consider to piggyback these information with each ACK packet in each round-trip communication.|$|E

40|$|Dense {{deployments}} {{of wireless}} local area networks (WLANs) {{are becoming a}} norm in many cities around the world. However, increased interference and trafﬁc demands can severely limit the aggregate throughput achievable unless an effective channel assignment scheme is used. In this work, a simple and effective distributed channel assignment (DCA) scheme is proposed. It is shown {{that in order to}} maximise throughput, each access point (AP) simply chooses the channel with the minimum number of active neighbour nodes (i. e. nodes associated with neighbouring APs that have packets to send). However, application of such a scheme to practice depends critically on its ability to estimate the number of neighbour nodes in each channel, for which no practical estimator has been proposed before. In view of this, an extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) estimator and an estimate of the number of nodes by AP are proposed. These not only provide fast and accurate estimates but can also exploit channel <b>switching</b> <b>information</b> of neighbouring APs. Extensive packet level simulation results show that the proposed minimum neighbour and EKF estimator (MINEK) scheme is highly scalable and can provide signiﬁcant throughput improvement over other channel assignment schemes...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The {{assumption}} that working memory (WM) is embedded within long-term memory {{suggests that the}} effectiveness of <b>switching</b> <b>information</b> between activated states in WM (i. e., attentional refreshing) may depend on whether that information is semantically relevant. Given that older adults often have greater general knowledge than younger adults, age-related deficits in episodic memory (EM) could be ameliorated by studying information that has existing semantic representations compared with unknown information. Method. Younger and older adults completed a modified operation span task that varied the number of refreshing opportunities. The memoranda used were equally known to younger and older adults (neutral words; e. g., father), better known to older adults than younger adults (dated words; e. g., mirth), or unknown to both groups (unknown words; e. g., cobot). Results. Results for immediate and delayed recall indicated an age-related improvement for dated memoranda and no age difference for unknown memoranda. Furthermore, refreshing opportunities predicted delayed recall of neutral memoranda more strongly for younger adults than older adults, whereas older adults ’ recall advantage for dated memo-randa was explained by their prior knowledge and not refreshing opportunities.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work described in this thesis proposes and investigates further use of scrambling in industrial analogue and digital monochrome video systems. This scrambling inevitably entails some signal modification. Providing the receiver is able {{to distinguish between the}} original and the scrambled signal, regardless of which one was transmitted, more efficient signal exploitation is possible. This more efficient signal exploitation is performed {{at the expense of the}} inherent redundancy present in the analogue and di ital signals. Analogue video signals are usually of a highly correlative nature and, this characteristic is exploited, in this thesis, by enabling them to be unwitting data carriers. The video signal is made the data carrier while the data gets a free ride. Each scan-line of the video signal is sampled, and blocks of pels are scrambled or not by modulo masking, depending on whether the data necessary for transmission is a logical 1 11 or 1 01 respectively. Prior to transmission the combined data and video sequence is converted into a continuous signal with a bandwidth that is no greater than that of the original video signal. From the knowledge of the original and the modified signal statistics, the receiver is able to perform the inverse operation of the transmitter, recovering the video signal and the data. Three novel systems are proposed for embedding data into analogue pictures. Two of these systems are capable of supporting an average of 17430 and 8713 bits per (256 x 256) image LV respectively, with excellent recovered picture quality. The third system produced a constant number of bits per image, with a slight degradation in the recovered picture quality but, with a capability of conveying up to about 0. 5 mega bits/sec of data. The idea and technique of embedding data into analogue signals was then carried on to the digital method of coding video signals using differential pulse code modulation. However, the scrambling technique here was used to obtain a novel switched quantization scheme, with forward estimation, without the necessity of sending any side information. Scrambling was performed on the quantizer output levels by inversion. Initially, experiments were carried out using fixed length code words with one and two dimensional predictors. Blocks of quantizer output levels are scrambled, or not, depending on which quantizer was used in encoding the video signal. Hence the <b>switching</b> <b>information</b> was carried by the quantized block of error signals. This type of set-up produced only modest improvements. The quantizers were then altered by using a different number of levels and the <b>switching</b> <b>information</b> was carried one block of quantized error signals in advance. As a result, the average bit rate was reduced to about 2. 7 bits/pel using a one dimensional predictor with exceptionally good subjective picture quality. When used with a two dimensional predictor, the scheme produced an average bit rate of about 1. 7 bits/pel with excellent subjective picture quality...|$|E
