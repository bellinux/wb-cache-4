Here, we present a straightforward and effective design strategy for modifying the optical and electrochemical properties of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based CPs by controlling both the intrachain and interchain properties in a single system. The synthesized polymers, P 1, P 2 and P 3, show almost identical optical absorption spectra in solution, manifesting essentially the same intrachain properties of the three CPs having restricted effective conjugation along the main chain. However, the absorption spectra of CP films are gradually tuned by controlling the interchain packing through the side-chain design.

Furthermore, the surface morphology shows that the synthesized nanorods have an average diameter of similar to 90 nm and length of similar to 2 mu m.

40|$|Widespread forgery in many sectors, {{ranging from}} currency, legal documents, electronics, car parts, or pharmaceuticals, {{has become a}} real threat to the society. [1] The immense number of counterfeited {{products}} {{can be linked to}} the recent development of high-resolution equipment, such as digital cameras, printers and scanners. Counterfeiting products not only infringe the rights of copyright owners, but they also cause extensive damage to the society by reducing the value of money or for example by causing health issues (e. g. through falsified pharmaceuticals). The use of fluorescent anti-counterfeit technologies, including lanthanide luminescence has already been illustrated by the red and green emitting materials in Euro banknotes that light up when placed under a UV lamp. [2] In Euro banknotes the emission of two different colors is observed when the banknotes are placed under a UV lamp. The specific narrow-line emission color of the lanthanides is very difficult to mimic when no information is available on the exact identity of the luminescent material in the banknote. However, the emission of the two different colors can be mimicked by using other materials than lanthanide compounds. Therefore, {{it is no surprise that}} Euro banknotes have been quite successfully falsified multiple times. In our work we have studied the design of dual mode anti-counterfeit materials based on d-f heterometallic nano-MOFs. We have created a single material, which strongly emits two different colors at wavelengths well matched to the standard UV lamps. What is more we have added an extra feature based on temperature dependent luminescence, which will increase the security level significantly. The double stage coding capability of these nano-MOFs would make the materials almost impossible to falsify. Nano-MOFs have been chosen for this application due to their unique luminescence properties. The nano-size of the MOFs is crucial for further processability, such as the creation of <b>security</b> <b>inks,</b> which can then be printed onto various surfaces. References [1] L.

This {{has been achieved}} in an important lanthanum phosphate (GdPO 4) via three different synthesis routes including soft chemical processes such as room temperature co precipitation and pechini type sol-gel method and a facile solid state diffusion reaction. All the methods produce well crystalline nanoparticles with dimensions ranging from few nm to tens of nm but with different morphology. The three lanthanum ions Ho 3 +, Yb 3 +, Eu 3 + introduce up and down conversion luminescence in GdPO 4 nanocrystals making them simultaneously excitable by UV and IR light and emit in the visible. The concept of dual excitation nanophosphor is quite unique for applications such as <b>security</b> <b>ink</b> and solar spectrum conversion for efficient energy harvesting.

The TEM {{bright field imaging}} shows that the developed nanophosphors are crystalline in nature with particle size similar to 45 nm. The upconversion (UC) emission spectra upon excitation at 980 nm of the nanophosphors at low pump power (= 900 mW) an intense broad band ranging from 400 - 900 nm along with a UV band has been observed. The enhancement of about similar to 104 times corresponding to the green band in the Ho 3 +-Yb 3 +-Li+ codoped nanophosphors {{compared to that of}} the Ho 3 + singly doped nanophosphors has been observed. This enhancement is caused by the energy transfer from the Yb 3 + to Ho 3 + ions and modified the local crystal field developed around the rare earth ions. A higher value of the slope (i. e., n similar to 6. 38) for broad band emission within the 944 mW- 1200 mW pump power region in the Ho 3 +-Yb 3 +-Li+ codoped nanophosphors is found to be due to the involvement of the photon avalanche population process but it is not related to the black body radiation. The intense peak at similar to 564 nm and similar to 648 nm for the broad band emission is attributed to the charge transfer luminescence of codoped nanophosphors, which is related to the oxygen ion present in the MoO 4 group and Yb 3 + ion. The observations described in this paper may be of significant interest for developing the visible upconverters, <b>security</b> <b>ink,</b> and novel devices for displays in the low and high pump power region.

40|$|Rational {{material}} design is inevitable to fully realize {{the properties of}} organic conjugated materials in applications, by regulating their intermolecular packing as well as intramolecular properties. In this dissertation, molecular design strategies to control interactions and assemblies of organic conjugated materials are systematically investigated, which enables unique optoelectronic properties for various optoelectronic applications. In Chapter 2, a molecular design to control intermolecular interactions renders a unique thermally stable supercooled liquid and its shear-triggered lighting-up crystallization with 25 -times fluorescence enhancement. The origin of the unique property is systematically scrutinized. Furthermore, possible biosensor application is proposed by demonstrating highly sensitive crystallization of the supercooled liquid by living cell attachment. Insightful design consideration for both intrachain and interchain properties is also critically important for conjugated polymers (CPs). In Chapter 3, molecular design of CPs’ main and side chains is logically investigated to regulate optical properties. Tailored CPs exhibit identical color in solution manifesting the same intramolecular optical properties by conjugated backbone design. Contrastingly, they show distinct color gradation in the solid state due to the coined intermolecular packing propensity difference through side chain design. Latent optical information encoding using CPs as <b>security</b> <b>inks</b> is demonstrated, which reveals and conceals hidden information upon CP aggregation/deaggregation. Furthermore, expansion of the design principles for efficient CP alignment is investigated (Chapter 4). Realization of CP alignment largely affects optoelectronic applications of CPs since it is inevitable to fully utilize CPs’ anisotropic properties in devices. Previously identified molecular design rules to realize directed CP alignment are evaluated, and more detailed design factors are additionally revealed. The properties of organic conjugated materials are also influenced by environmental factors, including characteristics of a substrate and solvent molecules. In Chapter 5, a novel optical sensor is devised based on controlled subtle interaction differences between substrates, fluorescent sensory molecules, and analyte solvents. The highly selective sensor array can clearly distinguish physicochemically similar liquids; ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and water.

Runtime: 45 : 08 minutesThe colored component of several important ancient pigments, including Egyptian blue and Han blue, are based on alkali earth copper tetrasilicate materials. In recent work, we have found that these layered materials can be chemically exfoliated into their constituent monolayers to provide alkali earth copper tetrasilicate nanosheets—defined by nanometer thickness and lateral dimensions that are on the order of several microns. The facile exfoliation of these materials into nanosheets is especially surprising in view of their long history on artifacts under a variety of environmental conditions, and we have examined the issue of whether archaeological samples are affected by this exfoliation mechanism. We have characterized the properties of these nanosheets by an array of analytical techniques, including powder x-ray diffraction, photoluminescence measurements, and Raman spectroscopy. In all cases, we observe differences between nanosheet and bulk samples that originate from the loss of coupling between layers when going from three-dimensional to two- dimensional structures. Both CaCuSi 4 O 10 nanosheets (derived from Egyptian blue) and BaCuSi 4 O 10 nanosheets (derived from Han blue) have strong near-infrared luminescence properties like their bulk counterparts, yet they are amenable to modern solution processing methods.
