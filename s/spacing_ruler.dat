40|$|The {{assessment}} of forensic photographs often requires the calibration {{of the resolution}} of the image so that accurate measurements can be taken of crime-scene exhibits or latent marks. In the case of latent marks, such as fingerprints, image calibration to a given dots-per-inch is a necessary step for image segmentation, preprocessing, extraction of feature minutiae and subsequent fingerprint matching. To enable scaling, such photographs are taken with forensic rulers in the frame so that image pixel distances can be converted to standard measurement units (metric or imperial). In forensic bureaus, this is commonly achieved by manual selection of two or more points on the ruler within the image, and entering the units of the measure distance. The process can be laborious and inaccurate, especially when the ruler graduations are indistinct because of poor contrast, noise or insufficient resolution. Here the authors present a fully automated method for detecting and estimating the direction and graduation <b>spacing</b> of <b>rulers</b> in forensic photographs. The method detects the location of the ruler in the image and then uses spectral analysis to estimate the direction and wavelength of the ruler graduations. The authors detail the steps of the algorithm and demonstrate the accuracy of the estimation on both a calibrated set of test images and a wide collection of good and poor quality crime-scene images. The method is shown to be fast and accurate and has wider application in other imaging disciplines, such as radiography, archaeology and surveying...|$|R
2500|$|However, Poincaré did {{not share}} Kantian views in all {{branches}} of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention {{plays an important role}} in physics.

Poincaré believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012). He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean <b>space</b> where the <b>rulers</b> are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.|$|R
5000|$|Abū Saʿīd {{does not}} seem to have {{personally}} engaged in large-scale building projects, perhaps because of the time he spent on campaigns. [...] Quṭb al-Dīn Ṭāʾūs, a vizier under Abū Saʿīd, built the Jūy-i Sulṭāni canal in Herat, which created the possibility for future building under Sulṭān Ḥusayn Bayqārā as it was completed while Abū Saʿīd was on his final campaign to Azerbaijan. This and the Aq Sarāy (white palace) shifted the elite living <b>space</b> while the <b>ruler</b> was in Herat to outside the city walls, “marking a conscious break with the past.” [...] Other public works credited to Abū Saʿīd include repairs to the Gulistān dam “while at the same time appropriating the lands it watered”.

60|$|Lord Palmerston {{refused to}} join the coalition, on the honourable ground that for many years he and Aberdeen had stood at the {{antipodes}} {{to one another in}} the momentous department of foreign affairs. In fact he looked in another direction. If the Aberdeen-Russell coalition broke down, either before they began the journey or very soon after, Lord Derby might come back with a reconstructed team, with Palmerston leading in the Commons a centre party that should include the Peelites. He was believed to have something of this kind in view when he consented to move the amendment brought to him by Gladstone and Herbert in November, and he was bitterly disappointed at the new alliance of that eminent pair with Lord John. With the tories he was on excellent terms. Pall Mall was alive with tales of the anger and disgust of the Derbyites against Mr. Disraeli, who had caused them first to throw over their principles and then to lose their places. The county constituencies and many conservative boroughs were truly reported to be sick of the man who had promised marvels as 'looming in the future,' and then like a bad jockey had brought the horse upon its knees. Speculative minds cannot but be tempted to muse upon the difference that the supersession by Lord Palmerston of this extraordinary genius at that moment might have made, both to the career of Disraeli himself, and to the nation of which he one day became for a <b>space</b> the supreme <b>ruler.</b> Cobden and Bright let it be understood that they were not candidates for office. 'Our day has not come yet,' Bright said to Graham, and the representative of the radicals in the cabinet was Sir William Molesworth. In their newspaper the radicals wrote rather stiffly and jealously. In the end Lord Palmerston changed his mind and joined.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} circumstances under which Chalukya rulers maintained legitimacy for two centuries in the diverse religious and cultural landscape of early medieval south India. The Indian subcontinent in the mid-first millennium AD saw puranic Hinduism emerge, along with numerous religious cults, all sharing religious space alongside established religions like Vedic religion, Buddhism and Jainism. Their interactions engendered material and visual forms affecting art, architecture, political economy, literature and divergent trends in languages and scripts in South Asia. Another significant development was the near simultaneous rise of two complex social institutions: an entrenched and complex caste system and kingship whose legitimacy derived as much from ritual performance and political alliance networks as from military prowess. I argue that local religious forms, practiced by non-elites constrained and shaped the new religious and state symbols that the Chalukyas constructed during their reign. I conducted a systematic archaeological survey of one Chalukya religious and political center - Aihole- to document the natural and cultural landscapes and material evidence for the religious and political functioning of the early Chalukya state and society. The results from this survey combined with my research into Chalukya temple architecture and religious practices have yielded three broad conclusions. First, in five square kilometers of intensive survey I plotted 877 artifact and architectural locations, out of which 836 yielded pottery. The spatial distribution and forms of these domestic utilitarian artifacts across Aihole suggest a sizeable and thriving settlement over most of the first millennium AD. Second, at Aihole the Chalukyas undertook a building program that consciously identified with the locally prevalent theme of memorial <b>spaces.</b> Third, Chalukya <b>rulers</b> created a sacred and political identity that incorporated local religious forms, thus gaining popular legitimacy to reign for two centuries. Future archaeological excavations at Aihole will yield further evidence for understanding the Chalukya built environment in relation to its standing stone monuments. This evidence can then be synthesized with information from inscriptions and comparative archaeological research to better understand the anthropological landscape during Chalukya times...|$|R
50|$|This game either {{requires}} an even {{number of players}} 4 or more, or any number of players more than 2 along with an individual ball feeder. The game is traditionally played with doubles teams. A doubles team is designated the rulers and begins on the baseline {{on the opposite side}} of the court. The feeder is positioned behind the <b>rulers</b> with respectable <b>space</b> to the <b>rulers</b> for mobility (at least 10 feet behind the line). The other doubles teams are the challengers and take turns {{on the opposite side of}} the court with a goal to win 3 points in a row to replace the current rulers. As each point begins, the rulers begin at the baseline, but are free to move anywhere once the point begins. The first point begins with the feeder feeding a short ball to the challengers allowing them to proceed to the net and an offensive. If the challengers win the first point, they remain at the net for the beginning of the next two points (they are allowed free mobility after the point begins). The feeder will randomly designate one player on the challengers team to receive an overhead (a short lob allowing the player to hit a powerful shot similar to a serve from the net), or a volley. With the third point, the other of the two challengers receives an overhead or a volley. If all three points are won the challengers take the place as the new rulers and the previous rulers proceed to the challenger's side. After a certain time, end game may be called and the current rulers are designated as the winners (The power to call end game may go to the feeder). This game was designed to train and encourage aggressiveness and a goal in doubles to move to the net to finish the point. It also trains groundstrokes volleys, and overheads, along with possible use of slices and drop-shots.A super-shot rule may also be put into effect. Here, a feeder may decide at a random time (either the 2nd or 3rd point) to drive a volley between the two challengers. If neither player touches the ball it is called a super-shot and the challengers could be penalized (may run laps, do pushups etc.). With this rule, the game also trains communication between a doubles team.|$|R
