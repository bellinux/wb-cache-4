25|$|Washington, DC {{is located}} in the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), exhibiting four distinct seasons. Its climate is typical of the South. The District {{is located in}} USDA plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a temperate climate. As implied in the previous sentence, the downtown area exhibits an urban heat island (UHI) build-up that can especially exacerbate the <b>sultriness</b> of summer nights.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} her {{performances}} in Kyoto that she also became {{known for her}} performances of nembutsu odori (or nembutsu dance) {{in honor of the}} Amida Buddha. Though this dance traces its origins to Kūya, a tenth-century evangelist of Pure Land Buddhism, by Okuni's time it had become a largely secular folk dance, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its <b>sultriness</b> and sexual innuendo. Other popular themes for Okuni's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back.|$|E
500|$|... 3 Splash {{opens with}} the first interlude, [...] "09:00AM", which is an {{instrumental}} piece with [...] "groovy" [...] DJ spins and scratches. [...] "Lick Me", the first tracks to include vocals, is an uptempo [...] "cute summer number" [...] with suggestive lyrics. [...] "Ecstasy" [...] is an electronic song with Kumi's [...] "cool husky" [...] vocals being heavily processed with autotune and vocoder effects. According to Adam Greenberg from AllMusic, Ecstasy [...] "share some ideation with Lady Gaga concepts, mixing <b>sultriness</b> with oddity and playing with the instrumentation and voicing along the way." [...] The album's second interlude, [...] "12:35PM", is another instrumental piece with [...] "slow-paced" [...] handclaps, and subtle urban undertones. Hashire! is a [...] "distorted" [...] midtempo dance song with influences of rock and pop music, and the EP is closed with a final instrumental interlude, [...] "12:00AM".|$|E
500|$|Johansson is {{described}} as a sex symbol by the media, which considers her lips, green eyes, and voice among her trademarks. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as [...] "the embodiment of male fantasy". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen said he found it [...] "very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are". In 2014, New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that [...] "she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her <b>sultriness,</b> and of how much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation." [...] Regardless, Johansson dislikes being [...] "super-sexualised" [...] as [...] "the new Marilyn Monroe" [...] and [...] "always be an object of desire. Because it doesn't last." [...] Johansson's sex appeal also cost her the lead role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) as its director David Fincher thought she was [...] "too sexy" [...] for the part.|$|E
500|$|The cover {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the cover [...] "a useless remake, {{which seems to}} exist solely for its video". Spence D. of IGN said that the lyrics fit perfectly with Spears's relationship with the media at the time. He also added, [...] "As for her interpretation, it's an interesting chameleonic diversion that comes off like a mash-up between vintage Prince-styled production, Cameo swagger, and Madonna <b>sultriness,</b> but never seems to capture the gloss and glory {{of any of the}} aforementioned influences". Christy Lemire of msnbc.com called it [...] "utterly unnecessary". Louis Pattison of the New Musical Express commented that [...] "judging by the fuck-you sentiments" [...] of the cover, Spears liked {{to play the role of}} [...] " [...] pop brat careering off the rails". Sarah Hepola of Salon.com wrote in an article about contemporary teen idols that the cover [...] "became an anthem for teen-idol rebellion". American director Quentin Tarantino included the song in a playlist that inspired him during production of his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds.|$|E
2500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and {{described}} it as [...] "seductive and beautiful, cynical and twisted, {{and one of the}} best films of the year." [...] Later, he included it as one of his [...] "Great Movies" [...] and described it as [...] "film noir, and so it is, but it is more: Unusually for a crime film, it deals with the psychology of the characters ... It contains all the elements of police action, but in a sharply clipped, more economical style; the action exists not for itself but to provide an arena for the personalities". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Spacey is at his insinuating best, languid and debonair, in a much more offbeat performance than this film could have drawn from a more conventional star. And the two Australian actors, tightly wound Mr. Pearce and fiery, brawny Mr. Crowe, qualify as revelations." [...] Desson Howe, in his review for The Washington Post, praised the cast: [...] "Pearce makes a wonderful prude who gets progressively tougher and more jaded. New Zealand-born Crowe has a unique and sexy toughness; imagine Mickey Rourke without the attitude. Although she's playing a stock character, Basinger exudes a sort of chaste <b>sultriness.</b> Spacey is always enjoyable." ...|$|E

6000|$|Everything {{between our}} young couple moved today, {{in spite of}} their pauses, their margin, to a quicker measure--the quickness and anxiety playing lightning-like in the <b>sultriness.</b> Densher watched, decidedly, as he had never done before.

60|$|Spring passed, {{and summer}} crept in and wasted away, and autumn had arrived. Every New Yorker knows what delicious weather we have, in these regions, {{of the early}} October days; how calm, clear, and {{divested}} of <b>sultriness,</b> is the air, and how decently nature seems preparing for her winter sleep.|$|E
60|$|At length, just as {{an elderly}} gentleman of very dignified {{presence}} happened to be passing, a large bubble sailed majestically down, and burst right against his nose! He looked up,--at first with a stern, keen glance, which penetrated at once into the obscurity behind the arched window,--then with a smile which might be conceived as diffusing a dog-day <b>sultriness</b> for the space of several yards about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The pure {{sunshine}} of the world, Lady Madeleine! {{would that}} it had ever lighted me! My youth flourished in the unwholesome <b>sultriness</b> of a blighted atmosphere, which I mistook for the resplendent brilliancy of a summer day. How deceived I was, you may judge, not certainly from finding me here; but I am here because I have ceased to suffer, only in having ceased to hope." ...|$|E
60|$|Vivian had {{intended}} to stop and breakfast after riding about ten miles; {{but he had not}} proceeded half that way when, from the extreme <b>sultriness</b> of the morning, he found it impossible to advance without refreshment. Max, also, to his rider's surprise, was much distressed; and, on turning round to his servant, Vivian found Essper's hack panting and puffing, and breaking out, as if, instead of commencing their day's work, they were near reaching their point of destination.|$|E
6000|$|And the European {{reader will}} observe that the Arabs {{generally}} reckon three seasons, including our autumn, in their summer. The hot weather at Al-Madinah {{appeared to me}} as extreme as the hibernal cold is described to be, but the air was dry, and the open plain prevented the faint and stagnant <b>sultriness</b> which distinguishes Meccah. Moreover, though the afternoons were close, the nights and the mornings were cool and dewy. At this season the citizens sleep on the house-tops, or on the ground ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{now made}} a more careful {{examination}} of the country around them. All was fresh and beautiful after the <b>sultriness</b> of the desert, and the sunshine and sweet, crisp air were delightful to the wanderers. Little mounds of yellowish green were away at the right, while on the left waved a group of tall leafy trees bearing yellow blossoms that looked like tassels and pompoms. Among the grasses carpeting the ground were pretty buttercups and cowslips and marigolds. After looking at these a moment Dorothy said reflectively: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{suddenly}} Pilkins {{came upon}} a youth sitting brave and, as if conflicting with summer <b>sultriness,</b> coatless, his white shirt-sleeves conspicuous {{in the light from}} the globe of an electric. Close to his side was a girl, smiling, dreamy, happy. Around her shoulders was, palpably, the missing coat of the cold-defying youth. It appeared to be a modern panorama of the Babes in the Wood, revised and brought up to date, with the exception that the robins hadn't turned up yet with the protecting leaves.|$|E
6000|$|The {{habit of}} a realist {{to find things}} the reverse of their {{appearance}} inclined him to put every statement in a paradox. A certain habit of antagonism defaced his earlier writings,--a trick of rhetoric not quite outgrown in his later, of substituting for the obvious word and thought its diametrical opposite. He praised wild mountains and winter forests for their domestic air, in snow and ice he would find <b>sultriness,</b> and commended the wilderness for resembling Rome and Paris. [...] "It was so dry, that {{you might call it}} wet." ...|$|E
60|$|His aged {{voice was}} hoarse and scratchy from the {{drinking}} {{of too much}} swipes at a funeral the night before, nothing of which contributed to make me less irritable. My head ached. The sun- glare on the water made my eyes ache, while I was suffering {{more than half a}} touch of mal de mer from the antic conduct of the outrigger on the blobby sea. The air was stagnant. In the lee of Waihee, between the white beach and the roof, no whisper of breeze eased the still <b>sultriness.</b> I really think I was too miserable to summon the resolution to give up the fishing and go in to shore.|$|E
60|$|The {{imagination}} of herself gliding away in that {{boat on the}} darkening waters was growing more and more into a longing, as {{the thought of a}} cool brook in <b>sultriness</b> becomes a painful thirst. To be freed from the burden of choice when all motive was bruised, to commit herself, sleeping, to destiny which would either bring death or else new necessities that might rouse a new life in her!--it was a thought that beckoned her the more because the soft evening air made her long to rest in the still solitude, instead of going back to the noise and heat of the village.|$|E
60|$|I {{resolved}} {{to pass a}} day at these old quarters of a certain Háji Abdullah. The hydrographers have given enlarged plans of Yáhárr and Jibbah, ports close to each other; while they have ignored the far more deserving Sharm Dumayghah. Distant only thirty miles of coasting navigation, a line almost clear of reefs and shoals, it is the natural harbour for the pilgrim-ships, which ever run the danger of being wrecked at El-Wijh; and it deserves more notice than we have hitherto vouchsafed to it. The weather also greatly improved {{on the next day}} (March 22nd): the cloud-canopy, the excessive moisture, and the still <b>sultriness</b> which had afflicted us since March 19th, were in process of being swept away by the strong, cool, bright norther.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not like}} being reproached, and, {{retiring}} huffily into a haughty silence, she sat by listlessly while Philip made the preparations for their departure. The little flat was hot and stuffy under the August sun, and from the road beat up a malodorous <b>sultriness.</b> As he lay in his bed in the small ward with its red, distempered walls he had longed for fresh air and the splashing of the sea against his breast. He felt he would go mad {{if he had to}} spend another night in London. Mildred recovered her good temper when she saw the streets of Brighton crowded with people making holiday, and they were both in high spirits as they drove out to Kemp Town. Philip stroked the baby's cheek.|$|E
6000|$|I saw thee once--once only--years ago: [...] I {{must not}} say how many--but not many. [...] It was a July midnight; and from out [...] A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring, [...] Sought a {{precipitate}} pathway up through heaven, [...] There fell a silvery-silken veil of light, [...] With quietude, and <b>sultriness,</b> and slumber, [...] Upon the upturned faces of a thousand [...] Roses that grew in an enchanted garden, [...] Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-- [...] Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses [...] That gave out, {{in return for the}} love-light, [...] Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-- [...] Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses [...] That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted [...] By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.|$|E
60|$|On that day, two {{men were}} {{lingering}} {{on the banks of}} a small but rapid stream, within an hour's journey of the encampment of Webb, like those who awaited the appearance of an absent person, or the approach of some expected event. The vast canopy of woods spread itself to the margin of the river overhanging the water, and shadowing its dark current with a deeper hue. The rays of the sun were beginning to grow less fierce, and the intense heat of the day was lessened, as the cooler vapors of the springs and fountains rose above their leafy beds, and rested in the atmosphere. Still that breathing silence, which marks the drowsy <b>sultriness</b> of an American landscape in July, pervaded the secluded spot, interrupted only by the low voices of the men, the occasional and lazy tap of a woodpecker, the discordant cry of some gaudy jay, or a swelling on the ear, from the dull roar of a distant waterfall.|$|E
60|$|For the instant, it {{appeared}} doubtful whether {{it were not}} the Judge's resolute purpose to set Hepzibah aside, and step across the threshold into the parlor, whence issued that broken and miserable murmur of entreaty. It was not pity that restrained him, for, at the first sound of the enfeebled voice, a red fire kindled in his eyes, {{and he made a}} quick pace forward, with something inexpressibly fierce and grim darkening forth, as it were, out of the whole man. To know Judge Pyncheon was to see him at that moment. After such a revelation, let him smile with what <b>sultriness</b> he would, he could much sooner turn grapes purple, or pumpkins yellow, than melt the iron-branded impression out of the beholder's memory. And it rendered his aspect not the less, but more frightful, that it seemed not to express wrath or hatred, but a certain hot fellness of purpose, which annihilated everything but itself.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a glorious}} day in June, the sky of pure deep {{dazzling}} blue, the sunshine glowing with brightness, but with cheerful freshness {{in the air}} that took away all <b>sultriness,</b> the sun tending westward in his long day's career, and casting welcome shadows from the tall firs and horse-chestnuts that shaded the lawn. A long rank of haymakers--men and women--proceeded with their rakes, the white shirt-sleeves, straw bonnets, and ruddy faces, radiant in the bath of sunshine, while in the shady end of the field were idler haymakers among the fragrant piles, Charles half lying on the grass, with his back against a tall haycock; Mrs. Edmonstone sitting on another, book in hand; Laura sketching the busy scene, the sun glancing through the chequered shade on her glossy curls; Philip stretched out at full length, hat and neck-tie off, luxuriating in the cool repose after a dusty walk from Broadstone; and a little way off, Amabel and Charlotte pretending to make hay, but really building nests with it, throwing it at each other, and playing as heartily as the heat would allow.|$|E
60|$|The soldiers, having searched {{this side}} of the valley after a fashion, and being perhaps {{somewhat}} sleepy with the <b>sultriness</b> of the afternoon, had now laid by much of their vigilance, and stood dozing at their posts or only kept a look-out {{along the banks of the}} river; so that in this way, keeping down the valley and at the same time towards the mountains, we drew steadily away from their neighbourhood. But the business was the most wearing I had ever taken part in. A man had need of a hundred eyes in every part of him, to keep concealed in that uneven country and within cry of so many and scattered sentries. When we must pass an open place, quickness was not all, but a swift judgment not only of the lie of the whole country, but of the solidity of every stone on which we must set foot; for the afternoon was now fallen so breathless that the rolling of a pebble sounded abroad like a pistol shot, and would start the echo calling among the hills and cliffs.|$|E
6000|$|A change came o'er {{the spirit}} of my dream. [...] The Boy was sprung to manhood: in the wilds [...] Of fiery climes he made himself a home, [...] And his Soul drank their sunbeams: he was girt [...] With strange and dusky aspects; he was not [...] Himself like what he had been; on the sea [...] 110 [...] And on the shore he was a wanderer; [...] There was a mass of many images [...] Crowded like waves upon me, but he was [...] A part of all; {{and in the last}} he lay [...] Reposing from the noontide <b>sultriness,</b> [...] Couched among fallen columns, in the shade [...] Of ruined walls that had survived the names [...] Of those who reared them; by his {{sleeping}} side [...] Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds [...] Were fastened near a fountain; and a man [...] 120 [...] Clad in a flowing garb did watch the while, [...] While many of his tribe slumbered around: [...] And they were canopied by the blue sky, [...] So cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful, [...] That God alone was to be seen in Heaven.[47] ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{a little}} {{preliminary}} conversation, I ventured {{to ask him}} if he did not feel regret at having abandoned his family and taken to this dangerous profession. [...] "I feel," [...] replied he, [...] "but one regret, and that will end only with my life;" [...] as he said this he pressed his clenched fists upon his bosom, drew his breath through his set teeth, and added with deep emotion, [...] "I have something within here that stifles me; it is like a burning iron consuming my very heart. I could tell you a miserable story, but not now--another time."--He relapsed into his former position, and sat with his head between his hands, muttering to himself in broken ejaculations, and what appeared at times to be curses and maledictions. I saw he was not in a mood to be disturbed, so I left him to himself. In a little time the exhaustion of his feelings, and probably the fatigues he had undergone in this expedition, began to produce drowsiness. He struggled with it for a time, but the warmth and <b>sultriness</b> of mid-day made it irresistible, and he at length stretched himself upon the herbage and fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|No sleep. The <b>sultriness</b> {{pervades the}} air And binds the brain--a dense oppression, such As tawny tigers feel in matted shades, Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage. Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads Vacant as Libya. All is hushed near by. Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf Of muffled sound, the Atheist roar of riot.

60|$|It was Sunday morning--a damp, warm November morning, {{with the}} sky {{overhead}} grey and low. Miss Reed stopped {{a little to}} take breath before climbing the hill, {{at the top of}} which, {{in the middle of the}} churchyard, was Blackstable Church. Miss Reed panted, and the <b>sultriness</b> made her loosen her jacket. She stood at the junction of the two roads which led to the church, one from the harbour end of the town and the other from the station. Behind her lay the houses of Blackstable, the wind-beaten houses with slate roofs of the old fishing village and the red brick villas of the seaside resort which Blackstable was fast becoming; in the harbour were the masts of the ships, colliers that brought coal from the north; and beyond, the grey sea, very motionless, mingling in the distance with the sky.... The peal of the church bells ceased, and was replaced by a single bell, ringing a little hurriedly, querulously, which denoted that there were only ten minutes before the beginning of the service. Miss Reed walked on; she looked curiously at the people who passed her, wondering....|$|E
60|$|It was an April day, {{as already}} hinted, and well towards {{the middle of}} the month. When morning dawned upon me, in town, its {{temperature}} was mild enough to be pronounced even balmy, by a lodger, like myself, in one of the midmost houses of a brick block,--each house partaking of the warmth of all the rest, besides the <b>sultriness</b> of its individual furnace--heat. But towards noon there had come snow, driven along the street by a northeasterly blast, and whitening the roofs and sidewalks with a business-like perseverance that would have done credit to our severest January tempest. It set about its task apparently as much in earnest {{as if it had been}} guaranteed from a thaw for months to come. The greater, surely, was my heroism, when, puffing out a final whiff of cigar-smoke, I quitted my cosey pair of bachelor-rooms,--with a good fire burning in the grate, and a closet right at hand, where there was still a bottle or two in the champagne basket and a residuum of claret in a box,--quitted, I say, these comfortable quarters, and plunged into the heart of the pitiless snowstorm, in quest of a better life.|$|E

60|$|Nor was {{it without}} similar {{effect on the}} minds of men that their journeyings and pilgrimages became more {{frequent}} than those of the Greek, the extent of ground traversed in the course of them larger, and the mode of travel more companionless. To the Greek, a voyage to Egypt, or the Hellespont, was the subject of lasting fame and fable, and the forests of the Danube and the rocks of Sicily closed for him the gates of the intelligible world. What parts of that narrow world he crossed were crossed with fleets or armies; the camp always populous on the plain, and the ships drawn in cautious symmetry around the shore. But to the mediæval knight, from Scottish moor to Syrian sand, the world was one great exercise ground, or field of adventure; the staunch pacing of his charger penetrated the pathlessness of outmost forest, and sustained the <b>sultriness</b> of the most secret desert. Frequently alone,--or, if accompanied, for the most part only by retainers of lower rank, incapable of entering into complete sympathy with any of his thoughts,--he must have been compelled often to enter into dim companionship with the silent nature around him, and must assuredly sometimes have talked to the wayside flowers of his love, and to the fading clouds of his ambition.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} {{that we are}} about to describe, the autumn had {{advanced}} some days since the events mentioned in the preceding chapter. Although the sun was now high in the eastern horizon, the restlessness produced by the heat emboldened a few idlers of Ravenna to brave the <b>sultriness</b> of the atmosphere, in the vain hope of being greeted by a breeze from the Adriatic as they mounted the seaward ramparts of the town. On attaining their destined elevation, these sanguine citizens turned their faces with fruitless and despairing industry towards every point of the compass, but no breath of air came to reward their perseverance. Nothing could be more thoroughly suggestive of the undiminished universality of the heat than the view, in every direction, from the position they then occupied. The stone houses of the city behind them glowed with a vivid brightness overpowering to the strongest eyes. The light curtains hung motionless over the lonely windows. No shadows varied the brilliant monotony of the walls, or softened the lively glitter on the waters of the fountains beneath. Not a ripple stirred the surface of the broad channel, that now replaced the ancient harbour. Not a breath of wind unfolded the scorching sails of the deserted vessels at the quay. Over the marshes in the distance hung a hot, quivering mist; and in the vineyards, near the town, not a leaf waved upon its slender stem. On the seaward side lay, vast and level, the prospect of the burning sand; and beyond it the main ocean--waveless, torpid, and suffused in a flood of fierce brightness--stretched out to the cloudless horizon that closed the sunbright view.|$|E
