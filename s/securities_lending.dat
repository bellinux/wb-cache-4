40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{presence}} of <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> supply before an initial public offering (IPO) reduces the initial stock return following IPO and improves subsequent long-run performance. We use a sample of British firms that go public via a two-stage IPO procedure where a firm becomes publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange in the first stage, and offers new shares to the public in the second stage. Stocks are lendable before the new equity issuance which relaxes the short-sale constraints that investors typically face in a conventional IPO. We find that two-stage offerings with higher <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> supply before offering are associated with lower IPO underpricing and better long-run performance. Our results are consistent with the conjecture that short selling improves the pricing efficiency of the IPO market...|$|R

25|$|Goldman Sachs {{was one of}} the {{heaviest}} users of these loan facilities, taking out many loans between March 18, 2008 and April 22, 2009. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the first Fed facility ever to provide overnight loans to investment banks, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $589 billion against collateral such as corporate market instruments and mortgage-backed securities. The Term <b>Securities</b> <b>Lending</b> Facility (TSLF), which allows primary dealers to borrow liquid Treasury securities for one month in exchange for less liquid collateral, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $193 billion.|$|E
25|$|The Term <b>Securities</b> <b>Lending</b> Facility is a 28-day {{facility}} that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers {{in exchange for}} other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Like the Term Auction Facility, the TSLF was done {{in conjunction with the}} Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased.|$|E
25|$|When a {{security}} is sold, the seller is contractually obliged {{to deliver it}} to the buyer. If a seller sells {{a security}} short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller fails to deliver, the transaction does not settle, and the seller {{may be subject to}} a claim from its counterparty. Certain large holders of securities, such as a custodian or investment management firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as <b>securities</b> <b>lending.</b> The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full title of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for margin buying.|$|E

40|$|Over the years, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has {{established}} margin regulations to limit purpose loans by banks and nonbanks to broker-dealers or other borrowers. In this study, the author reviews those regulations affecting <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> by banks and nonbanks. He examines data on security loans during the 1920 s and 1930 s, {{as well as}} in recent years, noting that <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> by banks and borrowing by broker-dealers often diverge-the popular notion that the two are tightly linked is not correct-and that during the 1920 s the volume of loans by banks to brokers may have been driven less by margin loans than by new issues of stocks and bonds by corporations. Also, during the 1928 - 29 episode, security loans by nonbank lenders, domestic and foreign, became increasingly important. The author points out that these observations have recent parallels.; The author also looks at the credit absorption hypothesis popular in the 1930 s, which argues that margin loans diverted credit from legitimate business uses to speculation, thereby weakening the financial positions of businesses. While the credit absorption view suggests that an increase in bank security loans should result in higher business loan rates relative to other short-term interest rates, the author finds no such effect. He concludes that the recent evidence suggests no credit absorption from bank security loans.

Creation of the second new tool, called the Term <b>Securities</b> <b>Lending</b> Facility, was announced on March 11, 2008.

Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008.

40|$|The first essay (Chapter 2) {{examines}} how investors behave in parallel markets that trade the same asset but have {{different degrees of}} transparency level. Using data from the Taiwan <b>Security</b> Borrowing and <b>Lending</b> market, we find that short sellers with private information prefer to trade in the opaque market, with momentum and risk-bearing trading strategies prefer to trade in the semi-transparent market, and with urgent liquidity needs (such as short-squeezed short sellers) prefer to trade in the transparent market. We show that transactions in both transparent and opaque markets contain information and provide liquidity. Our results indicate that parallel markets complement each other by serving different types of investors. The second essay (Chapter 3) shows {{that the presence of}} <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> supply before an initial public offering (IPO) reduces the initial stock return following IPO and improves the subsequent long-run performance. We use a sample of British firms that went public via a two-stage IPO procedure where a firm becomes publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange in the first stage, and offers new shares to the public in the second stage. Stocks are lendable before the new equity issuance which relaxes the short sale constraints that investors typically face in a conventional IPO. We find that twostage offerings with higher <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> supply before offering are associated with lower IPO underpricing and better long-run performance. Our results are consistent with the conjecture that short selling improves the pricing efficiency of the IPO market. The third essay (Chapter 4) examines the effect of short sellers as arbitrageurs on market liquidity in cases of toxic and non-toxic arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrage opportunities can be toxic when the prices of an asset-pair adjust to information at different speeds. In this case, market makers increase spread to avoid being picked off by informed arbitrageurs. Using price-parity deviations of Canadian stocks cross-listed in the U. S. market as arbitrage opportunities identifiers, we document that short arbitrageurs provide liquidity to the market in general, but impair liquidity in cases of toxic relative to non-toxic arbitrage opportunities. We also show that the liquidity impairment effect of short arbitrageurs is stronger when limits to arbitrage are high...|$|R

40|$|There {{are some}} {{statistical}} anomalies in the Chinese stock market, i. e., positive return skewness, anti-leverage effect (positive returns induce higher volatility than negative returns); and reverse volatility asymmetry (contemporaneous return-volatility correlation is positive). In this paper, we first confirm {{the existence of}} these anomalies using daily firm-level stock return data on the raw returns, excess returns and normalized excess returns. We empirically show that the asymmetry response of investors to news is one cause of the statistical anomalies if short sales are constrained. Then in the context of slow adoption of <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> policy, we conduct panel analysis and empirically verify that the lifting of short sale constraints leads to significantly less skewness, less anti-leverage effect and less reverse volatility asymmetry. Positive skewness is a feature of lottery. Investors are encouraged to bet on the upside lottery like potentials in the Chinese markets where the stocks skew more to the upside when short sales are constrained.
