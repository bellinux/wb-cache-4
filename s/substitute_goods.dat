500|$|Nurkse {{states that}} if {{demand for the}} output of one sector rises, due to the {{complementary}} nature of demand, the demand for the output of other industries will also experience a rise. Paul Rosenstein-Rodan spoke of a similar concept called [...] "indivisibility of demand" [...] which hypothesises that if large investments are made in {{a large number of}} industries simultaneously, an underdeveloped economy can become developed due to the phenomenon of complementary demand. However, both Nurkse and Rosenstein-Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce complementary goods. There are <b>substitute</b> <b>goods</b> too, which are in competition with each other. Thus if the state pumps in large investments into the car industry, for example, it will naturally lead to a rise in the demand for petrol. But if the state makes large scale investments in the coffee sector of a country, the tea sector will suffer.|$|E

Following the law of demand, the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.|$|E
2500|$|When {{consumers}} {{increase the}} quantity demanded {{at a given}} price, it {{is referred to as}} an increase in demand. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve D1 to the new curve D2. In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from P1 to the higher P2. This raises the equilibrium quantity from Q1 to the higher Q2. [...] A movement along the curve is described as a [...] "change in the quantity demanded" [...] to distinguish it from a [...] "change in demand," [...] that is, a shift of the curve. [...] there has been an increase in demand which has caused an increase in (equilibrium) quantity. [...] The increase in demand could also come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and <b>substitute</b> <b>goods,</b> market expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. [...] Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in movement along the supply curve from the point (Q1, P1) to the point (Q2, P2).|$|E

50|$|When income increases, {{the demand}} curve for normal goods shifts outward as {{more will be}} demanded at all prices, while the demand curve for {{inferior}} goods shifts inward due to the increased attainability of superior substitutes. With respect to related goods, {{when the price of}} a good (e.g. a hamburger) rises, the demand curve for <b>substitute</b> <b>goods</b> (e.g. chicken) shifts out, while the demand curve for complementary goods (e.g. tomato sauce) shifts in (i.e. there is more demand for <b>substitute</b> <b>goods</b> as they become more attractive in terms of value for money, while demand for complementary goods contracts in response to the contraction of quantity demanded of the underlying good).|$|E

When a given firm has {{the possibility of}} merging with either a complement or a <b>substitute</b> <b>good</b> producer, its equilibrium choice depends {{on the degree of}} product differentiation in the composite good market. A merger between complements, which allows for mixed bundling, only happens when composite goods are very differentiated.
