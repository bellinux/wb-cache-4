That is, these Soil <b>Screening</b> <b>Levels</b> are just one of three sets of criteria that should be evaluated to determine if a site is low-threat. The Soil <b>Screening</b> <b>Levels</b> discussed in this document have been developed for benzene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to define sites that are low-threat with respect to “direct contact ” with soil and inhalation of soil emissions. The exposure pathways considered in the site conceptual model are: ingestion of soil, dermal contact with soil and inhalation of dust and volatile emissions from soil. Note these exposure pathways are assumed to occur simultaneously, i. e., the <b>screening</b> <b>levels</b> are protective of the cumulative exposure from all four exposure pathways. Standard USEPA risk assessment equations were used to derive the <b>screening</b> <b>levels.</b> The exposure parameter values, chemical toxicity values, and chemical fate and transport properties are based on standard values used in California.

To this end, the land surface scheme is first validated against the Oklahoma Atmospheric Surface Layer Instrumentation System measurements with necessary refinements to the forward model implemented.

The retrieval scheme is robust when subjected to observational errors with magnitudes comparable to instrument accuracy and for initial guess errors larger than typical model forecast errors.

The daytime observations are more informative compared to nocturnal observations. An assimilation window as narrow as four hours, if centered on local noon, contains comparable information to an expanded window covering the whole day.

Observations analyzed by Parker [2004] show similar long-term trends for calm and windy conditions at night, and on basis of this {{it was suggested that}} the possible effect of urban heat effects on long-term temperature trends are small. On the other hand, a simplified analytic model study by Pielke and Matsui [2005, henceforth PM 05] suggests that at night the resultant long-term temperature trends over land should depend on height and strongly on wind speed (mostly due to alterations in the rate of nocturnal cooling in the stable boundary layer (SBL)).
