5|$|The riff was {{recorded}} with Krugman's Gibson ES-175 guitar, which was {{run through a}} Music Man 410 combo amplifier, and Dharma's vocals were captured with a Telefunken U47 tube microphone. The guitar solo and guitar rhythm sections were recorded in one take, while a four-track tape machine amplified them on the recording. <b>Sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Shelly Yakus remembers piecing together the separate vocals, guitar and rhythm section into a master track, with the overdubbing occurring in that order.|$|E

5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.|$|E

5|$|After {{transitioning}} {{away from}} being a cover band, the group quickly gained popularity in the Puerto Rican reggae scene. Cultura Profética began performing in major reggae festivals and opening for Jamaican reggae musician Don Carlos. The band's first album, Canción de Alerta (1998), was recorded in the Tuff Gong studios at Jamaica with Errol Brown, frontman of Hot Chocolate and Bob Marley's <b>sound</b> <b>engineer.</b> The group was the first Spanish-language act to record in Marley's studios. The record discusses a number of social issues in Puerto Rico, including the importance of acknowledging the island's African influence.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of his Sendiri tour, Chrisye began to explore the {{possibility}} of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa. On the condition that they use an Australian orchestra to provide backing music, Gutawa agreed to an acoustic-flavoured album. Aciu also agreed, despite the expected cost of Rp 600 million (US$70,000). After basic recording in Jakarta, Chrisye, Gutawa, and <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Dany Lisapali spent two weeks in Studio 301 in Sydney finishing off the album. The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music; the mixing and mastering was also completed in Sydney. AkustiChrisye was released in 1996 and sold well.|$|E

5|$|L.A. Woman is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American rock band the Doors, {{released}} on April 19, 1971, on Elektra Records. It {{is the last}} to feature the group's lead singer, Jim Morrison, who died {{three months after the}} album's release. It saw the band continue to integrate elements of blues back into their music, a direction begun with their previous album, Morrison Hotel. It was also recorded without record producer Paul A. Rothchild after he fell out with the group over the perceived lack of quality of their studio performances. Subsequently, the band co-produced the album with longtime <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Bruce Botnick.|$|E
5|$|Marquee Moon is the 1977 debut studio album by American {{rock band}} Television. In the years {{leading up to}} the album, the group had become a {{prominent}} act on the New York music scene and generated interest from a number of record labels. Television rehearsed extensively in preparation for Marquee Moon and, after signing to Elektra Records, recorded the album at A & R Recording in September 1976. It was produced by the band's frontman Tom Verlaine and <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Andy Johns.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} of August 1968, Deep Purple entered De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, with {{producer}} Derek Lawrence and <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Brian Aintsworth, who had both worked on their previous album. Tetragrammaton's advance of $250,000 {{had been used to}} book two weeks in the studio, a time which covered songwriting, rehearsals and recording sessions. Time was granted in larger amount than for the making of Shades of Deep Purple in May, feeding the band’s ambition of coming up with better original material than their previous effort.|$|E

5|$|After {{escaping}} from custody, Roger uses Billy {{to communicate and}} send scripts to Penny. When rewriting one of the programs, Gork: Son of Fire, Roger attempts to write the script with self-referential events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. Roger and Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a biplane shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Nemescu also started the {{production}} of California Dreamin. The filming {{took place in the}} June–August interval. By the end of August, the film was nearing its completion; on August 24, 2006, however, Nemescu and Andrei Toncu (<b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> for the new project as well) died in a car accident in Bucharest. Following the accident, the Romanian public, as well as those from abroad, offered wider attention to the productions of the two cineasts, including Marilena from P7, their first notable success. One year after the accident, the event was commemorated in the country through various displays, public meetings and debates. On August 24, 2007, Marilena from P7 had its premiere at Stockholm during the second Romanian Film Days. Romanian people, from the diaspora, as well as Swedish spectators, were present.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E

5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E
5|$|With {{his budget}} {{concerns}} alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, where on February 3, 1967, {{he and the}} Experience met <b>sound</b> <b>engineer</b> Eddie Kramer. During Kramer's first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method {{that they had been}} using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell's drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding's bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer's unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix's complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then pre-mixed and reduced the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix's perfectionism and Chandler's desire {{to reduce the number of}} takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix's guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, the microphones had been placed about twelve feet away from Hendrix's amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyer M1 60 ribbon microphones, which were typically not used to record loud music.|$|E
