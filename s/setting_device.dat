40|$|Cities {{depend on}} {{multiple}} heterogeneous, interconnected infrastructures to provide safe water to consumers. Given this complexity, efficient numerical techniques {{are needed to}} support optimal control and management of a water distribution network (WDN). This paper introduces a holistic analysis framework to support water utilities on the decision making process for an efficient supply management. The proposal is based on graph spectral techniques that take advantage of eigenvalues and eigenvectors properties of matrices {{that are associated with}} graphs. Instances of these matrices are the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian, among others. The interest for this application is to work on a graph that specifically represents a WDN. This is a complex network that is made by nodes corresponding to water sources and consumption points and links corresponding to pipes and valves. The aim is to face new challenges on urban water supply, ranging from computing approximations for network performance assessment to <b>setting</b> <b>device</b> positioning for efficient and automatic WDN division into district metered areas.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of using a disposable, self-administered, capillary blood sampling oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) device in a community setting. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighteen healthy and 12 type 2 diabetic volunteers underwent six 75 -g OGTTs using a prototype device in the following three settings: unaided at home (twice); unaided but observed in clinic (twice); and performed by a nurse with simultaneous laboratory glucose assays of 0 - and 120 -min venous plasma samples (twice). The device displayed no results. A detachable data recorder returned to the clinic provided plasma-equivalent 0 - and 120 -min glucose values and key parameters, including test date, start and end times, and time taken to consume the glucose drink. RESULTS: The device was universally popular with participants and was perceived as easy to use, {{and the ability to}} test at home was well liked. Device failures meant that 0 - and 120 -min glucose values were obtained for only 141 (78 %) of the 180 OGTTs performed, independent of <b>setting.</b> <b>Device</b> glucose measurements showed a mean bias compared with laboratory-measured values of + 0. 9 at 5. 0 mmol/L increasing to + 4. 4 at 15. 0 mmol/L.

CONCLUSIONS: Self-administered OGTTs can be performed successfully by untrained individuals in a community setting.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{the impact of}} energy {{quantisation}} in single electron transistor (SET) island {{on the performance of}} hybrid complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) -SET transistor circuits has been studied. It has been shown through simple analytical models that energy quantisation primarily increases the Coulomb Blockade area and Coulomb Blockade oscillation periodicity of the <b>SET</b> <b>device</b> and thus influences the performance of hybrid CMOS-SET circuits. A novel computer aided design (CAD) framework has been developed for hybrid CMOS-SET co-simulation, which uses Monte Carlo (MC) simulator for <b>SET</b> <b>devices</b> along with conventional SPICE for metal oxide semiconductor devices. Using this co-simulation framework, the effects of energy quantisation have been studied for some hybrid circuits, namely, SETMOS, multiband voltage filter and multiple valued logic circuits.

40|$|Spread Spectrum (SS) communication, {{initially}} {{designed for}} military applications, {{is now the}} basis for many of today's advanced communications systems such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global Positioning System (GPS), Wireless Local Loop (WLL), etc. For effective communication {{to take place in}} systems using SS modulation, the Pseudo-random Noise (PN) code used at the receiver to despread the received signal must be identical and be synchronised with the PN code that was used to spread the signal at the transmitter. Synchronisation is done in two steps: coarse synchronisation or acquisition, and fine synchronisation or tracking. Acquisition involves obtaining a coarse estimate of the phase shift between the transmitted PN code and that at the receiver so that the received PN code will be aligned or synchronised with the locally generated PN code. After acquisition, tracldng is now done which involves maintaining the alignment of the two PN codes. This thesis presents results of the research calTied out on a proposed adaptive PN code acquisition circuit designed to improve the synchronisation process in Direct Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) systems. The acquisition circuit is implemented using a Matched Filter (MF) for the correlation operation and the threshold <b>setting</b> <b>device</b> is an adaptive processor known as the Cell Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) processor. It is a double dwell acquisition circuit where the second dwell is implemented by Post Detection Integration (PDI). Depending on the application, PDI can be used to mitigate the effect of frequency offset in non-coherent detectors and/or in the implementation of multiple dwell acquisition systems. Equations relating the performance measures - the probability of false alarm (Pra), the probability of detection (P d) and the mean acquisition time (E {Tacq}) - of the circuit are deri ved. Monte Carlo simulation was used for the independent validation of the theoretical results obtained, and the strong agreement between these results shows the accuracy of the derived equations for the proposed circuit. Due to the combination of PDI and CA-CFAR processor in the implementation of the circuit, results obtained show that it can provide a good measure of robustness to frequency offset and noise power variations in mobile environment, consequently leading to improved acquisition time performance. The complete synchronisation circuit is realised by using this circuit in conjunction with a conventional code tracking circuit. Therefore, a study of a Non-coherent Delay-Locked Loop (NDLL) code tracking circuit is also calTied out. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
