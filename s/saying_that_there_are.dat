5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead {{to say that there}} are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.|$|E
500|$|Q {{magazine}} {{had mixed}} reactions to 1987, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> [...] "too few ideas being spread too thin". The magazine criticised some songs as [...] "overlong" [...] and questioned the overuse of sampling as [...] "the {{impression of a}} random hotchpotch". Q also unfavourably commented that The JAMs' [...] "use of the beatbox is altogether weedy". It liked some of its tracks: [...] "there are some wickedly amusing ideas and moments of pure poetry in the lyrics {{while some of the}} musical juxtapositions are both killingly funny and strong enough to stand repeated listenings".|$|E

500|$|The film {{presents}} {{human trafficking}} statistics and assertions {{from a variety}} of sources, prominently departments of the United States government and the United Nations. These include that human trafficking is growing faster than any other criminal industry, that the average age of those forced into prostitution in the U.S. is 13, that the commercial sexual exploitation of children victimizes almost two million children globally, that 80% of trafficked women and 50% of trafficked children are sexually exploited, that 161 UN member states engage in human trafficking, and that modern slavery has an annual revenue of —according to the film, higher than the annual revenues of Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League and the National Hockey League combined. The film indicates that [...] "trafficking is an exploitation of vulnerability" [...] and expresses the need to [...] "take away the stigma that [...] choose to be there." [...] Kevin Bales of Free the Slaves is quoted as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 27 million slaves in the world. The film ends with the assertion that only Jesus can free people from sexual slavery.|$|E

[...] He also advocates investigating why the various intelligence agencies could not collaborate on information to prevent the attacks while spending $40 billion per year. He has called the 9/11 Commission Report a [...] "charade", saying [...] "spending more money abroad or restricting liberties at home will do nothing to deter terrorists, yet this is exactly what the 9–11 Commission recommends." ...|$|E

Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said [...] "Allan inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air...People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled.

60|$|This is {{the real}} meaning of that mystery which appears so {{prominently}} {{in the lives of}} great sceptics, which appears with especial prominence in the life of Charles II. I mean their constant oscillation between atheism and Roman Catholicism. Roman Catholicism is indeed a great and fixed and formidable system, but so is atheism. Atheism is indeed the most daring of all dogmas, more daring than the vision of a palpable day of judgment. For it is the assertion of a universal negative; for a man {{to say that there is}} no God in the universe is like <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no insects in any of the stars.|$|E
60|$|When I so pressingly urge {{a strict}} {{observance}} {{of all the}} laws, let me not be understood as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no bad laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do {{mean to say that}} although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay, but till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne with.|$|E
60|$|To {{pass on to}} {{the more}} general remarks which you are {{accustomed}} to expect from the President of the Institute on this occasion. When I consulted one of your townsmen as to the subject which he thought would be most useful and most interesting to you, he said: 'Pray talk about anything you please, if it is only not Education.' There is a <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two kinds of foolish people in the world, those who give advice, {{and those who do}} not take it. My friend and I in this matter represent these two interesting divisions of the race, for in spite of what he said, it is upon Education after all that I propose to offer you some short observations. You will believe it no affectation on my part, when I say that I shall do so with the sincerest willingness to be corrected by those of wider practical experience in teaching. I am well aware, too, that I have very little that is new to say, but education is one of those matters on which much that has already been said will long bear saying over and over again.|$|E

60|$|He went off, and Rowland {{stayed there}} alone. He watched for seven long hours, and his vigil was forever memorable. The most {{rational}} of men was {{for an hour}} the most passionate. He reviled himself with transcendent bitterness, he accused himself of cruelty and injustice, he would have lain down there in Roderick's place to unsay the words that had yesterday driven him forth on his lonely ramble. Roderick had been fond of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> such things as necessary follies, and Rowland was now proving it. At last he grew almost used to the dumb exultation of the cliff above him. He saw that Roderick was a mass of hideous injury, {{and he tried to}} understand what had happened. Not that it helped him; before that confounding mortality one hypothesis after another faltered and swooned away. Roderick's passionate walk had carried him farther and higher than he knew; he had outstayed, supposably, the first menace of the storm, and perhaps even found a defiant entertainment in watching it. Perhaps he had simply lost himself. The tempest had overtaken him, and when he tried to return, it was too late. He had attempted to descend the cliff in the darkness, he had made the inevitable slip, and whether he had fallen fifty feet or three hundred little mattered. The condition of his body indicated the shorter fall. Now that all was over, Rowland understood how exclusively, for two years, Roderick had filled his life. His occupation was gone.|$|E
60|$|The chapter On the Antiquity of Jests, {{with its}} {{suggestion}} of an International Exhibition of Jokes, is capital. Such an exhibition, Mr. Matthews remarks, {{would at least}} dispel any lingering belief in the old <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only thirty-eight good stories in existence and that thirty-seven of these cannot be told before ladies; and the Retrospective Section would certainly be the constant resort of any true folklorist. For most of the good stories of our time are really folklore, myth survivals, echoes of the past. The two well-known American proverbs, 'We have had {{a hell of a}} time' and 'Let the other man walk' are both traced back by Mr. Matthews: the first to Walpole's letters, and the other to a story Poggio tells of an inhabitant of Perugia who walked in melancholy because he could not pay his debts. 'Vah, stulte,' was the advice given to him, 'leave anxiety to your creditors!' and even Mr. William M. Evart's brilliant repartee when he was told that Washington once threw a dollar across the Natural Bridge in Virginia, 'In those days a dollar went so much farther than it does now!' seems to be the direct descendant of a witty remark of Foote's, though we must say that in this case we prefer the child to the father. The essay On the French Spoken by Those who do not Speak French is also cleverly written and, indeed, on every subject, except literature, Mr. Matthews is well worth reading.|$|E
6000|$|He spoke very slightingly of Kotzebue, as an immoral {{author in}} the first place, and next, as {{deficient}} in power. At Vienna, said he, they are transported with him; {{but we do not}} reckon the people of Vienna either the wisest or the wittiest people of Germany. He said Wieland was a charming author, and a sovereign master of his own language: that in this respect Goethe could not be compared to him, nor indeed could any body else. He said that his fault was to be fertile to exuberance. I told him the OBERON had just been translated into English. He asked me if I was not delighted with the poem. I answered, that I thought the story began to flag about the seventh or eighth book; and observed, that it was unworthy of a man of genius to make the interest of a long poem turn entirely upon animal gratification. He seemed at first disposed to excuse this by <b>saying,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> different subjects for poetry, and that poets are not willing to be restricted in their choice. I answered, that I thought the passion of love as well suited to the purposes of poetry as any other passion; but that it was a cheap way of pleasing to fix the attention of the reader through a long poem on the mere appetite. Well! but, said he, you see, that such poems please every body. I answered, that it was the province of a great poet to raise people up to his own level, not to descend to theirs. He agreed, and confessed, that on no account whatsoever would he have written a work like the OBERON. He spoke in raptures of Wieland's style, and pointed out the passage where Retzia is delivered of her child, as exquisitely beautiful.[234] ...|$|E
