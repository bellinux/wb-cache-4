40|$|The New Zealand flower thrips, Thrips obscuratus (Crawford) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is an {{important}} seasonal pest of peaches infesting flowers during spring and mature fruit prior to, and during fruit harvest. Thrips numbers were monitored during peach flowering and prior to fruit harvest in a 160 tree experimental orchard, using water traps, sticky traps on tree limbs, and by direct sampling of flowers and fruit. Thrips numbers in water traps in the spring were low compared to summer samples. Adult thrips were found in peach flowers from pink to <b>shuck</b> <b>fall</b> with peak numbers during full bloom. Relatively low numbers of thrips were caught on sticky traps placed on tree stems in the spring which supports the notion that thrips numbers in the spring are low. Very high numbers of thrips (> 1, 000 thrips/ trap/ week) were caught in water traps prior to, and during fruit harvest. Adult thrips were found on peach fruit from three weeks prior to harvest with peak numbers at full fruit ripeness. During rain thrips moved to protected areas {{on the bottom of}} the fruit presumably to avoid being washed off the fruit. The association between thrips and Monilinia fructicola (Winter) Honey inoculum sites was studied using sticky traps placed near twig cankers and fruit mummies, and by counting thrips numbers on brown rot diseased sporulating fruit. Adult thrips were caught on sticky traps placed near brown rot infected twig cankers in the spring and summer, and on sticky traps placed near brown rot infected fruit mummies in the spring. Spring sticky trap catches showed a similar trend to water trap catches with peak thrips numbers caught in traps when the flowers were at or near <b>shuck</b> <b>fall.</b> Summer sticky trap catches were much higher than spring catches. Thrips were found on brown rot infected sporulating peach fruit in comparable numbers to thrips found on healthy peach fruit. Peak numbers of adult thrips were found on diseased fruit with a low sporulation severity. At high sporulation severities few thrips were found on diseased fruit. A thrips-washing method was developed and viable M. fructicola spores were enumerated on thrips removed from twig cankers, fruit mummies, and fruit exhibiting sporulating brown rot lesions. Two methods were developed to follow thrips dispersal of M. fructicola in and between peach trees in the spring and summer. Feeding thrips rubidium and assaying thrips for rubidium content was feasible in the laboratory, but due to the high number of thrips required for field experiments and associated difficulties in feeding large numbers of thrips rubidium, the method was not suitable for following thrips dispersal in the field. Thrips treated with spores of a fungicide-resistant strain of M. fructicola dispersed spores to flowers and fruit in the field with disease resulting. In all experiments most fungicide-resistant strain diseased flowers and fruit were found on the tree the thrips had been released onto, followed by trees in the same row as the release tree, and then across tree rows. Controlled environment studies showed increasing brown rot disease incidence and severity in flowers with increasing numbers of thrips per flower and increasing spore loads on the thrips. Thrips deposited spores onto fungicide-treated fruit which resulted in disease, thereby apparently negating the benefits of fungicide protection. A field experiment was conducted to compare the incidence of brown rot disease in peaches at harvest in the presence and absence of thrips. Brown rot disease incidence on fruit at harvest where thrips were excluded by using an insecticide was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than on fruit where water was applied and thrips numbers were higher. Laboratory experiments showed that thrips did not predispose flowers to infection and disease as thrips applied as a pre-treatment to flowers prior to M. fructicola spore application did not increase disease incidence. A possible explanation for this was the high susceptibility of flowers to infection. A single spore application method was developed and single spores were found to act independently in the infection process, with only one spore required for flower infection. There were differences found in the susceptibility of flower parts to infection with filaments being the most susceptible to infection followed by anthers, stigmas, and petals. The practical implications of thrips dispersal of M. fructicola were discussed as thrips were shown to be {{an important}} factor in brown rot epidemiology in Canterbury peach orchards...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand {{flower thrips}} (Thrips obscuratus (Crawford)) is an {{important}} pest of stonefruit during flowering and at harvest in New Zealand. The biology and control of this species {{formed the basis for}} this study. A simple method for laboratory rearing is described that facilitated studies on the bionomics of T. obscuratus. Aspects of reproduction, fecundity, requirements for oviposition and development, development rates, temperature thresholds, thermal constants, and lifespan are detailed. T. obscuratus has been reported from at least 223 endemic and introduced plant species. Larvae were taken from 49 species around Canterbury. Adults were usually found on flowers but were also common on leaves and fruits. All larvae were on flowers except for two records from the fruit of stonefruit. The number and species of thrips infesting sprayed and unsprayed stonefruit flowers and fruit were determined. Adults and larvae were almost all T. obscuratus and adults were mostly female. Adults and larvae of thrips were found in stonefruit flowers from pink to <b>shuck</b> <b>fall.</b> Adults were found in similar numbers throughout flower development. Larvae were almost entirely absent at pink; numbers were small at full bloom and peaked at or just after petal fall. Thrips adults, eggs and larvae were all common on peaches, nectarines and apricots. Thrips were most numerous on ripe fruit, although they were found on fruit for the local market up to three weeks before harvest. Thrips numbers were highest on stonefruit varieties ripening during December and January and lowest on varieties ripening during February, March and April, and were higher on peaches than apricots and nectarines. Sources of T. obscuratus infestations were probably from flowers {{in the vicinity of the}} orchard. Pupation sites for T. obscuratus were established as including the soil and litter beneath a flowering cabbage tree (Cordyline australis). Female T. obscuratus were parasitised and sterilised by a nematode thought to be Howardula aptini. Flying thrips were sampled inside and outside stonefruit blocks from September 1984 to August 1987. Several species including T. obscuratus, Thrips tabaci, Limothrips cerealium and Haplothrips niger were common. A broad pattern of the seasonal abundance of T. obscuratus was apparent from water trap samples. Thrips numbers were lowest in winter and low in spring, but increased gradually during summer. Numbers peaked in midsummer but declined suddenly in mid to late January. Numbers remained moderate to low throughout late summer and autumn. Seasonal abundance could be largely explained by the interrelationship of temperature, soil moisture and availability of host plants. Flight take-off thresholds of 15 Â°C were established from weekly water trap samples for both male and female T. obscuratus adults. Both adults and larvae of T. obscuratus were found on hosts throughout the year, but were most common in early summer. There was no reproductive diapause for T. obscuratus females collected from the field in winter. In field experiments T. obscuratus males and females showed a preference for white without U. V., and to a lesser extent yellow, compared to green, blue, black and red. Traps baited with ethyl nicotinate caught significantly more T. obscuratus males and females than traps baited with anisaldehyde, benzaldehyde, peach juice, peach fruit and unbaited traps. An insecticide trial investigated the protection of nectarine flowers from thrips infestation and damage, using the insecticides fluvalinate or phosalone (low toxicity to bees) applied at full bloom as supplements to the current recommended spray programme. Thrips numbers were reduced, and export packout (based on russet only) was 10 % higher for trees treated at full bloom than for those treated only with the recommended spray programme. Several varieties of ripe stonefruit picked at maturity for the local market and which had received only periodic applications of carbaryl were infested with adults, eggs and larvae. The application of low rates of fluvalinate for preharvest control of thrips on peach fruit was investigated. Peaches were sampled for thrips at local market maturity ('Redhaven') and export market maturity ('Flamecrest'). Low rates of fluvalinate (20 % to 5 % of field rates) reduced thrips infestation on both varieties. On 'Flamecrest' one application of fluvalinate at 10 % field rate, 15 days before harvest, was more effective at reducing thrips infestation than the current recommended spray programme.. The management of T. obscuratus on stonefruit in Canterbury is reviewed in relation to previous research and knowledge gained from this study...|$|E
