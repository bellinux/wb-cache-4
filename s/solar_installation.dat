25|$|Sunday Solar Energy was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} <b>solar</b> <b>installation</b> for the Carmey Avdat winery in the Negev Desert. The 50kW peak installation covers the 200-square meter roof of the winery and provides 65 percent of its annual energy needs.|$|E
25|$|A 46kW <b>solar</b> <b>{{installation}}</b> with battery storage at the Motufoua Secondary School on Vaitupu {{island was}} brought online on 27 November 2009. At {{the date of}} installation it was described as the largest diesel-solar photovoltaic (PV) hybrid electricity system in the South Pacific. Prior to the installment of the system the residential school relied upon a diesel powered generator, which needed to be turned off during the night. The hybrid system systems saves {{thousands of dollars in}} diesel costs and provides the school with a 24-hour supply of energy, with up to 200kW per day.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2014, ASU {{was the top}} {{institution}} {{of higher education in}} the United States for solar generating capacity. Today, the university generates over 24 megawatts (MW) of electricity from on-campus solar arrays. This is an increase over the June 2012 total of 15.3 MW. ASU has 88 solar photovoltaic (PV) installations containing 81,424 solar panels across four campuses and the ASU Research Park. An additional 29 MWdc <b>solar</b> <b>installation</b> was dedicated at Red Rock, Arizona in January 2017, bringing the university's solar generating capacity to 50 MWdc.|$|E

2500|$|Solar {{and wind}} power are {{extremely}} scalable, {{as there are}} systems available from less than 1 watt to several megawatts. This {{makes it possible to}} initialize the electrification of a home or village with minimal initial capital. It also allows for dynamic and incremental scaling as load demands increases. [...] The component configuration of a wind or <b>solar</b> <b>installation</b> also provides a level of functional redundancy, improving the reliability of the system. If a single panel in a multi panel solar array is damaged, the rest of the system continues functioning unimpeded. In a similar way, the failure of a single wind tower in a multi tower configuration does not cause a system level failure.|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) solar {{electricity}} generation {{has the potential}} to reduce the demand for more traditional fossil and nuclear power generation. Community PV <b>solar</b> <b>installations</b> allow energy users to share the electricity generated by these plants. Optimal siting of community <b>solar</b> <b>installations</b> will allow for maximum electricity generation while avoiding environmental conflicts, as well as, minimizing construction costs. This study identifies opportunities for community solar plants in Maricopa and Pinal Counties, Arizona, of ¼-acre in size. Input parameters fall into economic, physical, and environmental categories. Each of the input parameters were classified from 1 (not suitable) to 9 (highly suitable). Next, the classified rasters in each category were weighed according to importance, and Esri’s Weighted Sum tool was used to generate a combined raster for the category. The three resulting environmental, economic, and physical characteristic rasters were weighed again, and the Weighted Sum tool was used to generate a raster of community solar suitability scores. Next, a mask of locations inappropriate for community-scale solar development was created, including lakes, rivers, streams, and residential rooftops, which are too small to accommodate ¼-acre community <b>solar</b> <b>installations.</b> The masked areas were removed from the suitability raster, and the suitability raster was reclassified using standard deviations to generate a preference map with values ranging from 1 (low preference) to 3 (high preference). The model output reveals 68 percent of the study area is of medium or high preference for community <b>solar</b> <b>installations.</b> Maricopa and Pinal counties provide many opportunities for community <b>solar</b> <b>installations...</b>|$|R
