5|$|Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again is a 1983 James Bond spy film {{starring}} Sean Connery, {{directed by}} Irvin Kershner, produced by Jack Schwartzman, and written by Lorenzo Semple Jr. with uncredited additional co-writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, from {{a story by}} Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming. It is the second adaptation of Fleming's Thunderball, which was previously adapted as the 1965 film of the same name. Unlike the majority of James Bond films, Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again was not produced by Eon Productions, but by an independent production company, one of whose members was Kevin McClory, {{one of the original}} writers of the Thunderball story, who retained the filming rights of the novel following a legal dispute over them.|$|E
5|$|Octopussy had {{its premiere}} on 6 June 1983, {{four months before}} the October release of Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again. From its budget of $27.5million, Octopussy took $183.7million at the box office, a figure which saw it surpass the takings of its Connery-led rival, which took $160million.|$|E

5|$|Octopussy was {{produced}} by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, and was released {{in the same year}} as the non-Eon Bond film Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again. The film was written by George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum, and Michael G. Wilson, and was directed by John Glen.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December 1997, MGM {{announced}} {{that the company had}} purchased the rights to Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again from Schwartzman's company Taliafilm. The company has since handled the release of both the DVD and Blu-ray editions of the film.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{released}} Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again on VHS and Betamax in 1984, and on laserdisc in 1995. After Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{purchased the}} distribution rights in 1997 (see Legacy, below), {{the company has}} released the film on both VHS and DVD in 2001, and on Blu-ray in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 Casino Royale {{was adapted}} into a parody Bond film {{starring}} David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's {{preference for the}} role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, {{was not part of the}} Eon series of Bond films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again from Taliafilm. As of 2015, Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.|$|E
5|$|Independently of the Eon series, {{there have}} been three {{additional}} productions with the character of James Bond: a 1954 American television adaptation, Casino Royale, produced by CBS; a 1967 spoof, Casino Royale, produced by Charles K. Feldman; and a 1983 remake of Thunderball entitled Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again, produced by Jack Schwartzman, who had obtained the rights to the film from McClory.|$|E
5|$|Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again had {{its origins}} in the early 1960s {{following}} {{the controversy over the}} 1961 Thunderball novel, which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of the same name. Part of the agreement between McClory and Eon was that McClory would not make any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the 1965 Thunderball.|$|E

5|$|Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again was {{released}} by Warner Bros. in October 1983, opening to positive reviews and was a commercial success, grossing $160 million at the box office, although less overall than the Eon-produced Octopussy released in the same year. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to date, owns the distribution rights and also distributes Eon's Bond films, and the company has handled subsequent home video releases of the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} the UK premiere of the non-Eon rival Bond film, Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again, Eon {{announced}} that Roger Moore would return as Bond for the seventh time. John Glen also returned as director, while Peter Lamont and John Barry also signed up as they had for Octopussy. Michael G. Wilson co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} loosely adapted in a 1971 film {{starring}} Sean Connery {{and directed by}} Guy Hamilton. Diamonds Are Forever was the final Bond film undertaken by Sean Connery with Eon Productions, although {{he returned to the}} role of Bond twelve years later with Kevin McClory's Taliafilm company for Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again.|$|E
50|$|The {{script was}} written by Theodore Flicker and George Kirgo. They {{originally}} pitched {{the idea of a}} film based on Presley's life, but this was vetoed by Col. Parker. Working titles include <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> No, <b>Never</b> <b>Say</b> Yes, and The Singing Racing Car Driver. Flicker eventually left the project to work on The President's Analyst and Michael Hoey worked on the script uncredited with Kirgo.|$|R

5|$|Although other {{recurring}} {{characters in}} the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the actors, the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven actors playing the role. Only two actors have played the part twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play the part in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey {{in one of the}} non-Eon films, Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} in Japan, it was {{announced}} that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again. You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore.|$|E
5|$|In 1983's Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again, Edward Fox played M as a bureaucrat, {{contemptuous of}} Bond—far {{removed from the}} {{relationship}} shared between Bernard Lee's M and Sean Connery's Bond; the academic Jeremy Black notes that the contempt felt for the 00 section by Fox's M was reciprocated by Connery's Bond. Fox's M is also younger {{than any of the}} previous incarnations. The media historian James Chapman notes that whilst M considers Bond to be an out-dated relic, the Foreign Secretary orders the 00 section to be re-activated.|$|E

5|$|In 1999 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{obtained}} {{the rights to}} the 1967 film Casino Royale from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $10million in the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit. The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the Thunderball novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on Thunderball and had licensed his rights for the production of Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again in 1983. In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Leiter also {{appeared}} in novels by continuation authors, as well as ten films and one television programme, Casino Royale, where the character became a British agent, Clarence Leiter, played by Michael Pate. In the Eon Productions series of films, Leiter has been portrayed by Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, David Hedison, John Terry and Jeffrey Wright; in the independent production Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again, the part was played by Bernie Casey. Leiter has {{also appeared}} in the video game 007 Legends.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{series of}} films contain {{a number of}} repeating, {{distinctive}} motifs which date from the series' inception with Dr. No in 1962. The series consists of twenty four films produced by Eon Productions featuring the James Bond character, a fictional British Secret Service agent. The most recent instalment is the 2015 film Spectre, which was released in UK cinemas on 26 October 2015. There have also been two independently made features, the satirical Casino Royale, released in 1967, and the 1983 film Never <b>Say</b> <b>Never</b> Again.|$|E
