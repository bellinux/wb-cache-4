40|$|Share buy-backs are {{undertaken}} in the {{ordinary course of business}} by EU issuers and each year many of these issuers become the target of a tender offer. The question of significance is whether a target's share buy-backs may obstruct a tender offer in a manipulative manner. The current EU legislative regime, namely the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR, EU 596 / 2014), lacks clarity in this regard, as it includes an open-ended <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>rule</b> under which buy-backs satisfying certain legislative criteria are exempt from the manipulation and insider trading prohibitions. This thesis seeks to investigate whether open market buy-backs by a takeover target constitute prohibited market manipulation under the MAR. The secondary purpose of this thesis is to form an interpretative framework for establishing the conditions under which buy-backs carried out under the <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>rule</b> do not constitute market manipulation, and thirdly, when buy-backs that are engineered to technically comply with the <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>rule</b> are so abusive as to warrant new regulation or teleological interpretation of existing rules. These questions are approached using a law and economics-oriented research method, applying economic concepts to the normative analysis of law and the empirical context. Comparative law is used as a secondary method to gain insights from regulation in the United States. Taking into account both the textual formulation of the US rules and the reasons for adopting them helps to evaluate EU regulation. The evaluation of the regulatory regime focuses on the disclosure of information related to buy-backs in determining when information has been sufficiently disclosed to reduce the gravest of information asymmetries. In addition, the potential coercive effect of target's buy-backs is studied to find out whether the buy-backs carry such market power that might fall in the scope of the prohibition on market manipulation. Particular attention is given to assessing when issuers should feel confident in carrying out buy-backs even during control contests and, conversely, when circumstances deny them the benefit of the safe harbour...|$|E
40|$|The Capital Markets Act of Korea has a {{provision}} expressly recognising the extraterritoriality of the Act. However, the question still remains {{how far the}} reach of the Act extends to cover overseas activities. By reference to the discussions in the United States, this article makes recommendations for the effective and reasonable extraterritoriality of the Act. First, this article proposes to amend the current regulation providing the exemptions from the registration requirements for cross-border offerings. Korea and the United States adopted Regulation IPDS and Regulation S. respectively, to clarify the applicability of the registration requirements to primary offerings in Pore transactions. Unlike Regulation S in the United States, Regulation IPDS in Korea may be interpreted to regulate the offshore offerings causing no harm to domestic investors and markets. In order to avoid unreasonable consequences not intended by the legislator, this article suggests that Regulation IPDS be changed to function as a non-exclusive <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>rule.</b> Second, this article proposes a two-tiered approach for discerning the extraterritorial scope of the antifraud rules under the Capital Markets Act. Although the Capital Markets Act has various categories of antifraud provisions, it is still unclear to what extent these provisions may be applicable in the context of transnational securities fraud. Through consideration of the merits of the current regulatory structure in the United States, this article suggests that a more restrictive view be taken toward suits initiated by private claimants, but that a more permissive view be taken toward enforcement proceedings by public regulators.

40|$|Safe harbour' is {{shorthand}} for {{a bundle of}} privileges in insolvency which are typically afforded to financial institutions. They are remotely comparable to security interests as they provide a financial institution with a considerably better position as compared to other creditors should one of its counterparties fail or become insolvent. <b>Safe</b> <b>harbours</b> have been {{and continue to be}} introduced widely in financial markets. The common rationale for such <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> is that the protection they offer against the fallout of the counterparty’s insolvency contributes to systemic stability, as the dreaded ‘domino effect’ of insolvencies is not triggered from the outset. However, <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> also come in for criticism, being accused of accelerating contagion in the financial market in times of crisis and making the market more risky. This paper submits that the more important argument for the existence of <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> is liquidity in the financial market. <b>Safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>rules</b> do away with a number of legal concepts, notably those attached to traditional security, and thereby allow for the exponentiation of liquidity. Normative decisions of the legislator sanction <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> as modern markets could not exist without these high levels of liquidity. To the extent that <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> accelerate contagion in terms of crisis, which in principle is a valid argument, specific regulation is well suited to correct this situation, whereas to repeal or significantly restrict the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> would be counterproductive...|$|R
40|$|Merger {{approval}} decisions lie at {{the heart}} of competition policies. Farrell and Shapiro (1990) presented a model stating <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>rules</b> for merger approval. In the presence of sequential mergers, however, computation of the sufficient external effect criterion for each merger may not be possible as the second merger will be influenced by the equilibrium emerging from the first. If the mergers are close enough in time, the second merger must be evaluated without the knowledge of the equilibrium point after the first merger. Two alternatives are proposed: joint merger evaluation and independent merger evaluation. The decision errors (too many approvals or rejections) are identified for each of the alternative rules. It is shown that joint merger evaluations generate too many rejections of mergers and independent evaluations lead to too many approvals. antitrust policy; approval rules; Mergers...|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the current {{situation}} of Spanish case law on ISP liability. It starts by presenting the more salient peculiarities of the Spanish transposition of the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> laid down in the E-Commerce Directive. These peculiarities relate to the knowledge requirement of the hosting <b>safe</b> <b>harbour,</b> and to the <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> for information location tools. The article then {{provides an overview of}} the cases decided so far with regard to each of the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours.</b> Very few cases have dealt with the mere conduit and the caching <b>safe</b> <b>harbours,</b> though the latter was discussed in an interesting case involving Google’s cache. Most cases relate to hosting and linking <b>safe</b> <b>harbours.</b> With regard to hosting, the article focuses particularly on the two judgments handed down by the Supreme Court that hold an open interpretation of actual knowledge, an issue where courts had so far been split. Cases involving the linking <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> have mainly dealt with websites offering P 2 P download links. Accordingly, the article explores the legal actions brought against these sites, which for the moment have been unsuccessful. The new legislative initiative to fight against digital piracy – the Sustainable Economy Bill – is also analyzed. After the conclusion, the article provides an Annex listing the cases that have dealt with ISP liability in Spain since the <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> scheme was transposed into Spanish law...|$|R

Most laws provide a <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> to this obligation if acquired data has been encrypted. There are {{three types of}} safe harbour: an exemption; a rebuttable presumption and factor-based analysis. We demonstrate, using three condition-based scenarios, that the broad formulation of most encryption <b>safe</b> <b>harbours</b> {{is based on the}} flawed assumption that encryption is the silver bullet for personal information protection. We then contend that reliance upon an encryption <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> should be dependent upon a rigorous and competent risk-based review that is required on a case-by-case basis. Finally, we recommend the use of both an encryption <b>safe</b> <b>harbour</b> and a notification trigger as our preferred choice for a data breach notification regulatory framework.
