5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies {{were hard to}} come by as the season was purely domestic with no touring Test team, <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E
5|$|Lucius Belyakov is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a Russian soldier. He is also {{revealed}} to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, {{he is also the}} carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson. He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to have a conversation with Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he will know the identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter. Ben reveals to Samson that Management had planned for Ben to kill him <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his powers would pass to Ben. With his last breath, Management tells Ben how to defeat the Usher, Ben's ultimate nemesis.|$|E

25|$|Danish {{public opinion}} {{generally}} backed the new government, particularly {{after the fall}} of France in June 1940. There was a general feeling that the unpleasant reality of German occupation must be confronted in the most realistic way possible, given the international situation. Politicians realized {{that they would have to}} try hard to maintain Denmark's privileged position by presenting a united front to the German authorities, <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the mainstream democratic parties formed a new government together. Parliament and the government agreed to work closely together. Though the effect of this was close to the creation of a one-party state, it remained a representative government.|$|E
25|$|The second {{technique}} for cryoconservation is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without {{the formation of}} crystals. The process and mechanics of vitrification are similar to slow freezing, the difference lying in the concentration of the medium. The vitrification method applies a selected medium which has a higher concentration of solute so the water will leave the cells via osmosis. The medium is concentrated enough <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the intracellular water will leave without the medium needing to be reconcentrated. The higher concentration of the medium in vitrification allows the germplasms to be frozen more rapidly than with slow freezing. Vitrification {{is considered to be}} the more effective technique of freezing germplasms.|$|E

25|$|To counter those claims, Rosas {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} diplomats from the United States, Portugal, Sardinia, Bolivia and France. The British diplomat refused to assist, but the French Mareuil did <b>so.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> them declared unanimously {{that they had no}} complaints about the treatment to foreigners, that they had no knowledge of foreigners forced by terror into the military or to sign petitions, that they had no knowledge of abuses from the Mazorca, and that the information of alleged butcheries in India Muerta was inexact. Rosas included as well a petition signed by 15 000 British and French living in Buenos Aires, protesting against the blockade. Rosas was confident in that this formal declaration, signed by foreign diplomats, would counter the Montevidean propaganda and turn the international opinion to his side.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Jude Law {{arrived at}} the very end of shooting, on 2 April, to film the Imaginarium ladders sequence, which now {{required}} more dialogue than originally planned; a key scene in the Imaginarium wagon between Tony and the rest of the cast had been reserved for the Vancouver interior shooting, and <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the dialogue (and, thus, narrative role of that scene) had to be funnelled into a conversation between Law and Andrew Garfield's characters in the Imaginarium. This conversation proved to be the last sequence shot for the film, and involved a set completely improvised, on the day, to look like the ground at Battersea; they did not have the budget for anything better, but the production crew came away quite impressed at how well it worked.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} war effort, an {{explosives}} factory, ROF Bridgwater, {{was built}} at Puriton. The Catchment Board needed to be able to guarantee that 4.5 million gallons (20.5 Megalitres) of process water would be available to the factory every day. To this end, the Huntspill River was constructed, a little further to the north, which was essentially a revival of a plan by J. Aubrey Clark in 1853, to provide better drainage for the Brue valley. King's Sedgemoor drain was deemed to be a backup source for water, should the Huntspill scheme fail, and <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the work which had been planned before the war started was completed, to ensure that the volume of water needed was always available. Greylake sluice was built by the Somerset Rivers Catchment Board in 1942, and used guillotine gates to control water levels. The original plaque commemorating its completion was incorporated into the new structure when the sluice was rebuilt in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the season the league's coaches voted Georgetown, the 2006-07 Big East regular season and tournament winner, and Louisville to share the conference title. Additionally, it was decided that each team's conference schedule would expand from 16 to 18games <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the teams would play each other. Fifteen Big East teams reached {{the beginning}} of their conference schedules with winning records, with four teams having only one loss and three others with only two losses. The out of conference schedule for the league included four teams playing in the inaugural Big East/SEC Invitational, where they went 3–1, and two teams beating top–10 ranked teams. At the end of conference play, Georgetown, who was ranked tenth in the Coaches Poll, won the regular season title. Six teams ended the season ranked, while eight ended with over 20wins. The top–12teams in the standings were invited to the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, Arthur, as {{an officer}} with the Montreal {{detachment}} of the Rifle Brigade, undertook a year's training and engaged in defending the Dominion from the Fenian Raids; there was initially concern that his personal involvement in Canada's defence might put the Prince in danger from Fenians and their supporters in the United States, but it was decided his military duty was primary. Following his arrival at Halifax, Arthur toured the country for eight weeks and made a visit in January 1870 to Washington, D.C., where he met with President Ulysses S. Grant. During his service in Canada he was also entertained by Canadian society; amongst other activities, he attended an investiture ceremony in Montreal, was a guest at balls and garden parties, and attended the opening of parliament in Ottawa (becoming {{the first member of}} the Royal Family to do <b>so),</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> which was documented in photographs that were sent back for the Queen to view. It was not, however, all social and state functions for Arthur; the Prince was on 25 May 1870 engaged in fending off Fenian invaders during the Battle of Eccles Hill, for which he received the Fenian Medal.|$|E

500|$|On 1 December 2014, Balotelli {{was accused}} of racism and {{antisemitism}} for posting an image on Instagram of the video game character Mario. The image promoted anti-racism by telling others {{to be like the}} character, attributing him qualities stereotypically associated with different ethnicities, ending the idea that he [...] "jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew".

500|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{original}} cast from season one returned {{for the second}} season, including Daniel Baldwin, Ned Beatty, Richard Belzer, Andre Braugher, Clark Johnson, Yaphet Kotto, Melissa Leo, Jon Polito and Kyle Secor. The only permanent cast member not to return was Wendy Hughes, who previously played medical examiner Carol Blythe; her absence was never explained on-screen. While {{the rest of the}} cast was contractually obliged to return, many of them had offers for other films, television shows or plays, and the logistics of arranging their schedules <b>so</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them could return for the show was difficult.

500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{returning}} monsters, the Ice Warriors were not heavily redesigned. Gatiss insisted upon keeping {{the fundamentals of}} the original and Moffat explained that the original design was not well-known enough to put a new spin on it, and so Skaldak's shell is just a [...] "super-version of the original". Of the original design, Millennium FX's Neill Gorton said, [...] "My problem with the old ones is they had Lego hands and weird, spindly arms but a bulky body and these strange saddlebag hips, almost feminine. They had fur sticking out everywhere. <b>So</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> that together didn't suggest [...] "ice warriors." [...] They should be much beefier and stronger. We gave it more of a bodybuilder physique, changed the hands and styled the body {{to make it look}} more like armour-plating, even though it's reptilian." [...] The costume was made of flexible urethane rubber instead of the fibreglass like the original, as it would damage less easily and be more comfortable to wear. The costume was made to specially fit Spencer Wilding. Though only some of the Skaldak's real appearance was shown on-screen, Gorton stated that they created a full animatronic body.|$|E
