5|$|A key {{step in the}} {{majority}} of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E

5|$|Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were {{approached}} to provide tenders {{to design and}} assemble a new combat system for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the Defence Science and Technology Organisation tested operational versions of the proposed combat <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon's. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli Dolphin-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN Los Angeles-class submarine, {{it was decided that}} the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions about the security problems and possible leaks involved with a European combat system linked to American weapons, and desires to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a joint development program with the United States, with a formal agreement signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon.|$|E

40|$|The BACOLI {{package is}} a {{numerical}} <b>software</b> <b>package</b> for solving parabolic partial differential equations in one spatial dimension. It implements a B-spline collocation method for the spatial discretization {{of a system}} of partial differential equations. The resultant ordinary differential equations together with the boundary conditions form a system of differential-algebraic equations. The differential-algebraic equations are then solved using the DASSL solver. The BACOLI <b>software</b> <b>package</b> features adaptive error control in the temporal and spatial domains. The estimate of the temporal error is controlled through the DASSL solver. The estimate of the spatial error is controlled based on the difference between two solutions computed in the BACOLI <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> This difference gives an estimation of the error. If this error estimate does not meet the user-supplied tolerance, then the spatial mesh is changed. The BACOLI <b>software</b> <b>package</b> can only solve parabolic partial differential equations that depend on spatial derivatives. In this thesis, the BACOLI <b>software</b> <b>package</b> is modified to solve a broader spectrum of problems. In fact, after some modifications, the extended BACOLI <b>software</b> <b>package</b> can solve systems of parabolic partial differential equations and time-dependent equations that do not depend on spatial derivatives. We apply this extended <b>software</b> <b>package</b> to solve the monodomain model of cardiac electrophysiology. The monodomain model is a multi-scale mathematical model for the evolution of the electrical potential in cardiac tissue that couples the ionic currents at the cellular scale with their propagation at the tissue scale. Because of their local nature, the mathematical models of a single cell have no dependency on spatial derivatives whereas the models at the tissue level do. The heart models considered in our numerical experiments use various cardiac cell models. We find that solving the heart models through the extended BACOLI <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> in some cases, leads to a speed-up in comparison with the Chaste <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> which is a powerful, widely used, and well-respected <b>software</b> <b>package</b> for heart simulation...|$|R
