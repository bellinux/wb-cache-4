It has also been studied to investigate the effects of these waste materials on the aquatic life. [...] Natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogens,</b> such as oestradiol and oestrone, are present in sewage treatment works effluents. In male fathead minnows, exposure to these steroidal compounds leads to an increase in plasma vitellogenin levels exceeding that of even mature female fathead minnows. Vitellogenin blood plasma levels are an indicator for determining if chemicals have an oestrogenic activity to fish. This is also accompanied by an inhibition of testicular growth, even if the exposure is in low concentrations or {{for a short period of}} time. These studies showed that the presence of natural oestrogens, likely originating from humans, represents a new ecotoxicological issue.|$|E

These changes, which took place more gradually in oestrogen-treated than in normal parturient animals, follow the initial secretion of fluids characterized by high fat and non-fatty solid (S. N.

I determine that there is prima facie evidence to suggest that mares may suffer and that prescription of equine HRT (instead of synthetic oestrogen-oestriol) would therefore have to be justified in terms of either offering greater benefits to the women or offering greater value for money to the health service. I find that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that equine HRT offers unique advantages over and above oestriol.

Forty-two patients, aged 41 - 65 years, without skeletal metastases were studied. The mean duration of tamoxifen administration on a daily dose of 20 mg was 21 months (range 1 - 59 months).

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{communication}} (Robson, Schonberg and Tadros, 1942) a new oestrogen, derived from triphenyl ethylene, was described. This compound has {{the property of}} producing a comparatively prolonged oestrogenic action when administered orally (i. e. by stomach tube) to mice, particularly when given in doses several times the amount necessary to produce a threshold response. It appeared desirable to determine {{what happened to the}} compound following its administration, with special reference to any sites at which it might be stored. It is known that the natural oestrogens (oestradiol, oestrone) are rapidly mac-tivated in the body and this accounts for the relatively short duration of their action. Even when large doses are given only a small percentage can be re-covered from the body tissues and from the excretions.

40|$|The {{developmental}} life {{stages of}} all organisms {{have been demonstrated}} to be especially vulnerable to exposure to exogenous compounds that mimic, modulate or antagonize the action of endogenous hormones. One target for xenoestrogens is the ribonucleoprotein telomerase. Transcription of the ratelimiting telomerase reverse transcriptase [TERT] subunit of telomerase is directly induced via an oestrogen responsive element in the gene's promoter region and oestrogen also modulates Telomerase activity via post-translational modulation of the TERT molecule. This investigation examined the potential for environmentally relevant concentrations of two xenoestrogens, the antioestrogenic therapeutant tamoxifen and the <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen</b> 17 -P-ethinyloestradiol, to modulate telomerase activity in freshly fertilised embryos of the commercially and ecologically important pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Telomerase activity has not previously been demonstrated in C. gigas, therefore {{this was the first}} objective of this investigation. Oysters were strip-spawned and their gametes combined under controlled conditions to yield freshly fertilised embryos that were raised under controlled conditions for 24 hours. Samples were obtained of unfertilised female gametes, 4 hour old embryos and 24 hour old embryos. A second batch of larvae were raised and exposed immediately after fertilisation to 4 different concentrations; 1000, 100, 10 and Ing 1 "^ of both the antioestrogen tamoxifen and the <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen</b> 17 p-ethinyloestradiol, as well as seawater and solvent controls in order to determine their effect upon telomerase activity. Material was pelleted and the seawater removed before washing the pellet with TE buffer and extracting telomerase using the CHAPS lysis buffer that was supplied with the commercially available TRAPeze S 7700 telomerase assay from Chemicon International. Extensive optimisation of the PCR was required in order to produce viable results from the TRAPeze assay and ultimately a reliable and consistent modified protocol was developed. The manufacturer's semiquantitative method did not produce statistically viable data, despite various measures taken to account for potentially confounding artifacts in the gel images produced by the TR^Peze assay. An alternative quantification method was developed although it could not be incontrovertibly validated using the data available. Due to the lack of a validated quantification method no analysis of telomerase activity could be performed although activity was demonstrated in the extracts studied. Such activity confirms that telomerase is conserved almost ubiquitously in eukaryotes and that the crucial role it plays in errorfree cell replication may be vulnerable to perturbation by developmental exposure to xenoestrogens, however {{it was not possible to}} demonstrate such an effect in this investigationSchool of Biological Science...|$|R

40|$|Oestrogens {{are female}} sex hormones. Both natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogens</b> {{have been found}} in many aquatic environments. There are three {{naturally}} occurring oestrogens – oestradiol, estriol and estrone. Oestradiol (correctly known as 17 β oestradiol or E 2) is a naturally occurring steroid hormone and is the most potent of these three. Diethylstilbestrol, dienestrol, quinestrol etc are <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogens.</b> These environmental steroidal and nonsteroidal oestrogens act as endocrine disruptors (EDs). Both types of oestrogens in the environmental samples can be quantified using several laboratory methods such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) etc. but they often require extensive training to perform. Arxula adeninivorans is biotechnologically significant dimorphic yeast with unusual characteristics. It can use a wide range of substrates and it is thermotolerant, osmotolerant and halotolerant. It is a non-pathogenic fungus and is therefore ideal for use in industrial settings. It is a source of many enzymes and a wide range of transformation platforms have been developed to enable the production of foreign proteins. In this project, A. adeninivorans was transformed with histidine-tagged synthetic oestrogen binding protein (EBP) gene based on the Candida albicans EBP sequence. The recombinant EBP expressed in the yeast Arxula is separated using HisTrap columns. Linear sweep voltammetry was used for the detection of EBP redox responses to oestrogen in solution. A three-electrode configuration was used for all measurements [auxiliary electrode (platinum wire), reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) and working electrodes (Pt 50 μm diameter micro-disc and 2 mm diameter glassy carbon) ]. Electron transfer from EBP to electrodes will require the use of a mediator system and TMPD, a lipophilic mediator used in this experiment. Screen printed electrodes (SPEs) were used to detect the interaction between EBP and oestrogen. To perform experiment with SPE, EBP was immobilized on SPE using the crosslinker glutaraldehyde. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to detect interactions of EBP and oestrogen on SPE. Immobilion N transfer membrane was impregnated with TMPD solution and electrochemistry (DPV) was performed. The purpose of using membrane is to simulate the immobilization of TMPD on SPE along with EBP for the detection of oestrogen...|$|E

We conclude that increasing evidence supports the notion that low BPA concentrations adversely affect the epigenome of mammalian female germ cells, with functional consequences on gene expression, chromosome dynamics in meiosis, and oocyte development. Specific time windows, during which profound chromatin remodelling occurs and maternal imprints are established or protected, appear particularly vulnerable to epigenetic deregulation by BPA.

Here we assess the influence of gonadal steroids {{on the ability of}} guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to defend themselves against a common and deleterious parasite (Gyrodactylus turnbulli). Adult male guppies underwent 31 days of artificial demasculinization with the androgen receptor-antagonist flutamide, or feminization with a combination of flutamide and the <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen</b> 17 β-estradiol, and their parasite loads were compared over time to untreated males and females. Both demasculinized and feminized male guppies had lower G. turnbulli loads than the untreated males and females, but this effect appeared to be mainly the result of demasculinization, with feminization having no additional measurable effect. Furthermore, demasculinized males, feminized males and untreated females all suffered lower Gyrodactylus-induced mortality than untreated males. Together, these results suggest that androgens reduce the ability of guppies to control parasite loads, and modulate resistance to and survival from infection. We discuss the relevance of these findings for understanding constraints on the evolution of resistance in guppies and other vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe diverse {{effects of}} {{different}} natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen</b> receptor ligands depend on induction of different receptor conformations, allowing differential interactions with other transcription factors. Different conformations of the oestrogen receptor ligand binding domains can be monitored by conformation-specific binding to peptides selected from phage-displayed peptide libraries. We now report {{that a group}} of chlorinated pesticides, including 2, 4 -dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene, induces a peptide recognition pattern different from those induced by any one of the classical oestrogen receptor ligands. The pesticide-complexed oestrogen receptors recognized peptides reacting with the receptors complexed both with the natural oestrogen 17 β-oestradiol and with the synthetic partial antagonist 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen, respectively, indicating that the pesticide-induced conformation shares features with both the 17 β-oestradiol- and the 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen-induced conformations. The substitution H 524 A in the ligand binding domain conferred the pesticide-specific peptide recognition pattern and transactivation activity to the oestradiol- and the 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen-complexed receptors, indicating that one important determinant of the pesticide-induced conformation is a lack of stabilisation of any one particular receptor conformation by ligand interaction with H 524, which is known to interact with both oestradiol and 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen. Thus, peptide binding analyses of oestrogen receptor conformations induced by environmental endocrine disruptors can give novel information about molecular mechanisms of oestrogen action in general...|$|R

However, {{there are no}} established universal housekeeping miRNAs for the normalisation of miRNAs in body fluids. We have previously identified an oestrogen-responsive miRNA, miR- 494, in regulating the anticoagulant, Protein S, in HuH- 7 liver cells. Moreover, increased thrombotic risk associated with elevated circulating oestrogen levels is frequently observed in pregnant women and oral contraceptive users. In order to identify other oestrogen-responsive miRNAs, including miR- 494, that may be indicative of increased thrombotic risk in plasma, we used nanoString analysis to identify robust and stable endogenous reference miRNAs {{for the study of}} oestrogen-responsive miRNAs in plasma. Results We compared the plasma miRNA expression profile of individuals with: (1) Low circulating oestrogens (healthy men and non-pregnant women not taking oral contraceptives), (2) High circulating <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogens,</b> (women taking oral contraceptives) and (3) High circulating natural oestrogens (pregnant females > 14 weeks gestation). From the nanoString analyses, 11 candidate reference miRNAs which exhibited high counts and not significantly differentially expressed between groups were selected for validation using realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and digital droplet PCR (DDPCR) in pooled plasma samples, and the stability of their expression evaluated using NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms. Four miRNAs (miR- 25 - 5 p, miR- 188 - 5 p, miR- 222 - 3 p and miR- 520 f) demonstrated detectable stable expression between groups and were further analysed by RT-qPCR in individual plasma samples, where miR- 188 - 5 p and miR- 222 - 3 p expression were identified as a stable pair of reference genes. The miRNA reference panel consisting of synthetic spike-ins cel-miR- 39 and ath-miR 159 a, and reference miRNAs, miR- 188 - 5 p and miR- 222 - 3 p was useful in evaluating fold-change of the pregnancy-associated miRNA, miR- 141 - 3 p, between groups.

Purported EDCs in personal care products include 4 -MBC (UV filter) or parabens that showed oestrogenic activity in screening tests, although regulatory toxicity studies showed no adverse effects on reproductive endpoints. Hormonal potency is the key issue of the safety of EDCs. Oestrogen-based drugs, e. g. the contraceptive pill or the <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen</b> DES, possess potencies up to 7 orders of magnitude {{higher than those of}} PCP ingredients; yet, in utero exposure to these drugs did not adversely affect fertility or sexual organ development of offspring unless exposed to extreme doses. Additive effects of EDs are unlikely due to the multitude of mechanisms how substances may produce a hormone-like activity; even after uptake of different substances with a similar mode of action, the possibility of additive effects is reduced by different absorption, metabolism and kinetics. This is supported by a number of studies on mixtures of chemical EDCs.

Daily doses of 5 =n- 0 =-=m in the neonatal period resulted in pronounced deviations {{in the pattern of}} ovarian steroids synthesized as compared with control ovaries. In DES-exposed ovaries, the synthesis of androstenedione and, above all, progesterone was high while the synthesis of 17 =ahydroxyprogesteroneand testosterone was reduced compared with controls. These results could argue for a difference in activities of 17 =ahydroxylaseand 17 =bol-dehydrogenasein ovaries from DES-treated females compared with controls. After transplantation of DES-exposed ovaries to ovariectomized control females, the steroid pattern changed to that typical for control ovaries. Control ovaries transplanted to DES-treated females had a steroid pattern similar to that of DES-exposed ovaries...|$|R
40|$|Natural steroidal {{oestrogens}} are hormones {{produced by}} the endocrine systems of humans and livestock that elicit specific effects on endocrine activity at very low concentration. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>oestrogens</b> are structurally similar, man-made pharmaceuticals designed to mimic natural hormones. Both forms of oestrogen are organic, persistent and regularly detected as pollutants of surface waters and sewage sludges due to incomplete removal during water and sewage treatment processes. Numerous studies have shown oestrogens in the environment to be potent endocrine disrupters, unintentionally disturbing the biological development/functioning of many species (eg causing feminisation). As global water demand necessitates reuse of wastewaters and food scarcity encourages use of manures/sewage sludges as fertilisers, oestrogens - given their range of effects at low-dose - {{pose a threat to}} all consumers. Biochar is a form of charcoal created through pyrolysis or gasification of carbon-based biomass, predominantly of plant origin. The resultant carbon-rich product can potentially enrich soils by helping to retain essential nutrients, whilst simultaneously storing carbon. This research seeks to determine whether biochar may act as a suitable, low-tech, low-cost medium to sequester environmental oestrogens from wastewaters and soils. Natural (17 b-estradiol, oestrone) and synthetic (17 a-ethinyl estradiol, mestranol) oestrogens have been selected for study...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} (Jellinck & Lucieer, 1965) that liver microsomes derived from male rats convert {{a higher proportion of}} [14 C]oestradiol to its 2 -hydroxy derivative and to water-soluble products than similar preparations from female rats. This sex difference in oestrogen metabolism could be altered by changing the hor-monal environment; male rats acquired a female metabolic pattern when implanted with a pellet of oestrone (Jellinck & Woo, 1967). A number of natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogens</b> in pellet form were therefore tested to determine whether they had the same action as oestrone on rat liver microsomes. The effect of structurally related non-oestrogenic analogues was also examined. Compounds to be tested were compressed into cylindrical pellets (15 =- 5 mg.) and implanted into adult male hooded or Sprague-Dawley rats. The dose released from the pellets is very small (e. g. < 50 =m. oestrone or stilboestrol/day, Jellinck & Woo, 1967). The animals were killed 7 =- 1 days later and an 8000 g supernatant was prepared from the liver homogenate (50 mg. /ml.) as described previously (Jellinck & Lucieer, 1965). This fraction containing the microsomes was incubated for 30 min...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{and solid}} samples from two {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs) on Gran Canaria Island (Spain) have been tested {{for the presence of}} compounds with endocrine-disrupting properties. The selected degradation stages were sampled bimonthly from each WWTP over the 12 -month period from July 2010 to July 2011. The analytical methods used for the determination of the endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) were based on on-line solid phase extraction, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) coupled to UHPLC-MS/MS. All of the hyphenated methodologies employed in this work showed good recoveries (72 – 104 %) and sensitivities, with LODs lower than 7. 0 [*]ng[*]L− 1 and 6. 3 [*]ng[*]g− 1 for the dissolved and solid fractions, respectively. We have also evaluated the estrogenicity of the samples in terms of their estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQs). The chemical analysis of the selected EDCs revealed fairly low concentrations for both natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogens,</b> alkylphenolic compounds, and bisphenol-A in each of the dissolved, particulate, and sludge samples (ng[*]L− 1 or ng[*]g− 1). However, the estimated estrogenic activity indicated that the majority of samples could represent an important environmental risk, clearly surpassing the threshold to exert deleterious consequences on living beings...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{compounds}} implicated as Environmental Endocrine Disruptors (EEDs), {{the most potent}} to alter the normal functions of the endocrine systems of organisms and humans are the natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen.</b> They are hydrophobic and ubiquitous and remain in the final effluents {{for the vast majority}} of sewage treatment plant. Land application of animal manures and sewage sludge as fertilizers has been reported to increase the amount of hormones in soil. However, the information on the factor that influences the occurrence of these compounds in this environmental compartment is limited. This study investigates the sorption affinity of these oestrogens on soils by determining its soil-water partition coefficient (Kd), sorption coefficient normalised to organic carbon (Koc) and octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow). In this study, different percentage of organic carbon was used. The results obtained shows that the Kow is a good predictor of sorption among contaminants as the affinity of oestrogens in soils is strongly dependent to their Kow values. This study also shows that the solid-water partition coefficient (Kd) of all oestrogens have good correlation to the organic carbon content. The calculated sorption coefficient normalised to organic carbon (Koc) indicate a strong association of all oestrogens with organic carbon. Therefore it is concluded that the organic carbon is pertinent to the sorption of oestrogens in soils. ...|$|R

Bisphenol A (BPA), originally developed as a <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen,</b> is nowadays extensively used {{in the production of}} polymeric plastics. Under harsh conditions, these plastics may release BPA, which then can leach into the environment. Detectable concentrations of BPA have been measured in most analysed samples of human serum, plasma, or urine, as well as in follicular fluid, foetal serum, and amniotic fluid. Here we summarize the evidence about adverse BPA effects on the genetic and epigenetic integrity of mammalian oocytes. We conclude that increasing evidence supports the notion that low BPA concentrations adversely affect the epigenome of mammalian female germ cells, with functional consequences on gene expression, chromosome dynamics in meiosis, and oocyte development. Specific time windows, during which profound chromatin remodelling occurs and maternal imprints are established or protected, appear particularly vulnerable to epigenetic deregulation by BPA. Transgenerational effects have been also observed in the offspring of BPA-treated rodents, although the epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance still need to be clarified. The relevance of these findings for human health protection still needs to be fully assessed, but they warrant further investigation in both experimental models and humans. 1...|$|R
40|$|From 1940 {{through the}} 1960 s, {{diethylstilbestrol}} (DES), a <b>synthetic</b> <b>oestrogen,</b> {{was given to}} pregnant women to prevent pregnancy complications and losses. Subsequent studies showed increased risks of reproductive tract abnormalities, particularly vaginal adenocarcinoma, in exposed daughters. An increased {{risk of breast cancer}} in the DES-exposed mothers was also found in some studies. In this report, we present further follow-up and a combined analysis of two cohorts of women who were exposed to DES during pregnancy. The purpose of our study was to evaluate maternal DES exposure in relation to risk of cancer, particularly tumours with a hormonal aetiology. DES exposure status was determined by a review of medical records of the Mothers Study cohort or clinical trial records of the Dieckmann Study. Poisson regression analyses were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the relationship between DES and cancer occurrence. The study results demonstrated a modest association between DES exposure and breast cancer risk, RR = 1. 27 (95 % CI = 1. 07 – 1. 52). The increased risk was not exacerbated by a family history of breast cancer, or by use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. We found no evidence that DES was associated with risk of ovarian, endometrial or other cancer. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R
