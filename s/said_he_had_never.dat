5|$|In Yao's {{first game}} in Miami on December 16, 2002, the Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies, an Asian {{cultural}} stereotype. Yao was not {{angry with the}} promotion {{because he was not}} familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese. In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.|$|E
5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he had never left the island and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{sent the}} first {{shipments}} of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr Frederick Rutherfoord Harris and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula {{had so far}} accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued {{to do so for}} years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document.|$|E
5000|$|Arunachalam <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> taken {{a course}} in {{information}} science, but [...] "simply developed a natural flair for some aspects of information science, largely focused {{on the needs of}} students of science seeking information for research, and those wanting to look at and 'evaluate' performance in scientific research." ...|$|R
50|$|He is {{described}} as reserved, polite and modest, contrary to his character on TV. Wakabayashi <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> heard Kasuga speaking bad about others. Mikio Date, a member of owarai duo Sandwichman has also said Kasuga had neither spoken ill of others nor agreed with other comedians' bad comments on others at their joint live rehearsals.|$|R
50|$|On December 11, 2009, Filippo Graviano {{denied the}} assertions of Spatuzza {{before the court}} of Palermo. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> met Dell'Utri {{directly}} or indirectly.|$|R
25|$|Lavelle was {{reportedly}} astounded when Wilson {{showed him the}} intelligence reports with false data. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen these reports before and had not known the detail that was required to complete one. He had assumed that a general statement about enemy reaction would suffice.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Hovind {{announced}} that he would be debating the renowned evolutionary biologist, Stephen Jay Gould, who had a longstanding opposition to debating Creationists and had turned down numerous challenges. When contacted about the announcement, Gould <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of Hovind, much less agreed to debate.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{was awakened}} at 6:00 a.m. by his alarm clock. His girlfriend {{and other family}} members <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been known to use it since he did not work and had no other commitments. At 8:00a.m., his girlfriend left the house to visit her parents. Bryant left the house and {{switched}} on the burglar alarm, which registered the time as 9:47a.m.|$|E
50|$|Hales {{has talked}} {{about how he was}} {{diagnosed}} with A.D.D. many times and released a documentary video about Adderall on August 8, 2016. He mentioned he was prescribed Adderall about 6 months before he started his channel and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> seen the doctor who diagnosed him with ADD again. <b>He</b> also <b>said</b> that Adderall is the reason behind all his videos, but mentioned he doesn't {{want to talk about the}} subject because he doesn't take treatment any more.|$|R
25|$|Dawkins has distanced {{himself from}} Enron and Skilling, saying that Skilling {{misunderstood}} his book. Dawkins <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> advocated selfishness {{as a means of}} progression.|$|R
60|$|They 'ad {{to change}} buses arter a time, {{and they got}} on a wrong bus and went miles out o' their way, but neither of 'em seemed to mind. Ginger <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was {{thinking}} of something else, and the gal said she was too. They got to the Zoological Gardens at last, and Ginger <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>never</b> enjoyed himself so much. When the lions roared she squeezed his arm, and when they 'ad an elephant ride she was holding on to 'im with both 'ands.|$|R
25|$|To test Lee's {{story and}} rule out any {{prospect}} {{that he was}} merely a well-informed fantasist, officers deliberately {{took him to a}} dwelling where a high-profile fire had occurred but a criminal conviction had already been secured. Lee immediately ruled out his involvement— he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been anywhere near the area— leading police to believe that he was being truthful about the number of fires he had started.|$|E
25|$|In this period, Vincent Lingiari, Billy Bunter Jampijinpa {{and others}} toured Australia, {{with the support}} of workers’ unions, to give talks, raise awareness, build support for their cause and have {{meetings}} with major lawyers and politicians. Frank Hardy recalled one fundraising meeting at which a donor gave $500 after hearing Vincent Lingiari speak. The donor – who <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> before met an Aboriginal person – was a young Dr Fred Hollows, the eye surgeon and Communist activist.|$|E
25|$|UKIP {{has several}} {{high-profile}} backers. In March 2009, the Conservative Party's biggest-ever donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated £100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon. He was then {{expelled from the}} Conservatives and in 2011 appointed treasurer of UKIP. In October 2014, Arron Banks, who previously gave £25,000 to the Conservatives, increased his UKIP donation from £100,000 to £1 million after Hague <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of him. The multi-millionaire Paul Sykes has helped finance the party, donating over £1 million to their 2014 campaign at the European Parliament.|$|E
5000|$|Christopherson {{is often}} {{described}} as a pragmatic politician. <b>He</b> once <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been a [...] "hard-line ideologue", but [...] "the NDP is where I'm most comfortable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Toosi {{issued a}} denial {{statement}} rejecting {{all of the}} claims, which he called “total lies”. The allegations were [...] "aimed at discrediting the state’s religious foundations and its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei," [...] Toosi <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> stated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> engaged in [...] "such sins" [...] and [...] "actions incompatible with chastity." ...|$|R
50|$|Paying {{tribute to}} Piatrushenka's {{strength}} and stamina, national team leader and former double Olympic canoe champion Viktor Reneysky <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> seen another kayak sprinter who can cope with such heavy training loads.|$|R
25|$|In 1995, Begg married, and {{in early}} 1998, {{he and his}} new family moved to Peshawar, Pakistan. An American counterterrorism {{official}} claimed that the CIA and MI5 suspected Begg had worked with Khalil Deek, who also lived in Peshawar at that time, to create a CD-ROM terrorist manual. Begg said in interviews that he had met Deek in Bosnia and later collaborated {{with him on a}} business enterprise to sell traditional Pakistani clothing, but <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> met Zubaydah. Pentagon officials said this conflicts with what he told interrogators.|$|E
500|$|Yoshiki was {{convinced}} {{to do the}} film by his agent, Marc Geiger of William Morris Endeavor, and according to director Stephen Kijak, had given the film crew a competely free hand. Kijak <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of X Japan before getting a call from his producer to make the documentary. But upon learning the band's slogan of [...] "Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock" [...] {{he wanted to be}} a part of it.|$|E
500|$|In a {{separate}} and unrelated round of emails composed in 2009, Indiana Education officials shared concerns with Daniels about the lobbying resources {{and activities of}} the Indiana Urban Schools Association. Daniels asked that the administration [...] "examine cutting them out, at least of the [...] 'surge' we are planning {{for the next couple}} yrs." [...] The executive director of IUSA is Charles Little, an Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis professor of education, who had criticized him. It wasn’t immediately clear if the audit went through. Daniels <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of Charles Little.|$|E
60|$|He ate heartily of {{the supper}} I cooked. <b>Never</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> such an {{appetite}} {{at our table}} in the old days. We spoke of it, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been so healthy in his life.|$|R
50|$|On 29 May 2013, Dharmarajan {{retracted}} {{his previous}} statement claiming Kurien's involvement. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> met {{him and had}} only seen him on the news. <b>He</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> did not own a car back then.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 May 2009, Silvio Berlusconi <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> [...] "spicy" [...] {{relations}} with Noemi Letizia, swearing also on his children's heads. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> also {{that if any}} such thing <b>had</b> occurred, <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> resigned immediately.|$|R
500|$|Retired Test umpires Col Hoy and Les Townsend were {{watching}} {{at the ground}} when Meckiff was called. The day after the incident, both asserted {{that they would not}} have no-balled the paceman. Hoy <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> had any problem with the bowler's action during matches in which he officiated. He described Meckiff's action as [...] "slightly different" [...] but attributed this to an accentuated wrist action used in an attempt to get more life out of dead pitches, rather than his elbow. Townsend watched the paceman through binoculars and deemed all of his 12 deliveries to be identical. Townsend regarded Meckiff's arm action as [...] "peculiar" [...] but felt he did not throw. Former Test spinners Ian Johnson and Doug Ring said Meckiff's action was fair.|$|E
500|$|The {{source of}} Hsu's income once he {{returned}} to the United States is unclear. While he claims to be involved in several businesses in the fashion industry, visits to those addresses [...] "found no trace of Mr. Hsu." [...] At several business addresses provided on Hsu's campaign donation forms, none of the listed businesses could be located. A New Jersey fashion designer that Hsu had listed as a co-investor, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard of Hsu. Lawrence Barcella, Hsu's Washington, D.C. attorney, claims that Hsu's post-1996-return Silicon Valley investments account for some of his ability to make his political contributions. However, detailed financial records for Components Ltd, a Hsu-controlled entity with no obvious business purpose, reveal payments of $100,000 to nine political donors whose contributions were later bundled by Hsu.|$|E
500|$|The {{partnership}} had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes, and was likened by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack to a [...] "hurricane". Fingleton <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> [...] "known a {{more enjoyable}} hour" [...] of [...] "delectable cricket". He acclaimed Miller's innings as [...] "one of the rarest gems in the Test collection of all time" [...] and [...] "a moment {{to live in}} the cricket memory". O'Reilly said Miller and Harvey had counter-attacked with [...] "such joyful abandon {{that it would have been}} difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation". The crowd was in raptures at both the batting and Edrich's catch. Arlott said [...] "two of the greatest innings of all Test cricket were being played", and praised Miller for elevating [...] "cricket to a point of aesthetic beauty".|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of killing}} Supergirl was first {{conceived}} by DC's vice president/executive editor Dick Giordano, who lobbied {{for the death}} to DC's publishers. <b>He</b> later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> any regrets about this, explaining, [...] "Supergirl was created initially {{to take advantage of}} the high Superman sales and not much thought was put into her creation. She was created essentially as a female Superman. With time, writers and artists improved upon her execution, but she never did really add anything to the Superman mythos—at least not for me." [...] The poor initial reception of the 1984 film Supergirl was also blamed by some sources.|$|R
5000|$|One {{indication}} of this internal dispute came when Dr. Brian Day of B.C. was elected CMA president in August 2007. Day {{is the owner}} of the largest private hospital in Canada and a vocal supporter of increasing private health care in Canada. The CMA presidency rotates among the provinces, with the provincial association electing a candidate who is customarily ratified by the CMA general meeting. Day's selection was sufficiently controversial that he was challenged—albeit unsuccessfully—by another physician. The newspaper story went on to note that [...] "Day <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> supported the privatization of health care in Canada, and accused his detractors of deliberately distorting his position." ...|$|R
50|$|She {{continued}} to play StarCraft and {{was fascinated by the}} professional tournaments on T.V. At 16, after seeing BoxeR play on TV, she decided that she wanted to become a professional gamer. When she told her dad, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wished <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> introduced her to StarCraft. However, she {{continued to}} play and would sneak out at night to play in local tournaments around Seoul.|$|R
500|$|In 1939, a {{group of}} Hungarian {{scientists}} that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, [...] "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans {{to the possibility that}} German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon." [...] To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Excursions In and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840, the {{geologist}} Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's water dog. [...] "A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal {{was of a}} breed {{very different from what}} we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth." [...] wrote Jukes. [...] "These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot was white, and Harvey said he did it to [...] "toil" [...] or entice the fish. The whole proceeding struck me as remarkable, more especially as they <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been taught anything of the kind." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1985 {{inspectors}} for the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the Great Plains {{states began}} [...] "Project Looking Glass", a sting operation under the newly enacted Child Protection Act of 1984, {{which made it}} illegal to send pictures of nude minors through the mail for noncommercial purposes (previously, only those who intended to resell them could be prosecuted). Ray Mack, the inspector in charge, meant it to be primarily an intelligence-gathering operation, {{a way to keep}} tabs on producers and distributors. It sent mail to those it had known to have ordered such materials while they were legal. Among them were Keith Jacobson, a bachelor 56-year-old U.S. Army retiree turned farmer living with his elderly parents in Newman Grove, Nebraska, who would later describe himself as bisexual although he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> had relations with men. Jacobson had, the previous year, ordered two magazines entitled Bare Boys I and Bare Boys II from Electric Moon, an adult bookstore in San Diego, California, that had been raided and shut down.|$|E
5000|$|The Insolvent in {{answers to}} Mr Woodroffe, <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{obtained}} credit from any person by representing {{he was about}} to become tutor to Lord Darnley[...] <b>He</b> <b>had</b> expected that appointment but Lady Darnley had chosen another tutor for his Lordship.|$|R
50|$|On another occasion, he {{challenged}} the Church's rule of closed communion that almost completely excludes Protestants from its Eucharist. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> suggested to Church of Ireland members {{that they were}} not welcome to receive the sacrament in his churches.|$|R
50|$|Hussain is a Muslim, he {{can speak}} broken Tamil and can {{understand}} Sinhalese. In 2014, {{he moved out}} of the parental home in Burwood, Victoria.
