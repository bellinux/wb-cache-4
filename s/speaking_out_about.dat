In particular, the concept of témoignage ("witnessing"), which refers to <b>speaking</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> the suffering that one sees as opposed to remaining silent, was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was {{the most effective way to}} solve a problem.|$|E

They say the agency ignored their concerns for safety or requests for relocation, and tried to blame rape victims for their attacks. Their stories, and support from families and advocates, are drawing attention from lawmakers and promises of reform from the agency". Among 8,655 volunteers there are on average 22 Peace Corps women reported being the victims of rape or attempted rape each year.|$|E

Searchlight magazine, which campaigns against the BNP, claimed that her expulsion came from a dispute with the party's legal officer Lee Barnes over paying for the legal fight that followed the disputed election.

2500|$|Reagan {{prevented}} his Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, from <b>speaking</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> the AIDS epidemic. When in 1986 Reagan {{was highly}} encouraged by many other public officials to authorize Koop {{to issue a}} report on the epidemic, he expected it to be in line with conservative policies; instead, Koop's Surgeon General's Report on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome greatly emphasized the importance of a comprehensive AIDS education strategy, including widespread distribution of condoms, and rejected mandatory testing. This approach brought Koop into conflict with other administration officials such as Education Secretary William Bennett. [...] In 1988, Koop took the unprecedented action of mailing AIDS information to every U.S. household. This information included the use of condoms as the decisive defense against contracting the disease.|$|E

[...] Allawah Grove {{had its own}} Administration, Women's Committee, Progress Committee and Advancement Council which took {{progressive}} steps toward advancing the conditions for Aboriginal people all over Australia. By <b>speaking</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> the progress, success and the difficulties of their community, these groups of Allawah Grove contributed to an already growing global interest in Aboriginal Affairs. [...] Allawah Grove's many achievements included establishing a Kindergarten for Aboriginal children and a Friends' Centre, providing much needed community support from wider public and private services. Mothers from the community had helped set up a clothing store at the Centre, with the profits from sales funding many projects and activities. Beautiful bark paintings, which were inspired at the Centre, received world-wide acknowledgement, and became a pleasurable activity for the artists, as well as creating an industry for Allawah Grove. [...] Allawah Grove was closed and dismantled in 1969. It is now providing temporary accommodation for transient people and is managed by Aboriginal Hostels Limited.|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter {{initially}} {{suggested that}} he had no power to prevent Archer from continuing to meet with Burke, but facing increasing pressure to resign, Archer relented on 5 March, announcing that she would cease all personal and professional contact with him. Calls for her resignation persisted; former Cabinet minister Bob Kucera and prominent unionist Dave Kelly both demanded that she resign, and state Energy Minister Fran Logan announced that he would not give Archer information relating to his portfolios unless confident that she was [...] "absolutely and clearly aware" [...] of her ethical responsibilities as an MP. In response to the continuing pressure, Carpenter imposed a gag on all Labor MPs from <b>speaking</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> the commission's ramifications on 7 March. However, Archer faced further problems when, on 10 March, the opposition disclosed her past spent conviction, the details of which had previously remained unknown, and renewed its calls for her resignation on the basis of her refusal to previously disclose it. Four days later, Carpenter publicly refused to deny that he had asked Archer to resign from the ALP and been refused. After days of intense pressure, Archer broke her media silence on 20 March, again denying any wrongdoing and protesting the revelation of her spent conviction; however, this did little to cease the attacks on her.|$|E
