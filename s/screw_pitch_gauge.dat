A low lead <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> (i.e. 5 {{turns per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the lead screw to rotate as the spindle motor falls down.

40|$|Abstract: A global {{study of}} {{geometry}} and material properties of orthopedic screws was performed, considering {{not only the}} effect of each single factor (<b>screw</b> <b>pitch,</b> number of threads, fillet angle, etc.) but also their interactions with respect to bone density. The stress patterns resulting from different screw geometries and bone densities were analyzed using finite element techniques, taking into account different levels of osseointegration between the screw and the bone. These numerical models where validated through experimental pull-out tests, where a pull out force of 120 N produced localized failure of the last thread (stresses above 0. 42 MPa). The results of the numerical simulations were then summarised using a multi-factorial parametric analysis. This demonstrated the great relevance {{of the interaction between}} bone density and <b>screw</b> <b>pitch,</b> showing that the optimal <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> can vary by more than 25 % for different densities (0. 35 g/cm 3 and 0. 47 g/cm 3, respectively). The parameters calculated by means of the multi-factorial analysis allow the pull out force to be estimated for different osseointegration levels, different screw geometries and material properties, and for different bone densities. The final objective is to determine the best choice of implant for each individual patient. 1...|$|R

40|$|Screw feeders {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the food, plastics, household products, mineral processing and agricultural industries to remove material from hoppers and bins at a controlled rate. A key design requirement {{is to make the}} empty space in the screw available evenly along its exposed length below the hopper or bin. The evenness of the flow depends on the drawdown flow pattern, which in turn depends on the screw and hopper design, shape of the particles and wall friction effects. If the drawdown is not even then compositional variations in the outgoing stream can be created. The strongly varying residence time distributions for particles within the bin can also lead to quality issues. Designs to date have typically been based on analytical models and often performance issues are observed when the screw design used does not give the desired flow pattern. In this study the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate particle transport in a horizontal screw feeder system for a range of conventional screw designs including variable <b>screw</b> <b>pitch,</b> <b>screw</b> flight and core diameters. The influence of screw design on the particle mass flow rate, the evenness of particle drawdown from the hopper and power consumption are investigated.
