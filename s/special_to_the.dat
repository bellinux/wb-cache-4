The channel had released a trailer for the special in YouTube and a poster in their website, which showed Gaga with her characteristic pyrotechnic bra emitting sparks. According to Billboard, the special was watched by 1.2million viewers. The special received critical acclaim. On review aggregate website Metacritic, the special holds a rating of 81 out of 100 based on four critic reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald wrote, [...] "etween the orgy of visuals—stripper strobes, androgynous dancers and a very loose, X-rated 'Wizard of Oz' theme—we get some great song and dance numbers: 'Poker Face', 'Paparazzi' and 'Bad Romance'. These are amazing hits, club-thumping tracks that define joy and sadness for a generation of suburban teens and the urban disenfranchised." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} show's non-concert content was not genuine, and found the special to be similar to Madonna's 1991 documentary [...] The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski gave the special a B+ rating, claiming that Gaga [...] "proves that she is a performer" [...] and that [...] "she puts on a show", though she felt that the concert was overly emotional and artistically ambitious, and that Gaga's on-stage banter was slightly annoying. Koski also compared the <b>special</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Madonna documentary. Linda Stassi from New York Post was also positive in her assessment of the concert special. She complimented the behind the scenes footage, the costumes and the dancing and the pyrotechnics of the show, describing it as [...] "a concert that would make Madonna’s shows look like run-of-the-mill dinner theater." [...] A review in website Idolator described Gaga as [...] "ringleader of her own circus — in complete control of her little monsters".

[...] Milton characterizes him as such, but Satan lacks several key traits that would {{otherwise}} make him the definitive protagonist in the work.
