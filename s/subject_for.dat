30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the classification of the CS labels, we divided the number of <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> each label into a training set and test set equally. Because the number of training <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> each label was not the same, we equalized the number of training <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> all labels by considering the smallest number of training <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> a label, that is, for CpCO (1, 300 <b>subjects).</b> <b>For</b> each <b>subject,</b> only the GEI of the A 1 sequence was used. Then, we trained the training-based benchmarks using the equalized training set. For testing, each sample of a CS label was matched against all the available samples of the training set. To predict the CS label for each test sample, majority voting was used for mSVM [6] and the mean distance to a class was used for all other benchmarks.|$|R

5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E
5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road crossing to the south enabled the pedestrianisation of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons, first published between 1799 and 1805, {{played a crucial role}} in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, there was not one picture of Æthelstan.|$|E

5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} is more widespread {{than can be}} accounted for as being {{a consequence of the}} selection pressure caused by the use of antibiotics alone. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a high mercury content in feces might select for mercury-resistant bacteria and thus for antimicrobial resistance linked to mercury resistance. Three subject groups with different exposures to dental amalgam fillings were compared. None of the subjects had taken antimicrobial agents during the three preceding months or longer. The group exposed to dental amalgam (n = 92) had 13 times more mercury in feces than the group that had never been exposed to amalgam (n = 43) and the group whose amalgam fillings had been removed (n = 56). No significant differences in either mercury resistance or antibiotic resistance in the fecal aerobic gram-negative flora of these subject groups were seen. The following antimicrobial resistance frequencies were detected with a replica plating method: > or = 1 % resistance was seen in 40 % of the <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> ampicillin, 14 % of the <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> cefuroxime, 6 % of the <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> nalidixic acid, 14 % of the <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> trimethoprim, 19 % of the <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> sulfamethoxazole, and 25 % of the <b>subjects</b> <b>for</b> tetracycline. The amount of mercury in feces derived from amalgam was not selective for any resistance factors in aerobic gram-negative bacteria, but antimicrobial resistance was widespread even among healthy subjects with no recent exposure to antibiotics...|$|R

5|$|The Mint began {{preparation}} for the reduced-diameter dollar coin in 1976. Although no legislation had yet been introduced, Treasury officials anticipated a positive reception from Congress, and the coin had near unanimous support from the Mint and the vending machine industry, an influential lobby {{in the area of}} coin design and creation. In 1977, Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal publicly endorsed a smaller dollar coin and suggested that an allegorical representation of Liberty would be a suitable <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the coin.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate <b>subject</b> <b>for</b> the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of the}} sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E
