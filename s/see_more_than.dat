25|$|On 16 May the BBC {{reported}} that, after a lull of two weeks, the Ethiopians {{had attacked}} at Velessa on the Tsorona front-line, south of Eritrea's capital Asmara and that {{after two days}} of heavy fighting the Eritreans had beaten back the attack claiming to have destroyed more than forty-five Ethiopian tanks; although not able to verify the claim, which the Ethiopian Government dismissed as ridiculous, the BBC reporter did <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 300 dead Ethiopians and more than 20 destroyed Ethiopian tanks. In June 1999 the fighting continued with both sides in entrenched positions. About a quarter of Eritrean soldiers were women.|$|E

Holtzclaw's brigade {{under the condition that}} it be used only to cover a Confederate withdrawal from Lookout Mountain, ordering Stevenson at 2:30p.m. to withdraw to the east side of Chattanooga Creek. Stevenson was reluctant to break contact until his troops on the summit could escape on the Summertown Road into the Chattanooga Valley. The brigades of Walthall, Pettus, and Moore were ordered to hold on {{for the rest of the}} afternoon. For hours through the afternoon and into the night, the six Alabama regiments under Pettus and Moore fought sporadically with the Union troops through dense fog, neither side able to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a few dozen yards ahead nor make any progress in either direction.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
25|$|In August 1609, John Smith {{was quite}} {{surprised}} to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 300 new settlers arrive, {{which did not}} go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support. Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the Sea Venture. (Bermuda, or the 'Somers Isles', had remained settled since 1609, and the Virginia Company's possession was made official in 1612 when it was added to Virginia's territory.) Gates soon {{found that there was}} not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor, Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda with the Patience to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The Patience, captained by his nephew, then sailed for England instead of Virginia.|$|E

[...] He described the Oxford crew as [...] "exceptionally strong and mechanically quite efficient" [...] yet [...] "lacks polish and uniformity" [...] and while Cambridge were demonstrated uniformity, they rowed {{in a way which}} [...] "does look like hard work". [...] In the build-up to the race, Oxford's time in their second full course row was 45 seconds quicker than that rowed by Cambridge the previous day.|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I <b>see.</b> <b>More</b> <b>than</b> one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E
500|$|Several themes {{ran through}} the reviews, {{one of which was}} the lack of focus on adult characters. IGN's Robert Canning—who rated [...] "Duets" [...] 8.5/10, {{signifying}} a great episode—felt that this contributed to its success, as it [...] "allowed for small but interesting character development to take place, even with some of the minor characters." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was surprised that he did not miss the presence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester, but Hankinson, Semigran and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman all lamented her absence. The gay-centered storylines also attracted much commentary. Christie Keith of lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com suggested that [...] "Duets" [...] was [...] "the queerest episode of any series that's ever been on television". Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack wrote that Kurt [...] "stole the show in terms of pure emotional power" [...] and called him [...] "the most important character on television right now". USA Today Ann Oldenburg questioned whether Glee had gone [...] "too far" [...] by depicting a physical relationship between Santana and Brittany. Several reviewers appreciated the resultant development of Brittany's character: Poniewozik enjoyed the exploration of her [...] "basic loneliness", E! Online's Jenna Mullins was pleased to <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> her usual [...] "deadpanning and one-liners", and Wieselman called it a [...] "wonderful moment" [...] when she and Artie broke up, which led to the depiction of [...] "real feelings" [...] in Brittany for the first time. Canning found Brittany and Artie's coupling [...] "uneven" [...] and preferred her with Santana, as their development made them [...] "uniquely interesting and a blast to watch." [...] VanDerWerff conversely deemed Brittany's pairing with Artie [...] "one of the most resonant things the show's ever done".|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1996 float season, FWP limited {{the number of}} {{individuals}} in each group to a monthly average of eight. No more three days of each month could <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 45 groups on the river, and no more than six days of each month could <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 300 floaters on the river. (This effectively limited group size to 6.5 people, the same number developed in the 1988 plan.) The agency concluded that the CEA lacked an effective implementation plan, and that the FWP had no plan for preserving the river corridor or how to achieve its preservation goals. The biennial rule required FWP to refer any proposals to the Ad-Hoc Committee, and to prepare annually a list of all private land adjacent to the recreational waterway. The list would be used to by FWP staff to develop a [...] "protection strategy" [...] for each of these parcels.|$|E
