40|$|Recent {{applications}} of {{principal components analysis}} (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) in human population genetics have found that "statistical maps" based on the genotypes in population-genetic samples often resemble geographic maps of the underlying sampling locations. To provide formal tests of these qualitative observations, we describe a Procrustes analysis approach for quantitatively assessing the similarity of population-genetic and geographic maps. We confirm in two scenarios, one using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from Europe and one using SNP data worldwide, that a measurably high level of concordance exists between <b>statistical</b> <b>maps</b> of population-genetic variation and geographic maps of sampling locations. Two other examples illustrate the versatility of the Procrustes approach in population-genetic applications, verifying the concordance of SNP analyses using PCA and MDS, and showing that <b>statistical</b> <b>maps</b> of worldwide copy-number variants (CNVs) accord with <b>statistical</b> <b>maps</b> of SNP variation, especially when CNV analysis is limited to samples with the highest-quality data. As <b>statistical</b> <b>maps</b> with PCA and MDS have become increasingly common for use in summarizing population relationships, our examples highlight the potential of Procrustes-based quantitative comparisons for interpreting the results in these maps. ...|$|R

50|$|Most simply, {{they can}} be {{presented}} as a table, displaying coordinates that show the most significant differences in activity between tasks. However, differences in brain activity are more often shown as patches of colour on an MRI brain 'slice', with the colours representing the location of voxels that have shown {{statistically significant differences between}} conditions. The gradient of color is mapped to statistical values, such as t-values or z-scores. This creates an intuitive and visually appealing means of delineating the relative statistical strength of a given area of activation. Recently, an alternative approach has been suggested, in which the <b>statistical</b> <b>map</b> is combined with the map of the original difference in brain activity (or, more generally speaking, with the original contrast) and colorcodes are attributed to the latter.|$|E

The presence of a <b>statistical</b> <b>map</b> showing the prevalence of food deserts in the United States appeared to matter only when combined with an individual narrative, off- setting the fact that the individual narrative in isolation produced fewer thoughts consistent with the story’s persuasive goal and more counterarguments in opposition to environmental causes and solutions for obesity than other message conditions.

T 1 maps are popular for studying the progression and treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, their inclusion in standard imaging protocols remains limited due to the additional scanning time and expert calibration required and susceptibility to bias and noise. Here, we propose a new method of estimating T 1 maps using four conventional MR images, which are intensity- normalized using cerebellar gray matter as a reference tissue and related to T 1 using a smooth regression model. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we generate <b>statistical</b> T 1 <b>maps</b> for 61 subjects with MS.

The nightglow emissions serve as effective tracers of Venus' middle and upper atmosphere global wind system due to their variable peak brightness and horizontal distributions. A <b>statistical</b> <b>map</b> has been created utilizing O[SUB] 2 [/SUB] IR nightglow VEX observations, and a <b>statistical</b> <b>map</b> for NO UV is being developed. A nightside warm layer near 100 km has been observed by VEX and ground-based observations. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Venus Thermospheric General Circulation Model (VTGCM) has been updated and revised {{in order to address}} these key VEX observations and to provide diagnostic interpretation. The VTGCM is first used to capture the statistically averaged mean state of these three key observations. This correspondence implies a weak retrograde superrotating zonal flow (RSZ) from ˜ 80 km to 110 km and above 110 km the emergence of modest RSZ winds approaching 60 m s[SUP]- 1 [/SUP] above ˜ 130 km. Subsequently, VTGCM sensitivity tests are performed using two tuneable parameters (the nightside eddy diffusion coefficient and the wave drag term) to examine corresponding variability within the VTGCM. These tests identified a possible mechanism for the observed noncorrelation of the O[SUB] 2 [/SUB] and NO emissions.
