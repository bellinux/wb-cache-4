40|$|India is {{experiencing}} energy crisis and a widening gap between energy supply and demand. The country is, however, endowed with considerable, commercially and technically available renewable resources, from which surplus agro-biomass {{is of great}} importance and a relatively untapped resource. In the policy making process, knowledge of existing biomass use, degree of social reliance, and degree of biomass availability for energy production is unequivocal and pre-conditional. Field observations, documentation, and fill-in sheet tools were used to investigate the potential of biomass resources and the existing domestic, commercial, and industrial uses of biomass in selected Indian states. To do so, a team of field observers/supervisors visited three Indian states namely: Maharashtra (MH), Madhya Pradesh (MP), and Tamil Nadu (TN). Two districts from each state were selected to collect data {{regarding the use of}} biomass and the extent of biomass availability for energy production. In total, 471 farmers were interviewed, and approximately 75 farmers with various land holdings have been interviewed in each district. The existing uses of biomass have been documented in this survey study and the results show that the majority of biomass is used as fodder for domestic livestock followed by in-site ploughing, leaving trivial <b>surplus</b> <b>quantities</b> for other productive uses. Biomass for cooking appeared to be insignificant due to the availability and access to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in the surveyed districts. Opportunities exist to utilize roadside-dumped biomass, in-site burnt biomass, and a share of biomass used for ploughing. The GIS-based maps show that biomass availability varies considerably across the Taluks of the surveyed districts, and is highly dependent on a number of enviromental and socio-cultural factors. Developing competitive bioenergy market and enhancing and promoting access to more LPG fuel connections seem an appropriate socio-economic and environmental approach to reduce the use of biomass for indoor cooking and increasing the share of surplus biomass for energy production...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{builds on}} the {{published}} literature on agricultural policy analysis under costly and imperfect enforcement by introducing enforcement costs and misrepresentation into the economic analysis of export subsidies. Specifically, the present paper examines the economic causes of cheating on export subsidies {{and the consequences of}} enforcement costs and misrepresentation for the welfare effects and the transfer efficiency of this policy instrument. Policy design and implementation is modelled as a sequential game between a government that designs and enforces the policy and the recipients of the payments. Two alternative policy implementation scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, export subsidies are paid to private trading firms while in the second scenario subsidies are paid directly to the producers of the subsidised commodity. Analytical results show that the introduction of enforcement costs and cheating changes the welfare effects of export subsidies and their efficiency in redistributing income to producers. The analysis also shows that, contrary to what is traditionally believed, the incidence of export subsidies depends on the group that is subsidised to export the <b>surplus</b> <b>quantity</b> – the way the policy is implemented. The results provide additional support for the contention that the economic consequences of cheating are highly policy-specific. Finally, the analysis reveals that when the government faces restrictions on either the volume or the value of export subsidies, cheating reduces the distortionary effects of the policy on international markets. This is true irrespective of whether subsidies are paid to trading firms or to producers. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
25|$|Market {{equilibrium}} occurs where {{quantity supplied}} equals quantity demanded, {{the intersection of}} the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, {{there is a shortage of}} quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a <b>surplus</b> of <b>quantity</b> supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.|$|R
40|$|Land use {{and land}} cover {{changes in the}} region were {{analyzed}} {{on the basis of}} information extracted from satellite image data. Based on this information, it is clearly noticed that the different land use classes have changed their forms and degrees in different time periods due to the driving forces such as national park activities, influx of Tibetan refugees, climate change and growth of tourism. Furthermore, the landscapes dynamics and their relation to the provisioning of ecosystem services were evaluated {{on the basis of the}} “mapping supply and demand of ecosystem services” instrument of ecosystem research. Based on the application of the GIS/RS tools, mapping has been carried out with the information extracted from literature reviews, focus group discussions, interviews and household questionnaire surveys. The relevant indicators of the ecosystem services were identified through focus group discussions. In addition, these indicators were also qualitatively assessed through experts’ judgements and local people participations. The information obtained from mapping and expert assessment matrix indicated that the supply of multiple goods and services by nature on the one hand match the demands of society on the other hand, which proved that the system of the Everest is a self-sustaining system in most of the services cases. The land use changes, such as degradation of local forest condition mainly in the on-route trekking site villages from tourists related fuelwood demand and decreases of snow/glacier cover area from climate change phenomenon may put greater challenges in the provisioning of ecosystem services in near future. The challenges issues could be the availability of the fresh water, aesthetic value, soil erosion regulation and continuation of agro-pastoral farming. Despite some of the services deteriorate the environmental conditions, most of the services such as transportation, livestock products, carbon sequestration, crop productions, fuelwood supply etc. seem to develop towards better conditions. The flow of the tourists has had both positive and negative impacts in the region such as promotion of education, employment opportunities and in other hand, environmental degradation. Tourism has created additional demands on the Everest natural resources, some of them through the direct requirements of tourists and some of them through the indirect impacts of changing the Sherpa’s traditional livelihood practices as a result of new patterns of lifestyle and tourism wealth. These additional demands have affected local resource and land-use practices. Consequently, this has resulted in a deficit area of provisioning and regulating ecosystem services in the on-route trekking site villages even though the region is holding <b>surplus</b> <b>quantities.</b> Therefore, the Everest region includes both surplus and deficit areas in the local level for different kinds of services. Nevertheless, basing on the trade of ecosystem services, the deficit areas of the on-route trekking site villages are balanced by surplus areas of the off-route site villages. Furthermore, the promotion of religious values based on the tourism affluent has very much supported in the preservation of most of the ecosystem services through environment friendly religious beliefs and practices. Therefore, cultural services seem one of the main agents in promoting the condition of ecosystem services in the region. Due to the specific cultural values such as respecting natural landscapes as a god living place and worshipping natural landscapes, most of the services remain in a good conditions which makes a difference compared with other Himalayan regions in the ecosystem services context. Through discussing the findings in my analysis of the landscape dynamics I argue that the study region is experiencing influences from climate change. Thus an adaptive management approach is necessary to avoid the uncertainties and risks from ongoing change...|$|E

Methods: We developed a new method to study the electrochemical behavior of dGTP utilizing carbon multiwalled nanotube (MWNT) -modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs). RAPD was applied for amplification of DNA samples from healthy controls and patients with pancreatic cancer under the same conditions to determine the different <b>surplus</b> <b>quantity</b> of dGTP in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thereby determining the difference/quantity of PCR products or template strands. Using this method we generated a genetic fingerprint map of pancreatic cancer through the combination of electrochemical sensors and gel electrophoresis to screen for genetic alterations. Cloning and sequencing were then performed to verify these gene alterations. Results: dGTP showed favorable electrochemical behavior on the MWNTs/GCE. The {{results indicated that the}} electrical signal and dGTP had a satisfactory linear relationship with the dGTP concentration within the conventional PCR concentration range. The MWNTs/GCE could distinguish between different products of RAPD.

6000|$|... § 3. That {{effects are}} {{proportional}} to their causes is {{laid down by}} some writers as an axiom {{in the theory of}} causation; and great use is sometimes made of this principle in reasonings respecting the laws of nature, though it is encumbered with many difficulties and apparent exceptions, which much ingenuity has been expended in showing not to be real ones. This proposition, in so far as it is true, enters as a particular case into the general principle of the Composition of Causes; the causes compounded being, in this instance, homogeneous; in which case, if in any, their joint effect might be expected to be identical with the sum of their separate effects. If a force equal to one hundred weight will raise a certain body along an inclined plane, a force equal to two hundred weight will raise two bodies exactly similar, and thus the effect is proportional to the cause. But does not a force equal to two hundred weight actually contain in itself two forces each equal to one hundred weight, which, if employed apart, would separately raise the two bodies in question? The fact, therefore, that when exerted jointly they raise both bodies at once, results from the Composition of Causes, and is a mere instance of the general fact that mechanical forces are subject to the law of Composition. And so in every other case which can be supposed. For the doctrine of the proportionality of effects to their causes can not of course be applicable to cases in which the augmentation of the cause alters the kind of effect; that is, in which the <b>surplus</b> <b>quantity</b> superadded to the cause does not become compounded with it, but the two together generate an altogether new phenomenon. Suppose that the application of a certain quantity of heat to a body merely increases its bulk, that a double quantity melts it, and a triple quantity decomposes it: these three effects being heterogeneous, no ratio, whether corresponding or not to that of the quantities of heat applied, can be established between them. Thus the supposed axiom of the proportionality of effects to their causes fails at the precise point where the principle of the Composition of Causes also fails; viz., where the concurrence of causes is such as to determine a change in the properties of the body generally, and render it subject to new laws, more or less dissimilar to those to which it conformed in its previous state. The recognition, therefore, of any such law of proportionality is superseded by the more comprehensive principle, in which {{as much of it as}} is true is implicitly asserted.(134) ...|$|R

40|$|Food {{security}} {{is an issue}} of high importance for Sub-Saharan African countries. With the on-going process of regional integration, the promotion of regional trade between neighbouring countries is one strategy to enhance food security. The study introduces an Analytical Framework (AF) to evaluate the potentials of regional trade to enhance food security. Three working levels are defined: (1) A desk study to identify relevant countries or regions, (2) a fact-finding mission to collect in-depth data and (3) an assessment to evaluate the potentials. The AF is implemented in a case study on crossborder trade between Tanzania and Zambia. Both countries are members of the Southern African Development Community and are intensifying co-operation and trade liberalisation. Although being generally food secure, Tanzania still faces food shortages. The Government pursues an interventionist policy by purchasing food in surplus areas to sell these at subsidised prices in deficit regions. This is combined with several barriers for crossborder trade, e. g. an export ban on food staples. Zambia's food security policies are biased towards maize as major food staple. The Government intervenes on domestic markets and provides farmers with subsidised inputs. Zambia's Northern Province is generally food secure but Zambia sometimes faces food shortages. The Mbeya and Rukwa Regions in Tanzania have favourable natural conditions. The productivity of the agricultural sector is above national level and the area produces <b>surpluses.</b> Import <b>quantities</b> to Zambia are influenced by the imposed export ban. Besides formal trade, the importance of informal cross-border trade with maize has increased. Trade is ampered by a number of non-tariff barriers, ranging from cost-intensive and time-consuming customs procedures to road blocks. Most of the non-tariff barriers are relevant for formal and informal trade. The assessment of the policy measures shows conflicts of interests between national food security on one side and agricultural trade liberalisation on the other side. Market interventions have negative effects on trade in general. Additionally, the Tanzanian export ban creates disincentives for farmers and traders. The assessment shows potentials for increasing the crossborder trade between both countries. The recommendations concentrate on the potentials to expand their involvement in trade...|$|R
40|$|Squash {{yield and}} quality under furrow and trickle {{irrigation}} methods and {{their responses to}} different irrigation quantities were evaluated in 2010 spring and fall growing seasons. A field experiment was conducted using squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) grown in northern Egypt at Shibin El Kom, Menofia. A randomized split-plot design was used with irrigation methods as main plots and different irrigation quantities randomly distributed within either furrow or trickle irrigation methods. Irrigation quantity was a fraction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as: 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, and 1. 5 ETc. Each treatment was repeated three times, two of five rows from each replicate were left for squash seed production. In well-watered conditions (1. 0 ETc), seasonal water use by squash was 304 and 344 Â mm over 93 days in spring and 238 and 272 Â mm over 101 days in fall under trickle and furrow irrigation methods, respectively. Squash fruit yield and quality were significantly affected by season and both irrigation method and quantity. Fruit number and length were not affected by irrigation method and growing season, respectively. Interaction between season and irrigation quantity significantly affected leaf area index, total soluble solid (TSS), and fruit weight. Moreover, seed yield and quality were significantly affected by growing season and both irrigation method and quantity except harvest index, which was not affected by irrigation method. Significant differences for the interaction between season and irrigation method were only found for seed yield and 100 seeds weight. Except for harvest index, no significant difference was observed by interaction between season and irrigation quantity. Both fruit and seed yields were significantly affected in a linear relationship (r 2 Â >=Â  0. 91) by either deficit or <b>surplus</b> irrigation <b>quantities</b> under both irrigation methods.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irrigation}} efficiency upon the water demand for agricultural purposes in the Utah Lake drainage {{area has been}} evaluated in this study. Irrigation demand is the quantity of water at the supply source necessary to satisfy crop water requirements, taking into account irrigation efficiency. The Utah Lake drainage area was divided into hydrologic subareas and districts to facilitate analysis. The demand, <b>surplus,</b> and deficit <b>quantities</b> for each area was determined. The computations were made using constant mean quantities. Within a given area, the diverted water {{was assumed to be}} applied uniformly to satisfy agricultural crop demands, and the contribution of groundwater was neglected. The quantity of major interest is the surplus or deficit, which has been computed for present and potential future irrigation effiencies taking into account historical diversions and precipitation, and estimated root zone storage. The crop demand is not adequately met in the study area. There is a surplus in the Provo district (29, 000 acre-feet annually), while deficits occur in the Spanish Fork district (69, 000 acre-feet annually) and Northern Juab Valley subarea (38, 000 acre-feet annually). The common pattern is excessive diversions in May and insufficient diversions in July through September. The present mean irrigation efficiency of 36 percent in the Utah Lake dra inage area results in an annual deficit of 111, 000 acre-feet, of which 69, 000 acre-feet occurs in Utah Valley. The maximum monthly deficit is 76, 000 acre-feet, which occurs in August. Provided irrigation efficiencies were increased to 68 percent, surplus would exist in every month and the annual surplus would be 159, 000 acre-feet. The combination of additional storage facilities to modify the diversion to coincide with crop demand, reallocation of water from water -plenty to water -short areas, and increasing the irrigation efficiency would provide the best economic use of water {{for the benefit of the}} area.
