40|$|International audienceDistributed Fiber Optic Systems (DOFS) are an {{emerging}} and innovative technology that allows long-range and continuous strain/temperature monitoring {{with a high}} resolution. However, <b>strain</b> <b>profiles</b> measured in the optical fiber may differ from actual strain in the structure, due to the shear transfer through the intermediate material layers between the optical fiber and the host material (i. e., in the protective coating of the sensing cable and in the adhesive).

These are composed of an optical fiber cable in which a light impulse is launched by an opto-electronic device. The scattered light is {{of interest in the}} spectral domain: the spontaneous Brillouin spectrum is centered on the Brillouin frequency, which is related to the local strain and temperature changes in the optical fiber. When coupled with an industrial Brillouin optical time-domain analyzer (B-OTDA), an optical fiber cable can provide distributed measurements of strain and/or temperature, with a spatial resolution over kilometers of 40 cm. This paper focuses on the functioning of a B-OTDA device, where we address the problem of the improvement of spatial resolution. We model a Brillouin spectrum measured within an integration base of 1 m as the superposition of the elementary spectra contained in the base. Then, the spectral distortion phenomenon can be mathematically explained: if the strain is not constant within the integration base, the Brillouin spectrum is composed of several elementary spectra that are centered on different local Brillouin frequencies. We propose a source separation methodology approach to decompose a measured Brillouin spectrum into its spectral components. The local Brillouin frequencies and amplitudes are related to a portion of the integration base where the strain is constant. A layout algorithm allows the estimation of a <b>strain</b> <b>profile</b> with new spatial resolution chosen by the user. Numerical tests enable the finding of the optimal parameters, which provides a reduction to 1 cm of the 40 -cm spatial resolution of the B-OTDA device.

Knowledge of the through-thickness residual <b>strain</b> <b>profile</b> in the thermally sprayed hydroxyapatite coating/substrate system is therefore {{important in the}} development of a new generation of orthopaedic implants. As the coating microstructure is complex, non-destructive characterization of residual strain, e. g. using neutron diffraction, provides a useful measure of through thickness <b>strain</b> <b>profile</b> without altering the stress field. This first detailed study using a neutron diffraction technique, non-destructively evaluates the through thickness strain measurement in nanostructured hydroxyapatite plasma sprayed coatings on a titanium alloy substrate (as-sprayed, heat treated, and heat treated then soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF)). The influence of crystallographic plane orientation on the residual strain measurement is shown to indicate texturing in the coating. This texturing is expected to influence both the biological and fracture response of HA coatings. Results are discussed in terms of the influence of heat-treatment and SBF on the residual stress profile for these biomedical coatings. The results show that the through thickness residual strain in all three coatings was different for different crystallographic planes but was on average tensile.

In this context, placement of chills in castings has been frequently used to locally manipulate the solidification conditions and microstructure of a casting.

40|$|Fiber optic sensing {{technologies}} are emerging as valid alternatives {{for the health}} monitoring of civil structures. Distributed sensors based on Brillouin scattering add the unique capability of measuring <b>strain</b> and temperature <b>profiles</b> along optical fibers. Measurement is performed by establishing the correlation between fiber strain and temperature, and the frequency shift of the Brillouin backscattered light induced by a monochromatic light pulse. The technology holds potential for use on large structures and integrated transportation infrastructure. Its effectiveness has been assessed through scaled laboratory experiments, whereas field validation is limited to very few demonstration projects conducted to date. This paper presents a pilot application of Brillouin optical time domain reflectometry to measure <b>strain</b> <b>profiles</b> along the steel girders of a continuous slab-on-girder bridge subjected to diagnostic load testing. One of the exterior continuous girders required heat-straightening after falling during construction due to wind. The significance of applying a distributed measurement technique lies in the potential to assess the global girder response, which would be impractical and uneconomical using discrete measurement techniques.
