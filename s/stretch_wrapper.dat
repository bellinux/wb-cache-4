50|$|Mechanical brake <b>stretch</b> <b>wrappers</b> are manual <b>stretch</b> {{wrapping}} systems which {{consist of}} a simple structure supporting a roll of film to be stretched and a mechanical brake which acts on the film roll, creating resistance to turning and stretching the film as it is fed out.|$|R
5000|$|Extended core <b>stretch</b> <b>wrappers</b> are {{rolls of}} stretch film which have their {{internal}} core extended beyond their film roll creating a handle by which film can be wrapped. Extended core wrapping {{is the lowest}} initial investment stretch wrapping system as no machinery is purchased. This system provides little control over stretch and is hard on workers' hands. Because of this, many stretch wrap users opt for low cost hand wrappers such as [...] "hand savers" [...] or mechanical brake systems.|$|R

5000|$|Orbital Wrappers: The film {{is housed}} in a {{carriage}} on a vertical ring, the load is fed horizontally through {{the eye of the}} rotating ring, applying film to the load. A variation of an orbital <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper</b> is a horizontal ring system, in which the load remains still while a horizontal ring is rotated around the load and moves up and down vertically relative to the load, similar to a rotary arm <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Turntable <b>stretch</b> <b>wrappers</b> are {{a type of}} {{automatic}} and semi-automatic stretch wrapping system. A load is placed on a turntable, which rotates relative to the film roll, which is housed in a carriage attached to a vertical [...] "mast" [...] on which it may move up and down. In the simplest turntable systems, stretch is achieved by rotating the load at a speed in which the take-up demand on the load surface is faster than {{the rate at which}} the film is allowed to be fed, being limited by a brake system.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Mima {{launched}} the Octopus Twin a wrapping machine capable of wrapping 150 pallets per hour. ITW Mima delivered their 3000th Octopus <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper</b> in 2008.|$|E

The first <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper</b> was {{manufactured in the}} following year. In 2002, M.J. Maillis Group announces the acquisition of Wulftec International Inc., the leading manufacturer of stretch wrapping machines in Canada.|$|E
50|$|AGVs can {{be applied}} to move {{materials}} in food processing (such as the loading of food or trays into sterilizers) and at the “end of line,” linking the palletizer, <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper,</b> and the warehouse. AGVs can load standard, over-the-road trailers with finished goods, and unload trailers to supply raw materials or packaging materials to the plant. AGVs can also store and retrieve pallets in the warehouse.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary Ring Wrappers: The film {{is housed}} in a {{carriage}} on an horizontal ring in which the load remains static while the horizontal ring is rotating around the load and moves up and down vertically relative to the load, similar to a rotary arm <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper.</b> The rotary ring technology is really a more balanced system with less wear and maintenance than the other available wrapping technologies. These wrappers are capable to reach the highest production capacities (up to 160 pallets/hour).|$|E
50|$|Mima {{was founded}} in 1976 in the United States, to {{manufacture}} stretch wrapping machinery it was acquired by ITW in 1986. Alongside this, Matti Haloila started his own company in Finland and manufactured HaloilaHaloila - Etusivu semi-automatic stretch wrappers from 1976. In 1983 Haloila launched an automatic, rotating ring <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper</b> with the brand name Octopus.Haloila {{became part of the}} Illinois Tool Works (ITW) in 1995, shortly after this, ITW acquired the stretch film business from Mobil and ITW Mima Packaging System was formed. ITW Mima Packaging Systems manufacture stretch films in Belgium and Ireland and stretch wrappers in Bulgaria and Finland.|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} main factors {{affecting}} {{the stability of}} a palletized load that is unitized by a stretch wrapping mechanism. These factors include the type of unitized load, wrapping configuration and shipping method. The wrapping configuration is determined {{on the basis of}} the type of unitized load and shipping method. For this study, the aforementioned components were referred to as the package, the product, and the distribution environment. These components come together to make up a stretch wrapping system. The package corresponds to the stretch wrap film that is packaging the unitized load and pallet. The product corresponds to the goods placed on the pallet to be packaged by the <b>stretch</b> <b>wrapper.</b> The distribution environment corresponds to the hazards that the packaged product will encounter in transit. This study was designed to observe and understand the interactions between each of the components of the stretch wrap system. Prior to stretch wrapping a pallet of product, the film is elongated or pre-stretched. The elastic nature of the stretch wrap forces the film to conform around the palletized load. It is hypothesized that the film force that the stretch wrap applies to the palletized load contributes to improved load containment. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between percentage pre-stretch to change in film force and load containment. For the study, a range of pre-stretched unitized loads were subjected to ISTA 3 E distribution testing. Simultaneously the film force was monitored during the period of distribution testing. Subsequent to distribution testing, the load dispersion was quantified. The data obtained from this test suggested that there is no correlation between percentage pre-stretch and change in film force or load containment. The study also compared three methods of calculating pre-stretch: the marking wheel procedure, tapeless measure, and film cut and weigh. It was found that the most consistent method was the marking wheel procedure, followed by the cut and weigh procedure, and the tapeless measure procedure...|$|E
