30|$|When {{inducing}} fungal pigmentation in wood under controlled conditions, {{the rate}} of culture growth in the initial media plates is often the limiting factor. If fungi are very slow to grow and cannot completely colonize a plate, less inoculum is available for large <b>scale</b> <b>lumber</b> testing. A North American Chlorociboria sp. was shown to have a maximum growth diameter of 18 mm in four weeks, with neither pigment nor mycelium completely covering the plate during the entire six-month trial period (Robinson & Laks 2010 a). This represents a very large problem for large-scale pigment testing, as large amounts of inoculum, whether in liquid, solid, or wood-dowel form, are necessary for inoculating logs and lumber. Fungi that cannot colonize an entire Petri plate, even under ideal growing conditions with unlimited incubation time, are not economically viable options for induced pigmentation in value-added wood.|$|E
40|$|To {{facilitate}} sustainable {{economic conditions}} for timber harvest in Alberta. To create a fair system of timber dues for all timber operators in Alberta. To maintain a timber dues rate system that accurately reflects the economic value of timber {{and the final}} selling price of the manufactured product. Policy Effective January 1, 1998 non-weigh <b>scale,</b> <b>lumber</b> producing operators who assess timber dues on sales volumes of their products will be permitted to apply up to 15 % of their sales volume as ‘small sawlogs’, as per 81 (3) of the Timber Management Regulation (the ‘Regulation’). Dues on this volume will be assessed at the base rate. All other dues rates under s. 81 remain available. Provisions in the Regulation establish a timber dues system that attempts to reflect the true market value of timber. Such provisions recognize where the value of timber is low or {{the costs associated with}} its ’ harvest are high- socalled ‘marginal ’ timber. This system bases the assessment of dues on an operator’s weigh scale data. Non-weigh scale operators who have timber dues assessed on the volume of their forest product sales have not, to this point, been able to apply ‘small sawlog ’ dues rates to their dues assessment. This Directive applies only to coniferous timber permits which are subject to Schedule 3 of the Regulation that are issued on a non-competitive basis, produce lumber and assess timber dues based on their product sales volume. The operator must claim for this provision in order for it to be processed...|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} James H. Perkins, {{a native of}} New Hampshire, in December 1845 was the {{beginning}} of the economic boom that would make Williamsport into a booming lumber city.

Perkins and his business partner, John Leighton, set out with the goal of creating a large <b>scale</b> <b>lumbering</b> and milling operation.

50|$|The first {{parcel of}} land that was to become Clear Creek State Forest was {{purchased}} by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for $6,880. The original purchase of 3200 acre was purchased in 1919 {{at the end of}} the lumber era that swept throughout the mountains of Pennsylvania. The state continued to purchase land throughout the 20th century with the last acquisition taking place in 1980. Most of the land was acquired from large <b>scale</b> <b>lumbering</b> corporations. These lumber businesses stripped the old growth forest that once spread over most of Pennsylvania. They began lumbering on a large scale in 1883 when the first sawmills were constructed in the area along the many creeks that drained the Allegheny Plateau. The lumbermen harvested the hemlock and white pine trees on an almost exclusive basis. The logs of hemlock and pine were lashed together in rafts and floated down the Clarion River and into the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh. The lumber companies also built three logging railroads in the area to get the lumber out of the mountains and on to the cities of Western Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|The {{next several}} years saw two {{developments}} that made the Susquehanna boom and the sawmills associated with it feasible. The first was the development of reliable means of transportation, with {{the completion of the}} West Susquehanna Branch of the Pennsylvania Canal to Williamsport in 1834 and opening of the first railroad in 1839. These allowed finished wood products to be taken to markets year-round, instead of just floating logs and rafts down the river during Spring and high water. The second was the gradual development and acceptance of steam engines to power sawmills, allowing large mills to operate without water-power. The arrival of James H.

40|$|In {{creating}} explanatory {{models for}} the transition to capitalism in nineteenth century rural New England, scholars [...] both historians and archaeologists [...] focused on agriculture, artisans, and larger scaled industries including textile factories, paper mills, shoe manufactories, and armories. Absent in the transformation scholarship is detailed attention to another sector of the economy, small agriculturally based sawmills, once ubiquitously present on the rural landscape. This dissertation investigates change in sawmilling in the two central Massachusetts towns of Sturbridge and Southbridge from 1730 - 1870. Demand for finished lumber and cordwood escalated {{with the emergence of}} factory villages and the expansion of town centers during the 1830 s, 40 s, and 50 s. Expanded market opportunities pressured sawmill owners and operators to increase production, augment limited hydrological sources, improve water-power systems, and consolidate timber resources. As larger <b>scaled</b> <b>lumber</b> production replaced the custom operation of sawmills, the rural New England landscape itself was transformed by millponds flooding fields and clumps of sawdust clogging streams. The increased value of woodlots and trees is another consequence of industrialization and an essential element in the social and economic transformation of the nineteenth century New England countryside. Those owning woodlots or the means to acquire wooded land and stands of trees profited from the blossoming timber trade as factory villages and expanding town centers required construction materials and firewood during the building booms of the mid nineteenth century. Woodlot management and forest regeneration protected the local timber supply which sustained water-powered sawmilling until the close of the nineteenth century. Archaeological investigation of the thirty-eight sawmill sites identified in the two central Massachusetts towns of Sturbridge and Southbridge coupled with evaluation of land records, probate documents, census and tax records, and account books provides biographical detail for specific millsites and sawmill owners. Hydrological analysis based on data from the present environment, historic climate data, soil profiles, and topographical information combine with archaeological and documentary evidence for a physical description of change in the study area 2 ̆ 7 s landscape and in specific millsites through time. ...|$|R

Although the colony growth rate of C. aeruginascens is still slower than most routine spalting fungi (S. cuboideum, Trametes versicolor (L.) Lloyd, Xylaria polymorpha (Pers.) Grev.), the ability to achieve full plate colonization and pigmentation of albino colonies will allow log and <b>lumber</b> <b>scale</b> use of C. aeruginascens as a spalting fungus to develop.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the pirate}} era, the area in and {{surrounding}} Goose Creek State Park has been centered on timber production, commercial fishing and small <b>scale,</b> subsistence farming. <b>Lumber</b> companies, such as the Eureka Lumber Company and later Weyerhauser Corporation, acquired extensive tracts of land along the creeks and harvested vasts stands of old growth bald cypress and longleaf pine. Much of the land that is now part of Goose Creek State Park was clear cut. Evidence of the timber industry remains at the park today. Visitors to the park can see the remains of piers and loading docks up and down Goose Creek and an old railroad bed crosses the park.|$|R
50|$|Rausu is {{primarily}} a fishing town. One third of residents are supported by the fishing industry. The main intake by the fishing industry consists of kichiji rockfish (Sebastolobus macrochir), Alaska Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), konbu kelp, salmon, squid, and sea urchin. Particularly famous is Rausu konbu (Rausu kelp). There is no other place in Japan to harvest sea urchin from winter to summer other than Rausu.As for agriculture, in southern Rausu there is some dairy farming, but no land suitable for growing rice, produce, or other large <b>scale</b> agriculture. The <b>lumber</b> industry does not {{have much of a}} presence either (as it does in the rest of Hokkaido). 70% of the town's land is lush mountain forest, but it is mostly a part of the Shiretoko National Park.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of a slackwater pool along 53 mi of the North Fork formerly assisted logging operations in the region, although the <b>scale</b> of the <b>lumber</b> industry has decreased significantly since the 19th century. About 81 million board feet were transported on Dworshak Reservoir between 1988 and 1991; however, logs have not been barged on the lake since 1991. This is {{in part because of}} the implementation of a late-summer flow augmentation scheme that requires greater drawdowns of the reservoir, putting log-handling facilities well above the water level, and also because of the development of backcountry logging roads that allow more efficient transport by truck. It has been suggested that some of Dworshak's flood control space be shifted to Grand Coulee Dam in northern Washington in order to provide increased water for flow augmentation; this would carry the added benefits of improving recreation on the lake.|$|R
40|$|Bending {{tests were}} {{performed}} on full <b>scale</b> structural <b>lumber</b> sawed frm sugi(Cryptomeria japonica D. Don.) logs grown in Oita orefecture, {{and the relationship between}} the wood 2 ̆ 7 s strength performance and material factors, as well as the variation of Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus in the wood in its transformation from log to lumber were examined. The ersults are summarized as follows. (1) The mean value of MOE (A) (modulus of elasticity corrected by the standard testing condition) and MOR(A) (modulus of repture correcetd by the standard testing condition) of the sugi square-cut lumber were 7. 86 kN/mm 2 and 40. 3 N/mm 2, respectively. On the ither hand the mean value of MOE(A) and MOE(A) of the sugi rectangular-cut lumber were 8. 12 kN/m 2 and 47. 7 N/mm 2, respectively. The MOE(A) values in both sugi lumber were above the value of standard strength of non graded lumber of established by the Ministry of Construction notice. (2) In the relationship between material factors and strength performance,MOE(A) showed the highest correlation to MOE(A). It was proven that in full-scale boxed heart square-cut structural lumber of sugi the effect of the knots on the strength was small. (3) The dynamic modulus of elasticity decreased in the transition from log to gren lumber. It is considered that sawing pattern and the ratio of juvenile wood in the lumber are involved in the reduction of this value. (4) The machine stress grading of the JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standard) using modulus of elasticity approximately corresponded with the value established by the Ministry of Construction notice. This sugegsts that lumber grown in Oita prefecture classfied according to the grading scale of the JAS can be utilized in terms of its strength preformance...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} describes and {{analyzes the}} operations of a technically planned timber harvest applied on experimental <b>scale</b> by a <b>lumber</b> company in a humid tropical forest of the Southeast of Nicaragua. It involves an operational inventory, the planning and building of the network trails and mountain yards, the controlled logging and its dragging and post-harvest activities. The yields and costs were determined for {{each one of the}} operations. The costs are similar to those in other regions of the humid tropic. The short term impact of the logging was evaluated in term of the damages to the forest, as well as changes in the silvicultural conditions of the remnants mass. The results show that the damages were smaller, in comparison with traditional methods in Central America; thus, the forest was in good condition to allow its handling in natural form. The population of trees and the regeneration in terms of growth, mortality and recruitment were monitored during four years through a network of permanent plots installed before the intervention. The experience in Rio San Juan indicates that benefits can be obtained with the application of low impact techniques in the commercial timber harvest. One recommendation is to validate these results on an operational scale and increase the information coverage of the results, in order to convince the lumber company, the concessionaire or the forest that a good planning, supervision and qualification in the harvest of the forest is not more expensive and it is at their reach...|$|R
