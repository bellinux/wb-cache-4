5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century Euler {{studied the}} {{rotational}} motion of a rigid body and discovered {{the importance of}} the principal axes. Lagrange realized that the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix. In the early 19th century, Cauchy <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> their work could be used to classify the quadric surfaces, and generalized it to arbitrary dimensions. Cauchy also coined the term racine caractéristique (characteristic root) for what is now called eigenvalue; his term survives in characteristic equation.|$|E
25|$|Grothendieck's work {{includes}} {{the invention of}} the étale and l-adic cohomology theories, which explain an observation of André Weil's that there is a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a finite field reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the complex numbers. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.|$|E

Throughout the years, he has collaborated with animal rights organizations to spread awareness about animal abuse and to promote veganism. Phoenix is a member of In Defense of Animals and PETA and has campaigned for both. He does not wear any clothes made out of animal skin. In his films, he requests that the leather costumes are made from synthetic materials.|$|E
25|$|Some {{same-sex}} marriage opponents initially doubted {{that there was}} enough support for legislatures to pass laws for {{same-sex marriage}}; doubters also <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> same-sex marriage previously only advanced through the judiciary. But within seven months into the campaign, same-sex marriage laws were passed in four more states, although Maine's law was repealed by a people's veto on November 3, 2009 funded heavily by organizations from outside the state. However, in the 2012 election, same-sex marriage in Maine was approved by popular vote, meaning {{five of the six}} states had legalized same-sex marriage. The full sweep was brought by Rhode Island's legislature passing same-sex marriage the following May.|$|E

25|$|Broad was {{headmaster}} of Nelson College for 11 years. In 1927 {{he visited}} the United Kingdom with his wife, and <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> secondary schools were organised there. When he returned to Nelson, he put into practice {{some of what he}} had observed, particularly the house system, which still continues. The latter years of Broad's tenure were dominated by the effects of the damaging 1929 Murchison earthquake. Three new boarding houses were planned: the new Rutherford and Barnicoat Houses were completed in 1931, and Fell House was temporarily located in nearby Fairfield House. Broad gained extra responsibilities in 1932 as the daytime operations of the Nelson Technical School were merged into Nelson College. He retired as headmaster at the end of 1933, having been at the school for all but five years since 1884.|$|E
25|$|Thompson slumped to 11–19 in 1945, {{even though}} she {{collected}} a low 1.90 ERA in 260 innings pitched for the renamed Grand Rapids Chicks. Nevertheless, she rebounded the next year with the South Bend Blue Sox and went 15–6 with a 2.90 ERA in 31 games. She appeared in only one game for South Bend during the 1947 season as the league moved entirely to sidearm pitching. Her younger sister, Fredda Acker, joined her on the team as an overhand pitcher in that season but never appeared on the All-American roster, perhaps to safeguard her award-winning looks. Organizers of the AAGPBL did not want Viola's sister Fredda to join the league once she was crowned Miss America for publicity purposes. Their minds were changed once they <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> well Fredda could play.|$|E
25|$|A {{long history}} {{has taken place}} on the Mestalla field since its very beginning, when the Valencia team was not yet in the Primera División. Back then, this stadium could hold 17,000 spectators, and in that time, the club started to show its {{potential}} in regional championships, which led the managers of that time {{to carry out the}} first alterations of Mestalla in 1927. The stadium's total capacity increased to 25,000 before it became severely damaged during the Civil War; the Mestalla was used as a concentration camp and a junk warehouse. It would only keep its structure, since the rest was a lonely plot of land with no terraces and a stand broken during the war. Once the Valencian pitch was renovated, the Mestalla <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> the team managed to bring home their first title in 1941.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Genie's {{stay the}} {{scientists}} <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> frequently and effectively {{she used her}} nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people. David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E
25|$|When Hrólfr {{heard that}} Aðils refused to pay, {{he set off}} to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode {{directly}} to the Swedish king's hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their bodies. Hrólfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Svíagris {{and asked them to}} flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw Aðils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw their gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect the gold. Aðils, however, continued the chase on his horse Slöngvir. Hrólfr then threw Svíagris and <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> Aðils stooped down to pick up the ring with his spear. Hrólfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back.|$|E
25|$|The torrid scoring pace slowed {{during much}} of the third quarter, as both teams began to assert {{themselves}} on the defensive side of the ball. But late in the quarter, a 12-yard punt return by Cowboys receiver Butch Johnson gave Dallas good field position on their 42-yard line. The Cowboys subsequently drove down to the Steelers 10-yard line, mostly with Dorsett's rushing. Then on third down with less than three minutes remaining in the period, Staubach spotted 38-year-old reserve tight end Jackie Smith wide open in the end zone and threw him the ball. Head coach Tom Landry said Staubach tried to throw the ball soft when he <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> wide open Smith was and that it came in low, and that when Smith tried to stop, his feet seemed to come out from under him. Jackie Smith states that it was still a catchable ball and that he should have made the play. Instead, Smith dropped the pass and the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal from kicker Rafael Septién, cutting their deficit to 21–17. Though Smith played 16 years in the league and is now enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he is perhaps best known for this dropped touchdown, particularly in a championship game that was ultimately decided by four points.|$|E

25|$|The CTC {{decision}} to award the license to City Centre was overturned on appeal in March 1982. A review committee, considering the original decision, {{found that the}} funding of the STOLport in Montreal, {{and the ability of}} the applicants to pay for the port, was not addressed and overturned the decision sending back to the CTC to reconsider. In August 1982, Air Atonabee, which already had a license to fly in the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal triangle, announced that it would buy five Dash 8 planes, with first delivery in 1983. The CTC next approved a joint application of Canavia and City Centre Airways to operate Dash 7 planes between Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, with the Government of Canada to spend $13.7 million to help establish the service. The service planned to be running by 1984. Metro urged Transport Canada to build a pedestrian tunnel at an estimated cost of $5.5 million, but Transport Canada put off the decision, stating that it would not decide until it <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> well the STOL service operated. In March 1983, the Canavia-City Centre consortium applied to the Government of Canada for $73.5 million in loan guarantees for the project. The firm was eventually given a $20 million loan guarantee, and the consortium made plans to fly between Toronto and Ottawa only, with service to Montreal in a future phase.|$|E
25|$|Convulsive {{therapy was}} {{introduced}} in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist Ladislas J. Meduna who, believing mistakenly that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with camphor and then metrazol (cardiazol). Meduna {{is thought to be}} the father of convulsive therapy. In 1937, the first international meeting on convulsive therapy was held in Switzerland by the Swiss psychiatrist Muller. The proceedings were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry and, within three years, cardiazol convulsive therapy was being used worldwide. Italian Professor of neuropsychiatry Ugo Cerletti, who had been using electric shocks to produce seizures in animal experiments, and his colleague Lucio Bini developed the idea of using electricity as a substitute for metrazol in convulsive therapy and, in 1938, experimented {{for the first time on}} a person. It was believed early on that inducing convulsions aided in helping those with severe schizophrenia but later found to be most useful with affective disorders such as depression. Cerletti had noted a shock to the head produced convulsions in dogs. The idea to use electroshock on humans came to Cerletti when he <b>saw</b> <b>how</b> pigs were given an electric shock before being butchered to put them in an anesthetized state. Cerletti and Bini practiced until they felt they had the right parameters needed to have a successful human trial. Once they started trials on patients, they found that after 10-20 treatments the results were significant. Patients had much improved. A positive side effect to the treatment was retrograde amnesia. It was because of this side effect that patients could not remember the treatments and had no ill feelings toward it. ECT soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient. Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a Nobel Prize but did not receive one. By 1940, the procedure was introduced to both England and the US. In Germany and Austria, it was promoted by Friedrich Meggendorfer. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the use of ECT became widespread.|$|E
