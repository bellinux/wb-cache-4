Current <b>surge</b> <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> technologies are detailed for several of the larger <b>surge</b> <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers worldwide. Tests were performed using both 8 / 20 μs and 10 / 350 μs current impulses to verify the voltage and current response of gas discharge tubes with or without series MOVs and triggering circuits. Measurements obtained from the test setup were compared against each other, sharing a total impulse current of 35. 8 kA peak using an 8 / 20 μs waveform and 10. 2 kA peak using a 10 / 350 μs current impulse waveform. In the work presented, it is shown that series varistors dampened any voltage and current oscillatory behaviour superimposed from the current impulse generator due to their voltage clamping properties, which similarly do not allow any follow current to flow after a surge has subsided. No effect was seen by using a single varistor or a many parallel mounted varistors in series with a gas discharge tube. By using three electrode gas discharge tubes with a triggering circuit, the clamping voltage was reduced, as the gas tubes reacted faster than an equivalent circuit without a triggering module, which {{has the advantage of}} reducing the protection level for the protected equipment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>surge</b> <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> (SPD), as {{buildings}} over-voltage protective device, {{has been}} widely used in building’s power distribution system. A novel SPD based on hollow cathode effects is designed. In both air and nitrogen gas, the relationship of discharging voltage and gas pressure are measured, and the critical pressure ranges are determined in the condition of Up< 4 kV (Up is pulse voltage protection level). The results indicate that, in {{the condition of the}} gap distance D= 3 mm and the small hole diameter φ = 3 mm, the operating gas pressure ranges are from 50 to 5 × 104 Pa. With the gap distance D increasing, the pulse voltage protection level Up is decreasing slightly. While D= 3 mm, φ = 3 mm, and gas pressure (nitrogen) is 600 Pa, the DC voltage protection level and pulse protection level are 784 V and 2. 4 kV, respectively. In the action of 10 / 350 µs pulse current waveform, the quantity of transferred charge Q is 48. 26 C, and the ratio energy W/R is up to 2 MJ/Ω.

From the data evaluated during 1980 [...] 1994, it was found that failures of surge arresters and suppressers by short circuits were neither a significant risk nor safety concern, and there were no failures of surge suppressers preventing a reactor trip.

40|$|The present {{society is}} highly {{dependant}} on complex electronics systems, {{which have a}} low damage threshold level. Therefore, {{there is a high}} risk of partial or total loss of the system’s electronics when they are exposed to a thunderstorm environment. This calls for a deep understanding on the mechanism related to the interaction of lightning generated electromagnetic fields with various large distributed/scattered systems. To accurately represent the interaction of lightning electromagnetic fields with electrical networks, it is necessary to have return stroke models capable to reproduce the electromagnetic field signatures generated by a lightning flash. Several models have been developed in the recent past to study the field-to-wire coupling mechanism. The most popular, simple and accurate among the available models is the Agrawal et al. model. On the other hand, ATP-EMTP is a well-known transient simulation package widely used by power engineers. This package has various built-in line models like Semlyen, Marti and Noda setups. There is a difficulty in applying the Agrawal et al. model with the built-in line models of ATP-EMTP, as the voltage source due to the horizontal component of electric field in Agrawal et al. model is in series with the line impedance and not in between two transmission line segments. Furthermore, when the electromagnetic field is propagating over a finite conducting ground plane, the soil will selectively attenuate the high frequency content of the electromagnetic field; causing a change in the field wave shape. A finite conducting ground will also produce a horizontal field component at the ground level. Several approximations are available in the literature to obtain the horizontal electric field; namely the wave-tilt and the Cooray-Rubinstein approximation. Consequently, it is important to investigate the change on the induced voltage signature when the power line is located over a finitely conducting ground. Additionally, to provide protection from lightning induced transients it is necessary to use <b>Surge</b> <b>Protective</b> <b>Devices</b> (SPDs) capable of diverting the incoming transients and provide protection level necessary to avoid damage in the equipment. However, standard test procedures of the SPDs do not take into account sub-microsecond structure of the transients. Therefore, to provide the required protection level to sensitive equipments connected to the low voltage power network, it is essential to understand the response of SPDs subjected to high current derivative impulses. This thesis is aimed to investigate the research problems as addressed above. Special attention will be given to a new proposed return stroke model, a simple circuit approach for efficient implementation of Agrawal et al. model using ATP-EMTP, the effect of the soil conductivity on the lightning induced overvoltage signatures and the response of <b>surge</b> <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> subjected to high current derivative impulses...|$|R

This thesis provides comprehensive analysis on the lightning scenarios in 18 communication and broadcasting towers situated in similar and different isokeraunic contours in Sri Lanka. The results and observation show that most of the damages reported due to the indirect lightning flashes, power line surges and step voltage in the event of lightning strike to the tower. The property damages such as patches and cracks developed in their walls and floors, the damages to electrical and electronic equipment such as electrical switch gears, bulbs, socket outlets, televisions, and radios also reported. The personal injuries were in the form of temporary paralysis due to step potential or electric shock. In one case, the victims were sleeping on floor in his home which is located around 40 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. In another case the victims were sitting on the chair with legs on the ground in his home which is located around 30 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{lightning}} overvoltages in Medium Voltage (MV) {{lines are}} thoroughly investigated. The other {{goal is to}} propose new protection schemes for the designs. The lines consist of overhead lines, underground cables and covered conductors. These overvoltage problems range from direct and indirect strokes to lightning arcs. All the models and simulations are developed using the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) and Finite Element Method (FEM), while MATLAB is used for post-processing the results and identification of the model parameters. Improvement in the surge protection of MV overhead lines is demonstrated {{with a combination of}} surge arresters and a shield wire. Using the IEEE 34 -node feeder injected with multiple lightning strokes, the feeder is simulated using EMTP. The response of the line is modeled both with and without the surge protection devices. The simulation study extends to the performance of a MV underground cable due to a nearby lightning discharge using FEM. The use of shield wire for limiting the overvoltage stress in the cables is proposed. A numerical analysis and simulations are performed to determine the outage rate of MV covered conductors due to lightning strokes of different characteristics. The optimum distance for <b>surge</b> <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> on the conductors is also assessed. An enhancement in the surge analysis of distribution lines with the shielding effect of trees is proposed. An experimental study shows that a tree can intercept a lightning stroke in the vicinity of a distribution line. This study also analyzes experimental results of the shielding effectiveness of a tree and the induced voltages existing between the tree and the distribution line. The study is extended to evaluate the induced voltage on a distribution line for larger clearances using a Rusck model. This work investigates the lightning arc between an overhead line and a nearby tree under artificial rainfall. A full-scale laboratory experiment confirms that a direct stroke to a tree can cause severe damage to nearby power lines by initiating an arc channel through air to the conductors. A complete model of this phenomenon is developed by combining the existing static and dynamic arc equations. The model is accomplished by the bilateral interaction between the EMTP and Transient Analysis Control System (TACS) field. The experimental results have been reproduced by the computer simulations.
