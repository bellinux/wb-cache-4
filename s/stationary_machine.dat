5000|$|In {{an article}} on the Khatyn massacre, Lund University {{historian}} Per Anders Rudling, relying on KGB interrogation reports released in 2008, wrote that the Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118 filled a farmer's barn with civilians, set it on fire, and used a machine gun to kill the civilians who tried to escape the flames: “One witness stated that Volodymyr Katriuk was a particularly active participant in the atrocity: he reportedly lay behind the <b>stationary</b> <b>machine</b> gun, firing rounds on anyone attempting to escape the flames”. A Soviet Union war-crimes trial in 1973 heard that three members of the Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118 killed a group of Belarusian loggers earlier that day, suspecting {{they were part of a}} popular uprising. [...] "I saw how Ivankiv was firing with a machine-gun upon the people who were running for cover in the forest, and how Katriuk and Meleshko were shooting the people lying on the road," [...] the witness said. The Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118 was chiefly responsible for the creation of German [...] "dead zones". The dead zone policy involved exterminating communities suspected, or capable of aiding the Soviet partisans who had launched ambushes against Nazi forces in Belarus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{industry}} in western Canada {{and in particular}} British Columbia did not develop as quickly as in the east but with the exhaustion of the eastern forests {{and the opening of}} the Panama Canal in 1914, it eventually overtook the scale of activity in eastern Canada. Different conditions there required different logging techniques. Because the trees were much larger and heavier, three times as many horses or oxen were required to haul them. The more moderate climate meant that the winter snow roads could not be used and instead necessitated the use of log skid roads. Trees were so tall that springboards were wedged into notches cut into the trunk to serve as work platforms for two loggers using heavy double bit steel axes. Human and animal muscle, powered the industry until 1897 when the steam-powered [...] "donkey engine" [...] was introduced in B.C. from the US. This <b>stationary</b> <b>machine</b> drove a winch connected to a rope or wire which was used to haul logs up to 150 metres across the forest floor. A series of such engines placed at intervals could be used to haul large numbers of logs, long distances in relatively short periods of time. The [...] "high lead system" [...] in which a wire or lead suspended in trees was used to haul logs, was also introduced about this time.|$|E

40|$|Advanced Meat Recovery Systems (AMRS) {{have been}} {{developed}} {{in an effort to}} simplify the deboning of meat. For {{the purpose of this paper}} deboning is the process whereby all or nearly all edible tissue is extracted from bone in meat processing operations. Historically, this was done by the skillful use of h i v e s of various kinds. More recently, motorized knives and other cutting instruments have been introduced. These make deboning more efficient and more rapid. The hand-held devices, however, have been associated with repetitive motion disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Moreover, such devices are less efficient and more contaminative than <b>stationary</b> <b>machines</b> that do not require human handling. The <b>stationary</b> <b>machines</b> of the 1960 s were criticized because of what was considered a rather crude approach to deboning consisting of the grinding of the bones containing the meat.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the design of a {{protocol}} for transparent, location-independent access in mobile systems. The protocol, termed by us Mobile Client/Server Protocol (MCSP) is an implementation of a communication layer on a mobile host and a <b>stationary</b> <b>machine</b> within the wireline network, and provides middleware functionality. The MCSP supports communication services through the client/server paradigm to transaction-oriented applications distributed between the mobile and a set of service and information brokers. To support the mobile and the wireless environment, a surrogate process is created within the fixed network to perform operations on behalf of the mobile within the fixed network. The MCSP then loosely couples the communicating entities, thus reducing the overhead associated with handoffs and disconnects, so characteristic of the mobile environment. Of particular interest is the application of the MCSP to location-based services, for example, th...|$|E

However, after certain period of time, relaxation of screw material, self-untightening of nuts and looseness of foundation screws influence on reducing the force of preload screw tightening and unequal load distribution. This unequal load distribution causes unequal deformations, which generate occuring vibrations. In extreme cases, breakages of screws and heavier accidents of systems driven by that gear units or machines can happen.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the fermentative parameters and chemical composition of silage cane sugar added with residue dried brewery. The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments and four replications: 100 % cane sugar; 90 % of cane sugar + 10 % residue dried brewer; 80 % of cane sugar + 20 % residue dried brewer and 70 % cane sugar + 30 % dried brewer based on natural matter, composed silages.

40|$|Renal failure {{results in}} {{poisoning}} because metabolic by-products are not promptly {{removed from the}} body. The main remedy for this condition is hemo-dialysis, where blood bypasses the kidneys and is filtered in a “dialyzer”, <b>stationary</b> <b>machine.</b> This research proposes and verifies novel techniques that allow an implantable device to replace a dialysis machine. This device would perform two important kidney functions: filtering solids and retaining desired electrolytes and small proteins. Three independent approaches are proposed and experimentally verified. The first approach is design optimization of the glomerular membrane as an implantable filter to separate blood cells from whole blood. We studied the parameters that minimized pressure drop per unit area in micro-channels (straight and diverging) with circular cross-sections. The second approach, aimed at extending the filtration capability of a porous membrane, used the concept of “back-wash”. It used a natural energy source in the body, the pulsatile character of blood flow, with pressure varying between 80 and 120 mm Hg. Under similar experimental conditions, experimental results demonstrated that the permeate volumetric flow rate was higher in the backwash system compared to the no-backwash system, and this flow rate could be maintained for many more filtration cycles. The third approach, which retained body electrolytes and small proteins, used a static electric field to divert blood ions and charged proteins back to circulation. Two geometries for this electrophoretic filtration were proposed and tested: “Y” method and “cross-flow” method. The “cross-flow” method seems more promising after a preliminary comparison. A benefit of using the electrostatic deviation of charged solids before mechanical filtration is a lower density of blood solids reaching the filtration membrane, causing a lower probability of filter clogging. Due {{to the importance of}} maintaining proper pressure drops at all renal filtration stages an implantable valveless pump was designed and fabricated for pressure drop adjustments. This pump’s novelty is that it relies entirely on blood pressure pulsations and does not require an external power supply. None of the proposed filtration techniques requires external power supplies; all rely on energy delivered by the heart...|$|E
