40|$|Abstract. Brushing teeth {{is a daily}} {{habit to}} {{maintain}} oral hygiene, including the maintenance of oral cleanliness and prevention of caries and periodontal disease. However, tooth brushing is often not carried out correctly or forgotten because the task is boring. Although several works have contributed to improving brushing performance and motivation, the feedback {{seems to be very}} remote from the brushing itself, i. e., not intuitive. In this study, we establish two objectives to deal with these issues. The first is not to present information on a visual display, but to augment the ordinary tooth brushing experience consisting of haptic and auditory sensations, while the other is to design the modulation so that users feel as if their teeth are gradually becoming cleaner, thereby providing the necessary motivation. To achieve these aims, we propose a novel approach to augment the tooth brushing experience by modulating the brushing sounds to make tooth brushing entertaining in an intuitive manner. A microphone embedded in the toothbrush records the brushing sounds, which are presented to users after being modified by a PC. In the experiment, we demonstrate that increasing the <b>sound</b> <b>gain</b> and manipulating the frequency can control the overall impression of brushing by giving a sense of comfort and accomplishment...|$|E

40|$|There has not {{yet been}} any work {{reported}} in the literature where the Punjabi speech has been analyzed/synthesized using the linear predictive coding (LPC). This work, therefore, concentrates on the linear prediction analysis and synthesis of the Punjabi speech.

Each of the four control parameters (LP coefficients, voiced/unvoiced decision, pitch period for voiced <b>sounds,</b> <b>gain)</b> can be determined directly from the speech waveform using more than one method, thereby making each analysis/synthesis project substantially different from every other project. Modern software tools (e. g., MATLAB and Praat), and methods (e. g., autocorrelation method) have been used in this work because of their graphics capabilities, efficiency, stability, simplicity and accuracy. Informal perceptual listening tests and spectral characteristics confirm that LPC technique is capable of generatin...|$|R
500|$|However, {{the year}} 2009 saw the dubstep <b>sound</b> <b>gaining</b> further {{worldwide}} recognition, often through {{the assimilation of}} elements of the sound into other genres, {{in a manner similar}} to drum and bass before it.

40|$|When castrati {{disappeared}} from the operatic stage, they were replaced by heroic tenors and fatherly basses, who came to represent masculinity in its different guises. However, the high, penetrating sound of the erstwhile virtuosos continued to inspire fascination and debate. In this article, I examine medical and artistic discourses on several male voices {{that came to be}} considered weak or effeminate in the nineteenth century. Comparing representations of castratos, theories on the falsetto register and narratives on the social meaning of stammering allows for an exploration of the outer edges of the normal, healthy male voice as its sound was imagined {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. Both on the (operatic) stage and in daily life, the chest voice and its rough <b>sound</b> <b>gained</b> terrain as the practice of cultivation lost its legitimacy and its association with gentlemanly refinement.

40|$|Abstract In perceptual speaker {{identification}}, it {{is known}} that the identification accuracy depends on the contents of the stimuli presented to the listeners. In our previous experiments, we found that the stimuli containing a nasal sound are effective for speaker identification by listening, and that coronal sounds are more effective than labial ones. In this present study, we investigated the effects of the stimulus contents again, this time focusing on the vowels in CV monosyllabic stimuli. Through the experiment we obtained the following outcomes: 1) nasal <b>sounds</b> <b>gained</b> significantly higher scores than oral sounds, although the difference between the sonorants and the obstruents was not significant; 2) alveolar nasals were more effective than the labial nasal; 3) palatalisation of a consonant improved speaker identification performances; and 4) back vowels were more effective than front vowels significantly. These tendencies imply the following phonological grounds: 1) [+nas] is more important than [+son]; 2) [+nas] comes under [PLACE] as to the judgment of the speaker identity; 3) [son] may lie under [nas] in the identification of the speakers, and 4) [-ant] and [+back] are also important for speaker identification...|$|R
