5|$|The peak of sutra copying {{occurred}} in the Nara period at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Daihannya) sutra and the Lotus Sutra were the sutras most often copied. Most of the sutras were written in black ink on paper dyed pale yellow. However, some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo, purple or other colored paper—particularly {{the ones that were}} produced in 741 when Emperor Shōmu decreed Konkōmyō Saishōō sutras written in gold letters be distributed among provincial temples. Many sutra copies contain a colophon with the name of the sponsor—often <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ruling class—and the reason of copying, usually related to the health or salvation of people or the state.|$|E
5|$|At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan {{appeared}} at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed {{that they should be}} broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.|$|E

After briefly considering Tennessee Williams, Berg decided to research the aviator Charles Lindbergh, attracted by what he described as [...] "the dramatic possibilities of the story of the great hero who became a great victim and a great villain". Berg convinced Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to grant him unprecedented access to the man's archives, which he was surprised to find totaled [...] "1,300 boxes, or several million papers".|$|E

500|$|As {{she arrived}} at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd {{gathered}} outside the building. [...] Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men [...] "to the prisoner Wells's house" [...] at about 4am on the morning of 2January. [...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E
2500|$|The city {{takes its}} name from George Vancouver, who {{explored}} the inner harbour of Burrard Inlet in 1792 and gave various places British names. The family name Vancouver itself originates from the Dutch [...] "Van Coevorden", denoting <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city of Coevorden, Netherlands.

[...] Daniel Drayton and Edward Sayres, the two white captains, {{had to be}} taken into safety as pro-slavery people {{attacked}} them for threatening their control of property. [...] The fugitive slaves were taken to a local jail. [...] It was later reported that when <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd asked the Edmonson girls if they were ashamed for what they had done, Emily replied proudly that they would do exactly the same thing again. Three days of riots and disturbances followed, as pro-slavery agitators attacked anti-slavery offices and presses in the city in an attempt to suppress the abolitionist movement. [...] Most of the masters of the fugitive slaves decided to sell them quickly to slave traders, rather than provide another chance to escape. [...] Fifty of the slaves were transported by train to Baltimore, from where they were sold and transported to the Deep South.|$|E

6000|$|She was {{standing}} very still, her eyes roaming {{through the hall}} and music room, as it now was--all thrown into one, under the great skylight. Old Jolyon had an odd impression of her. Was she trying to conjure <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shades of that space where the colouring was all pearl-grey and silver? He would have had gold himself; more lively and solid. But Jo had French tastes, and it had come out shadowy like that, with an effect as of the fume of cigarettes the chap was always smoking, broken here and there by a little blaze of blue or crimson colour. It was not his dream! Mentally he had hung this space with those gold-framed masterpieces of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when quantity was precious. And now where were they? Sold for a song! That something which made him, alone among Forsytes, move with the times had warned him against the struggle to retain them.

We are bound to regard that young woman as Lady Anna Lovel, and we are bound to regard her and her mother conjointly as co-heiresses, in {{different}} degrees, to all the personal property which the old Earl left behind him. We can't with safety take any other view. There will still be difficulties in their way;--and very serious difficulties, were she to marry this tailor; but, between you and me, he would eventually get the money. Perhaps, Mr. Flick, you had better see him. You would know how to get at his views without compromising anybody. But, in the first place, let the Countess know everything.

60|$|It was the Whig {{rather than}} the Puritan that triumphed on that day; it was the Englishman with his aristocratic compromise; and even what {{followed}} Cromwell's death, the Restoration, was an aristocratic compromise, and even a Whig compromise. The mob might cheer as for a mediæval king; but the Protectorate and the Restoration were more of a piece than the mob understood. Even in the superficial things where {{there seemed to be}} a rescue it was ultimately a respite. Thus the Puritan régime had risen chiefly by one thing unknown to mediævalism--militarism. Picked professional troops, harshly drilled but highly paid, were the new and alien instrument by which the Puritans became masters. These were disbanded and their return resisted by Tories and Whigs; but their return seemed always imminent, because it was in the spirit of the new stern world of the Thirty Years' War. A discovery is an incurable disease; and it had been discovered that a crowd could be turned into an iron centipede, crushing larger and looser crowds. Similarly the remains of Christmas were rescued from the Puritans; but they had eventually to be rescued again by Dickens from the Utilitarians, and may yet have to be rescued by <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vegetarians and teetotallers. The strange army passed and vanished almost like a Moslem invasion; but it had made the difference that armed valour and victory always make, if it was but a negative difference. It was the final break in our history; it was a breaker of many things, and perhaps of popular rebellion in our land. It is something of a verbal symbol that these men founded New England in America, for indeed they tried to found it here. By a paradox, there was something prehistoric in the very nakedness of their novelty. Even the old and savage things they invoked became more savage in becoming more new. In observing what is called their Jewish Sabbath, they would have had to stone the strictest Jew. And they (and indeed their age generally) turned witch-burning from an episode to an epidemic. The destroyers and the things destroyed disappeared together; but they remain as something nobler than the nibbling legalism of some of the Whig cynics who continued their work. They were above all things anti-historic, like the Futurists in Italy; and there was this unconscious greatness about them, that their very sacrilege was public and solemn like a sacrament; and they were ritualists even as iconoclasts. It was, properly considered, but a very secondary example of their strange and violent simplicity that one of them, before a mighty mob at Whitehall, cut off the anointed head of the sacramental man of the Middle Ages. For another, far away in the western shires, cut down the thorn of Glastonbury, from which had grown the whole story of Britain.|$|E
50|$|Shortcomings {{in party}} loyalty, {{with members of}} Parliament and groups of members rooting for their own {{interests}} and not always abiding by the directives of the party leadership also contributed greatly to short-lived Cabinets.

50|$|The Public Service Commission (PSC) {{chairman}} Stuart Huggett {{revealed to}} the Fiji Times on 19 January that they had received a formal complaint from Commodore Bainimarama about Lesi Korovavala, the Chief Executive Officer of the Home Affairs Ministry.

Earlier, Bainimarama had claimed evidence of a telephone conversation between Baledrokadroka and <b>somebody</b> <b>from</b> outside <b>the</b> camp; the Fiji Times implied this to be Korovavala.
