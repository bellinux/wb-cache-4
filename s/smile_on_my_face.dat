500|$|Half an {{hour after}} Michael Vaughan {{resigned}} from the Test captaincy, Collingwood relinquished charge of the ODI squad because it was affecting his ability to enjoy the game. Collingwood told his wife {{on the night before}} his century against South Africa {{that it was time to}} go. [...] He later explained, [...] "I've found the extra workload to be very difficult [...] [...] It's mentally tiring, and that's the top and bottom of it.

500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> too.|$|E

Snyder flew out to San Francisco, California to screen several episodes, and told Lucas the only place he wanted to see the show was on Cartoon Network. Snyder wished to create an action/adventure block of shows on Friday night in an attempt to rejuvenate Cartoon Network. Snyder expressed confidence that the shows would help boost ratings: [...] "You catch me at a time where I have a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> because of our internal results".

40|$|In this project, my aim {{has been}} to {{recreate}} scenes which make my heart beat a bit faster. Scenes which bring <b>smiles</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> the moment I cast <b>my</b> eyes <b>on</b> them. Scenes which raise excitement within me, taking me on a ride of longing, curiosity and fantasies. Through this project, I {{have come to understand}} the importance of looking within me and empowering the thoughts and interests which grow inspiration and spark fire in me. I chose to work with hats due to the value they once held amongst men in the olden day Iran and the strong roots of formality entangling them. The combination of such culturally and historically rich objects together with my young romanticized thoughts has been an inspiring journey for me. This project was followed by the idea of creating large showcase body related objects. I wanted to work in dimensions larger than the usual sizes of jewelry I have experience working with. I wanted them to draw attention and take over a room with their presence through for example their forms, colors, light, sound, dimensions...|$|R

2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around with a big <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{warmth and}} odour stole over my senses. I was neither hungry nor thirsty, but drugged with fatigue. With a fixed <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> (a smile betokening, as I believe now, little but {{feminine}} vanity and satisfaction after feeding on that strange heart), my thoughts went wandering. The sounds of skies and earth drowsed my senses, and I nodded {{off into a}} nap. The grinding of wheels awoke me. From a welter of dreams I gazed out through {{the opening of the}} barn at a little battered cart and a shaggy pony. And behold, on the chopped straw and hay beside me, lay stretched out, nose on paw, our enemy, the sheep-dog. He thumped a friendly tail at me, while he growled at my deliverer.|$|E

50|$|Even with Jonathan Ross as {{a three-hour}} warm-up man, Buy Me Up TV failed to coax the glimmer of a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> The talents of Doon Mackichan couldn't rescue Justin Edwards' and James Eldred's account of life {{behind the scenes}} at a 24-hour {{shopping}} channel.Perhaps, judging that this setting {{has been the subject}} of numerous satires, the authors settled for a frenzied facsimile of life at the consumerist cutting edge. Everyone sounded barking, indeed on the verge of a nervous breakdown, perhaps because they had to cope with dialogue that could apparently only be delivered at ear-shattering volume. The audience laughter was strangely disturbing, as if they had been force fed E numbers before being manacled to their seats.|$|R
5000|$|Koel Puri of India Today {{gave the}} film 4/5, saying [...] "film is no path breaker {{but for the}} fact that I just can't fault it, I still have a <b>smile</b> {{plastered}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and I'll probably go see it again... tomorrow". Subhash K. Jha also gave a 4/5 and said, [...] "Hrishida won't recognise this as his [...] "Khubsoorat". But he won't disapprove of what has been done to his work". [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave the film a 4/5 and said that, [...] "director Shashank Ghosh is no Hrishikesh Mukherjee" [...] though manages [...] "to make a perfect Disney movie. It makes you laugh. It makes you go 'aww' and that goes a long way in a young romance" [...] Saibaal Chatterjee of NDTV also gave a positive review, giving the film a 3.5/5 and saying, [...] "in the end, Khoobsurat is a pretty good show. It is both funny and flashy, but its many flourishes are delivered in measures that religiously avoid excess". Srijana Mitra Das of Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 and said, [...] "This delightfully roguish romance tickles everything fun-loving inside you ... that's what makes it so khoobsurat." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN IBN gave a rating of 3/5 and wrote, [...] "Khoobsurat is for those seeking comfort in the familiar, it's a pretty satisfying watch." [...] Sarita A. Tanwar of DNA India gave the film 3/5 and said it [...] "is sure to connect with the hearts of girls of all ages". Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave the film a 3/5, and said [...] "this film has little of the gentle nuance of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee-directed original, but it's still pretty good fun. This Bollywood-Disney fairytale combo is worth a shot". Raja Sen, of Rediff gave the film 3/5, and compared it to candy, saying [...] "wrapped in bright plastic and frequently too sweet for your own good, they act as sunny, unsurprising treats that lead to sticky, syrupy smiles". Andy Webster of the New York Times also wrote positively, saying [...] "Bollywood films have appropriated Hollywood genres and imagery for years, but Mr. Ghosh, using a pleasing pastel palette, deftly achieves a particularly Disney-like polish. And he avoids making-of-a-royal pitfalls: Ms. Kapoor’s character never abandons her humor for refinement. Twice, Mili says that she was raised to speak up for herself. Not a bad characteristic for a future Rajput princess".However, a critic at Bollywood Hungama disagreed and gave the film 2.5/5, and said, [...] "overall, Khoobsurat is likeable in parts with good performances and stunning visuals; however the weak script is an 'ugly' hurdle this film will face at the box-office". Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times also gave a negative review, giving the film a 1/5, and said [...] "the film could have been more tolerable".|$|R
