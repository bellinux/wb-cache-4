Based on an empirical investigation in Izmir, a transit migration hub in Turkey, this paper critically discusses intentionality as a valid dimension in conceptualisations of transit migration. The study found that migrants' intentions in this transit migration hub are highly fluctuating because of their embeddedness in socio-institutional environments, which continuously affect migrants' <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> <b>risk</b> perceptions and coping strategies, causing new migration intentions to arise. The study argues that intention is a problematic criterion in conceptualising transit migration, due to a conceptual fallacy where transit migration flows are taken as {{the unit of analysis}} whereas intentions are individual attributes...|$|R

This paper both {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} key conceptual and methodological principles that can be extracted from the very complex literatures on social capital and innovation, and to draw out the interactions between these concepts. The paper argues that the social capital literature has been hijacked at one end by those solely taken by precise definitions and measurement, and {{at the other end}} by those that proclaim social capital to be the blanket solution, and the missing link. If we allow ourselves {{to get caught up in}} the too miniature details then we risk losing important insights from a fascinating concept.

However, public broadcasting {{a question to}} all friends <b>risks</b> <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> when repeated too often, is not tolerant to topic sensitivity, and can result in no response, as the message is lost in a myriad of status updates. Direct messaging is more personal and avoids these pitfalls, but requires manual selection of friends to contact, which can be time consuming and challenging. A user may have difficulty guessing which of their numerous online friends can provide a high quality and timely response. We demonstrate a working system that addresses these issues by returning an ordered subset of friends predicting (a) near-term availability, (b) willingness to respond and (c) topical knowledge, given a query. The combination of these three aspects are unique to our solution, and all are critical {{to the problem of}} obtaining timely and relevant responses. Our system acts as a decision aid – we give insight into why each friend was recommended and let the user decide whom to contact. I...|$|R

The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a model that examines the inter-relationships between social capital and livelihoods and to thereby estimate their impacts on levels of hazard <b>risk.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>capital</b> is embedded in social networks and institutional frameworks that determine {{the quantity and quality of}} resources and services available to people. In addition to addressing the physical and social dimension of hazards, this research evaluates the linkages between social capital and livelihoods and underlying spatial processes that determine levels of vulnerability and risk from a hazardous event. The proposed hazard risk location model (HRLM) re-specifies hazard risk as a function of the hazard, exposure, and coping ability. The model is developed in two stages. First, an autoregressive model is applied to estimate the causal relationship between the dependent variable representing coping ability and variables representing social capital.

30|$|We use three inter-related {{approaches}} {{to address these}} concerns. First, we control {{for a wide variety}} of individual and PSU-level characteristics, ranging from a respondent’s religion to PSU-level corruption and trust. We also include country fixed effects and a battery of PSU-level geographic controls in all regressions. Second, using the approach developed by Altonji et al. 2005, we calculate that the effect of unobservables needs to be at least two times higher than the effect of observables to explain away the diversity effect, which is unlikely. Third, our results survive when we control for whether the respondent has ever moved, as well as when we limit our observations to only years after 2005, suggesting that reverse causality between entrepreneurship and diversity is less likely to be an issue. Admittedly, several of our control variables - such as our measures of <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> <b>risk</b> attitudes, or PSU-level non-geographic controls - are less likely to be exogenous, which suggests that our results should be regarded primarily as correlations. Nevertheless, our multi-pronged approach makes it less likely that our results capture simply a spurious relationship.|$|R

In {{order to get a}} better method, we propose a new risk measure to be the base of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation rule. Design/methodology/approach : We proposed two kinds of allocation methods: one is marginal risk contribution based on iso-entropic coherent risk measure(IE), the other one is to combine the minimal excess allocation(EBA) principle and IE into <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. The iso-entropic coherent risk measure has many advantages over others; it is continuous and more powerful in distinguishing risks, consistent with higher-order stochastic dominances than other risk measures. And EBA is consistent with the amount of risk, which means fairness for <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. Findings : Through cases, simulations and empirical application, it shows that these two allocation rules satisfy some good properties, can be more efficient, more precise and fairer. And the EBA based on IE may be the better one. Research limitations/implications : However, there are some problems still open. One is how to treat the negative value of allocation.

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> and of how tax and other costs of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> should be {{allocated}} in a financial firm. <b>Risk</b> <b>capital</b> is equity investment that backs obligations to creditors and other liability holders and maintains the firm’s credit quality.

Our theory leads to an adjusted present value (APV) criterion for making investment and contracting decisions. We relate our results to capital budgeting procedures used in corporate finance.

40|$|The {{development}} of effective community, {{regional and national}} risk-management strategies, especially for systemic risks, such as natural disasters, entails understanding the determinants of social vulnerability in individuals and groups, and the factors that foster the adoption of specific mechanisms of risk management and, thus, the elements that supports an efficient implementation process. This thesis contributes to this understanding {{in the context of}} communities in developing countries by using data from surveys conducted in the district of Kalahandi, state of Orissa, India, and three municipalities in Mexico, each with a different level of socioeconomic development: Villaflores, Chiapas; Ahome, Sinaloa; and Valle de Santiago, Guanajuato. Using regression modeling of binary response variables, I tested the statistical association between the adoption of formal social risk-management and a number of endogenous and exogenous household characteristics. The results indicate that the likelihood of adoption of formal risk-management strategies increases with the level of the household's association, i. e., its affiliation with local groups; in addition, proximity to roads, financial services and urban-mixed use areas (markets), is less strongly correlated with the likelihood of adoption of risk-management strategies than the level of association, particularly in less-developed environments. These findings are robust to a variety of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and environmental contexts.
