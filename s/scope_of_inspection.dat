40|$|Most {{researchers}} {{focused on}} the importance and details of Conservation Management Plan when historic building is re-adapted for re-vitalized. In their study, emphasis on retaining the character defining elements of historic building is always the key issue of study. Future maintenance of the historic building is not seen as important. This can be proved {{by the fact that}} no requirements on submission of maintenance plan is needed for Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA) in Hong Kong. Since the neglect on maintenance of heritage buildings will result in extensive replacement or alteration of building fabrics which is undesirable, it is necessary to formulate a Heritage Maintenance Plan detailing the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> and period of cyclic maintenance in order to prolong their life span and functions. PMQ being one of the pioneer re-adaption projects with reinforced concrete structures is considered as a representative historic building in which both old and new building components exist. By identifying the building elements and formulating a inspection checklist and intervals of inspection, it is hoped that the management company can systemically identify the defects through the inspections and carry out repair works to rectify the problems in advance before the problem escalates. It is expected that such periodic inspection will extend the lives of historic buildings and prevent the building fabrics from deterioration. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|E

40|$|This {{plan has}} been {{prepared}} in response to direction from the U. S. Department of Energy. The purpose of {{the plan is to}} define approaches that will be implemented to ensure protection of the public and the environment when active Low-Level Burial Grounds (LLBGs) at the Hanford Site are closed. Performance assessments for active burial grounds in the 200 East and West 200 Areas provide current estimates of potential environmental contamination and doses to the ''maximum exposed individual'' from burial ground operation and closure and compare dose estimates to performance objective dose limits for the facilities. This is an Operational Closure Plan. The intent of the guidance in DOE Order 435. 1 is that this plan will be a living document, like the facility performance assessments, and will be revised periodically through the operational life of the LLBGs to reflect updated information on waste inventory. management practices, facility transition planning, schedule dates, assessments of post-closure performance, and environmental consequences. Out year dates identified in this plan are tentative. A Final Closure Plan will be prepared in the future when the timing and extent of closure-related activities for LLBGs can be established with greater certainty. After current operations at the LLBGs are concluded, this plan proposes transitioning of these facilities to the Environmental Restoration Program. This action will enable the Environmental Restoration Program to design and implement consistent and coordinated final remedial actions for active and inactive LLBGs. Active and inactive burial grounds in the 200 West and 200 East Areas are commingled.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a concise {{overview}} of the problem of building decay in Hong Kong, the current government measures concerning dilapidated buildings and the latest development and implementation of the mandatory building inspection scheme (MBIS). A comparison of various MBISs from other jurisdictions of the world is also given. Design/methodology/approach – A desktop study of building inspection procedures, repair and maintenance policies was carried out, followed by an industry-wide opinion survey conducted by means of self-administered questionnaires. Target respondents are within the construction community of Hong Kong. The perceived benefits, potential difficulties and insightful recommendations or good practices are investigated. A comparison of the relative ranking of individual mean scores from various groups of respondents is presented in this paper. Findings – The execution of MBIS was found to be effective in enhancing public awareness of the importance of building upkeep and recognition of the property owner's legal responsibilities in this respect. Private property owners were made aware of the necessity to take holistic preventive measures to maintain the overall safety of their own buildings. A comparison of MBIS with other similar MBISs across different cities, revealed similarities as regards the inspection cycle, <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> and qualifications of inspectors. The main difference related to the age rather than the height of target buildings. Practical implications – Proper inspection and maintenance is necessary to keep buildings in good condition to avoid injury or loss of life due to sudden collapse of structures or their elements such as concrete spalling and fall of window frames. The official launch of MBIS on 30 June 2012 is one of the proposed effective measures to resolve the long-standing problems of building neglect and deterioration in Hong Kong with particular regard to the existing old private premises. Originality/value – The execution of MBIS should be useful in improving the safety and health status of the dilapidated premises and in so doing safeguarding the residents and general public. To further identify the perceived benefits and potential difficulties of MBIS, and to suggest insightful recommendations or good practices for its successful future implementation, an opinion survey was launched among construction practitioners in Hong Kong between March and April of 2012.

40|$|Degradation {{of steam}} {{generator}} (SG) tubing due to both mechanical and corrosion modes {{has resulted in}} extensive repairs and replacement of SGs around the world. The variety of degradation modes challenges the integrity of SG tubing and, therefore, the stations’ reliability. Inspection and monitoring aimed at timely detection and characterization of the degradation {{is a key element}} for ensuring tube integrity. Up to the early- 70 ’s, the in-service <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> SG tubing was carried out using single-frequency eddy current testing (ET) bobbin coils, which were adequate for the detection of volumetric degradation. By the mid- 80 ’s, additional modes of degradation such as pitting, intergranular attack, and axial and circumferential inside or outside diameter stress corrosion cracking had to be addressed. The need for timely, fast detection and characterization of these diverse modes of degradation motivated the development in the 90 ’s <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> systems based on advanced probe technology coupled with versatile instruments operated by fast computers and remote communication systems. SG inspection systems have progressed in the new millennium to a much higher level of automation, efficiency and reliability. Also, the role of Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) has evolved from simple detection tools to diagnostic tools that provide input into integrity assessment decisions, fitness-for-service and operational assessments. This new role was motivated by tighter regulatory requirements to assure the safety of the public and the environment, better SG life management strategies and often self-imposed regulations. It {{led to the development of}} advanced probe technologies, more reliable and versatile instruments and robotics, better training and qualification of personnel and better data management and analysis systems.

Evans, Barston and Pollard carried out a psychological syllogistic reasoning task to prove this effect. Participants were asked whether they would accept or reject a given syllogism. We discuss one specific case which is commonly assumed to be believable but which is actually not logically valid. By introducing abnormalities, abduction and background knowledge, we adequately model this case under the weak completion semantics. Our formalization reveals new questions about possible extensions in abductive reasoning. For instance, observations and their explanations might include some relevant prior abductive contextual information concerning some side-effect or leading to a contestable or refutable side-effect. A weaker notion indicates the support of some relevant consequences by a prior abductive context. Yet another definition describes jointly supported relevant consequences, which captures the idea of two observations containing mutually supportive side-effects.

The damage state was controlled by interrupting the loading stage at predetermined values of the deflection. After mechanical tests, the panels were non-destructively inspected by a highly sensitive superconductive magnetometer (HTS SQUID), from which the maps of the parallel component of the magnetic field above the sample surface were obtained. A destructive analysis of the specimens was also carried out by optical microscopy, to assess damage features. The existence of a defect in the material was clearly signalled by a distortion in the magnetic field, even when an elastic behaviour could be guessed from the load-displacement curve. Until the loading conditions only resulted in failures in the matrix, {{the slope of the}} SQUID response along a line-scan was linearly dependent on the maximum energy applied to the specimen during the mechanical tests.

Software inspection has been extensively used for over thirty years to ensure the quality {{of software}}, by finding and repairing defects in software products. However, the yet narrow <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> research has been centred on <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> Object-Oriented artifacts. Moreover, few methods have been developed for evaluating inspections and deciding whether they are cost-effective, as compared to other quality assurance techniques, such as testing. A typical <b>inspection</b> process consists <b>of</b> two stages critical for defect detection: individual inspection (preparation) followed by inspection meeting. Recently, the controversy <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> meeting effectiveness has been raised in the literature, because the cost of organizing and conducting them is high, while there is no net meeting gain.
