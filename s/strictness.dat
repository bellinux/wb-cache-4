5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of <b>strictness</b> among countries.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} have historically blocked residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington {{from participating in}} paid games, under a presumption that DFS is illegal in these states due to the <b>strictness</b> of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions could easily be circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players in the five states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his <b>strictness</b> and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E
5|$|The leading case, Anti-Vivisection Society, {{sets out}} a strict rule that {{charities}} cannot campaign politically. An illustration of its <b>strictness</b> is Bowman v Secular Society, {{where it was}} held that even when attempted changes to the law were ancillary to the main goals, it was still unacceptable. There is a dividing line; charitable trusts discussing political issues can be valid, as discussed by Hoffmann J obiter dicta in Attorney General v Ross. This line is considered by the Charity Commission in their official guidelines, which allow the Commission {{to look at the}} wider purpose of the organisation when deciding if it constitutes a valid charity.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general <b>strictness</b> of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E

25|$|The growing <b>strictness</b> in the {{observance}} of mourning customs {{in connection with}} the Ninth Day of Av became pronounced in post-Talmudic times, and particularly in one of the darkest periods of Jewish history, from the 15th century to the 18th.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December 1485, Standonck {{was elected}} Rector of the University. The {{students}} rose up in violent protest, such was {{his reputation for}} severity and <b>strictness.</b> (On 10 April 1490 he made a formal complaint to the authorities that students were not attending his lectures).|$|E
25|$|But Hester {{had been}} {{alienated from the}} Puritan society, both in her {{physical}} life and spiritual life. When Dimmesdale dies, she knows she has to move on because she can no longer conform to the Puritans' <b>strictness.</b> Her thinking is free from religious bounds and she has established her own different moral standards and beliefs.|$|E
25|$|To the regiments we {{had landed}} the extreme {{variety of the}} F.F.I. organizations, their at least {{peculiar}} discipline, the differing quality of their groups, the poverty of their equipment, the crying inadequacy of their armament and supplies, the heterogeneity of their officering, the facility with which their superior ranks had been assigned, and in certain cases the ostensibly political nature of their aims, ran counter to the classical military outlook of many officers, some of whom, in reaction, exaggerated their regulation <b>strictness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>strictness</b> in character size and shape, Chinese characters are written with very precise rules. The most important rules regard the strokes employed, stroke placement, and stroke order. Just as each region that uses Chinese characters has standardized character forms, each also has standardized stroke orders, with each standard being different. Most characters {{can be written}} with just one correct stroke order, though some words also have many valid stroke orders, which may occasionally result in different stroke counts. Some characters are also written with different stroke orders due to character simplification.|$|E
25|$|Georgia {{became a}} theme in Russian {{literature}} as well. In 1829, Russia's greatest poet Alexander Pushkin visited {{the country and}} his experience is reflected in several of his lyrics. His younger contemporary, Mikhail Lermontov, was exiled to the Caucasus in 1840. The region appears as a land of exotic adventure in Lermontov's famous novel A Hero of Our Time and he also celebrated Georgia's wild, mountainous landscape in the long poem Mtsyri, about a novice monk who escapes from the <b>strictness</b> of religious discipline to find freedom in nature.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} {{on this position}} is to secure the wrists to either the spreader bar or to a securing point between their ankles forming a hogtie, resulting in {{what is called a}} suspension bow. In this position, if the subject is a female and facing down, her breasts would be pointing almost straight down depending on the <b>strictness</b> of the position, and nipple clamps and weights can be added for painful stimulation. The clamps may alternatively be secured to a point on the floor, limiting the subject's ability to struggle or move at all without causing pain.|$|E
25|$|Further entries of {{the subject}} follow this initial exposition, either {{immediately}} (as for example in Fugue No. 1 in C major, BWV 846 of the Well-Tempered Clavier), or separated by episodes. Episodic material is always modulatory and is usually based upon some element heard in the exposition. Each episode has the primary function of transitioning for the next entry {{of the subject}} in a new key, and may also provide release from the <b>strictness</b> of form employed in the exposition, and middle-entries. André Gedalge states that the episode of the fugue is generally based {{on a series of}} imitations of the subject that have been fragmented.|$|E
25|$|His fellow captives {{included}} many political prisoners, who {{were forced to}} perform hard labour for many years. Reunited with his brother Ganesh, the Savarkars nevertheless struggled in the harsh environment: Forced to arise at 5am, tasks including cutting trees and chopping wood, and working at the oil mill under regimental <b>strictness,</b> with talking amidst prisoners strictly prohibited during mealtime. Prisoners were subject to frequent mistreatment and torture. Contact {{with the outside world}} and home was restricted to the writing and mailing of one letter a year. In these years, Savarkar withdrew within himself and performed his routine tasks mechanically. Obtaining permission to start a rudimentary jail library, Savarkar would also teach some fellow convicts to read and write.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{opinions}} differ, {{no consensus}} is forthcoming, {{and all are}} free to choose. With agreement among the Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an unalterable validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are always changing and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next. Even when and where they were once used with full <b>strictness,</b> their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who {{had the authority to}} decide when individual discipline had been satisfied. This too {{is a part of the}} Holy Tradition.|$|E
25|$|Gymnastics {{developed}} in ancient Greece, in Sparta and Athens, {{and was used}} as method to prepare men for warfare. In Sparta, among the activities introduced into the training program was the Agoge or exhibition gymnastics made up of gymnastic elements {{in the form of}} the Pyrrhic-a dance in a military style-performed for state dignitaries in the final year of a student's training. The maneuvers were performed naked except for the tools of war. Athens combined this more physical training with education of the mind. At the Palestra, a physical education training center, the discipline of educating the body and educating the mind were combined allowing for a form of gymnastics that was more aesthetic and individual and which left behind the form that focused on <b>strictness,</b> discipline, the emphasis on defeating records, and focus on strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumcision}} {{consists of}} three procedures, the first being the cutting of the foreskin. The second is the priah, or peeling back of the epithelium after the foreskin has been amputated. According to Shaye J. D. Cohen, in Why Aren't Jewish Women Circumcised?: Gender and Covenant in Judaism, pg 25, the Torah only commands circumcision (milah). David Gollaher has written that the rabbis added the procedure of periah to discourage men from trying to restore their foreskins: ‘Once established, periah was deemed essential to circumcision; if the mohel failed to cut away enough tissue, the operation was deemed insufficient to comply with God's covenant’ and ‘Depending on the <b>strictness</b> of individual rabbis, boys (or men {{thought to have been}} inadequately cut) were subjected to additional operations.’ In addition to milah (the actual circumcision) and priah, mentioned above, the Talmud mentions a third step, metzitzah, or squeezing some blood from the wound.|$|E
25|$|Umar, the {{predecessor}} of Uthman, was very strict {{in the use}} of money from the public treasury. Apart from the meagre allowance that had been sanctioned in his favour, Umar took no money from the treasury. He did not receive any gifts, nor did he allow any of his family members to accept any gifts from any quarter. During the time of Uthman, there was some relaxation in such <b>strictness.</b> Uthman did not draw any allowance from the treasury for his personal use, nor did he receive a salary, he was a wealthy man with sufficient resources of his own, but unlike Umar, Uthman accepted gifts and allowed his family members to accept gifts from certain quarters. Uthman honestly expressed that he had the right to utilize the public funds according to his best judgment, and no one criticized him for that. The economic reforms introduced by Uthman had far reaching effects; Muslims as well as non-Muslims of the Rashidun Empire enjoyed an economically prosperous life during his reign.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina {{there are}} {{public and private}} medical schools, however the {{prestige}} of the public institutions is undeniable and the private institutions do not normally appear in international rankings. A person who can afford to attend a private university, quite expensive for the average Argentinian, will choose that option over public education because of the smaller groups of students in each class and {{because of the lack of}} <b>strictness</b> in course evaluation. By law entrance into public institutions is open and tuition-free to all who have a high school diploma, and universities are expressly forbidden from restricting access with difficult entrance exams. Point in case, in 2016 La Universidad Nacional de la Plata was obligated by the governing bodies to stop forcing its students to write an entrance exam. As a result, that university experienced a major increase in the size of its student population. When it comes to educational quality, la Universidad de Buenos Aires, a public university, is widely recognised as the top medical school in the country.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the reign of}} two emperors bent on supporting the Church and stamping out paganism, {{it is understandable that}} pagans simply did not embrace Julian's idea of proclaiming their devotion to polytheism and their rejection of Christianity. Many chose to adopt a practical approach and not support Julian's public reforms actively for fear of a Christian revival. However, this apathetic attitude forced the emperor to shift central aspects of pagan worship. Julian’s attempts to reinvigorate the people shifted the focus of paganism from a system of tradition to a religion with some of the same characteristics that he opposed in Christianity. For example, Julian attempted to introduce a tighter organization for the priesthood, with greater qualifications of character and service. Classical paganism simply did not accept this idea of priests as model citizens. Priests were elites with social prestige and financial power who organized festivals and helped pay for them. Yet Julian’s attempt to impose moral <b>strictness</b> on the civic position of priesthood only made paganism more in tune with Christian morality, drawing it further from paganism’s system of tradition.|$|E
25|$|Greek temples were {{designed}} and constructed according to set proportions, mostly {{determined by the}} lower diameter of the columns or by {{the dimensions of the}} foundation levels. The nearly mathematical <b>strictness</b> of the basic designs thus reached was lightened by optical refinements. In spite of the still widespread idealised image, Greek temples were painted, so that bright reds and blues contrasted with the white of the building stones or of stucco. The more elaborate temples were equipped with very rich figural decoration in the form of reliefs and pedimental sculpture. The construction of temples was usually organised and financed by cities or by the administrations of sanctuaries. Private individuals, especially Hellenistic rulers, could also sponsor such buildings. In the late Hellenistic period, their decreasing financial wealth, along with the progressive incorporation of the Greek world within the Roman State, whose officials and rulers took over as sponsors, led to the end of Greek temple construction. New temples now belonged to the tradition of Roman architecture, which, in spite of the Greek influence on it, aimed for different goals and followed different aesthetic principles.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the ages, farmers, {{archaeologists and}} amateur {{treasure}} hunters have unearthed important treasures of immense historical, scientific and financial value. However, the <b>strictness</b> {{of the common}} law rules meant that such items were sometimes not treasure trove. The items risked being sold abroad, or were only saved for the nation by being purchased at a high price. Mention has already {{been made of the}} objects comprising the Sutton Hoo ship burial, which were not treasure trove as they had been interred without any intention to retrieve them. The objects were later presented to the nation by their owner, Edith May Pretty, in a 1942 bequest. In March 1973, a hoard of about 7,811 Roman coins was found buried in a field at Coleby in Lincolnshire. It was made up of antoniniani believed to have been minted between 253 and 281A.D. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held in the 1981 case of Attorney-General of the Duchy of Lancaster v. G.E. Overton (Farms) Ltd. that the hoard was not treasure trove as the coins did not have a substantial silver content. Thus, it belonged to the owner of the field and could not be retained by the British Museum.|$|E
500|$|A law {{went into}} effect in 1790 {{requiring}} prints to bear a censor's seal of approval to be sold. [...] Censorship increased in <b>strictness</b> over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments. [...] From 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval. [...] A group of Utagawa-school offenders including Toyokuni had their works repressed in 1801, and Utamaro was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi.|$|E
500|$|During his {{coaching}} career, Rymkus was renowned for his <b>strictness.</b> While with the Oilers, he repeatedly threatened to whip his players. He {{could also be}} melodramatic. He once repeated a speech Leahy gave at Notre Dame before a practice in a blizzard. He told his players during a hot August in Houston to be [...] "like the Great Northern Buffalo, whose coat is shaggy and whose muscles are strong. The Great Northern Buffalo sticks {{his head into the}} wind and braves the cold, not like the puny Southern Buffalo, who turns his back to the storm." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Orientalist Karl Vilhelm Zetterstéen, al-Mu'tadid [...] "had {{inherited}} his father's gifts as a ruler and was distinguished alike for his {{economy and}} his military ability", becoming [...] "one {{of the greatest}} of the Abbasids {{in spite of his}} <b>strictness</b> and cruelty". Al-Mu'tadid's capable reign is credited with having arrested the Abbasid Caliphate's decline for a while, but his successes were too dependent on the presence of an energetic ruler at the helm, and ultimately his reign [...] "was too short to reverse long-term trends and re-establish Abbasid power on a long-term basis" [...] (Hugh Kennedy).|$|E
500|$|Haynes' one-year term as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} political conflict between a faction led by Haynes, Hooker, and Dudley, and another led by Winthrop. [...] The major disagreement between them concerned the <b>strictness</b> of judicial procedures {{and the process of}} rendering judgments; the Haynes faction believed that Winthrop had been lax in some of his decisions. [...] The conservative faction was successful in enacting regulations for stricter judicial procedures; it also passed legislation banning the smoking of tobacco and restricting overly ostentatious or fashionable clothing. [...] Haynes also presided over the trial and banishment of Roger Williams, an act that Williams reports Haynes later expressed some regret over.|$|E
500|$|In 1607, Fuller began {{challenging}} the Court of High Commission yet again, an ecclesiastical court {{established by the}} monarch with near unlimited power. The High Commission was vastly unpopular amongst both common lawyers and Members of Parliament, as the idea of [...] "prerogative law" [...] challenged both authorities. The appointment of Richard Bancroft as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1604 caused the issue to grow in importance; Bancroft's zeal and <b>strictness</b> [...] "could hardly fail to produce an atmosphere in which principles and issues would crystallize, in which logic would supplant reasonableness". The judges, particularly Sir Edward Coke, began to unite with Parliament in {{challenging the}} High Commission. The High Commission tried people for heresy, based on their internal thoughts and private beliefs, in [...] "a trap to catch unwary or ingenuous men - 'an unlawful process of poking about in the speculation of finding something chargeable'".|$|E
500|$|Coke's changed {{position}} from Attorney General to Chief Justice {{allowed him to}} openly attack organisations he had previously supported. His first target was the Court of High Commission, an ecclesiastical court established by the monarch with near unlimited power; it administered a mandatory ex officio oath that deliberately trapped people. The High Commission was vastly unpopular among both common lawyers and Members of Parliament, as the idea of [...] "prerogative law" [...] challenged both authorities. The appointment of Richard Bancroft as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1604 caused the issue to grow in importance; according to P.B. Waite, a Canadian historian, Bancroft's zeal and <b>strictness</b> [...] "could hardly fail to produce an atmosphere in which principles and issues would crystallize, in which logic would supplant reasonableness". The judges, particularly Coke, began to unite with Parliament in challenging the High Commission. [...] In 1607 Parliament openly asked for Coke's opinion on the High Commission's practices; he replied that [...] "No man ecclesiastical or temporal shall be examined upon secret thoughts of his heart or of his secret opinion".|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} public lecture, which was {{published}} posthumously, Havelock addressed {{the political implications of}} his own scholarly work. Delivered at Harvard on 16 March 1988, less than three weeks before his death, the lecture is framed principally in opposition to the University of Chicago philosopher Leo Strauss. Strauss had published a detailed and extensive critique of Havelock's The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics [...] in March 1959, as [...] "The Liberalism of Classical Political Philosophy" [...] in the journal Review of Metaphysics. [...] (Strauss died 14 years later in 1973, the same year in which Havelock retired.) Havelock's 1988 lecture claims to contain a systematic account of Plato's politics; Havelock argues that Plato's idealism applies a mathematical <b>strictness</b> to politics, countering his old teacher Cornford's assertion that Platonic arguments that morality must be analyzable in arithmetical terms cannot be serious. This way of thinking about politics, Havelock concluded, could not be used as a model for understanding or shaping inherently nonmathematical interactions: [...] "The stuff of human politics is conflict and compromise." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the peace}} of Vienna signed between the French Empire and the Austrian Empire in October, Nansouty was ordered to leave the command of his {{division}} to General Bruyères and retake his position of First Squire alongside the Emperor (17 October 1809). However, {{with the return of}} the Grand Squire Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, the role of the First Squire was much diminished. As a result, in 1811 Nansouty was given an additional function, that of General Inspector of cavalry. Very active in exercising this function, he soon became reputed for his <b>strictness</b> and for his detailed knowledge and invaluable experience that he had of this arm. Nonetheless, war was, once more, not far away and, on 19 October 1811, Nansouty was called to the command of the 2nd and 4th cuirassier divisions of the [...] "Observation Corps of the Elba", under the command of Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout. Then, with the reorganisation of the Grande Armée in April 1812, Nansouty was named at the command of the I Cavalry Corps [...]|$|E
500|$|Supporters of the Constitution, {{known as}} Federalists, opposed {{a bill of}} rights for much of the {{ratification}} period, in part due to the procedural uncertainties it would create. Madison argued against such an inclusion, suggesting that state governments were sufficient guarantors of personal liberty, in No. 46 of The Federalist Papers, a series of essays promoting the Federalist position. Hamilton opposed {{a bill of rights}} in The Federalist No. 84, stating that [...] "the constitution is itself in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights. He stated that ratification did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights, making protections unnecessary: [...] "Here, in <b>strictness,</b> the people surrender nothing, and as they retain everything, they have no need of particular reservations." [...] Patrick Henry criticized the federalist point of view, writing that the legislature must be firmly informed [...] "of the extent of the rights retained by the people ... being in a state of uncertainty, they will assume rather than give up powers by implication." [...] Other anti-federalists pointed out that earlier political documents, in particular the Magna Carta had protected specific rights. In response, Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different: ...|$|E
500|$|Irons {{proposed}} that costly signalling theory could explain costly religious behaviour. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These [...] "ostentatious" [...] displays signalled commitment to Islam to strangers and group members. Sosis demonstrated {{that people in}} religious communities are {{four times more likely}} to live longer than their secular counterparts, and that these longer lifespans were positively correlated with the number of costly requirements demanded from religious community members. However, confounding variables may not have been excluded. Wood found that religion offers a subjective feeling of well-being within a community, where costly signalling protects against free riders and helps to build self-control among committed members. Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious communities. In a self-reported survey, as the <b>strictness</b> of a church increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased proportionally. In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church that has more stringent demands on its members. Despite this observation, costly donations and acts conducted in a religious context does not itself establish that membership in these clubs is actually worth the entry costs imposed.|$|E
