40|$|Global warming, and {{the climate}} change it induces, is an urgent global issue. One remedy to this problem, and {{the focus of this}} paper, is to motivate <b>sustainable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> {{behaviors}} by people. The development of feedback technologies providing real-time, continuous feedback of one’s energy usage has been used to motivate <b>sustainable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> behaviors. However, there is one important problem- they tend to use a “one-size-fitsall” solution, providing the same feedback to differently motivated individuals at different stages of readiness, willingness and ableness to change. In this paper, we synthesize a wide range of motivational psychology literature to develop a motivational framework based on the Transtheoretical (aka Stages of Behavior Change) model. We state the motivational goal(s) of each stage, followed by our recommendation(s) for designing feedback technologies in order achieve these goals. Each recommendation is supported by a rationale based on motivational literature, followed by a simple textual example to illustrate one way to apply the recommendation.

40|$|<b>Sustainable</b> <b>energy</b> {{production}} and <b>consumption</b> {{is one of}} the issues for the sustainable development strategy in China. As China’s economic development paradigm shifts, household <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> (HEC) has become a focus of achieving national goals of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction. The information entropy model and LMDI model were employed in this study in order to analyse the structural evolution of HEC, as well as its associated critical factors. The results indicate that the information entropy of HEC increased gradually, and coal will be reduced by clean energies, such as natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. The information entropy tends to stabilize and converge due to rapid urbanization. Therefore, from the perspective of environmental protection and natural resource conservation, the structure of household <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> will be optimized. This study revealed that residents’ income level {{is one of the}} most critical factors for the increase of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> while the <b>energy</b> intensity is the only driving force for the reduction of HEC.
