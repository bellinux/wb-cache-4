40|$|Young {{stars are}} {{expected}} to gain most of their mass by accretion from a disk that forms around them {{as a result of}} angular momentum conservation in the collapsing protostellar cloud. Accretion initially proceeds at high rates of 10 − 6 − 10 − 5 M ⊙ yr − 1 resulting in strong irradiation of the stellar surface by the hot inner portion of the disk and leading to the suppression of the intrinsic stellar luminosity. Here we investigate how this luminosity suppression affects evolution of the protostellar properties. Using simple model based on the energy balance of accreting star we demonstrate that disk irradiation causes only a slight increase of the protostellar radius, at the level of several per cent. Such a weak effect is explained by a minor role played by the intrinsic stellar luminosity (at the time when it is significantly altered by irradiation) in the protostellar energy budget compared to the <b>stellar</b> deuterium <b>burning</b> luminosity and the inflow of the gravitational potential energy brought in by the freshly accreted material. Our results justify the neglect of irradiation effects in previous studies of the protostellar growth via disk accretion.

40|$|The " 2 " 2 Ne(#alpha#,n) {{reaction}} {{is the dominant}} neutron source for neutron capture nucleosynthesis (s-process) in massive stars and plays also a significant role for the s-process in thermally pulsing AGB stars. In these scenarios " 2 " 2 Ne is produced by the reaction sequence " 1 " 4 N(#alpha#,#gamma#) " 1 " 8 F(#beta#"+) " 1 " 8 O(#alpha#,#gamma#) " 2 " 2 Ne. While the first {{reaction is}} well understood, #alpha#-capture on " 1 " 8 O was affected by considerable uncertainties. At the temperatures of <b>stellar</b> He <b>burning</b> the reaction rate is determined by two resonances at #alpha#-energies of 470 and 566 keV. Since these resonances were not yet successfully measured, the rates had {{to be based on}} estimated resonance strengths. In the present work the first direct measurement of the strengths of these extremely weak low energy resonances is reported. The use of a high-efficiency segmented Ge detector in coincidence with BGO counters covering a large solid angle led to a significantly improved experimental sensitivity, thus allowing for the clear identification of specific #gamma#-transitions. As a result, resonance strengths of 1. 0 #+-# 0. 2 #mu#eV and 0. 4 #+-# 0. 2 #mu#eV could be obtained for the 566 and 470 keV resonances, respectively. When compared to the previously reported upper limits of #<=# 1. 7 #mu#eV, this result provides the basis for the reliable determination of the reaction rate during stellar He-burning. Accordingly, these data allow to reduce the uncertainties in the s-process neutron balance. (orig.)

40|$|The rate {{of oxygen}} {{formation}} determines the C/O ratio during <b>stellar</b> helium <b>burning.</b> It {{is the single}} most important nuclear input of stellar evolution theory including the evolution of Type II and Type Ia supernova. Yet the low energy cross section of the fusion of 4 He + 12 C denoted as the 12 C(a,g) 16 O reaction still remains uncertain after forty years of extensive work. We analyze and critically review the most recent measurements of complete angular distributions of the outgoing gamma-rays at very low energies (Ecm > 1. 0 MeV). Our analysis of the angular distribution measured with the EUROGAM/GANDI arrays lead us to conclude considerably larger error bars than published hence they are excluded from the current sample of "world data". We show that the current sample of "world data" of the measured E 2 cross section factors below 1. 7 MeV cluster to two distinct groups that lead to two distinct extrapolations of SE 2 (300) ~ 60 or ~ 154 keVb. We point to a much neglected discrepancy between the measured E 1 -E 2 phase difference (phi_ 12) and unitarity as required by the Watson theorem, suggesting systematic problem(s) of some of the measured gamma-ray angular distributions. The ambiguity of the extrapolated SE 2 (300) together with a previously observed ambiguity of SE 1 (300) represent the current state of the art of the field and they must be resolved by future measurements of complete and detailed angular distributions of the 12 C(a,g) reaction at very low energies (Ecm < 1. 0 MeV).
