A <b>stream</b> <b>splitter</b> was used to divert a 5 % side stream of column effluent, which was subsequently mixed with the reagents necessary for bioluminescence assay of the separated isoenzymes. The use of the <b>stream</b> <b>splitter</b> greatly de-creased the rate of consumption of reagent and, when combined with a peristaltic pumping system, permitted independent control of the side-stream flow rate. Thus both the residence interval in a delay coil in which the AlP reaction product is formed and the bioluminescence re-sponse could be increased. Bioluminescence emission was monitored in a flow-through fluorometer without use of an external light source or filters. Separation and de...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedOne {{of the most}} significant challenges with modern intrusion detection systems is the high rate of false alarms that they generate. In order to lower this rate, we propose {{to reduce the amount of}} traffic sent a given intrusion detection system via a filtering process termed stream splitting. Each packet arriving at the system is treated as belonging to a connection. Each connection is then assigned to a network stream. A network stream can then be sent to an analysis engine tailored specifically for that type of data. To demonstrate a stream-splitting capability, both an extendable multi-threaded architecture and prototype were developed. This system was tested to ensure the ability to capture traffic and found to be able to do so with minimal loss at network speeds up to 20 Mb/s, comparable to several open-source analysis programs. The <b>stream</b> <b>splitter</b> was also shown to be able to correctly implement a traffic separation scheme. Ensign, United States Nav...|$|E

At alkaline pH calcium can be adsorbed onto the metallic components of the sampling system, and under more acidic conditions calcium can be released. Thus an alkaline sample will have an apparently reduced calcium content, while a more acidic sample may have an apparently increased concentration of calcium. By using non-metallic components in the sampling system this source of error an be eliminated...|$|R
40|$|Today most larger {{companies}} maintain virtual private networks (VPNs) {{to connect}} their remote locations {{into a single}} secure network. VPNs can be quite large covering more than 1000 locations {{and in most cases}} use standard Internet protocols and services. Such VPNs are implemented using a diverse set of technologies such as Frame Relay, MPLS or IPSEC to achieve the goal of privacy and performance isolation from the public Internet. One of the services which recently received increased interest in the VPN space is the use of VPNs to distribute proprietary live streaming content. For example, a VPN could be used to broadcast a CEO employee town hall meeting. To distribute this type of content economically without overloading the network, the deployment of <b>streaming</b> caches or <b>splitters</b> is most likely required. In this paper we address the problem of optimally placing such <b>streaming</b> <b>splitters</b> or caches to broadcast to a given set of VPN endpoints under the constrains typically found within a VPN. In particular, we introduce an algorithm which guarantees the optimal cache placement if interception is used for redirection. We prove that the general problem is NP hard and then we introduce multiple heuristics for optimal cache placement in the general case which we then evaluate using extensive simulations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{two-dimensional}} separations in {{gas chromatography}} (GC) require switching systems {{to transfer the}} flow stream of carrier gas from the first to second dimension. This {{can be accomplished by}} valve systems, but is more suitably effected by pneumatic flow switching, such as the Deans&# 039; switch method. Recent developments in microfluidics and related micro-technologies should make gas phase switching much more effective. The capillary flow technology platform of Agilent Technologies exemplifies recent developments introduced to GC. Thus various Deans&# 039; switch pressure balanced devices, <b>stream</b> <b>splitters,</b> and column couplings bring new capabilities to analytical GC. We are uniquely placed {{to take advantage of the}} new devices, owing to our development of advanced operational methods in GC which can make use of microfluidic capillary couplings, and novel cryogenic approaches that deliver performance previously impossible with conventional methods. Multidimensional chromatographic flow switching to isolate pure compounds from complex mixtures suggests many potential applications for enhanced chemical analysis. Multiple dimensions of analysis, integrating capabilities for gas chromatography separations with different spectroscopic detection methods for chemical identification of isolated chemical species (including mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared) can be proposed.

40|$|International audienceSdFFF is now {{commonly}} used for cell sorting. Nevertheless, {{as with many}} other separation methods, SdFFF Hyperlayer elution leads (1) to sample dilution resulting in cell loss which could restrict further use; and (2) to a high output flow rate impacting detector sensitivity and selectivity. In order to limit these problems, we proposed modifications of the SdFFF separation channel consisting both in downscaling and the insertion of an outlet <b>stream</b> <b>splitter.</b> This last system corresponded to a strip which divides the flow rate output into two parts, one containing concentrated cells in a reduced volume and flow rate, the other containing the excess mobile phase useless for further cell manipulation, detection and characterization. For {{the first time we}} have shown that splitter implementation and downscaling respected channel flowing and resulted in Hyperlayer elution of around 95 % of cells in less than 50 % of input flow rate. Improved cell sorting was demonstrated by enrichment (∼ 10 times) of cancer stem cells from WiDr cells with two times less quantity of injected cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 When a {{separation}} {{system is to}} produce multicomponent products, it is frequently not necessary to separate a feed mixture completely into pure components. Instead, column bypasses can reduce both capital and operating costs by reducing mass load on the columns. This paper presents an algorithmic procedure for the synthesis of a sequence of simple, sharp split distillation columns with both bypasses and mixers that minimizes annualized costs. This procedure can solve problems in which a single feed is to be separated into two or more multicomponent products. We use models that are linear except for <b>stream</b> <b>splitters.</b> Unfortunately, superstructures developed from these models and simply optimized can display multiple local optima; a better approach is needed. We present {{an analysis of the}} problem structure that suggests a decomposition which allows significant reductions both in the problem search space and nonlinearities caused by splitters. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 The decomposition permits one to solve any three component problem for its global optimum as two linear programs. Four and five componenet problems require six and twenty-four nonlinear programs, respectively, each of which models a structurally different flowsheet for the process. For each flowsheet, one can establish a lower bound for the corresponding nonlinear program by using a relaxation that allows the splitters to be treated linearly; giving a linear program which is readily solved. For two example problems, we first produced lower bounds for each structural alternative (a linear program for each). Solving the nonlinear program for the most promising structure eliminated the need for solving the nonlinear program for all remaining alternatives. Upper and lower bounds within 1...|$|R
40|$|Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) {{simulations}} {{were performed}} {{for a commercial}} supersonic transport aircraft concept and experimental hardware models designed to represent the installed propulsion system of the conceptual aircraft in an upcoming test campaign. The purpose of the experiment {{is to determine the}} effects of jet-surface interactions from supersonic aircraft on airport community noise. RANS simulations of the commercial supersonic transport aircraft concept were performed to relate the representative experimental hardware to the actual aircraft. RANS screening simulations were performed on the proposed test hardware to verify that it would be free from potential rig noise and to predict the aerodynamic forces on the model hardware to assist with structural design. The simulations showed a large region of separated flow formed in a junction region of one of the experimental configurations. This was dissimilar with simulations of the aircraft and could invalidate the noise measurements. This configuration was modified and a subsequent RANS simulation showed that the size of the flow separation was greatly reduced. The aerodynamic forces found on the experimental models were found to be relatively small when compared to the expected loads from the models own weight. Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations were completed for two configurations of a three-stream inverted velocity profile (IVP) nozzle and a baseline single-stream round nozzle (mixed-flow equivalent conditions). For the Sideline and Cutback flow conditions, while the IVP nozzles did not reduce the peak turbulent kinetic energy on the lower side of the jet plume, the IVP nozzles did significantly reduce the size of the region of peak turbulent kinetic energy when compared to the jet plume of the baseline nozzle cases. The IVP nozzle at Sideline conditions did suffer a region of separated flow from the inner <b>stream</b> nozzle <b>splitter</b> that did produce an intense, but small, region of turbulent kinetic energy in the vicinity of the nozzle exit. When viewed with the understanding that jet noise is directly related to turbulent kinetic energy, these IVP nozzle simulations show the potential to reduce noise to observers located below the nozzle. However, these RANS simulations also show that some modifications may be needed to prevent the small region of separated flow-induced turbulent kinetic energy from the inner <b>stream</b> nozzle <b>splitter</b> at Sideline conditions...|$|R
40|$|Virtual private {{networks}} (VPN) {{are often}} used to distribute live content, such as video or audio streams, from a single source to {{a large number of}} destinations. <b>Streaming</b> caches or <b>splitters</b> are deployed in these multicast networks to allow content distribution without overloading the network. In this paper, we consider two combinatorial optimization problems that arise in multicast networks. In the Tree Cache Placement Problem (TCPP), the objective is to find a routing tree on which the number of cache nodes needed for multicasting is minimized. We also discuss a modification of this problem, called the Flow Cache Placement Problem (FCPP), where we seek any feasible flow from the source to the destinations which minimizes the number of cache nodes. We prove that these problems are NP-hard using a transformation from Satisfiability. This transformation allows us to give a proof of non-approximability by showing that it is gap-preserving. We also consider approximation algorithms for the TCPP and FCPP and special cases where these problems can be solved in polynomial time...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation of the spatially developing mixing layer issuing from two turbulent <b>streams</b> past a <b>splitter</b> plate {{is carried out}} under mild compressibility conditions. The study mainly focuses on the early evolution of the mixing region, where transition occurs from a wake-like to a canonical mixing-layer-like behaviour, corresponding to the filling-up of the initial momentum deficit. The mixing layer is found to initially grow faster than linearly, and then at a sub-linear rate further downstream. The Reynolds stress components are {{in close agreement with}} reference experiments and follow a continued slow decay till the end of the computational domain. These observations are suggestive of the occurrence of incomplete similarity in the developing turbulent mixing layer. Coherent eddies are found to form in the close proximity of the splitter plate trailing edge, that are mainly organized in bands, initially skewed and then parallel to the spanwise direction. Dynamic mode decomposition is used to educe the dynamically relevant features, and it is found to be capable of singling out the coherent eddies responsible for mixing layer development.
