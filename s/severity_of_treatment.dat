40|$|The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} water deficit on four Virginia (flue-cured) tobacco genotypes, Line 842, Oxford 207, RG 11 and Virgin D, was analyzed in whole plants. Drought stress was induced by withholding irrigation and subjecting plants to low, moderate and severe regimes. Some growth indices such as fresh weight, plant growth rate, number, color and area of new developed leaves, {{as well as}} proline, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content {{as a measure of}} oxidative stress were investigated to examine the role of genotype in water-deficit tolerance. Under stress, the weight of the aboveground parts of plants, plant growth height, number of new developed leaves and leaf area index decreased with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> The stressed plants accumulated more proline, malonildialdehide and hydrogen peroxide than control non-stressed plants under water-deficit conditions. The results showed that among the genotypes, Virgin D (VD) was the most sensitive to drought, while L 842 and Oxford 207 were moderately tolerant; RG 11 was drought-tolerant. This suggests that the correlation between the physiological traits and level of antioxidative response exists and therefore it {{could be used as a}} rapid screening test to evaluate the drought tolerance of tobacco...|$|E

40|$|Many {{assessment}} instruments used in {{the evaluation}} of toxicity, safety, pain, or disease progression consider multiple ordinal endpoints to fully capture the presence and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> effects. Contingency tables underlying these correlated responses are often sparse and imbalanced, rendering asymptotic results unreliable or model fitting prohibitively complex without overly simplistic assumptions on the marginal and joint distribution. Instead of a modeling approach, we look at stochastic order and marginal inhomogeneity as an expression or manifestation of a treatment effect under much weaker assumptions. Often, endpoints are grouped together into physiological domains or by the body function they describe. We derive tests based on these subgroups, which might supplement or replace the individual endpoint analysis because they are more powerful. The permutation or bootstrap distribution is used throughout to obtain global, subgroup, and individual significance levels as they naturally incorporate the correlation among endpoints. We provide a theorem that establishes a connection between marginal homogeneity and the stronger exchangeability assumption under the permutation approach. Multiplicity adjustments for the individual endpoints are obtained via stepdown procedures, while subgroup significance levels are adjusted via the full closed testing procedure. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a collection of 25 correlated ordinal endpoints, grouped into six domains, to evaluate toxicity of a chemical compound...|$|E

The way that these by-products are treated affects the composition and functional properties of fibre-rich powders. Factors such as treatment intensity, solvent, and drying system were studied. Only the more soluble components (soluble sugars, uronic acids and proteins) showed significant differences. All the fibre-rich powders had high concentrations of TDF (62 – 77 %). The IF/SF proportion decreased with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> in this way increasing the physiological quality of the fibre. Functional properties, namely water-holding capacity (WHC), oil-holding capacity (OHC), solubility (SOL), and glucose dialysis retardation index (GDRI), varied according to the preparation procedure.

Long-term treatment related morbidity is therefore important, {{but may not}} be well characterised. The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct an electronic survey of clinicians involved in the care of patients with DTC to determine their views on treatment related morbidity. Methods: A nine item questionnaire was developed, piloted locally and sent by email to members of three United Kingdom (UK) medical organisations (Thyroid Cancer Forum, British Association of Endocrine and Thyroid Surgeons, British Thyroid Association). Results: 125 responses were received. Less than 5 % of respondents had a formal protocol to detect morbidity associated with TSH suppression. Over 50 % agreed that morbidity from TSH suppression is not well defined.

The results indicated that older patients have outcomes similar to those of younger patients. There {{were no significant differences in}} quality of life, performance status and physical health among the three age groups.

Patients aged 45 - 65 years and patients 65 years and older reported a higher level of co-morbidity and more cancer-related impairments than those aged 45 and younger. Although older patients had higher co-morbidity, they showed similar Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores to those of their younger counterparts. The regression analysis revealed social resources, self-reported health, performance status and complexity of care as significant predictors of patients' ADL, but not age, co-morbidity or <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> The findings support the conclusion that differences in performing ADL between younger and older patients with cancer are minimal and tend to be due to co-morbidity.

The addition of carbon dioxide (CO 2) at lower pressures (< 100 MPa) is a relatively new process, but has demonstrated similar bactericidal effects. Pressurized CO 2 has also been shown to inactivate enzymes, but this ability has not been studied in milk. Dense phase CO 2 is defined as CO 2 which exists in the liquid or supercritical state. A proprietary piece of equipment designed by Praxair (Chicago, IL) applied dense phase carbon dioxide to milk in a continuous manner. Enzyme activity was assayed by acid degree value and protein breakdown. Temperatures between 15 °C and 40 °C and pressures between 7 MPa and 62 MPa were investigated. Because of milk’s susceptibility to pH change, the process’s effect on casein proteins was also studied. At higher temperatures (40 °) and CO 2 concentrations, the process was shown to significantly reduce the proteolytic and lipolytic endproducts. However, these conditions also changed the structure of the underlying casein protein. By reducing the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> both in terms of temperature and CO 2 content, no change to the casein was observed.

Water as the only transfer medium participated in steam explosion process is closely correlated with refining efficacy and energy consumption, while researches on steam explosion are neglected from transfer mechanism. In this work, from water transfer perspective, steam explosion process was innovatively divided into four specific stages and the multi-stage mass transfer model of steam explosion process was firstly established. From this model, quantitative relation of water composition in each stage and final water content formula were evaluated, which is efficient to guide the process energy efficiency with several proposed regulation strategies. By combining transfer process simulation with pretreatment efficacy evaluation, much water in feedstock presented a buffering effect on reaction and transfer issues during steam explosion process, thereby weakening the actual <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> 40 % water content of cellulosic biomass was optimized from the compromise between treatment efficacy and energy efficiency. The yield of overall glucose through pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis was increased by over 20 % with a potential cost savings of steam consumption by simply coordinating water content of cellulosic biomass prior to steam explosion treatment. Thus, results in the work emphasize the water transfer and regulation during steam explosion process on understanding water reaction mechanism, enhancing pretreatment efficacy and saving energy, leading to more efficient use of biomass.

40|$|The current {{treatment}} for cancer {{is focused on}} chemotherapeutic treatments {{which can lead to}} many side effects including nausea, vomiting and chemoresistance. Combating chemoresistance is a key target in cancer therapy, along with enhancing the effects of current chemotherapy treatments. One progressive novel approach being investigated is pre-treating (“priming”) cells prior to chemotherapeutic treatment. Evidence has shown that “priming” of cancer cells can sensitizes the mitochondria to respond better to chemotherapy and hence reduce <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and side effects. In this thesis, I aim to define the mechanism by which “priming” enhances cell death through the mitochondria. Firstly, cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid that has shown to have beneficial properties in inflammation, pain relief and in reducing cancer cell progression was examined for a potential “priming” agent. Secondly, the effect of the chemotherapy agent, cisplatin, was fully defined for its role in mitochondrial function along with a combination therapy of CBD and cisplatin. And finally, “priming” with CBD was assessed for any potential benefit to cancer treatment. I have demonstrated here that “priming” with CBD can enhance the killing effect of cisplatin in cancer cells and not in control cells. More specifically, the underlying mechanism for “priming” by CBD was shown to be through the modulation of mitochondrial function by means of the high stress two-phase system p 53 /Nrf 2 together with voltage dependant anion channel 1 (VDAC 1) receptor activation. From this body of work, “priming” has been shown to have a potential in enhancing current chemotherapeutic treatment. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} performance (nitrous oxide decomposition, hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide, {{and selective}} reduction of nitric oxide by i-butane) was evaluated {{for a set}} of HZSM- 5 and sublimed Fe/ZSM- 5 catalysts, which have been extensively characterized in an earlier contribution (J. Catal. (2003)). Nitrous oxide decomposition rates for the sublimed samples strongly increase after high-temperature calcination and particularly, after high-temperature steaming. Only {{a small fraction of the}} total iron content is active in this decomposition. For benzene hydroxylation the initial phenol productivity also increases with increasing <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> It is concluded that similar catalytic sites are important. Nevertheless, Fe/ZSM- 5 and Fe/ZSM- 5 (HTC) exhibit relatively low phenol selectivities due to significant hydrocarbon combustion. The steamed Fe/ZSM- 5, however, produces phenol with high selectivity. The stability of the sublimed samples is relatively low due to the large coke make, attributable to the large number of active sites. Commercial HZSM- 5 with an iron content of 0. 024 wt% and its steamed counterpart are also active and have a better stability, the latter one having the highest phenol productivity after prolonged reaction times. The beneficial effect of severe activation treatments to sublimed Fe/ZSM- 5, where iron is introduced at extraframework positions, is taken as an indication that removal of lattice aluminum is important for the generation of active sites. The different activity order in NO reduction by i-butane suggests that the active sites for this reaction are different from those for nitrous oxide decomposition and selective benzene oxidation...|$|E

Rice husks {{were subjected to}} hydrothermal processing {{under a variety of}} operational conditions to cause the selective breakdown of xylan chains, in order to assess the effects of reaction severity on the distribution of reaction products. RESULTS: The effects of severity (measured by the severity factor, R 0) on the concentrations of the major autohydrolysis products (monosaccharides, xylo- and glucooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharide substituents, acetic acid, acid-soluble lignin and elemental nitrogen) were assessed. The interrelationship between the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and molecular weight distribution was established by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. Selected samples were subjected to refining treatments as ethyl acetate extraction and ion exchange for refining purposes, and the concentrates were assayed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. CONCLUSIONS The protein equivalent of the products present in liquors accounted for 43 to 51 % of the protein present in the raw rice husks. The concentrations of glucose (derived from starchy material) and arabinose (split from the xylan backbone) were fairly constant with severity. Even in treatments at low severity, high molecular weight compounds derived from xylan accounted for a limited part of the stoichiometric amount. Operating under harsh conditions, about 50 % of the total xylan-derived compounds corresponded to fractions with a degree of polymerization (DP) < 9. After refining, saccharides accounted for more than 90 % of the non-volatile components of the sample. The refined products showed a series of xylose oligomers up to about DP 13, and a series of acetylated xylose oligomers up to about DP 15...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} severe (hydrothermal) {{treatment}} on Fe/ZSM- 5 prepared by sublimation of FeCl 3 is studied {{by a combination}} of high-resolution TEM, EXAFS, 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, IR, UV–vis, nitrogen adsorption, 27 Al NMR spectroscopy, and low-temperature nitrous oxide decomposition. The heterogeneous nature of Fe/ZSM- 5 is stressed with a preponderance of iron oxide particles on the external zeolite surface. Additionally, neutral iron oxide nanoparticles and charge-compensating iron complexes are located in the micropores. Severe calcination at 973 K induces the growth and ordering of the iron oxide aggregates. Moreover, some of the occluded neutral iron oxide nanoparticles are transformed into charge-compensating iron complexes upon a protolysis reaction with the Brønsted protons. These effects are more pronounced in the case of steaming at 973 K, additionally resulting in the removal of Al from framework positions. Despite the low dispersion of iron oxide in Fe/ZSM- 5, relatively low Fe [...] -Fe coordination numbers were derived from the EXAFS data for Fe/ZSM- 5; high-temperature treatments increased this number. This low value points to the disordered nature of the iron oxide aggregates rather than to the presence of an abundant fraction of binuclear iron clusters. Titration of sites active in nitrous oxide decomposition shows that their amount increases upon increasing <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> of Fe/ZSM- 5. Their number, however, remains very small (a few percent of the total iron) and appears to correlate to the amount of Fe 2 + present after room temperature exposure to vacuum conditions. A comparison to a commercial HZSM- 5 zeolite with a very low iron content is made. The catalytic performance of these materials is discussed in a companion paper (J. Catal. (2003)) ...|$|E

ObjectiveThe objective {{of this study was}} identify the circumstances under which PET scanning for the diagnosis of AD maximizes health outcomes. MethodsA Markov-model-based decision analysis was conducted using estimates derived from the literature on AD epidemiology, the accuracy of PET, and donepezil treatment efficacy. The target population for the analysis was assumed to be US men and women who either have mild AD or are asymptomatic but at an elevated risk of developing AD owing to disease in a first-degree relative (parent or sibling). The time horizon was the patient lifetime. We compared treatment 1) based on an American Academy of Neurology (AAN) clinical evaluation either alone; 2) in combination with PET scanning; or 3) empirically based on a family history. Outcomes measures were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and (severe) dementia-free life expectancy (SDFLE). ResultsFor both patient populations, treating all patients based on an AAN evaluation without further testing using PET resulted in the greatest gains in life expectancy, QALYs, and SDFLEs. PET-based testing was the second preferred strategy compared to no intervention. The rankings of the strategies were sensitive to <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> complications: analyses of hypothetical treatments with the potential for severe complications indicated that testing was preferred if the treatment was effective but had moderate complications. ConclusionsThese results suggest that current treatments, which are relatively benign and may slow progression of disease, should be offered to patients who are identified as having AD based solely on an AAN clinical evaluation. A clinical evaluation that includes functional neuroimaging based testing will be warranted, however, when new treatments that are effective at slowing disease progression but have the potential for moderate to severe complications become available...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Mycorrhizal fungi are {{important}} {{contributors to the}} functioning of boreal forests, since they act in the bilateral carbon and nutrient transport between above- and belowground parts of the ecosystem. In ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis of woody host plants, both fungal and plant partners depend on resources provided by the other. A single tree may simultaneously host several ECM fungal partners, which greatly enhance the host's nutrient uptake. At the same time nearly 20 % of host primary production is allocated to mycorrhizal fungi. Although fungi depend on host-derived carbon, it is poorly understood how reduced carbon availability, e. g., due to herbivory, affects the ECM fungal symbionts. In this thesis I studied the impact of simulated insect defoliation or mammal browsing on mycorrhizal fungi of boreal woody hosts. Quantitative and qualitative changes in biomass partitioning in different fungal compartments were detected. None of the experiments showed that defoliation or shoot clipping treatments reduced the intensity of ECM colonisation, while treatments often shifted fungal composition towards less biomass producing ECM morphotypes. Above- and belowground diversity in ECM symbionts tended to decrease due to shoot or foliar damage. In addition, in some cases defoliation also reduced fungal biomass in fine roots and decreased ECM sexual reproduction by {{reducing the number of}} sporocarps produced. Defoliation induced a similar response pattern in the host and in ECM fungi with a stronger response to increasing <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> (e. g. degree of removed foliage or repeated years of defoliation). This was also confirmed when relating the effects of host and ECM fungal symbionts to defoliation using present and previously published data. The present results suggest that belowground adaptation of boreal trees to the changing environment is mediated by changes in fungal community or biomass partitioning. The lack of response in the intensity of ECM colonisation further emphasises the importance of the symbiosis to boreal trees...|$|E
40|$|Comorbidity, the {{presence}} of additional illnesses unrelated to the tumor, has {{a significant impact on}} the prognosis of patients with head and neck cancer. In these patients, tobacco and alcohol abuse contributes greatly to comorbidity. Several instruments have been used to quantify comorbidity including Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 (ACE 27), Charlson Index (CI) and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. The ACE 27 and CI are the most frequently used indices. Information on comorbidity at the time of diagnosis can be abstracted from patient records. Self-reporting is less reliable than record review. Functional status is not a reliable substitute for comorbidity evaluation as a prognostic measure. Severity as well as {{the presence}} of a condition is required for a good predictive instrument. Comorbidity increases mortality in patients with head and neck cancer, and this effect is greater in the early years following treatment. In addition to reducing overall survival, many studies have shown that comorbidity influences disease-specific survival negatively, most likely because patients with high comorbidity tend to have delay in diagnosis, often presenting with advanced stage tumors, and the comorbidity may also prompt less aggressive treatment. The impact of comorbidity on survival is greater in younger than in older patients, although it affects both. For specific tumor sites, comorbidity has been shown to negatively influence prognosis in oral, oropharyngeal, laryngeal and salivary gland tumors. Several studies have reported higher incidence and increased <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> complications in patients with high comorbidity burden. Studies have demonstrated a negative impact of comorbidity on quality of life, and increased cost of treatment with higher degree of comorbidity. Our review of the literature suggests that routine collection of comorbidity data will be important in the analysis of survival, quality of life and functional outcomes after treatment as comorbidity has an impact on all of the above. These data should be integrated with tumor-specific staging systems in order to develop better instruments for prognostication, as well as comparing results of different treatment regimens and institutions...|$|E

This study had two goals: (1) To investigate factors that predict actual and intended vaccinations, and (2) to test a model of HPV vaccination intentions. An adapted Health Belief Model {{was used as the}} theoretical framework to guide this study. The model components assessed in this study were: Perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, perceived benefits, cues to action, self-efficacy, knowledge, and subjective norms. Each model component was assessed by at least one variable, with some model components being assessed with multiple variables. Participants were 374 women, aged 18 to 30, residing in Canada. Data were collected using an online questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses revealed that actual vaccination decisions were directly influenced by the following model components and variables: Perceived severity (<b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment),</b> perceived barriers (vaccine safety concerns, fear of doctor stigma, insurance coverage), and cues to action. Multiple regression analyses revealed that vaccination intentions were influenced by: Perceived benefits (vaccine positive beliefs, vaccine effectiveness), barriers (vaccine safety concerns), cues to action, self-efficacy, and subjective norms. A structural equation model to assess HPV vaccination intentions was tested. With a few modifications, support for the model was found. This model revealed that all of the theoretical components measured in this study contributed directly or indirectly to vaccination intentions. This study revealed that actual and intended HPV vaccinations are predicted by different variables. In addition, it also found support for a complex model of vaccination intentions. A unique contribution was the finding that women 2 ̆ 7 s fear of experiencing stigma from doctors by asking for the vaccine impacted actual vaccination decisions. Vaccine safety concerns were also found to impact actual uptake. Finally, healthcare professionals may also benefit from understanding that cues to action were found to be predictive of behaviours, suggesting that women who are exposed to more cues are more likely to get vaccinated...|$|E

The <b>treatments</b> consisted <b>of</b> spraying with acibenzolar-S-methyl, fluazinam, pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + methiran, copper oxychloride, copper oxychloride and mancozeb + oxytetracycline, and inoculated and non-inoculated controls. After three days <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> all plants were inoculated with X. perforans (10 6 CFU / mL). Leaf discs were collected for assessment of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, β- 1, 3 glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase and protease. The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated with the data <b>of</b> <b>severity.</b> All <b>treatments</b> had reduced AUDPC compared to the inoculated control. Fungicides acibenzolar-S-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and pyraclostrobin + methiran had more satisfactory results in reducing the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> bacterial spot on tomato. The products based on pyraclostrobin together with acibenzolar-S-methyl induced enzymatic activities of peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase and β- 1, 3 glucanase, indicating that these products {{may be related to the}} induction of resistance to bacterial spot on tomato plants...|$|R
