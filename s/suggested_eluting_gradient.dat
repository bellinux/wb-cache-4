The preparation is a composite mixture of the fine powder of fruits of Vidang (Embelia ribs), glandular trichomes of the fruits of Kamala (Mallotus philippensis), mature fruits of Harde (Terminalia chebula), Saindhava and Yavakshara. The use of reversed phase C 18 column <b>eluted</b> with <b>gradient</b> mobile phase of acetonitrile and water enabled the efficient separation of the chemical markers in 22 min. Validation of the method was performed in order to demonstrate its selectivity, accuracy, precision, repeatability and recovery. All calibration curves showed good linear correlation coefficients (r 2 > 0. 995) within the tested ranges. Three markers in Vidangadi churna were quantified with respect to Embelin (0. 647 %, w/w), Rottlerin (4. 419 %, w/w), and Ellagic acid (0. 459 %, w/w). Intra-and inter-day RSDs of retention times and peak areas were less than 3. 12 %. The recoveries were between 99. 66 % and 102. 33 %. In conclusion, a method has been developed for the simultaneous quantification of three markers in Vidangadi churna.

40|$|In a {{continuation}} of study towards the discovery of biologically active compounds from Sri Lankan medicinal plants, we have chemically investigated some of the selected plants for their antifungal activity. Preliminary investigations showed that methanol extract of the plant Plectranthuszeylanicus showed significant antifungal activity. The bioactive agent of the above mentioned plant in the most potent fractions with antifungal properties were identified using column chromatography, <b>eluted</b> using <b>gradient</b> elution technique using three different solvents as a mixture of two in different ratios as a combination of hexane: ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate: methanol in increasing polarity, followed by antifungal assay against Aspergillus species for each fractions. Analysis of Antifungal activity profile of the plant showed that the highest inhibition activity in (75 % Hexane: 25 % Ethyl acetate) and (80 % Ethyl acetate: 20 % methanol) fractions and the respected value of the highest inhibition diameter {{was found to be}} 12. 83 mm for both fractions. Further isolation of these fractions are under study and introduction of chromatographic techniques into this work will possibly pave the way for an effective discovery of an antifungal agent. The obtained results provide a support for the use of this plant in traditional medicine {{and it would be a}} potential antiseptic source for the prevention and treatment of fungal infection...|$|R

The 35 ml of the enzyme {{solution was}} applied to DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma-aldrich.) column which was previously equilibrated with 0.02 M Acetate buffer (pH 5.2). The entire purification was carried out at 4 °C. The column was first washed with equilibration buffer, and then bound proteins were <b>eluted</b> using linear <b>gradient</b> of 0.05 - 1.0 M NaCl (in acetate buffer) at a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. The elute fractions (3.0 ml) was by an automatic fraction collector and monitored for enzyme activity {{as well as for}} protein concentration at 280 nm. After step-wise eluted each fraction from DEAE-Sepharose column, the total activity and specific activity of endoglucanase was assayed by DNS method, the fraction showing high activity were pooled and used for SDS-PAGE analysis.|$|R

The wild-type Grx 2 and the C 15 S mutant of Grx 2 (the C 15 S mutant) were expressed with the C-terminal Histag (LEHHHHHH). The cells were grown in M 9 minimal media containing 100  μg/ml ampicilin for 13 C/ 15 [*]N double labeling at 37 °C until OD 600 reached 0.6.

40|$|The {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) column is capable of enrichment/pre-concentration of trace impurities in the mobile phase during the column equilibration, prior to sample injection and elution. These impurities <b>elute</b> during <b>gradient</b> elution and result in significant chromatographic peaks. Three types of purified water were tested for their impurity levels, and hence their performances as mobile phase, in HPLC followed by total ion current (TIC) mode of MS. Two types of HPLC-grade water produced 3 - 4 significant peaks in solvent blanks while LC/MS-grade water produced no peaks (although peaks were produced by LC/MS-grade water also {{after a few days}} of standing). None of the three waters produced peaks in HPLC followed by UV-Vis detection. These peaks, if co-eluted with analyte, are capable of suppressing or enhancing the analyte signal in a MS detector. As it is not common practice to run solvent blanks in TIC mode, when quantification is commonly carried out using single ion monitoring (SIM) or single or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM or MRM), the effect of co-eluting impurities on the analyte signal and hence on the accuracy of the results is often unknown to the analyst. Running solvent blanks in TIC mode, regardless of the MS mode used for quantification, is essential in order to detect this problem and to take subsequent precautions.
