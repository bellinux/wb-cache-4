50|$|The Port of Montevideo, {{handling}} over 1.1 million containers annually, is {{the most}} advanced container terminal in South America. Its quay can handle 14 m vessels. Nine <b>straddle</b> <b>cranes</b> allow for 80 to 100 movements per hour. The port of Nueva Palmira is a major regional merchandise transfer point and houses both private and government-run terminals.|$|R
25|$|Containers are {{transferred}} between rail, truck, and ship by container cranes at container terminals. Forklifts, reach stackers, <b>straddle</b> carriers, and <b>cranes</b> {{may be used}} to load and unload trucks or trains outside of container terminals. Swap bodys, sidelifters, tilt deck trucks, and hook trucks allow transfer to and from trucks with no extra equipment.|$|R
50|$|The LARC-LX {{was used}} to {{transport}} wheeled and tracked vehicles, including beach preparation equipment and general cargo, from ship-to-shore or to inland transfer points. It was also capable of transporting 40 ft shipping containers, which could be landed from the LARC either by <b>crane,</b> <b>straddle</b> carriers, or rollers. It was the only amphibious vehicle in U.S. Army service capable of landing on a beach through surf. Typically, the LARC-LX was carried as deck cargo on a commercial vessel or heavy lift ship to be transported overseas.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, {{containerisation}} revolutionised shipping, eventually {{coming to}} New Zealand as well. The local harbour boards wrought massive changes on those ports selected (after much political wrangling) {{to handle the}} new giant vessels, such as Lyttelton and Auckland Port. Gantry <b>cranes,</b> <b>straddle</b> carriers and powerful tugboats were built or purchased, and shipping channels dredged deeper, while large areas of land were reclaimed to enable the new container terminals. The changes {{have been described as}} having been more radical than the changeover from sail to steam a century before.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a petri net model for examining effectiveness of straddle carrier direct-system operation. A schematic process of straddle carrier operation {{is given by}} formalization of operation type and its motion sequences. An interchange model is proposedto represent transloading process that controls the flow of containers between container handling equipment. Simulation platform was developed to examine the deployment scenarios, which {{is related to the}} number of operating gantry <b>cranes,</b> <b>straddle</b> carriers and truck slots at transfer point. The simulation results suggest the trade-off between operational efficiency and service quality by deployment combinations of cargo handling equipment which is valuable for decision support in terminal managementsystem aiming for operation efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|They {{are also}} called portal cranes, the [...] "portal" [...] being {{the empty space}} straddled by the gantry. The terms gantry crane and {{overhead}} crane (or bridge crane) are often used interchangeably, as both types of <b>crane</b> <b>straddle</b> their workload. The usual distinction drawn {{between the two is}} that with gantry cranes, the entire structure (including gantry) is usually wheeled (often on rails). By contrast, the supporting structure of an overhead crane is fixed in location, often {{in the form of the}} walls or ceiling of a building, to which is attached a movable hoist running overhead along a rail or beam (which may itself move). Further confusing the issue is that gantry cranes may also incorporate a movable beam-mounted hoist in addition to the entire structure being wheeled, and some overhead cranes are suspended from a freestanding gantry.|$|R
40|$|Modeling & Simulation (M&S) {{provides}} one of {{the best}} solutions for personnel and managers training in complex environments. In this article, the authors present an advanced High Level Architecture (HLA) federation of simulators (TRAINPORTS, TRAINing in marine PORTs by using Simulation), that recreates in a three-dimensional virtual environment the most important transshipment terminal of the South Mediterranean area, the Gioia Tauro container terminal. The TRAINPORTS federation includes four different federates (<b>Straddle</b> Carrier, Quay <b>Crane,</b> Forklift and Truck) and offers an advanced tool for marine port operators' training providing the sensation of being in a real container terminal environment. The TRAINPORTS federation is part of an innovative family of simulators (called ST_VP, Simulation Team Virtual Port). This article presents the TRAINPORTS architecture, describes the federates/federation development process and discusses the simulators operation modes and verification and validation issues.

50|$|The first railway {{workshops}} in the Wellington region were near Wellington's first railway station at Pipitea Point. These workshops {{started out as}} a set of storage sheds for rolling stock when the first section of the Wairarapa Line was being constructed from 1872 to 1874. Later a repair and erecting shop was built at the site at the behest of Messrs Brogden and Sons, who arranged for the workshops to be fitted out with equipment imported from England. The building was 100 ft long by 48 ft wide, with a seaward side lean-to 50 ft long and 24 ft wide. A single road entered the building, in which facilities were provided for blacksmiths with four forges, woodworking and carpentry, and a machine shop. A stationary steam engine was used to power the machinery using a system of shafts and belts. A 10-ton overhead <b>crane</b> <b>straddled</b> the track.|$|R
40|$|There are two {{stitching}} {{methods used}} to repair and strengthen cracks or joints in concrete pave-ment. The first, and most common, is cross-stitching. Cross-stitching uses deformed tie bars epoxied or grouted into holes drilled at an angle through a crack. The second, slot-stitching, uses deformed tie bars grouted into slots cut across a joint or crack. Each technique is beneficial for certain circumstances. Recommendations on where to use these methods are outlined in this special report. Stitching is applicable {{for a number of}} situations where strengthening joints or cracks is required. Among these are: • Strengthening longitudinal cracks in slabs to prevent slab migration and maintain aggregate interlock • Mitigating omission of tie bars from longitudinal contraction joints due to construction error • Tying roadway lanes or shoulders that are separating and causing a maintenance problem • Tying centerline longitudinal joints which are starting to fault • Strengthening keyed joints for heavy loads (aircraft, gantry <b>cranes,</b> <b>straddle</b> carriers, etc. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology {{to design a}} Container Terminal Operation Simulation (CTOS), which simulates the vulnerability of port operations to extreme weather events. In CTOS, an agent based model was built for a container terminal at the Port of Sydney to simulate the operations of port operational assets such as <b>cranes,</b> <b>straddle</b> carriers and trucks to observe the individual and collective behaviour under various extreme weather events using a set of Key Performance Indicators (e. g. <b>crane</b> rates, <b>straddle</b> productivity, truck queue length, yard utilisation). The CTOS {{results show that the}} crane throughput loss due to six hours of heavy rain and six hours of high speed wind (separately) is 13 per cent within a 24 hour period. While high speed wind and heavy rain have the highest impact on the crane throughput, high speed wind and flooding in the port area leads to a backlog in servicing trucks. Using a single terminal for the purpose of the simulation, as opposed to the entire Sydney Port, is a limitation. However, the CTOS is designed and coded in a manner that permits its modification such that it can be applied to other port contexts. CTOS offers a versatile tool for port authority to enable estimating performance implications of extreme weather-related disruptions to port operations. CTOS provides an effective proof of concept prototype where the system architecture can be reused in developing an open generic port operations model...|$|R
