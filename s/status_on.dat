After reaching this intensity, the hurricane turned northeastward and accelerated, although it did not intensify further. A reconnaissance mission around this time recorded a minimum pressure of 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg).|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane <b>status</b> <b>on</b> September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes {{well away from the}} Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane <b>status</b> <b>on</b> September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Amara brought stormy {{conditions}} to Rodrigues in December2013. Amara {{was the first}} named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December14. The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. Despite its ill-defined organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm <b>status</b> <b>on</b> December16 as it tracked southwest. Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone <b>status</b> <b>on</b> December18. After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933mbar (hPa; 27.55inHg) on December21, making it an intense tropical cyclone based on the intensity scale utilized by Météo-France. Shortly after, wind shear strengthened as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December23, Amara degenerated into a remnant low.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{relatively}} long-lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm <b>status</b> <b>on</b> October16 and then to hurricane <b>status</b> <b>on</b> October17. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.|$|E
