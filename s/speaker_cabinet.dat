5|$|Console organs {{have two}} 61-note manuals and a pedalboard {{of at least}} two octaves. Most {{consoles}} do not have a built-in power amplifier or speakers, so an external amplifier and <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet</b> is required.|$|E
5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through a {{rotating}} <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet</b> known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its inventor Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating horn over a stationary treble compression driver, and a rotating baffle beneath a stationary bass woofer. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ is an {{electric}} organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various {{models have been}} produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating {{an electric}} current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so it can drive a <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E

50|$|Speaker {{enclosures}} {{are used}} in homes in stereo systems, home cinema systems, televisions, boom boxes and many other audio appliances. Small speaker enclosures {{are used in}} car stereo systems. <b>Speaker</b> <b>cabinets</b> are key components {{of a number of}} commercial applications, including sound reinforcement systems, movie theatre sound systems and recording studios. Electric musical instruments invented in the 20th century, such as the electric guitar, electric bass and synthesizer, among others, are amplified using instrument amplifiers and <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinets</b> (e.g., guitar amplifier <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinets).</b>|$|R
25|$|Jim Marshall {{then cut}} the massive <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet</b> into two {{separate}} speaker cabinets, {{at the suggestion}} of Townshend, with each cabinet containing four 12-inch speakers. One of the cabinets had half of the speaker baffle slanted upwards and Marshall made these two cabinets stackable. The Marshall stack was born, and Townshend used these as well as Hiwatt stacks.|$|E
25|$|Woofer {{enclosures}} must {{be larger}} and more sturdily built than cabinets for mid-range or high-frequency (tweeter) speakers. As such, in the 1950s, when Ampeg introduced bass amplifier and speaker systems, bass guitarists began to use them. Similarly, Hammond organ players used a specialized keyboard combo amplifier, the Leslie <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet,</b> which contains a woofer for the low frequencies and a horn for the high frequencies. The Leslie horns rotate and a baffle around the woofer rotates as well, producing a rich tremolo and chorus effect.|$|E
25|$|Re-amping is {{a process}} often used in {{multitrack}} recording in which a recorded signal is routed {{back out of the}} editing environment and run through external processing using effects units and then into a guitar amplifier and a guitar <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet</b> or a reverb chamber. Originally, the technique was used mostly for electric guitars: it facilitates a separation of guitar playing from guitar amplifier processing—a previously recorded audio program is played back and re-recorded at a later time for the purpose of adding effects, ambiance such as reverb or echo, and the tone shaping imbued by certain amps and cabinets. The technique has since evolved over the 2000s to include many other applications. Re-amping can also be applied to other instruments and program, such as recorded drums, synthesizers, and virtual instruments.|$|E

25|$|Electronic {{music is}} music that employs {{electronic}} musical instruments, digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology. An electronic musician is a musician who composes or performs such music. In general, a distinction {{can be made}} between sound produced using electromechanical means, such as violins and drums, and that produced using electronic technology. Electromechanical instruments include mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers, and so on, and electric elements, such as magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar, which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences to hear with an instrument amplifier and <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings, hammers, or other sound-producing mechanisms. Devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer can produce electronic sounds.|$|E

500|$|Grunge is {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} sludgy electric guitar sound with a [...] "thick" [...] middle register and rolled-off treble tone and {{a high level of}} distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers [...] and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs [...] ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most [...] "lugubrious sound"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive [...] "buildup of sonic fog". or even dismissed as [...] "noise" [...] by one critic. As with metal and hardcore, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.|$|E

2500|$|Vaughan was {{inspired}} musically by American and British blues rock. He favored clean amplifiers with high volume {{and contributed to}} the popularity of vintage musical equipment. He often combined several different amplifiers together and used minimal effects pedals. Chris Gill of Guitar World commented: [...] "Stevie Ray Vaughan's guitar tone was as dry as a San Antonio summer and as sparkling clean as a Dallas debutante, the product of the natural sound of amps with ample clean headroom. However, Vaughan occasionally used pedals to augment his sound, mainly to boost the signal, although he occasionally employed a rotating <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet</b> and wah pedals for added textural flair." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Van Halen I, {{a single}} Celestion <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet</b> was used, and a variac set to around 90 volts was used on Van Halen's main 100 watt Marshall head, mainly {{to lower the}} amplifier's volume. [...] The volume control and all other {{controls}} on his Marshall head were set to maximum of 10. [...] Van Halen's Van Halen I recorded guitar tracks were re-amped by using the Sunset Sound studios live reverb room. The first Montrose album was recorded in this way by Ted Templeman and Donn Landee, who also produced and engineered the Van Halen I album. Van Halen I was recorded in Studio 1 and Van Halen II was recorded in Studio 2 at Sunset Sound.|$|E
2500|$|An {{amplifier}} stack {{consists of}} an amplifier head atop a speaker cabinet—a head {{on top of one}} cabinet is commonly called a half stack, a head atop two cabinets a full stack. The cabinet that the head sits on often has an angled top in front, while the lower cabinet of a full stack has a straight front. The first version of the Marshall stack was an amp head on an 8×12 cabinet, meaning a single <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinet</b> containing eight 12" [...] guitar speakers. After six of these cabinets were made, the cabinet arrangement was changed to an amp head on two 4×12 (four 12" [...] speakers) cabinets to make the cabinets more transportable. Some touring metal and rock bands have used a large array of guitar speaker cabinets for their impressive appearance. Some of these arrangements include only the fronts of speaker cabinets mounted on a large frame.|$|E
5000|$|Large <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinets</b> such as 8x10" [...] {{enclosures}} {{may have}} wheels and a [...] "towel bar" [...] and dolly wheels to facilitate transportation. <b>Speaker</b> <b>cabinets</b> with 1/4 input jacks typically have two parallel jacks, {{so that the}} amp head may be plugged into one cabinet, and then a second cabinet can be [...] "daisy chained" [...] by connecting it to the first cabinet. Cabinets with horn-loaded tweeters often have an attenuator knob for controlling the tweeter. Some 2000s-era <b>speaker</b> <b>cabinets</b> may have Speakon jacks; these jacks are often used with high-wattage amps, because they are safer, as the cable connections are hidden inside the connector and thus {{it is impossible for}} the user to touch the metal contacts when plugging in the amp cable.|$|R
