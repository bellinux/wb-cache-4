5|$|On 9 January 2011, Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy {{gave her}} {{support to the}} idea of a public DNA <b>screening</b> <b>process</b> if the police found it useful. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had {{conducted}} mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of Louise Smith. McCarthy suggested that the <b>screening</b> <b>process</b> should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area. DNA that had been found on Yeates' body was tested for a potential profile. Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred registered sex offenders living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals' whereabouts on 17 December.|$|E

5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent <b>screening</b> <b>process</b> is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E

5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists {{as possible so}} long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give up}} his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the <b>screening</b> <b>process</b> so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR <b>screening</b> <b>process</b> and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E

These basic parameters for <b>screening</b> <b>processes</b> will be presented as well as different types of screening machines to demonstrate the way to decide for the best available technique...|$|R
50|$|The {{processing}} of arrivals {{as part of}} their customs screening began in October 2002. It first focused on arrivals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. It handled 127,694 people before being phased out as universal <b>screening</b> <b>processes</b> were put in place.|$|R
25|$|The <b>screening</b> <b>process,</b> however, is {{characterized}} by a high false positive rate. In one study, CAH screening had the lowest positive predictive value (111 true-positive cases among 20,647 abnormal screening results in a 2-year period, or 0.53%, compared with 6.36% for biotinidase deficiency, 1.84% for congenital hypo-thyroidism, 0.56% for classic galactosemia, and 2.9% for phenylketonuria). According to this estimate, 200 unaffected newborns required clinical and laboratory follow-up for every true case of CAH.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} thing about shelling is to remove the shell of peanuts with the smallest damage to the seed. The moisture of the unshelled peanuts is controlled to avoid excessive frangibility of the shells and kernels, which in turn, reduces the amount of dust present in the plant. After, the peanuts are sent to a series of rollers set specifically for the batch of peanuts, where they are cracked. After cracking, the peanuts go through a <b>screening</b> <b>process</b> where they are inspected for contaminants.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} Dynamical Mean-Field Theory we {{investigate}} the spin response {{function of a}} model for correlated materials with d- or f-electrons hybridized with more delocalized ligand orbitals. We point out the existence of two different processes responsible for the dynamical screening of local moments of the correlated electrons. Studying the local spin susceptibility we identify {{the contribution of the}} "direct" magnetic exchange and of an "indirect" one mediated by the itinerant uncorrelated orbitals. In addition, we characterize the nature of the dynamical <b>screening</b> <b>processes</b> in terms of different classes of diagrams in the hybridization-expansion contributing to the density-matrix. Our analysis suggests possible ways of estimating the relative importance of these two classes of <b>screening</b> <b>processes</b> in realistic calculations for correlated materials.

25|$|The {{first steps}} taken to {{diagnose}} this condition are {{consideration of the}} signs and symptoms, and a medical history (the detailed medical review of past health state) to evaluate any risk factors. Based on the symptoms presented, a range of biochemical tests (using blood and/or urine samples) may also be considered {{as part of the}} <b>screening</b> <b>process</b> to provide sufficient quantitative analysis of any differences in electrolytes, renal and liver function, and blood clotting times. Upon physical examination, palpation of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or an organ enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Many {{ligand binding}} assays require a {{filtration}} step to separate bound and unbound ligands before screening. A method called Scintillation proximity assay (SPA) has been recently developed, which eliminates this otherwise crucial step. It works through crystal lattice beads, which are coated with ligand coupling molecules {{and filled with}} cerium ions. These give off bursts of light when stimulated by an isotope, which can easily be measured. Ligands are radiolabeled using either 3H or 125I, and released into the assay. Since only the radioligands that directly bind to the beads initiate a signal, free-ligands do not interfere during the <b>screening</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
