Yehl said, [...] "With {{nearly two dozen}} heroes filling up every ounce of panel space, the reading {{experience}} becomes stretched thin as writers Geoff Johns and Jeff Lemire try to find something for everyone to say or do. The result is an event comic that has two more issues to go yet still hasn’t decided exactly what this story is really about." [...] He however, enjoyed Lex Luthor's appearance in the issue. Conversely, Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying [...] "For all the false starts and misdirection of the New 52, the first major crossover in “Trinity War” has come together nicely. While {{there is still the}} pervading <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> merely a set-up for the next major event, the “Forever Evil” villains month, there’s no denying that it has been a hell of a ride so far," [...] adding [...] "all of the previously disparate elements from the various series begin to coalesce into something major." [...] Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, feeling it was [...] "loads of fanboy fun" [...] and the issue actually progressed the series storyline, not just the event's storyline.|$|E

He checked his horse, and made it stand still in the same spot for two or three minutes, during which he turned his head from side to side in a melancholy way, as if he were looking at some painful object on more sides than one. Evidently, after his fit of promptitude, Mr. Tulliver was relapsing into the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a puzzling world.
