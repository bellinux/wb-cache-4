25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> on the slide. The ambidextrous <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Tasers are {{programmed}} to be activated in automatic five second bursts, although the officer {{can stop the}} energy charge at any time by engaging the <b>safety</b> <b>switch.</b> The charge can also be prolonged beyond five seconds if the trigger is held down continuously. The operator can also inflict repeated shock cycles with each pull of the trigger as long as both barbs remain attached to the subject. The only technical limit to the number or length of the electrical cycles is {{the life of the}} battery, which can be ten minutes or more.|$|E
2500|$|The 747's {{cargo door}} used {{a series of}} {{electrically}} operated latch cams into which the door-edge latch pins closed. The cams then rotated into a closed position, holding the door closed. A series of L-shaped arms (called locking sectors) were actuated by the final manual moving of a lever to close the door; these were designed to reinforce the unpowered latch cams and prevent them from rotating into an unlocked position. [...] The locking sectors were made out of aluminum and were too thin a gauge {{to be able to}} keep the latch cams from moving into the unlocked position against the power of the door motors. Electrical switches cut electrical power to the cargo door when the outer handle was closed; but if one of those were faulty, the motors could still draw power and rotate the latch cam to the open position. The same event could happen if frayed wires were able to power the cam-motor, even if the circuit power was cut by the <b>safety</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Because of the [...] "walk in" [...] {{nature of}} TWT, the tunnel was {{designed}} {{with the possibility}} that someone could accidentally be locked in the tunnel. Two large emergency <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> were provided. One was located at the test section, the other at the diffuser area. When either of these <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> were activated, the valve could not be opened.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded on December 15, 1902 by Bryson Dexter Horton and James B. McCarthy. In 1903 they {{incorporated}} as the McBride Manufacturing Company. During {{the first decade of}} business, the company expanded into various other electrical products. In 1908, the company was renamed Detroit Fuse and Manufacturing. Horton, an 1895 electrical engineering graduate of the University of Michigan, was credited with the invention of the <b>safety</b> <b>switch,</b> which encased high voltage switches and started the company's main line of business of circuit breakers and encased control panels. Their first enclosed <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> was introduced in 1909.|$|E
50|$|Common {{applications}} of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. Micro switches {{are commonly used}} in tamper switches on gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems, where {{it is necessary to}} know if a valve has been opened or shut.|$|R
50|$|The {{operator}} {{is protected}} from electrocution by <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> and fuses. There {{may also be}} controls for the supply of electricity to the switchboard, coming from a generator or bank of electrical generators, especially frequency control of AC power and load sharing controls, plus gauges showing frequency and perhaps a synchroscope. The amount of power going into a switchboard must always equal to the power {{going out to the}} loads.|$|R
2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|R

Proper grounding of systems and {{equipment and}} selection of overcurrent devices to facilitate fail-safe electrical systems are presented. Methods to limit voltage drop to 5 % from the facility power source to the end-use equipment are offered. There are recommendations for location of equipment and wiring and additional <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> for protection of equipment and facilitating service. Since many recommendations are general, there are suggested references for further details on wiring and equipment selection...|$|R
50|$|Open knife {{switches}} were {{supplanted by}} <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> with current carrying contacts inside a metal enclosure {{which can only}} be opened by switching off the power. In modern applications, automatic switches (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a snap action mechanism which opens the switch contacts rapidly, and feature an arc chute where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.|$|R
50|$|To protect {{maintenance}} {{workers from}} electrocution, all high-voltage cabinets have <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> which automatically lower the pantograph if the cabinet is opened while the power car is energized. Late-model ER2s also feature a ladder blocking relay which prevents {{the extension of}} maintenance ladders when the pantograph is raised, thus preventing workers and bystanders from climbing onto the roof. For passenger safety, all doors are equipped with position sensors which notify the engineer whether all doors are shut (however, in practice it is standard operating procedure for the fireman to step out onto the platform and check the doors visually).|$|R
50|$|Most {{swivel seats}} have a <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> so the {{stairlift}} won’t move unless the seat is locked into its travel position. Special models with seats facing {{the bottom of}} the staircase have been produced for users with spinal or other conditions which prevent use of the conventional seat layout. More room is need on the landing with these special seats.|$|E
5000|$|The grade against loaded trains {{heading to}} the mill was kept to 1 in 16½. The {{downhill}} grade from the tunnel to the mill was steeper and considered dangerously steep. To overcome this, a <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> was laid. During actual operations, no serious accidents occurred, though {{there are reports of}} [...] "some exciting moments", being [...] "due to greasy rails".|$|E
50|$|The Wadsworth Electric Manufacturing Company {{was formed}} by George B. and Harry Wadsworth in 1904. George {{received}} his first patent for an electrical service entrance <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> in 1907. This device reduced the likelihood of accident or fire and enabled homeowners to replace their own fuses. He received an additional 15 patents in the field between 1907 and 1925. Harry Wadsworth left the business in 1910.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} LAWKS mechanism {{consists of}} a switch on {{the handle of the}} knife, connected to the liner lock. When pulled back, the liner lock can easily be pushed back to close the knife. But when the <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> is pushed forward, it acts as an extra lock ensuring the linerlock {{can not be used to}} close the knife, making the folding knife a virtual fixed-blade tool.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{a simple}} sight {{assembly}} atop the chamber block - a semi-cylindrical groove along it, and a white forward post {{at the front of}} the groove. Some variants of PB-4 have a built-in laser sight with a laser window in the center of the [...] "locking surface", and the beam following the central extractor channel of the chamber block. The laser switch on the left side of the handle block is operated by the thumb, and the laser is fed by a battery inside the pistol grip. There are no <b>safety</b> <b>switches</b> - the locked and loaded weapon is always ready to fire (provided the battery is not discharged, for the models which use a battery).|$|R

50|$|In 1906-07, Schrade {{patented}} the Safety Pushbutton Knives, {{an improved}} series of switchblade knives with side-mounted operating button and a sliding <b>safety</b> <b>switch.</b> Later developed in slightly modified form as the Presto series, the Schrade switchblade {{would come to}} dominate the automatic knife market in the United States for the next fifty-five years. In the 1920s, Schrade bought the defunct Walden Cutlery Company {{in order to obtain}} their stocks of handle material for his knives.|$|E
50|$|The barrel is {{press-fit}} {{and pinned}} into the receiver. The manual <b>safety</b> <b>switch</b> is placed {{inside of the}} trigger guard and is manipulated by the shooter's index finger.

To close the blade again, the user has to pull the switch back to free the liner lock like the original LAWKS, but the AutoLAWKS switch automatically returns to a neutral position.|$|E
50|$|An electrician's license entitles {{the holder}} {{to carry out}} all types of {{electrical}} installation work in Australia without supervision. However, to contract, or offer to contract, to carry out electrical installation work, a licensed electrician must also be registered as an electrical contractor. Under Australian law, electrical work that involves fixed wiring is strictly regulated and must almost always be performed by a licensed electrician or electrical contractor. A local electrician can handle a range of work including air conditioning, data, and structured cabling systems, home automation & theatre, LAN, WAN and VPN data solutions, light fittings and installation, phone points, power points, safety inspections and reports, <b>safety</b> <b>switches,</b> smoke alarm installation, inspection and certification and testing and tagging of electrical appliances.|$|R

2500|$|Out {{of concern}} about energy wasted by the {{standing}} pilot flame, designers of many newer appliances have switched to an electronically controlled pilot-less ignition, also called intermittent ignition. With no standing pilot flame, there is no risk of gas buildup should the flame go out, so these appliances do not need thermocouple-based pilot <b>safety</b> <b>switches.</b> As these designs lose the benefit of operation without a continuous source of electricity, standing pilots are still used in some appliances. The exception is later model instantaneous (aka [...] "tankless") water heaters that use {{the flow of water}} to generate the current required to ignite the gas burner; these designs also use a thermocouple as a safety cut-off device in the event the gas fails to ignite, or if the flame is extinguished.|$|R
