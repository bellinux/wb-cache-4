50|$|The Trifinio {{biosphere}} reserve is located where El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras meet their border, thus the prefix tri in its name. It covers {{an area of}} 221 km2 and was created in 1987 to protect the Montecristo's cloud forest and its rare flora and fauna. The dense cloud forest of oak and laurel trees, that grow up to 30 meters, houses rare wildlife species like the two-fingered anteater, <b>striped</b> <b>owls,</b> toucans, agoutis. pumas and spider monkeys.|$|R
50|$|An {{estimated}} 432 {{species of}} mammals characterize the fauna {{of the continental}} U.S. There are more than 800 species of bird and more than 100,000 known species of insects. There are 311 known reptiles, 295 amphibians and 1154 known fish species in the U.S. Known animals that exist {{in all of the}} lower 48 states include white-tailed deer, bobcat, raccoon, muskrat, <b>striped</b> skunk, barn <b>owl,</b> American mink, American beaver, North American river otter and red fox. The red-tailed hawk {{is one of the most}} widely distributed hawks not only in the U.S., but in the Americas.|$|R
50|$|The Jamaican owl (Pseudoscops grammicus) is a {{medium-sized}} tawny colored owl that is endemic {{to the island}} of Jamaica. It is considered by some {{the only member of}} its genus Pseudoscops, while other authorities include in it the <b>striped</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|E
50|$|Birds include biguá (Phalacrocórax olivaceus), rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum), <b>striped</b> <b>owl</b> (Pseudoscops clamator), green {{kingfisher}} (Chloroceryle americana), {{great black}} hawk (Buteogallus urubitinga), roadside hawk (Rupornis magnirostris), dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), checkered woodpecker (Veniliornis mixtus), greater thornbird (Phacellodomus ruber), rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris) and straight-billed reedhaunter (Limnoctites rectirostris).Endangered birds include yellow cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata), Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) and Eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>owl</b> (Pseudoscops clamator) is a {{medium-sized}} owl with large ear tufts and a brownish-white facial disk rimmed with black. Its beak is black, {{and it has}} cinnamon-colored eyes. It has shorter, rounder wings than most of its close relatives. The upperparts are cinnamon with fine black vermiculation and heavy stripes. The underparts are pale tawny with dusky streaks. It is native to South America, and parts of Central America.|$|E
50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>owl</b> is a {{relatively}} large species with prominent tufts of elongated feathers on the crown resembling ears. It is 30 - 38 cm and weighs from 320 to 546 g. Its head, back, hot wings and tail are brown with black stripes and small markings while its underparts are buff-coloured with heavy black streaking on the breast. The facial disk is pure white with a thin black border.|$|E
50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>owl</b> is {{native to}} much of South and Central America. Its range is not well known, perhaps because it is nocturnal and not easily seen, but it is known from Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. It uses a variety of habitats, {{including}} riparian woodlands, marshes, savannahs, grassy open areas, and tropical rainforests. It can be found from sea level to 1600 m and above.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} of the species' bulk, prominent ear-tufts and barred plumage distinguishes it {{through much of the}} range, but it may be easily confused with the lesser or Magellanic horned owl (B. magellanicus), which may overlap in range. The Magellanic horned owl was once considered a subspecies of the great horned, but is now almost universally considered a distinct species, as is supported by genetic materials, with the great horned being the paraspecies. Overall coloration is similar, but the Magellanic is markedly smaller with smaller feet and a smaller head, with finer but more numerous brownish bars on the underside, rather than the blotchy irregular barring typical of great horned owls. Other eagle-owls may superficially be somewhat similar, but the species is generically allopatric with the exception of wintering snowy owls. More tropical species with ear tufts, the stygian owl (A. stygius) and <b>striped</b> <b>owl</b> (Pseudoscops clamator), are much smaller. Other large owls lack ear tufts ...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{report the}} {{biometric}} values and ultrasonographic {{aspects of the}} normal eye of the <b>Striped</b> <b>owl</b> (Rhinoptynx clamator). Sample population Twenty-seven healthy, free-living, adult Striped owls from the Ecological Park of Tiete Veterinary Ambulatory (Sao Paulo, Brazil). Procedures Both eyes of all owls underwent B-mode ultrasonographic examination and biometry was performed for lens axial length (WL), depth of the anterior (AC) and vitreous (VC) chambers, axial length of the globe (LB) and the pecten oculi (LP) of both eyes, using a 12 MHz probe. The owls were manually restrained without sedation and the eyes were topically anesthetized. Results Biometric and statistical findings were as follows: in the left eye, {{the means and standard}} deviations were: LB = 23. 76 +/- 0. 92 mm, WL = 7. 79 +/- 0. 27 mm, AC = 4. 27 +/- 0. 47 mm, VC = 11. 36 +/- 0. 29 mm and LP = 5. 69 +/- 0. 50 mm; in the right eye, the values were: LB = 24. 25 +/- 0. 79 mm, WL = 8. 03 +/- 0. 40 mm, AC = 4. 56 +/- 0. 52 mm, VC = 11. 40 +/- 0. 25 mm, and LP = 5. 68 +/- 0. 41 mm. No significant differences were found between left and right eyes measurements of LB, WL, AC, VC, and LP dimensions. Conclusions Ocular ultrasound aspects and biometric values of the <b>Striped</b> <b>owl</b> are reported. The study`s results provide means for various ocular measurements. The ultrasound is an easy and safe exam to be performed in the Striped owl`s eyes. FAPESP Sao Paulo Research Foundation[2005 / 00698 - 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractClinical, gross, and {{histopathology}} lesions {{and molecular}} characterization of Trichomonas spp. infection were described in two striped owls (Asio (Rhinoptynx) clamator), one American kestrel (Falco sparverius), two green-winged saltators (Saltator similis), {{and in a}} toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) from Brazil. These birds presented clinical signs including emaciation, ruffled feathers, abundant salivation and open mouth breathing presumably due to abundant caseous material. Gross lesions were characterized by multifocal yellow friable plaques {{on the surface of}} the tongue, pharynx and/or caseous masses partially occluding the laryngeal entrance. In the owls, the caseous material extended into the mandibular muscles and invaded the sinuses of the skull. Histopathologically, marked necrotic and inflammatory lesions were associated with numerous round to oval, pale eosinophilic structures (6 – 10 μm) with basophilic nuclei, consistent with trichomonads. Organisms similar to those described above also were found in the liver of the two green-winged saltators. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of trichomonosis in a <b>striped</b> <b>owl</b> and a toco toucan. Sequence analysis of the Trichomonas spp. internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS- 1) region and partial 5. 8 S of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) disclosed significant genetic diversity. Two sequences had 100 % identity to Trichomonas gallinae, whereas two sequences had a 99 % and 92 % identity to a Trichomonas vaginalis-like sequence, respectively. One sequence (green-winged saltator 502 - 08) had a 100 % identity to a newly recognized genus Simplicomonas...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the species composition, relative abundance, habitat use, and seasonal variability of raptor assemblages in the Flooding Pampas of Argentina, {{which represents the}} southeastern part of the biome known as the Rio de la Plata Grasslands. We conducted seasonal roadside surveys to detect raptors in modified and natural habitats over a 3 -yr period from spring 2006 through autumn 2009. We classified raptor species according to their relative abundances and occurrence frequencies, and compared the assemblage composition among land-cover types (croplands, grazing fields, periurban areas, and grasslands) and seasons. The raptor assemblage in the Flooding Pampas comprised 16 species, representing approximately 43 % of all raptor species in the biome. The Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) was the dominant species in all land-cover types and seasons. The Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus), American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), and Roadside Hawk (Rupornis magnirostris) were all abundant and very frequently observed species, whereas Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus), and Long-winged Harrier (Circus buffoni) were less abundant but recorded during most surveys. The remaining raptors (Aplomado Falcon [Falco femoralis], Cinereous Harrier [Circus cinereus], Short-eared Owl [Asio flammeus], Sharp-shinned Hawk [Accipiter striatus], and Snail Kite [Rostrhamus sociabilis]) were much less abundant in the study area. We also recorded four other raptor species (Variable Hawk [Geranoaetus polyosoma], Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle [G. melanoleucus], <b>Striped</b> <b>Owl</b> [Asio clamator], and Barn Owl [Tyto alba]), but only outside of the standard transect surveys. Species composition differed among land-cover types, but we detected no distinct overall seasonal patterns except that species diversity indices were lower in autumn and especially, spring. Milvago chimango was important to determine similarity in assemblage composition within land-cover types, but other less abundant species, such as C. plancus, A. cunicularia, and R. magnirostris, were more important to differentiate land-cover types based on raptor composition. Species diversity was highest in grazing fields and grasslands, and lowest in periurban areas. Our results suggest that although some raptor species appear to benefit from land-cover patterns in the study area, man...|$|E
