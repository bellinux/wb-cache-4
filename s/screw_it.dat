500|$|By May 1972, Bushnell and Dabney quit Nutting Associates {{and moved}} to {{incorporate}} Syzygy Engineering; they instead named it Atari due to another company with a similar name. Bushnell later stated that he was encouraged {{by the success of}} Computer Space in regards to future game ideas, as he had never before created something that made so much money, and additionally felt that his time at Nutting gave him confidence in running his own company because he [...] "couldn't <b>screw</b> <b>it</b> up more than they did". Nutting Associates did not make any further Computer Space games before closing in 1976. Bushnell's enthusiasm was soon substantiated, as Atari's first game, Pong, went on to substantially greater success than Computer Space. Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release {{marked the beginning of the}} commercial video game industry.|$|E
500|$|Consulting {{producer}} Gail Mutrux recommended {{feature film}} director Gary Fleder to direct [...] "Subway" [...] because she believed he would provide visually engaging direction without distracting {{from the story}} in the script. Other Homicide: Life on the Street producers were not familiar with Fleder. When Mutrux told them the name of one of his previous films, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Yoshimura became concerned Fleder was [...] "one of these indie kind of guys [...] {{going to come in and}} try to reinvent our show", a problem he had experienced with other directors in the past. After watching Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, however, Yoshimura believed Fleder would be perfect to direct [...] "Subway" [...] because he felt that Fleder could provide strong visuals to a story that took place in one location, and prevent the script from becoming too static and boring. Upon being offered the job, Fleder thought that it would be a challenge due to most of the action being confined to a single set, but accepted the director position based on the strength of Yoshimura's script:, [...] "The script was terrific. And for me, the big issue from day one was, 'How do I not <b>screw</b> <b>it</b> up?'" [...] Yoshimura said that feature directors often struggle with Homicide: Life on the Street because they are used to working at a slower and more deliberate pace than the typical eight-day filming period of a single episode. Additionally, Yoshimura said, they have little time to adjust to the regular cast and crew, which he described as a [...] "closed community [...] used to shooting or working a certain way on this show, and then have their rhythms and their patterns and their habits".|$|E

Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really."

As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them.

2500|$|Many {{different}} {{variants of}} the hamburger {{have been created}} over the years, {{some of which have}} become very popular. Much of this diversity has been the product of other restaurant chains that have tried to reproduce the success of McDonald's and White Castle, while others served to influence McDonald's. An example of a restaurant that influenced McDonald's and its imitators is Big Boy, which was first opened in 1936 by Bob Wian in Glendale, California and became known in that locale as Bob's Big Boy. It was at this restaurant that a major hamburger variant, the double deck cheeseburger, with two beef patties, was first made. Wian's creation was distinctively served by Big Boy restaurants with the bun sliced twice, the center slice—known as the club section—separating the two patties. The chain also popularized the drive-in restaurant format, taken and simplified by McDonald's type fast food operators. By the 1960s, Big Boy had expanded throughout the United States and Canada. Despite the benefits it provided to Wian, the chain was sold along with the rights to their signature Big Boy hamburger to the Marriott Corporation in 1967. This same year McDonald's franchisee Jim Delligatti, created an imitation of the Big Boy — the Big Mac.'This wasn’t like discovering the lightbulb,' Mr. Delligatti later told the Los Angeles Times.
