40|$|A test to {{evaluate}} {{constraints on the}} evolution of single microsatellite loci is described. The test assumes that microsatellite alleles that share the same flanking sequence constitute a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>alleles</b> with a common descent that is distinct from alleles with a mutation in the flanking sequence. Thus two or more different <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>alleles</b> at a given locus represent the outcomes of different evolutionary processes. The higher rate of mutations within the repeat region (10 (- 3) or 10 (- 4)) compared with that of insertion/deletion or point mutations in adjacent flanking regions (10 (- 9)) or with that of recombination between the repeat and the point mutation (10 (- 6) for sequences 100 bp long) provides the rationale for this assumption. Using a two-phase, stepwise mutation model we simulated the evolution of a number of independent <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>alleles</b> and constructed the distributions of two similarity indices between pairs of these allele series. Applying this approach to empirical data from locus AG 2 H 46 of Anopheles gambiae resulted in a significant excess of similarity between the main and the null series, indicating that constraints affect allele distribution in this locus.

A null mutation leads to mid-gestation lethality [1 â€“ 4], obscuring the later roles of the gene in organogenesis. We have generated a multi-purpose gene alteration by combining the potential for homologous and site-specific recombination in a single targeting vector, and using the selectable marker for neomycin-resistance, neo, to downregulate gene activity.

While early branching species (e. g. E. raikovi) show a mating-type determination at a single mat locus in accord with Mendelian genetics, late branching species (e. g.

40|$|The FHIT gene is inactivated {{early in}} the {{development}} of many human tumors, and Fhit-deficient mice have increased cancer incidence. Viral reexpression of Fhit kills Fhit-deficient cells by induction of apoptosis. Fhit, a member of branch 2 of the histidine-triad superfamily of nucleoside monophosphate hydrolases and transferases, is a diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolase, the active-site histidine of which is not required for tumor suppression. To provide a rigorous test of the hypothesis that Fhit function depends on forming a complex with substrates, we designed a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>alleles</b> of Fhit intended to reduce substrate-binding and/or hydrolytic rates, characterized these mutants biochemically, and then performed quantitative cell-death assays on cancer cells virally infected with each allele. The allele series covered defects as great as 100, 000 -fold in kcat and increases as large as 30 -fold in KM. Nonetheless, when mutant FHIT genes were expressed in two human cancer cell lines containing FHIT deletions, reductions in apoptotic activity correlated exclusively with KM. Mutants with 2 - and 7 -fold increases in KM significantly reduced apoptotic indices, whereas the mutant with a 30 -fold increase in KM retained little cellular function. These data indicate that the proapoptotic function of Fhit is limited by substrate binding and is unrelated to substrate hydrolysis...|$|E

Molecular genetic approach {{is expected to}} help the breeder in identification of mungbean varieties in more detail and to protect intellectual property right. This study aimed to identify Indonesian mungbean varieties based on DNA fingerprint profile using a marker set to support morphological characters. A total of 22 Indonesian mungbean accessions were characterized based on 21 morphological traits and 55 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) primers. Of the total 22 mungbean varieties {{used in the present}} study, 16 varieties were improved varieties and remaining six varieties were local varieties originated from Java, Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi collected in GeneBank of ICABIOGRAD. The results showed that the 21 morphological characters were not sufficient to differentiate 22 mungbean varieties, while SSR analysis revealed that eight multi-alleles markers and high polymorphic information content (PIC) values have been successfully selected for varietal identification. The selected markers enabled to differentiate each mungbean variety according to their genetic marker with the lowest distance of 0. 125, demonstrating the robustness of the selected marker set as a tool to identify a specific DNA fingerprint profile as a varietal identity (ID).

40|$|The grasses {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important families of plants since they constitute our major crops and pastures and dominate many natural ecosystems. Self-incompatibility (SI) is widespread in the grasses and is under the control of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>alleles</b> at each of two unlinked loci, S and Z. Specification of the pollen grain is gametophytic and depends upon the combination of S and Z alleles in the pollen grain. Both of these must be matched in the pistil for the pollen grain to be incompatible. Several lines of research suggest that this two-locus SI system is shared by all grass species of the Pooideae and possibly by the entire Graminae. Firstly, genetic studies demonstrated the presence of the S-Z system in the Triticeae, the Poeae and Avenae. Secondly, linkage analyses showed common markers linked to the S-gene in grass species from all three tribes. Recent molecular studies revealed remarkable synteny of chromosomes and conservation of gene order within the Poaceae. Molecular markers have also been used to confirm syntenous localization of S and Z in several species. Despite the complexity of the grass incompatibility system relative to that in other families, the detailed genetic and physical maps for the crop species in the Triticeae and the availability of large insert libraries and mutations at the incompatibility loci, makes this a particularly promising family for molecular studies.

Together, these data indicate that phosphorylation can regulate Bim by multiple mechanisms and that the phosphorylation of Bim on different sites can contribute to the sensitivity of cellular apoptotic responses...|$|R

The seedling genotype was determined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA with universal and specific primers and the phenotype by pollen tube growth.

The originally defined specificities of the system, usually identified by a microcytotoxicity assay on peripheral blood lymphocytes, are controlled by the alleles of three closely linked loci HLA-A, B and C. These loci are highly polymorphic with at least 19 A alleles, 26 B alleles and 5 C alleles defined. There is extensive cross reaction amongst the determinants controlled by each locus, though not usually between loci.

This new allele cosegregated within an extended kindred with reduced TPMT activity. We attempted to determine the mechanism(s) by which the presence of TPMT* 4 might result in low enzyme activity. Although very few mature transcripts derived from allele TPMT* 4 were detected, the mutation did lead to generation of at least two aberrant mRNA species. The first resulted from use of a novel splice site located one nucleotide 3 ' downstream from the original splice junction. That mRNA species contained a single nucleotide deletion and a frameshift within exon 10, the terminal exon of the gene. The second novel mRNA species resulted from activation of a cryptic splice site located within intron 9, leading to inclusion of 330 nucleotides of intron sequence.

Here we report five SLC 45 A 2 mutations. The 106 delT mutation in the chicken S*AL allele results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon and the corresponding mRNA appears to be degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. A splice-site mutation in the Japanese quail AL*A allele causes in-frame skipping of exon 4. Two independent missense mutations (Tyr 277 Cys and Leu 347 Met) were associated with the Silver allele in chicken. The functional significance of the former mutation, associated only with Silver in White Leghorn, is unclear. Ala 72 Asp was associated with the cinnamon allele (AL*C) in the Japanese quail. The most interesting feature concerning the SLC 45 A 2 variants documented in this study is the specific inhibition of expression of red pheomelanin in Silver chickens.

Sequencing technologies that generate long reads, including transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing, can capture entire haploblocks in a single read.

Using F ST and Q ST comparisons, we compare variation at DOG 1 with neutral markers and quantitative variation in seed dormancy. Patterns of genetic differentiation among populations suggest that the gene DOG 1 contributes to local adaptation.

Biochemical analyses demonstrated that EF-G Q 495 P, G 502 D, and delta 608 - 703 were not disrupted in guanine nucleotide binding but were deficient in ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis and guanine nucleotide-dependent ribosome association.

One such example in rice is the occurrence of varying degrees of apiculus coloration due to anthocyanin pigmentation, which was previously reported {{to be caused by}} a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>alleles</b> at the C locus. The present study reveals, on the basis of comparison of its maps, that the C gene appears to be the rice homolog (OsC 1) of maize C 1, which belongs to the group of R 2 R 3 -Myb factors. Two different types of deletions causing a frameshift were detected in the third exon, and both of the deleted nucleotides corresponded to the positions of putative base-contacting residues, suggesting that the Indica and Japonica types carry loss-of-function mutations with independent origins. In addition, replacement substitutions were frequently detected in OsC 1 of strains carrying the previously defined C alleles. Molecular population analysis revealed that 17 haplotypes were found in 39 wild and cultivated rices, and the haplotypes of most cultivated forms could be classified into one of three distinct groups, with few shared haplotypes among taxa, including Indica and Japonica types. The genealogy of the OsC 1 gene suggests that allelic diversification causing phenotypic change might have resulted from mutations in the coding region rather than from recombination between preexisting alleles. The McDonald and Kreitman test revealed that the changes in amino acids might be associated with selective forces acting on the lineage of group A whose haplotypes were carried by most Asian cultivated forms.

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{isolation}} of a new P-element-induced allele of the vestigial locus vg(2 a 33), the molecular characterization of which allows us to propose a unifying explanation of the phenotypes of {{the large number of}} vestigial P-element alleles that now exists. The first P-element allele of vestigial to be isolated was vg(21), which results in a very weak mutant wing phenotype that is suppressed in the P cytotype. By destabilizing vg(2 a 33) in a dysgenic cross, we isolated the vg(2 a 33) allele, which exhibits a moderate mutant wing phenotype and is not suppressed by the P cytotype. The new allele is characterized by a 46 -bp deletion that removes the 3 '-proximal copy of the 11 -bp internal repeat from the P element of vg(21). To understand how this subtle difference between the two alleles leads to a rather pronounced difference in their phenotypes, we mapped both the vg and P-element transcription units present in wild type and mutants. Using both 5 '-RACE and S 1 protection, we found that P-element transcription is initiated 19 bp farther upstream than previously thought. Using primer extension, the start of vg transcription was determined to lie 435 bp upstream of the longest cDNA recovered to date and upstream of the P-element insertion site. Our discovery that the P element is situated within the first vg exon has prompted a reassessment of the large body of genetic data on a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>alleles</b> derived from vg(21). Our current hypothesis to explain the degree of variation in the mutant phenotypes and their response to the P repressor invokes a critical RNA secondary structure in the vg transcript, the formation of which is hindered by a readthrough transcript initiated at the P-element promoter...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} mutational and {{revertant}} analysis {{to study the}} elements of the 54 -nucleotide COX 2 5 '-untranslated leader involved in translation initiation in yeast mitochondria and in activation by the COX 2 translational activator, Pet 111 p. We generated a collection of mutants with substitutions spanning the entire COX 2 5 '-UTL by in vitro mutagenesis followed by mitochondrial transformation and gene replacement. The phenotypes of these mutants delimit a 31 -nucleotide segment, from - 16 to - 46, that contains several short sequence elements necessary for COX 2 5 '-UTL function in translation. The sequences from - 16 to - 47 were shown to be partially sufficient to promote translation in a foreign context. Analysis of revertants <b>of</b> both the <b>series</b> <b>of</b> linker-scanning <b>alleles</b> and two short deletion/insertion alleles has refined the positions of several possible functional elements of the COX 2 5 '-untranslated leader, including a putative RNA stem-loop structure that functionally interacts with Pet 111 p and an octanucleotide sequence present in all S. cerevisiae mitochondrial mRNA 5 '-UTLs that is a potential rRNA binding site...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a developmental, genetic, and molecular {{analysis of the}} sole Drosophila member of the BAG family of genes, which is implicated in stress response and survival in mammalian cells. We show that the gene, termed starvin (stv), is expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, accumulating primarily in tendon cells following germ-band retraction and later in somatic muscles and the esophagus during embryonic stage 15. We show that stv expression falls within known tendon and muscle cell transcriptional regulatory cascades, being downstream of stripe, but not of another tendon transcriptional regulator, delilah, and downstream of the muscle regulator, mef- 2. We generated a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> stv <b>alleles</b> and, surprisingly, given the muscle and tendon-specific embryonic expression of stv, found that the gross morphology and function of somatic muscles is normal in stv mutants. Nonetheless, stv mutant larvae exhibit a striking and fully penetrant mutant phenotype of failure to grow after hatching and a severely impaired ability to take up food. Our study provides the first report of an essential, developmentally regulated BAG-family gene...|$|R
