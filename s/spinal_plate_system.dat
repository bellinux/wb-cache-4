40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} use of {{a surgical}} technique commonly used in humans for treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) in dogs. DESIGN Prospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs with CSM (n= 10). METHODS Dogs weighing > 30 kg that had CSM at 1 vertebral articulation were eligible for inclusion. Dogs had vertebral column distraction/fusion performed using a cortical ring allograft, cancellous autograft, and a <b>spinal</b> locking <b>plate.</b> Dogs were evaluated temporally by repeat neurological examinations and by client perception of postsurgical outcome, determined by telephone interview. RESULTS Nine dogs survived the immediate postoperative period. Seven of 8 dogs had moderate to complete improvement without recurrence (mean follow-up, 2. 48 years). The most common postsurgical complications were screw loosening (n= 4) and plate shifting (2), neither of which required surgical revision. One dog had pseudoarthrosis that may have negatively impacted outcome. CONCLUSION Treatment of single level CSM in dogs with ring allograft and a <b>spinal</b> locking <b>plate</b> <b>system</b> may lead to successful outcomes. The major problems encountered with included cost of the implants and adjusting the system designed for humans to fit the vertebral column of a dog. CLINICAL RELEVANCE For dogs with CSM at a single level, the {{use of a}} <b>spinal</b> locking <b>plate</b> in combination with a cortical ring allograft can be an effective surgical treatment. Costs of the implants as well as anatomic differences in dogs make this type of surgery less appealing...|$|R

50|$|Zhang Haidi {{was born}} in September 1955 in Jinan, Shandong Province. She became a {{paraplegic}} at age five.

50|$|According to {{specimens}} examined {{from the}} Taemas-Wee Jasper region of New South Wales in Australia, both L. broilii and L. herolfi have tubercles of the median dorsal plate coalesce into a distinct median dorsal ridge (MDR). The fusion of the tubercles {{is unique to}} Lunaspis in the order Petalichthyida, where other devonian fish in this order have ornament tubercles that are separately occurring. The maximum height of the ridge is reached before the posterior margin of the median dorsal <b>plate.</b> The <b>spinal</b> <b>plates</b> are curved and are the wings off of the center part of the bony armoring. They have many small spines along the anterior ridge of <b>spinal</b> <b>plates.</b> The ornament ridges on the bony plates make it easily distinguishable from other petalichtyid fish. These ornament ridges are widely spaced and continuous in the Lunaspis, across the three species; in L. broilii, the ornaments are more densely packed than L. heroldi and L. prumiensis.|$|R

40|$|Although {{anterior}} cervical instrumentation {{was initially}} used in cervical trauma, because of obvious benefits, indications {{for its use}} have been expanded over time to degenerative cases as well as tumor and infection of the cervical spine. Along with a threefold increase in incidence of cervical fusion surgery, implant designs have evolved {{over the last three}} decades. Observation of graft subsidence and phenomenon of stress shielding {{led to the development of}} the new generation dynamic anterior cervical <b>plating</b> <b>systems.</b> Anterior cervical <b>plating</b> does not conclusively improve clinical outcome of the patients, but certainly enhances the efficacy of autograft and allograft fusion and lessens the rate of pseudoarthrosis and kyphosis after multilevel discectomy and fusions. A review of biomechanics, surgical technique, indications, complications and results of various anterior cervical <b>plating</b> <b>systems</b> is presented here to enable clinicians to select the appropriate construct design.

30|$|In this study, the {{incidence}} of plate fracture was shown to be significantly different between groups (Fig.  2). Although bicortical screws increase the stability of fixation after BSSRO, they increase the stress on the condyle [23]. Accordingly, mini-plate fixation is recommended for TMD patients [24]. As condylar position may influence post-operative occlusal stability, early removal of fixation is helpful for correcting occlusal discrepancies [25]. However, the mono-cortical absorbable <b>plate</b> <b>system</b> shows higher incidence of plate fracture compared to the bi-cortical plate fixation group [26]. When comparing the conventional absorbable <b>plate</b> <b>system</b> to the hybrid fixation <b>system,</b> <b>plate</b> fracture is observed only in the conventional absorbable <b>plate</b> <b>system</b> [27].|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the time-course changes in {{condylar}} long-axis and skeletal stability after sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) with an unsintered hydroxyapatite (u-HA) /poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) plate, PLLA plate, or titanium plate. Patients and Methods: Of 60 Japanese patients diagnosed with mandibular prognathism, 20 underwent SSRO with a u-HA/PLLA <b>plate</b> <b>system,</b> 20 underwent SSRO with a PLLA <b>plate</b> <b>system,</b> and 20 underwent SSRO with a conventional titanium <b>plate</b> <b>system.</b> The time-course changes in condylar long-axis and skeletal stability were assessed by use of axial, frontal, and lateral cephalograms. Results: Compared with the u-HA/PLLA group, the titanium group showed a significantly greater change in the right condyle angle between initially and 1 month (P =. 0105) and intercondylar axes angle between 1 and 3 months (P =. 0013). The PLLA group showed a significantly greater change than the titanium group (P =. 0043) and u-HA/PLLA group (P =. 0002) in terms of ramus inclination between 1 and 3 months; however, there were no significant differences among the 3 groups in the other measurements for each time interval. Conclusion: This study suggests that there are no significant differences in postoperative time-course changes among a u-HA/PLLA <b>plate</b> <b>system,</b> PLLA <b>plate</b> <b>system,</b> and conventional titanium <b>plate</b> <b>system.</b> © 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons...|$|R
50|$|B. canis is a {{zoonotic}} organism. Signs of {{this disease}} are different in both genders of dogs; females that have B. canis infections face an abortion of their developed fetuses. Males face the chance of infertility, because they develop an antibody against the sperm. This may be followed by inflammation of the testes which generally settles down a while after. Symptoms do not only include testicular inflammation, infertility in males, and abortion in females. Another symptom is the infection of the <b>spinal</b> <b>plates</b> or vertebrae, which is called diskospondylitis.|$|R
