40|$|Abstract Background Experimental evidences {{demonstrate}} that <b>vegetable</b> derived <b>extracts</b> inhibit cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. To further explore the mechanisms behind, we modeled duodenal contents with several <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> Results By employing a widely used cholesterol quantification method {{based on a}} cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase coupled reaction we analyzed the effects on cholesterol partition. Evidenced interferences were analyzed by studying specific and unspecific inhibitors of cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase coupled reaction. Cholesterol was also quantified by LC/MS. We found a significant interference of diverse (cocoa and tea-derived) extracts over this method. The interference was strongly dependent on model matrix: while as in phosphate buffered saline, the development of unspecific fluorescence was inhibitable by catalase (but not by heat denaturation), suggesting <b>vegetable</b> <b>extract</b> derived H 2 O 2 production, in bile-containing model systems, this interference also comprised cholesterol-oxidase inhibition. Several strategies, such as cholesterol standard addition and use of suitable blanks containing <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> were tested. When those failed, {{the use of a}} mass-spectrometry based chromatographic assay allowed quantification of cholesterol in models of duodenal contents in the presence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> Conclusions We propose that the use of cholesterol-oxidase and/or peroxidase based systems for cholesterol analyses in foodstuffs should be accurately monitored, as important interferences in all the components of the enzymatic chain were evident. The use of adequate controls, standard addition and finally, chromatographic analyses solve these issues. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of ethanol extracts of some organically and conventionally grown leafy vegetables. Methods: The ethanol extracts of kailan (Brassica alboglabra), bayam (Amaranthus spp.) and sawi (Brassica parachinensis) were tested for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total anthocyanin content (TAC) and the antioxidant {{capacity of the}} extracts measured using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay. Results: In TPC test, sawi extract showed the highest phenolic content while bayam contained the least phenolic content for both organically and conventionally grown types. In TFC test, organically grown sawi extract showed the highest flavonoid content, while organically grown kailan extract showed the least flavonoid content among all types of vegetables. The flavonoid content of the conventionally grown types of <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> was the highest in kalian and the least in sawi. For 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, the activity increased with the increasing concentration of each extract. All conventionally grown <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> showed higher antioxidant activity compared to their organically grown counterparts. Extracts of conventionally grown sawi showed the highest percentage inhibition followed by conventionally grown kailan and organically grown sawi. There were no correlation between TPC, TFC, TAC and IC 25 of both organically and conventionally grown vegetables. However, there was a correlation between TAC and IC 25 of conventionally grown <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> The results showed relatively similar polyphenol content between organically and conventionally grown <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> However, the conventionally grown <b>vegetables</b> <b>extracts</b> generally have higher antioxidant activity compared to the organically grown extracts. Conclusions: These results suggested that {{the different types of}} agricultural practice had a significant contribution to the polyphenol content and antioxidant activity in the vegetables...|$|R

40|$|An {{appropriate}} way to control cancer is chemoprevention as {{a large number of}} compounds have been observed to prevent the occurrence of cancer and variety of mechanisms exists for producing such protective effects. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that diets rich in vegetables are associated with a decreased risk of cancer. Chemoprevention involves the use of natural or laboratory made substances to prevent cancer or reduce risk cancer. The E 6 oncoprotein from oncogenic Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) has exhibit functions in tumorigenesis, regulation of transcriptions and apoptosis. E 6 product from oncogenic viral type like HPV 16 can bind the tumor suppressor p 53 and promotes its degradation. In the present study, 80 crude methanol and water extracts obtained from 40 selected vegetables were screened and evaluated for their cytotoxic and anti-human papillomavirus 16 E 6 activities. The cytotoxic effect of the varying concentrations of both methanol and water <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> (0, 1, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/ml) against cervical cancer-derived, HeLa and CaSki cells and normal cell-derived, MRC 5 (human lung fibroblast) cells were evaluated using the in vitro neutral red cytotoxic assay. The IC 50 values for each <b>vegetable</b> <b>extract</b> was determined. The results indicated that the percentage of killing increased with the increasing concentration of extracts tested. Overall, the crude methanol <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> showed greater inhibition against the growth of cervical cancer-derived cell lines, HeLa and CaSki cells. The methanolic <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> exerted signs of cell-type selectivity against cervical cancer-derived cell lines where 29 extracts were active against CaSki. However, only 7 extracts were effective in inhibiting the growth of HeLa cells. Twenty <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts,</b> both methanol and water extracts of Asparagus officinalis, Beta vulgaris, Ipomea batatas, Manihot esculentus, Pachyrrizus erosus,Petroselium crispum, Phaseolus vulgaris, Portulaca oleracea, Sesbania grandiflora, and Solanum tuberosum were analyzed qualitatively at various concentrations (0, 1, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/ml) for their anti-HPV 16 E 6 in HPV 16 containing, cervical cancer-derived cell line, CaSki. Immunocytochemistry technique was carried out to analyze the expression of HPV 16 E 6 oncoprotein in CaSki cells treated with varying amounts of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> The results indicated that methanolic extracts of Phaseolus vulgaris suppression of E 6 oncoprotein in CaSki cells which increased in cells treated independently with increasing concentrations of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> Generally, the crude water extracts were most effective in suppressing the expression of HPV 16 E 6 oncoprotein in CaSki cells. The {{results of the present study}} indicated that out of the 40 selected vegetables screened, Portulaca oleracea (Beremi) and Beta vulgaris (Beetroot) showed significant cytotoxic effects and anti-HPV 16 E 6 activities in CaSki cells. These findings suggest that some of the vegetables may tested have great potential to be exploited for effective chemoprevention and as anti-HPV 16 E 6 agent in the control of cervical cancer...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} compares {{antioxidant}} activities, total phenolic content (TPC), vitamin C content, and antiglycemic properties of Momordica charantia (small bitter gourd) and Moringa oleifera (drumstick leaves) {{before and after}} subjecting to boiling and microwave heating for different durations. Both cooking methods enhanced the antioxidant activity and vitamin C content in the vegetables studied when cooked for five minutes and these properties declined when the cooking time was prolonged to 20 minutes. Cooking also retained or slightly improved the α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition activity of the vegetables; however, it reduced {{the ability of the}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> to inhibit α-amylase enzyme activity. The antioxidant activities were positively correlated with the TPC and vitamin C content in the <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> tested. The present study also evaluated the insulin-like properties (stimulation of adipogenesis) of selected <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> (five minutes microwaved). 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes treated with small bitter gourd extract significantly stimulated lipogenesis (in the absence of insulin) compared to drumstick leaves. Thus, the finding of this study negates the belief that cooking will reduce the nutritional value of the vegetables and also suggested that appropriate cooking method and duration for different vegetables could be selected to improve or preserve their nutritional value...|$|R

The use of <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> to increase shelf life is a promising new frontier {{in the prevention of}} oxidation. In this study the efficacy on lipid and protein oxidation was evaluated in chicken meat mixed with conventional methanol/water and supercritical extracts of Echinacea angustifolia after cooking and at different times of cold storage in order to propose these matrices as natural substances to increase the shelf-life of meat products. Echinacea spp. are native to North America and were traditionally used by the Indian tribes for a variety of diseases, including mouth sores, colds and snakebites. The three most commonly used Echinacea spp. are Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallida and Echinacea purpurea.
