5000|$|The {{sternocostal joints}} {{also known as}} sternochondral joints (or costosternal articulations), are {{synovial}} plane joints of the cartilages of the true ribs with the sternum, {{with the exception of}} the first, which is a <b>synarthrosis</b> since the cartilage is directly united with the sternum. The ligaments connecting them are: ...|$|E
50|$|The xiphisternal joint (or xiphisternal synchondrosis) is a {{location}} {{near the bottom}} of the sternum, where the body of the sternum and the xiphoid process meet. It is structurally classified as a synchondrosis, and functionally classified as a <b>synarthrosis.</b> This joint can remain until the middle years of life, but usually ossifies to form a synostosis between the two sternal elements.|$|E
40|$|Acetazolamide dysmelia was induced in rat embryos {{by giving}} drug to mothers during days 9, 10 and 11 of pregnancy. With {{appropriate}} technique 100 per cent of deformed young could be produced. Individual anomalies were {{made up of}} one or more of 5 basic malformations—dislocation, reduction and supernumerary defects, syndactyly and <b>synarthrosis.</b> Right forepaws were invariably, left forepaws were less frequently and hindpaws were rarely involved. Most paws showed a postaxial to preaxial sequential involvement of digits, but on occasions digit 4 was more severely affected than the fifth digit. In all but 5 of 94 bilateral defects right forepaw lesions were of equal or greater severity than left forepaw lesions. The number of deformed paws and probably the severity of the paw defects were linearly related to drug dosage. Digital ray defects were accompanied by defects in the carpal bones and ulna of matching severity. During the phase of acute intoxication following drug treatment mothers lost weight and this was linearly related to the amount of drug given. The full term weight of foetuses was depressed in proportion to drug dosage but the drug displayed little if any embryolethal effect...|$|E
40|$|There {{are a lot}} {{of reports}} and reviews about osteonecrosis of the talus (ONT), yet reports about the animal model of ONT to {{evaluate}} proper therapeutic approaches are rarely heard. In our study, a novel animal model was established. Pure ethanol was injected into the cancellous bone of sheep's talus. Macroscopic observation, X-ray, CT and histology were performed at two, four, 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively. It was revealed that the trabeculae of talar head began to change their structure after two weeks postoperatively compared to the normal talus. The ONT was obvious {{at the end of the}} fourth week, and their outstanding feature was the damage of trabeculae bone and formation of cavities. CT scans and pathological changes of the subjects all showed characteristics of the early stage of osteonecrosis, also the sections of the specimens confirmed necrosis of tali. By 12 weeks, the phenomenon of necrosis still existed but fibrous tissue proliferated prominently and bone reconstruction appeared in certain area. Most specimens (3 / 4) got late stage necrosis which presented as <b>synarthrosis</b> in X-ray and mass proliferation of fibrous tissue in histology at the end of 24 weeks. The novel animal model of ONT was successful, and it is inclined to deteriorate without any intervention. The study provides us a new way to evaluate various treatments on ONT in laboratory, which may eventually pave way to clinical applications. </p...|$|E
