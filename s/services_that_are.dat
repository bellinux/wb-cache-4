5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and <b>services</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E

25|$|Meretz is {{also one}} of the more left-wing parties in terms of {{economic}} policy. The party seeks to create a welfare state with broad-reaching social <b>services</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> effectively regulated and monitored.

25|$|Unlike modern {{websites}} {{and online}} <b>services</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial data centers, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home.

Only larger BBSes with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a LAN connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.|$|E

25|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{may result in}} decreasing international funds to UNRWA, and UNRWA may be pushed towards reducing its services.

UNRWA is a main service provider for Palestinian refugees in host countries. It provides jobs for thousands of refugees, education, health care, and various other <b>services</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> extremely valuable and necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} layer establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes process-to-process connectivity, meaning it provides end-to-end <b>services</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{independent of the}} structure of user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers).
