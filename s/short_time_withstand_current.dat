Predominantly, 2 - 3 persons have to be protected against the attack by hand guns and hand grenade and enable a counter attack from this safe area. The ballistic protection was established by a multitude of textiles layers made out of aramid fibres. The fibre weaving applying various methods, treatment by lamination and their combination was optimized by measuring the energy reduction of various layers to achieve best resistance against {{the impact of the}} selected ammunition. For the inflation of the ballistic package new approaches for the gas generator formulation and manufacturing techniques were investigated and successfully tested. This new composition combined pyrotechnic hot gas production with ablative cooling to provide cool gases for safely deploying the folded protecting shield stabilized by inflated tubular structure. Finally, all components were combined in a demonstrator which was tested on a shooting range. The results showed that the ballistic shield deployed in a <b>short</b> <b>time</b> and <b>withstood</b> the demanded impact of bullets, fragments and blasts according to the specifications. The current weight of the ballistic package has still to be reduced for which effective proposals are to be made...|$|R

40|$|Power devices {{intended}} for high-voltage systems must be tested according to international standards, {{which includes the}} short-time <b>withstand</b> <b>current</b> test and peak <b>withstand</b> <b>current</b> test. However, these tests require very special facilities which consume huge amounts of electrical power. Therefore, mathematical tools to simulate such tests are highly appealing since they allow reproducing the electromagnetic and thermal behavior of the test object in a fast and economical manner. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element method (3 D-FEM) approach to simulate the transient thermal behavior of substation connectors is presented and validated against experimental data. To this end, a multiphysics 3 D-FEM method is proposed, which considers both the connector and the reference power conductors. The transient and steady-state temperature profiles of both the conductors and connector provided by the 3 D-FEM method prove its suitability and accuracy as compared to experimental data provided by short-circuit tests conducted in two high-current laboratories. The proposed simulation tool, which was proven to be accurate and realistic, may be particularly useful during the design and optimization phases of substation connectors since it allows anticipating the results of mandatory laboratory tests.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to study the individual and combined effects of current velocity and substratum composition on the waterlouse Asellus aquaticus (L.). Both factors affected growth, mortality, behavior, and food consumption of A. aquaticus. Short-term effects of increasing current velocity depended {{on the type of}} substratum. Critical current velocity for detachment was almost the same on sand as on a polished surface whereas on gravel A. aquaticus could <b>withstand</b> higher <b>current</b> velocities by hiding in interstitial spaces. Long-term experiments with different combinations of current velocity and substratum composition showed that current velocity had a greater effect than substratum on survival and growth. Substratum, however, had a greater influence on the distribution of individuals in the experimental units. Since growth was reduced at high current velocity and no changes in levels of food intake were observed it is concluded that a substantial amount of energy is required for <b>withstanding</b> <b>current</b> at higher flow rates. Furthermore, mortality showed a strong inverse correlation to growth. The interaction of effects of natural habitat factors may be better understood using an experimental and modeling approach focusing on energy budgets...|$|R

40|$|Armoured {{vehicles}} {{have traditionally}} used steel armour as protection against penetrators such as projectiles and shaped charge jets. The latter produce a thin stretching metal jet, usually of copper, with a tip velocity of about 7 - 8 km/s. In {{order to obtain}} more weight-efficient solutions, there is a search for lighter materials and other protection techniques. In this thesis, ceramic and electromagnetic armours are studied. Ceramic materials are lighter than steel, and their high compressive strength makes them useful as armour materials. Electromagnetic armour consists of two metal plates connected to an electric power supply capable of delivering a strong current pulse. A conductive penetrator passing through both plates is destroyed by {{the effects of the}} resulting current. Tests of the ceramic armour materials alumina and boron carbide were performed with reverse impact technique, which signifies that a target assembly (ceramic confined in a metal cylinder) was launched by a gun towards a projectile placed in front of the gun barrel. By this technique yaw was eliminated, but the geometric scale had to be very small. Therefore, we studied scaling laws for ceramic armour through a series of tests with direct impact technique and projectile diameters from 2 to 10 mm. The small scale has the advantage that flash X-ray photography can be used to photograph the projectile inside the ceramic target. The phenomenon of interface defeat or dwell was also demonstrated. It signifies that the ceramic, at least for a <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> can <b>withstand</b> the impact pressure so that the projectile just flows out onto the target surface. A transition velocity, above which dwell does not occur, was determined. Simulations were performed with the continuum-dynamic code Autodyn and by use of a model for the brittle ceramic materials by Johnson and Holmquist. The simulations reasonably well represented the penetration behaviour above the transition velocity. They also did below, if under this condition the ceramic model was forced to remain undamaged. The performance of electromagnetic armour was tested against a shaped charge jet. The jet was registered with shadowgraph flash X-ray photography between the plates and after passing through the plates. The current through the jet and the voltage over the plates were also registered. The current caused heating leading to melting and even vaporization. The magnetic Lorentz force compressed the jet radially, and as this effect increases with decreasing jet radius, instability may arise. Explosions in the compressed regions resulted in a fragmented jet with disk-shaped fragments which are less effective penetrators than the elongated fragments obtained in the absence of current. We also performed a theoretical study, in which the penetrator was subjected to small elastic strains only and the current was constant. The magnetic field was determined by FFT, and the stresses due to the Lorentz force were calculated with a semi-analytical method. The velocity skin effect was demonstrated...|$|R
