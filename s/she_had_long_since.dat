Lady Melbourne had {{been instrumental in}} bringing about the politically advantageous marriage of her son to Lady Caroline, despite disliking both her and her mother. However, once Lady Caroline began her affair with Byron, her mother-in-law began a long and blatant campaign to rid her son of his wife; as Lord David Cecil remarks, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> concluded that Caroline deserved all her misfortunes. William Lamb refused to submit and regretted {{that his mother had}} conspired against his wife with Byron. Calling Byron treacherous, William Lamb was supportive of his wife to her death.|$|E

Morally certain on this head, and seeing Madame Beck's profound embarrassment, I at last communicated my conviction.

He and Sharon visit the secret underground base where he gained his superpowers to recover Vaselli's diary and learn the original name of Red Skull. Although Rogers and Sharon find the diary, Red Skull's thugs grab it. Rogers and Sharon vow revenge and to rescue the recently kidnapped president. They travel to Italy and, in the Red Skull's home, locate an old recording of the murder of his parents.

As to Dorothy, she would have deemed him dead years ago; and should he ever return, he would find that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> been married; for the daughters of the wealthy merchant, Diggory Beggs, would not want for suitors.|$|E

Her friends without would gladly have supplied her wants, but this Richard would not permit. He set a guard around the sanctuary, and would not allow any one to come or go. He would starve her out, he said, if he could not compel her to surrender herself in any other way.|$|E

Carley watched the golden rosy sunset, and as the day ended she breathed deeply as if in unutterable relief. Supper found her with appetite <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> lost. Twilight brought cold wind, the staccato bark of coyotes, the flicker of camp fires through the cedars. She tried to embrace all her sensations, but they were so rapid and many that she failed.|$|E

There was no sign of tears in her eyes; but Adeline wept, and constantly dried her tears with her handkerchief.

60|$|You {{have not}} quite {{forgotten}} little Adele, have you, reader? I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, {{to go and}} see her at the school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much. She looked pale and thin: she said she was not happy. I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for anything that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.|$|R

If the city should be taken, she knew very well that she must necessarily fall again into her husband's power, and she determined that she never would fall into his power again alive. So she retired to her apartment, and there putting a rope around her neck, and making all other necessary preparations, she awaited the issue of the battle, resolved to destroy herself the moment she should hear tidings that Pyrrhus had gained the victory.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{felt that}} it was {{desirable}} to avoid continuing the subject. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> come to regard that interview in the garden as a sort of temporary aberration on his part, and that although, perhaps, sincere at the moment, he had very speedily come to laugh at his own folly, and had recognized that the idea was altogether ridiculous. Upon her it had made so little impression that it had scarcely occurred to her when they met, that any passage of the sort had taken place, and had welcomed him as the lad she had known as a child, rather than as the man who had, under a passing impulse, asked her to marry him.|$|E
60|$|But she {{wondered}} {{why it was}} that when men wanted to work, and there was work to do, yet {{they were unable to}} work because their unions said no. Why were there unions? And, if unions had to be, why were not all workingmen in them? Then there would be no scabs, and Billy could work every day. Also, {{she wondered}} where she was to get a sack of flour, for <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> ceased the extravagance of baker's bread. And so many other of the neighborhood women had done this, that the little Welsh baker had closed up shop and gone away, taking his wife and two little daughters with him. Look where she would, everybody was being hurt by the industrial strife.|$|E
5000|$|Cecilia - An {{engineering}} student born around May 1, 1980 Earlier strips {{have her}} born in 1973. Cecilia spent years refusing {{to admit that}} she was truly a geek at heart. However, in one strip she finally with hesitation admitted she is indeed a geek. She is also a programmer as well. Addicted to chocolate and cookies, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> taken enough classes and conducted enough research to graduate, but a mysterious psychological force keeps her in school. She stated in an interview for a project by her friend Tajel that her father was a professor, a [...] "great teacher", something {{that may or may not}} be a motivation for her to go above and beyond (also, her choice of words indicates that her father may have died). During class, she deliberately wears frumpy clothes to discourage male interest, since the vast majority of her classmates are men. This strategy is not always successful - [...] "Excuse me, female, will you marry me?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>has</b> had two boyfriends in the course of the strip: David and Scott. Although she broke up with David relatively quickly, she seriously dated Scott, her crush in high school, for numerous strips; they had a long-distance relationship for a while after Scott was promoted and moved to London but broke up amicably in 2007. Cecilia sometimes accompanies Tajel to political rallies and such events. She was asked in 2006 by a professor to interview for a faculty position at a different institution because [...] "it's the only position you're not overqualified for" [...] and [...] "we hired one of their grad students, so, diplomatically, they owe us." ...|$|R

Mrs. D----, widow of a soldier, mother of seven children." [...] "Nine, if you please, and good evening to you," [...] shrills Mrs. D----, leaning against the door-post, her arms folded on her bosom. She is a rather pretty, {{slightly}} made Eurasian, and whatever shame <b>she</b> may <b>have</b> owned <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> cast behind her. A shapeless Burmo-native trot, with high cheek-bones and mouth like a shark, calls Mrs. D---- [...] "Mem-Sahib." [...] The word jars unspeakably. Her life is a matter between herself and her Maker, but in that she--the widow of a soldier of the Queen--has stooped to this common foulness {{in the face of}} the city, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> offended against the White race. [...] "You're from up-country, and of course you don't understand. There are any amount of that lot in the city, say the Police." [...] Then the secret of the insolence of Calcutta is made plain. Small wonder the natives fail to respect the Sahib, seeing what they see and knowing what they know. In the good old days, the Honourable the Directors deported him or her who misbehaved grossly, and the white man preserved his face. He may have been a ruffian, but he was a ruffian on a large scale. He did not sink in the presence of the people. The natives are quite right to take the wall of the Sahib who has been at great pains to prove that he is of the same flesh and blood.|$|R
