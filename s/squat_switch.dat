25|$|Executed {{just above}} the runway, the flare arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up) lift {{momentarily}} increases, reducing the descent rate, and allows the main wheels to gently contact the runway. During the flare, pilots retard the throttles to idle to reduce engine thrust. A <b>squat</b> <b>switch</b> in the main landing gear detects the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down.|$|E
50|$|The {{right-hand}} diagram shows a how a tangential turnout is made. A lower, more squat {{profile rail}} {{is used to}} make the switch blades. On the left is the profile of this <b>squat</b> <b>switch</b> rail. The centre diagram shows how the switch rail has to be planed, and on the right it is shown fitting against the stock rail. Note that a thicker base is used to raise the tops level with each other.|$|E

50|$|September 21, 1992 KORL, CESSNA 210L, N2013S, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Pilot {{stated that}} while {{attempting}} to extend the landing gear the gear hydraulic motor operated but the gear did not extend. After several seconds of gear motor operation the circuit breaker for the gear motor popped. Further attempts to extend the gear by normal and emergency procedures were unsuccessful. A gear up landing was made. After the accident the aircraft was raised and the landing gear was extended by use of the manual gear extension emergency hydraulic pump. According to maintenance personnel a wire to the nose landing gear <b>squat</b> <b>switch</b> was chafed and grounded which caused the system to be signaled for gear up at all times. They further stated the pilot could not extend the gear by use of the backup hydraulic pump because the gear down solenoid had overheated during attempts to lower the gear and froze in the gear up position. After the solenoid cooled after landing {{they were able to}} manually lower the gear. Probable cause(s): Undetected chafing and grounding of a wire to the nose landing gear <b>squat</b> <b>switch</b> which resulted in the landing gear being signaled at all times for gear up when electrical power was applied to the system. Contributing to the accident was the overheating of the gear down solenoid which caused it to stick in the gear up position and prevented the gear from being manually extended.|$|E
