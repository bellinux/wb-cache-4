25|$|The {{common law}} of tort also remains {{particularly}} relevant {{for the type of}} liability an employer has where there is scientific uncertainty about the cause of an injury. In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed with at a number of jobs where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one. Although he may be able to sue all of them, a number may have already gone insolvent. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and <b>severally</b> <b>liable</b> and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it up to them to seek contribution from others and thus the risk of other businesses' insolvency. For a brief period, in Barker v Corus the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the risk of employers' insolvency back onto workers. Immediately Parliament passed the Compensation Act 2006 section 3 to reverse the decision on its facts. It has also been held in Chandler v Cape plc, in 2011, that even though a subsidiary company is the direct employer of a worker, a parent company will owe a duty of care. Thus shareholders {{may not be able to}} hide behind the corporate veil to escape their obligations for the health and safety of the workforce.|$|E

40|$|Tort reform advocates {{hoped to}} use a recent case, Norfolk 2 ̆ 6 Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 (2003), {{as a vehicle for}} obtaining a Supreme Court opinion {{critical}} of the traditional doctrine of joint and several liability. Under this doctrine, each of the multiple responsible causes of an injury is potentially fully liable for that injury. The specific issue in Ayers was the availability of joint-and-several liability under the Federal Employers 2 ̆ 7 Liability Act (FELA), which employs common-law tort doctrines while excluding some of the traditional defenses. The defendant claimed that the traditional common law used fractional apportionment of liability (proportionate several liability), rather than full (joint and several or several) liability, for all cases other than those involving tortfeasors acting in concert; that this was the state of the law when FELA was enacted in 1908; that FELA incorporates the common law 2 ̆ 7 s supposed preference for proportionate several liability; that joint and several liability for independent tortfeasors existed only for a brief period {{during the middle of the}} twentieth century; that joint and several liability results in a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s being liable for more damages than she caused or for which she is responsible; and that the evolving common law, the Restatements, and just principles of liability all support proportionate several liability. As this paper argues, and the Supreme Court recently unanimously concluded, all of these assertions are clearly incorrect. Under both the common law and federal admiralty law at the time of FELA 2 ̆ 7 s enactment, and long before, each defendant who tortiously contributed to a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury was <b>severally</b> fully <b>liable</b> for that injury, regardless of whether other tortious causes of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury could be joined in the same lawsuit. Full liability was intended and has been consistently employed by federal and state courts under FELA from the time of FELA 2 ̆ 7 s enactment. Joint-and-several liability is the universal rule in other countries, and all but a handful of the courts in the United States have consistently stated, even after the adoption of comparative responsibility, that joint-and-several liability is the fairest method of allocating liability among the multiple responsible causes of an injury. The courts note that, under joint and several liability, a defendant generally is only liable for injuries for which it is fully responsible as a tortious, actual, and proximate cause. The Restatement Third, while not adopting any single allocation method, states that the fairest method for allocating liability among multiple responsible causes of an injury is joint-and-several liability with re-allocation of uncollectible shares among the responsible parties, and it strongly criticizes proportionate several liability. Moreover, despite the misleading arguments of the tort reformers, which have resulted in many legislative inroads on the joint-and-several liability doctrine, the doctrine has nowhere been completely eliminated, and it continues to be the primary allocation rule in a majority of the states, especially for environmental, hazardous material, and product-liability claims...|$|R

As soon as it reaches a certain sum he is allowed to [...] raise a loan {{exceeding}} his share in the inverse ratio of the [...] amount of his deposit. For instance, after he has deposited one [...] dollar, he is allowed to borrow five or six; but, if he had [...] deposited twenty dollars, he is allowed only to borrow thirty. The [...] security he is compelled to offer is his own and that of two other [...] members of the association, who become jointly and <b>severally</b> [...] <b>liable.</b> He may have no assets whatever beyond the amount of his [...] deposits, nor may his guarantors; the bank relies simply on the [...] character of the three, and the two securities rely on the [...] character of their principal; and the remarkable fact is, that the [...] security has been found sufficient, that {{the interest of the}} men [...] in the institutions and the fear of the opinion of their fellows [...] has produced a display of honesty and punctuality such as perhaps [...] is not {{to be found in the}} history of any other banking [...] institutions. Such is the confidence inspired by these [...] institutions that they hold on deposit, or as loans from third [...] parties, an amount exceeding by more than three fourths the total [...] amount of their own capital. The monthly contributions of the [...] members may be as low as ten cents, but the amount which each [...] member is allowed to have in some banks is not more than seven or [...] eight dollars, in none more than three hundred dollars. He has a [...] right to borrow to the full amount of his deposit without giving [...] security; if he desires to borrow a larger sum, he must furnish [...] security in the manner we have described. The liability of the [...] members is unlimited. The plan of limiting the liability to the [...] amount of the capital deposited was tried at first, but it [...] inspired no confidence, and the enterprise did not succeed till [...] every member was made generally liable. Each member, on entering, [...] {{is obliged to}} pay a small fee, which goes toward forming or [...] maintaining a reserve fund, apart from the active capital. The [...] profits are derived from the interest paid by borrowers, which [...] amounts to from eight to ten per cent, which may not sound very [...] large in our ears, but in Germany is very high. Not over five per [...] cent is paid on capital borrowed from outsiders. All profits are [...] distributed in dividends among the members of the association, in [...] the proportion of the amount of their deposits—after the payment [...] of the expenses of management, of course—and the apportionment of [...] a certain percentage to the reserve-fund. Every member, as we have [...] said, has a right to borrow to the extent of his deposit without [...] security; but then, if he seeks to borrow more, whether he shall [...] obtain any loan, and, if so, how large a one, is decided by the [...] board of management, who are guided in making their decision just [...] as all bank officers are—by a consideration of the circumstances [...] of the bank as well as those of the borrower.

In 1865 there were 961 [...] of these institutions in Germany; in 1877 there were 1,827, with [...] over 1,000,000 members, owning $40,000,000 of capital, with [...] $100,000,000 more on loan, and doing a business of [...] $550,000,000.(335) ...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{consideration}} is a doctrine deriving {{from the common}} law, and can be suspended under the principles of equity. Historically, England had two separate court systems, and the Courts of Chancery which derived their ultimate authority from the King via the Lord Chancellor, took precedence over the common law courts. So does its body of equitable principles since the systems were merged in 1875. The doctrine of promissory estoppel holds that when one person gives an assurance to another, the other relies on it {{and it would be}} inequitable to go back on the assurance, that person will be estopped from doing so: an analogue of the maxim that nobody should profit from their own wrong (nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans). So in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co the House of Lords held that a tenant could not be ejected by the landlord for failing to keep up with his contractual repair duties because starting negotiations to sell the property gave the tacit assurance that the repair duties were suspended. And in Central London Properties Ltd v High Trees House Ltd Denning J held that a landlord would be estopped from claiming normal rent during the years of World War II because he had given an assurance that half rent could be paid till the war was done. The Court of Appeal went even further in a recent debt repayment case, Collier v P J Wright (Holdings) Ltd. Arden LJ argued that a partner who had been assured he was only liable to repay one third of the partnership's debts, rather than be jointly and <b>severally</b> <b>liable</b> for the whole, had relied on the assurance by making repayments, and it was inequitable for the finance company to later demand full repayment of the debt. Hence, promissory estoppel could circumvent the common law rule of Foakes. Promissory estoppel, however, has been thought to be incapable of raising an independent cause of action, so that one may only plead another party is estopped from enforcing their strict legal rights as a [...] "shield", but cannot bring a cause of action out of estoppel as a [...] "sword". In Australia, this rule was relaxed in Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher, where Mr Maher was encouraged to believe he would have a contract to sell his land, and began knocking down his existing building before Walton Stores finally told him they did not wish to complete. Mr Maher got generous damages covering his loss (i.e. reliance damages, but seemingly damages for loss of expectations as if there were a contract). Yet, where an assurance concerns rights over property, a variant [...] "proprietary estoppel" [...] does allow a claimant to plead estoppel as a cause of action. So in Crabb v Arun District Council, Mr Crabbe was assured he would have the right to an access point to his land by Arun District Council, and relying on that he sold off half the property where the only existing access point was. The council was estopped from not doing what they said they would. Given the complex route of legal reasoning to reach simple solutions, it is unsurprising that a number of commentators, as well as the Principles of European Contract Law have called for simple abandonment of the doctrine of consideration, leaving the basic requirements of agreement and an intention to create legal relations. Such a move would also dispense with the need for the common law doctrine of privity.|$|E
