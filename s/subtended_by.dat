5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram <b>subtended</b> <b>by</b> a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter <b>subtended</b> <b>by</b> the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E

Appropriate thrust in an {{aircraft}} in {{all stages of}} the flight, i. e., take-off, climb, cruise, descent and landing is achieved through variation in the nozzle exit area. This paper describes the effect on thrust and IR radiance of a turbojet engine due to variation in the exit area of a just choked converging nozzle (M-e = 1). The variations in the nozzle exit area result in either choking or unchoking of a just choked converging nozzle. Results for the change in nozzle exit area are analyzed in terms of thrust, mass flow rate and specific fuel consumption.

The sample hue was one of 12 samples with chromaticity spaced evenly every 30 degrees around a hue circle in the CIE UCS diagram. The circle, radius 0. 06, was centered at the chromaticity of D 65 (u'= 0. 198, v'= 0. 468). The hue was displaced randomly by between 40 and 100 degrees, and the participants were required {{to use one of}} two keys to return the hue to its original appearance. The keys changed CIE 1976 hue angle (huv) by 1 degree, one in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction, but left the CIE 1976 saturation (suv) and the luminance unchanged. Each participant saw the to-be-memorized hue once only and made subsequent adjustments without seeing it again. Four adjustments were made immediately, four after 1 h, and a further four after 1 week. The second and the fourth in each set of four were preceded by a clockwise displacement of hue angle and the remaining two by an anticlockwise displacement. The CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity of the standard and the chromaticity of the very first adjustment performed immediately after the presentation of the standard were separated by 0. 0210 (s. d 0. 0178) averaged across hues. One hue (purple) was more readily nameable than the others and was more accurately reproduced. There was no evidence of stable individual differences in observers' memory: observers' accuracy in reproducing one colour was not significantly correlated with their accuracy in reproducing another. Adjustments made after an interval of 1 h were worse than those undertaken immediately, but no better than those performed after 1 week. The variability of hue memory under these conditions was similar to the variability of coloured surfaces under common sources of illumination...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Hyperventilation (HV) during {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) is {{a standard}} clinical procedure to trigger seizures in patients affected by mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Despite the pathophysiology of this susceptibility to HV is not definitively understood, it may be hypothesized {{to be related to}} ictal and interictal sympathetic nervous system abnormalities, the presence of which is well known in MTLE patients. In order to test this hypothesis we investigated the HV effect on heart rate variability (HRV) in a group of MTLE patients, compared to a matched group of healthy controls. Material and methods: Forty patients affected by MTLE and 40 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in the study. In those subjects, a standard electroencephalographic recording has been acquired and the high and the low frequency components (HF, LF) of heart rate variability (HRV) and their ratio (LF/HF) have been analyzed at rest and during the HV. Indeed, LF/HF is a reliable index of sympathetic tone modulation. Results: HRV did not differ between MTLE and healthy subjects at rest, whereas HV induced a significant LF/HF increase only in MTLE. Within the MTLE group, males showed higher LF/HF increase during HV respect to females, while no differences related {{to the side of the}} epileptic focus were found. Discussion: MTLE patients showed an increased sympathetic response to HV compared to healthy subjects. HRV analysis points towards an autonomic overactivation as a pathophysiological pathway <b>subtending</b> seizure triggered <b>by</b> hyperventilation in MTLE. Autonomic susceptibility in MTLE may help to explain the increased prevalence of arrhythmic events in these patients, potentially predisposing to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) ...|$|R

On the downward-moving sheet, dots in the right-end area were green, and the rest of the dots were red. When subjects fixated at the center of the stimulus, they bound the color and motion of the dots in the right-end area erroneously–the red dots appeared to move downwards and the green dots appeared to move upwards. In the psychophysical experiment, we measured the color-contingent motion aftereffect in the right-end area after adaptation to the illusory stimulus. A significant aftereffect was observed as if subjects had adapted to the perceived binding of color and motion, rather than the physical binding. For example, after adaptation, stationary red dots appeared to move upwards, and stationary green dots appeared to move downwards. In the fMRI experiment, we measured direction-selective motion adaptation effects in V 1, V 2, V 3, V 4, V 3 A/B, and V 5. Relative to other cortical areas, V 2 showed a much stronger adaptation effect to the perceived motion direction (rather than the physical direction) for both the red and green dots. Significantly, the fMRI adaptation effect in V 2 correlated with the color-contingent motion aftereffect across twelve subjects.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} efficiency conferred by vessels {{is regarded as}} one of the key innovations explaining the historical rise of the angiosperms at the expense of the gymnosperms. Few studies, however, have compared the structure and function of xylem and their relationships with foliage traits in evergreen representatives of both groups. We measured sapwood cross-sectional area, conduit diameters, hydraulic conductance, and leaf area of fine branches (2. 5 – 7. 5 mm diameter) of five conifers and eight evergreen angiosperm trees in evergreen temperate forests in south-central Chile. Conductance of both lineages was higher at Los Lleuques, a warm temperate site with strong Mediterranean influence, than in a cool temperate rain forest at Puyehue. At a common sapwood cross-sectional area, angiosperm branches at both sites had greater hydraulic conductance (G) than conifers, but similar leaf areas. Branch conductance normalized <b>by</b> <b>subtended</b> leaf area (GL) at both sites was, therefore, higher in angiosperms than in conifers. Hydraulically weighted mean conduit diameters were much larger in angiosperms than in conifers, although this difference was less marked at Puyehue, the cooler of the two sites. Conduits of the vesselless rain forest angiosperm Drimys winteri J. R. & G. Forst were wider than those of coniferous associates, although narrower than angiosperm vessels. However, GL of D. winteri was within the range of values measured for vesselbearing angiosperms at the same site. The observed differences in xylem structure and function correlate with evidence that evergreen angiosperms have higher average stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity than their coniferous associates in southern temperate forests. Comparisons of conifers and angiosperm branches thus suggest that the superior capacity of angiosperm conduits is attributable to the development of higher gas-exchange rates per unit leaf area, rather than to a more extensive leaf area. Results also suggest that the tracheary elements of some vesselless angiosperms differ in width and {{hydraulic efficiency}} from conifer tracheids. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Femoroacetabular {{impingement}} (FAI) is {{a common}} cause of young adult hip pain. FAI can result from an acetabular-sided bony lesion, or “pincer” lesion. A pincer lesion is defined as an area of linear contact between the acetabular rim and the femoral head-neck junction due to general or focal acetabular overcoverage. Three dimensional (3 D) analysis of the acetabular rim morphology is essential to understand etiology and aciculate diagnosis of the of the pincer type FAI. A few studies have measured 3 D geometry of the acetabular rim; in which the acetabular rim {{is described as a}} deviation from a reference plane. Therefore, the definition of the reference plane is critical to determine the acetabular rim geometry. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use 3 D Computed Tomography (CT) modeling to evaluate the impact of varied acetabular orientation reference planes on the interpretation of acetabular rim abnormalities, with the goal to determine the ideal reference plane for future study use. Methods: 3 D CT modeling was performed on five hip joints of patients who underwent hip arthroscopy with acetabular trimming for a presumed pincer lesion. These models were exported into point-cloud models. An acetabular 3 D model was automatically created within 10 mm from the femoral head surface (Fig. 1 A,B). The acetabular articular surface and rim were separated with a threshold of 5 mm, which provided an acetabular rim model with a band width of 5 mm (Fig. 1 C). A local coordinate system was defined with the acetabular notch midpoint being 6 o’clock. A best-fit plane of the acetabular rim was determined by the least square method using two different acetabular rim models: 1) a model excluding the acetabular notch (plane A) and 2) a model excluding the acetabular notch and superior region from 10 : 30 to 3 : 00 (3 : 00 being anterior) (plane B). The acetabular rim model was transformed into a cylindrical coordinate system with an axis determined by a normal vector of the plane. The final acetabular rim model consisting of 120 points with 3 ° increments was created by searching the outermost points of the rim. The acetabular center was determined using best-fit sphere of the articular surface model. A reference plane including the center point was determined with orientations determined by normal vectors of the acetabular rim planes (Fig. 1 C, yellow line). The 3 D geometry of the rim was described <b>by</b> <b>subtended</b> angles from the normal vector of the reference plane. Results: Three distinct peaks were noted at anteroinferior (AI), anterosuperior (AP) and posteroinferior (PI) regions (Fig. 2 A,B). While the AI and PI peaks measured with the plane A were higher than that measured with plane B, the AP peak measured with plane A was lower than that measured with plane B (Fig. 2 C). The angle between the normal vectors of plane A and B was 13. 7 ± 3. 5 °. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that the orientation of the reference plane is critical to the 3 D measurement of the acetabular rim. Since bony prominence in the anterosuperior region has been considered as the pathogenesis of the impingement, the reference plane including this region may cause underestimation of the bony lesion. An appropriate determination of the reference plane is crucial for evaluation of the bony lesion in the pincer FAI patient. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
