A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and <b>Steven</b> soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells <b>Steven</b> {{he is going to}} be a father. <b>Steven</b> declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. <b>Steven</b> then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved <b>Steven.</b> Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E
