40|$|Most {{previous}} studies {{have argued that the}} validity of group comparisons of structural parameters is dependent {{on the extent to which}} measurement invariance is met. Although some researchers have supported the concept of partial invariance, there is still no clear-cut partial invariance level which is needed to make valid group comparisons. In addition, relatively little attention has been paid to the implications of failing measurement invariance (e. g., partial measurement invariance) on group comparison on the underlying latent constructs in the multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) framework. Given this, the purpose of the current study was to examine the extent to which measurement noninvariance affects <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> comparisons across populations in the MGCFA framework. Particularly, this study takes a Bayesian approach to investigate the sensitivity of the posterior distribution of <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> difference to varying types and magnitudes of noninvariance across two populations. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to empirically investigate the sensitivity of structural parameters to varying types and magnitudes of noninvariant measurement models across two populations from a Bayesian approach. In order to assess the sensitivity of noninvariance conditions, three outcome variables were evaluated: (1) accuracy of statistical conclusion on <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> difference, (2) precision of the estimated <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> difference, and (3) bias in the posterior mean of <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> difference. Inconsistent with findings of {{previous studies}}, the results of this study showed that the three outcome variables were not sensitive to varying types and magnitudes of noninvariance across all conditions. Instead, the three outcome variables were sensitive to sample size, factor loading size, and prior distribution. These results indicate that even under a large magnitude of measurement noninvariance, accurate conclusions and inferences on <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> differences across populations could be obtained in the MGCFA framework. Implications for practice are discussed for applied researchers who wish to conduct group comparisons of structural parameters across populations under measurement noninvariance...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. When {{structural}} damage occurs, nonlinearity usually exists in damaged structures. So far, some progresses {{in the identification}} of nonlinearity in structures have been made. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been applied for the identification of nonlinear <b>structural</b> <b>parameters.</b> However, since the extended state vector contains both the state vector and the <b>structural</b> <b>parameters,</b> EKF approach can identify limited numbers of nonlinear <b>structural</b> <b>parameters</b> due to computational convergence difficulty. To overcome such problem, a two-stage Kalman estimator approach, which is not available in the previous literature, is proposed for the identification of nonlinear <b>structural</b> <b>parameters.</b> In the first stage, state vector of a nonlinear structure is considered as an implicit function of the nonlinear <b>structural</b> <b>parameters,</b> and the parametric vector is estimated directly based on the Kalman estimator.
