40|$|The leopard seal, Hydrurga leptonyx, is an apex {{predator}} {{that has}} a key role as consumer within the Antarctic ecosystem. Due to the constraints of traditional methods for studying feeding ecology fatty acids (FAs) analysis of blubber has become {{a useful tool for}} determining diet since it provides an indication of long-term dietary histories. FAs however, are not distributed uniformly within the blubber so understanding the degree of stratification is important in order to obtain accurate results. The FA stratification in blubber has not been examined for the leopard seal. We used whole blubber core samples from 24 individual leopard seals captured in the Danco Coast region off the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The cores were sub-sectioned into: outer, middle and inner layers and the FA compositions were compared with potential prey <b>species</b> (<b>krill,</b> fish and penguins). We found 17 FAs present at greater than trace amounts (> 0. 5 %) across all samples. The most abundant FAs were: C 18 : 1 ω 9, C 16 : 1, C 22 : 6 ω 3, C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 1 ω 7 which accounted for approximately 70 % of the total. This composition of blubber is similar to other marine mammals, although some differences do exist. Principal Component Analysis confirmed clear separation between inner and outer layers where most of the FAs were present in significantly different amounts between these layers. Monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) dominated the three layers being more abundant in the outer layer. The higher presence of MUFAs, which have comparatively low melting points, in the outer layer, may suggest that this section has a thermoregulatory function. On the other hand, polyunsaturated (PUFA) and saturated FAs (SFA) were more abundant in the inner layer. PUFAs are known to be of dietary origin and SFAs are inert chemically so they can be used as long-term reserve suggesting this layer is associated with dietary intake. Moreover, the FA composition of the inner blubber layer resembles those of the prey more closely than the outer layer. Detailed analysis of the inner layer and the prey species revealed that although they did not overlap completely, inner layer FAs resembled krill FAs more closely {{than any of the other}} prey types. This would suggest that seals are eating a combination of prey types, but are using krill more heavily. FA analysis indicates that this top predator is feeding predominantly at lower trophic levels than anticipated; so that, within the WAP food web, the leopard seal is behaving more like a mesopredator rather than an apex predator Fatty acid composition suggests leopard seals are no longer apex predators in the Western Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem.

40|$|A {{pronounced}} seasonal {{variability in}} primary productivity is the crucial {{factor in determining}} the life strategies of many polar zooplankton species, whereas oligotrophic tropical oceans experience little change with a low productivity. Lipid accumulation represents an important energetic adaptation in pelagic organisms {{to cope with the}} pronounced seasonal productivity in polar oceans. We compare important global euphausiid species from the Arctic via the tropics to the Antarctic, focussing on the genera Euphausia and Thysanoessa. While the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is the species with the highest biomass of all metazoans on earth, <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> are clearly less relevant in other oceans. In polar <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> total lipid accumulation is usually very pronounced and may be utilised for metabolic maintenance during overwintering or for reproductive processes in spring. Most polar <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> store large amounts of the unusual depot lipid phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), a polar lipid with highly unsaturated fatty acids. However, they exhibit strong differences in their neutral lipid compounds, which may either consist of wax esters or triacylglycerols, but also of both types of lipid classes. Their major end-products of the fatty acid and fatty alcohol biosynthesis are quite different and usually species-specific. In contrast, tropical euphausiids do not rely on lipids as energy reserves and exhibit the usual lipid and fatty acid compositions of biomembranes with high amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In polar euphausiids, the major end-products of the fatty acid and fatty alcohol biosynthesis are quite different and usually species-specific. The ecophysiological implications of these deviating lipid characteristics may determine biogeographical zonation patterns and affect the vulnerability of polar <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> to global warming...|$|R

25|$|Krill are {{considered}} an important trophic level connection – {{near the bottom}} of the food chain – because they feed on phytoplankton and (to a lesser extent) zooplankton, converting these into a form suitable for many larger animals for which krill make up the largest part of their diets.

40|$|Krill are bolo-planktonic {{crustaceans}} {{that are}} wide-spread {{across the ocean}} basins of the world. The 86 known species fulfil {{an important role in}} pelagic food webs. The first basin-wide investigation of krill zoogeography was conducted during the International Indian Ocean Expedition (1962 - 1965). Together with subsequent plankton and micro-nekton studies conducted over the past five decades, all available krill distribution information for the 57 <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> occurring throughout the Indian Ocean has been collated to produce spatially-explicit data on species richness and taxonomic distinctness. The number of <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> was highest throughout the tropical and subtropical areas, and within the south-ward flowing Agulhas and Leeuwin Currents, each of which, had 34 <b>species</b> of <b>krill.</b> Average taxonomic distinctness (Δ+) is a measure of biodiversity that be applied to presence/absence data and is robust to differences in sampling effort, which allows historical data sets to be included. Most areas of the Indian Ocean were comparable in Δ+ values, which reflects the high connectivity across the basin and, in turn, holo-planktonic krill. Areas with lower Δ+ included the Red Sea and the north-west coast of India, whilst, somewhat surprisingly, areas of higher Δ+ were found {{in the middle of the}} Bay of Bengal. Although only 10 species were recorded from this region, these species were spread across six different genera, including Bentheuphausia amblyops, from the monotypic family Bentheuphausiidae, and Pseudeuphausia latifrons, which is the only species of this genus found in the Indian Ocean.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the adaptation of}} euphausiid (<b>krill)</b> <b>species</b> to oxygen minimum zones (OMZ), respiratory response and stress experiments combining hypoxia/reoxygenation exposure with warming were conducted. Experimental <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> {{were obtained from the}} Antarctic (South Georgia area), the Humboldt Current system (HCS, Chilean coast), and the Northern California Current system (NCCS, Oregon). Euphausia mucronata from the HCS shows oxyconforming or oxygen partial pressure (pO 2) -dependent respiration below 80 % air saturation (18 kPa). Normoxic subsurface oxygenation in winter posed a "high oxygen stress" for this <b>species.</b> The NCCS <b>krill,</b> Euphausia pacifica, and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba maintain respiration rates constant down to low critical pO 2 values of 6 kPa (30 % air saturation) and 11 kPa (55 % air saturation), respectively. Antarctic krill had the lowest antioxidant enzyme activities, but the highest concentrations of the molecular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and was not affected by 6 h exposure to moderate hypoxia. Temperate <b>krill</b> <b>species</b> had higher SOD (superoxide dismutase) values in winter than in summer, which relate to higher winter metabolic rate (E. pacifica). In all species, antioxidant enzyme activities remained constant during hypoxic exposure at habitat temperature. Warming by 7 °C above habitat temperature in summer increased SOD activities and GSH levels in E. mucronata (HCS), but no oxidative damage occurred. In winter, when the NCCS is well mixed and the OMZ is deeper, + 4 °C of warming combined with hypoxia represents a lethal condition for E. pacifica. In summer, when the OMZ expands upwards (100 m subsurface), antioxidant defences counteracted hypoxia and reoxygenation effects in E. pacifica, but only at mildly elevated temperature (+ 2 °C). In this season, experimental warming by + 4 °C reduced antioxidant activities and the hypoxia combination again caused mortality of exposed specimens. We conclude that a climate change scenario combining warming and hypoxia represents a serious threat to E. pacifica and, as a consequence, NCCS food webs...|$|R

40|$|In {{the highly}} {{productive}} northern Benguela Upwelling System (nBUS), euphausiids can dominate the zooplankton community and {{may contribute substantially to}} the vertical flux of carbon. The predominant vertical transport of carbon produced by phytoplankton {{in the upper}} water layers of the ocean to deeper layers takes place by sinking of particulate organic carbon (POC). Several processes mediated by the zooplankton community can either enhance or limit the vertical carbon flux and regulate the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. Main biological pathways by which carbon is exported to deeper water layers are the active transport of carbon by vertical migration of pelagic animals, such as krill, and the passive transport of faecal pellets. A conceptual model will be introduced, combining diel vertical migration (DVM) patterns of dominant <b>krill</b> <b>species,</b> with environmental parameters such as temperature, food availability and with physiological constraints such as species-specific respiration rates, which may explain seasonal adaptations of DVM to changes in water temperature, oxygen and food availability. Energetic considerations based on the DVM model showed that temperature acted as the controlling and limiting factor with food abundance further modifying the vertical positioning of <b>krill</b> <b>species.</b> Variable spatial and temporal distributions of krill will lead to seasonal and regional differences in the export of carbon to deeper water layers.
