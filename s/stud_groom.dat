60|$|While this {{conversation}} was going on, {{the two young}} men had left the house, and sauntered out into Blake's stud-yard. Here were his stables, where he kept such horses as were not actually in the trainer's hands--and a large assortment of aged hunters, celebrated timber-jumpers, brood mares, thoroughbred fillies, cock-tailed colts, and promising foals. They were immediately joined by Blake's <b>stud</b> <b>groom,</b> who came on business intent, to request a few words with his master; which meant that Lord Ballindine was to retreat, as it was full time for his friend to proceed to his regular day's work. Blake's groom was a very different person in appearance, from the sort of servant in the possession of which the fashionable owner of two or three horses usually rejoices. He had no diminutive top boots; no loose brown breeches, buttoned low beneath the knee; no elongated waistcoat with capacious pockets; no dandy coat with remarkably short tail. He was a very ugly man of about fifty, named John Bottom, dressed somewhat like a seedy gentleman; but he understood his business well, and did it; and was sufficiently wise to know that he served his own pocket best, in the long run, by being true to his master, and by resisting the numerous tempting offers which were made to him by denizens of the turf to play foul with his master's horses. He was, therefore, a treasure to Blake; and he knew it, and valued himself accordingly.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} said, {{and has become}} racing legend, that Peter St Albans was Aboriginal, and the first Aboriginal jockey to win the Melbourne Cup. The legend arose as, not yet being 13 years old St. Albans {{was too young to}} ride in the 1876 Melbourne Cup. Thus, to allow him to race Briseis in the Cup, it was argued his birthdate and parents were unknown, and from this the legend of him being Aboriginal grew. That he changed his surname is {{supposed}} to be the proof that his mother was Aboriginal; and that the owner of the stud James Wilson Snr. was devoted to St Albans {{is supposed to be the}} proof that either he or his son is St Albans' father. The tale also contends St Albans was left as a baby on the doorstep of one of the <b>stud</b> <b>grooms,</b> Michael Bowden, and raised by him and his wife. This is all strongly denied by his family and his descendants, who say that Michael Bowden and his wife were Peter's true parents. They even hold a copy of Peter's birth certificate. A colour painting by Frederick Woodhouse featuring St Albans, youthful, and very white, standing alongside Briseis with stable jockey Tom Hales in the saddle also confirms the family's story; as does a wood engraving of Briseis with St Albans in the saddle held by the State Library of Victoria.|$|R
60|$|The reason was, I think, that Circumstantial Selection {{is easier}} to understand, more visible and concrete, than Lamarckian evolution. Evolution as a {{philosophy}} and physiology of the will is a mystical process, which can be apprehended only by a trained, apt, and comprehensive thinker. Though the phenomena of use and disuse, of wanting and trying, of the manufacture of weight lifters and wrestlers from men of ordinary strength, are familiar enough as facts, they are extremely puzzling as subjects of thought, and lead you into metaphysics the moment you try to account for them. But pigeon fanciers, dog fanciers, gardeners, stock breeders, or <b>stud</b> <b>grooms,</b> can understand Circumstantial Selection, because it is their business to produce transformation by imposing on flowers and animals a Selection From Without. All that Darwin had {{to say to them}} was that the mere chapter of accidents is always doing on a huge scale what they themselves are doing on a very small scale. There is hardly a laborer attached to an English country house who has not taken a litter of kittens or puppies to the bucket, and drowned all of them except the one he thinks the most promising. Such a man has nothing to learn about the survival of the fittest except that it acts in more ways than he has yet noticed; for he knows quite well, as you will find if you are not too proud to talk to him, that this sort of selection occurs naturally (in Darwin's sense) too: that, for instance, a hard winter will kill off a weakly child as the bucket kills off a weakly puppy. Then there is the farm laborer. Shakespear's Touchstone, a court-bred fool, was shocked to find in the shepherd a natural philosopher, and opined that he would be damned for the part he took in the sexual selection of sheep. As to the production of new species by the selection of variations, that is no news to your gardener. Now if you are familiar with these three processes: the survival of the fittest, sexual selection, and variation leading to new kinds, there is nothing to puzzle you in Darwinism.|$|R

After working as a jackaroo and <b>stud</b> <b>groom</b> he studied at St John's Theological College, Morpeth, in New South Wales, where he obtained a Licentiate in Theology with first class honours.

50|$|After the Manor was {{completed}} in 1883, Ferdinand quickly decided it was too small. The Bachelors' Wing to the east was extended after 1885 and the Morning Room, built in late-Gothic style, {{was added to the}} west after 1888. The stables {{to the west of the}} Manor were built in 1884. Ferdinand and his <b>stud</b> <b>groom</b> devised the plan, working with Conder.

50|$|After his big race success, Singleton {{spent time}} in France, as trainer to the Duke of Orleans, but this {{employment}} {{came to an end}} with the coming of the French Revolution. He returned to race-riding in England, having his final ride at Chester in 1784. He died in poverty five years later in a Chester workhouse. He had married the daughter of Rockingham's <b>stud</b> <b>groom</b> and had a son, another John Singleton, who won the 1797 revival of the Derby.|$|E
50|$|For Bedford, Singleton rode {{to victory}} in three British Classic Races - the 1791 Oaks on Portia (aged just, the 1793 Oaks on Caelia and, his most famous victory, the 1797 Derby on an unnamed colt by Fidget. Back in his family's native Yorkshire he also won the 1802 St. Leger on Orville for Lord Fitzwilliam, who had {{inherited}} the estates of his uncle, Lord Rockingham, {{the man who had}} provided Singleton's father and great uncle with so many of their victories, and also employed his maternal grandfather as <b>stud</b> <b>groom.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On 30 September 1994 Scott {{was shot}} in the chest and killed by a <b>stud</b> <b>groom,</b> William O'Brien, using a single barrel shotgun. O'Brien and Scott had become {{involved}} in a dispute that culminated with O'Brien telling the trainer that he could [...] "stuff his job". O'Brien had reportedly disagreed with Scott's working methods since his takeover of the farm in 1992. The following day Scott sent O'Brien a letter asking for confirmation of his resignation. There was then a confrontation in a barn at Glebe Stud Farm in which Scott was killed. The jury in the case rejected the defence's assertion that O'Brien was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was founded}} in 1766 by Richard Tattersall (1724-1795), who had been <b>stud</b> <b>groom</b> to the second Duke of Kingston. The first {{premises}} occupied were near Hyde Park Corner, {{in what was then}} the outskirts of London. Two [...] "Subscription rooms" [...] were reserved for members of the Jockey Club, and they became the rendezvous for sporting and betting men. Among the famous dispersal sales conducted by [...] "Old Tatt" [...] were those of the Duke of Kingston's stud in 1774 and of the stud of the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) in 1786. The prince often visited Richard Tattersall, and was joint proprietor with him of the Morning Post for several years. He was succeeded by his son, Edmund Tattersall (1758-1810), who extended the business of the firm to France. The third of the dynasty, Richard Tattersall (1785-1859), the eldest of Edmund's three sons, became head of the firm at his father's death. He had his grandfather's ability and tact, and was the intimate of the best sporting men of his time. Another Richard Tattersall (1812-1870), son of the last, then took command of the business. His great-grandfather's 99-year lease having expired, he moved the business to Knightsbridge in 1865. Richard was followed by his cousin, Edmund Tattersall (1816-1898), and he by his eldest son, Edmund Somerville Tattersall (1863-1942).|$|E
