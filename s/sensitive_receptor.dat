40|$|In {{order to}} {{comprehend}} the strategy of odor encoding by odorant receptors, we isolated 2740 mouse receptor neurons from four olfactory epithelial zones and classified {{them in terms of}} their sensitivities and tuning specificities to a chiral pair of odorants, S(+) -carvone (caraway-like odor) and R(–) -carvone (spearmint-like odor). Our approach revealed that the majority of receptors at the lowest effective stimulus concentration represented the principal odor qualities characteristic of each enantiomer by means of the principal odor qualities of the odorants for which the <b>receptors</b> were most <b>sensitive.</b> The chiral-non-discriminating <b>receptors</b> became 3. 7 times of R(–) -carvone-sensitive receptors in the subpopulations when the stimulus concentration was increased 10 -fold. More than 80 % of the responsive receptors (an estimated 70 ± α types) exhibited overlapping sensitivities between the enantiomers. The signals from the non-discriminating receptors may be reduced to decode the characteristic odor identity for R(–) -carvone in the brain over an adequate range of stimulus strengths. The information processing of odors appears to involve the selective weighting of the signals from the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors.</b> An analysis of the overall receptor codes to carvones indicated that the system employs hierarchical receptor codes: principal odor qualities are encoded by the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors</b> and lower-ranked odor qualities by less <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors.</b> Key words: calcium imaging, odorant, odor discrimination, odor quality, olfactory receptor neuron, sensory information processin...|$|R

30|$|Ecotoxicity {{assessments}} {{performed in}} this Step {{differ from the}} human health assessments in two ways. First, as discussed above, when setting up groups based on MoA, assessors {{need to address the}} issue of response addition for chemicals that have different MoAs. Second, if the ecological risk assessment is at an ecosystem level (i.e., using RVs such as PNEC or EQS values) consideration should be given to refining the assessment by performing assessments on specific receptors (e.g. algae, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish). As discussed above, the RVs for ecological effects are usually based on the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> which varies across different chemicals. As Backhaus and Faust indicated, it is a crude simplification to add the impact of a chemical where the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> is fish to one where the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> is an invertebrate (25).

40|$|The {{promotion}} of composting in the UK as a sustainable waste management option {{has led to}} concerns regarding exposure of the public to potentially harmful emissions of airborne micro-organisms or bioaerosols. In response to public concerns, the Environment Agency in England and Wales requires a risk assessment for any licensed composting facility that has a <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> within 250 m of the site boundary. An ongoing programme of studies {{in association with the}} Environment Agency has begun to explore methods to improve exposure assessments for bioaerosols. Our results have shown that is is possible to use air dispersion models for estimating downwind concentrations of bioaerosols, and the more advanced modelling options, {{such as the use of}} intermittent emission rates, result in lower downwind concentrations. Current risk assessments may be over-estimating the exposure of receptors to bioaerosols from composting, however further studies are needed to validate the results presented here. 1. INTRODUCTION The {{promotion of}} composting in the UK as a more sustainable waste management option has led to concerns regarding exposure of the public to potentially harmful emissions of airborne microorganisms or bioaerosols. The composting process is reliant on various micro-organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to break down the organic matter. However, if as a result of composting operations these micro-organisms become airborne, may be breathed in, and due to their small size, can penetrate deep into the human respiratory system. Conditions such as farmer's lung disease and aspergillosis (Latgé, 1999) have been linked to high concentrations of bioaerosols, although dose-response relationships are not well defined. In response to public concerns, the Environment Agency in England and Wales requires a risk assessment for any licensed composting facility that has a <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> within 250 m of th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: Concurrent use {{of ethanol}} and {{nicotine}} (tobacco) {{is often seen}} in human beings. In previous animal experiments, we have demonstrated that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, especially α-conotoxin MII and mecamylamine <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors</b> located in the ventral tegmental area {{may be involved in}} the stimulatory, dopamine enhancing, and rewarding effects of ethanol in rodents. Ethanol may exert these effects via direct interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and/or indirectly via enhancement of extracellular acetylcholine levels in the ventral tegmental area. The present experiments investigated a possible indirect effect of ethanol in stimulating the mesoaccumbal dopamine system. Methods: Neurochemical effects of voluntary ethanol intake on extracellular ventral tegmental acetylcholine and accumbal dopamine levels were measured by means of in vivo microdialysis with a two-probe approach in freely moving rats. Results: Obtained data indicate that voluntary ethanol intake (~ 0. 7 g/kg/h) leads to an increase of extracellular acetylcholine levels in the ventral tegmental area, and an almost time-locked increase of dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. A positive correlation between the ventral tegmental acetylcholine levels and ethanol intake as well as preference was also observed. Conclusion: The present results suggest that voluntary ethanol intake enhances extracellular ventral tegmental acetylcholine that may interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, possibly α-conotoxin MII <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors...</b>|$|R
40|$|We review {{here the}} present {{knowledge}} about the pathway of import and assembly of porin into mitochondria and compare it {{to those of other}} mitochondrial proteins. Porin, like all outer mitochondrial membrane proteins studied so far is made as a precursor without a cleavble lsquosignalrsquo sequence; thus targeting information must reside in the mature sequence. At least part of this information appears to be located at the amino-terminal end of the molecule. Transport into mitochondria can occur post-translationally. In a first step, the porin precursor is specifically recognized on the mitochondrial surface by a protease <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor.</b> In a second step, porin precursor inserts partially into the outer membrane. This step is mediated by a component of the import machinery common to the import pathways of precursor proteins destined for other mitochondrial subcompartments. Finally, porin is assembled to produce the functional oligomeric form of an integral membrane protein wich is characterized by its extreme protease resistance. ...|$|E
