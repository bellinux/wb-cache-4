5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns to <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E

Beckett's 2–0 record and 1.93 ERA against the Cleveland Indians earned him the 2007 ALCS MVP Award. He then started and won {{the first game}} of the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies, {{pitching}} seven innings, allowing one run on six hits, and striking out nine batters. Boston would go on to <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Rockies in the series.|$|E

McKinley became the first Republican {{candidate}} to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there.|$|E

5|$|The NHL {{doubled in}} size to 12 teams in 1967–68 and {{organized}} itself into two divisions: the East Division, with the original six teams, and the West Division, which contained the six expansion franchises.

5|$|The {{tactical}} plan included coordinated strikes on Axis airfields {{carried out by}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress groups to tie down Axis fighter groups. Medium bomber units operating the North American B-25 Mitchell would fly sweeps over the Gulf of Tunis. They were {{to be joined by}} Lockheed P-38 Lightning heavy fighters which were also detailed to <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> area. The presence of the B-25s would allow the P-38s to operate in the area without raising the Axis suspicions. It would seem as if they were there to escort the B-25s, rather than their actual intention, to interdict Axis air transports. Supermarine Spitfire units would <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> straits further north, catching any enemy aircraft that evaded the P-38s. More B-25 and B-17 units were detailed to strike at Sicilian airfields to catch transports on the ground. The USAAF 9th Air Force was detailed to send its Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomb groups against airfields in and around Naples in this capacity as well. On 2 April Doolittle's superiors, supreme commander of all Allied Air Forces in the Mediterranean, Arthur Tedder and commander of Allied Air Forces in Western North Arica Carl Spaatz, decided to wait for the next suitable window to launch the offensive.|$|E

They include the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Mermaid, the Shepherdess and the Chimney <b>Sweep,</b> <b>the</b> Toad, the Darning Needle, the Emperor's New Clothes, the Sea Horse, the Paper Boat, the Flying Trunk and the Wild Swans. There is also a distinctive statue of Andersen in Eventyrparken (The Fairy Tale Park) beside the cathedral. Sculpted by Louis Hasselriis in 1888, it shows the storyteller with a book in his hand, ready to entertain onlookers with his fairy tales.|$|E

The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{defeating}} the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated. Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-final. The blue, blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games, setting the matchup for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers. In the first game, played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal, Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6–1. Due to poor ice conditions, {{the second game}} {{was moved to the}} Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa. Led by goaltender Georges Vezina, Montreal won 3–0 to <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> series, and claim the Cup.|$|E

A fourth unit, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3 or Dive Bombing Wing 3), sent 22 Ju 87s to attack Gosport. The dive-bombers were supported by 157 Bf 109s; 70 from JG 27; 32 from JG 53 acting as close escort; and 55 from JG 2 which was to <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Portsmouth area {{in advance of the}} main raid independently. The Ju 87s were based around Caen, too far away for the attacks. So in the morning the Stukas were moved into closer airfields around Cherbourg, right on the Channel coast. There, fuel tanks were filled, bombs loaded, and crews given a final briefing.|$|E
5|$|In 1996–97, Colorado won the Pacific Division, {{as well as}} the Presidents' Trophy for {{finishing}} the regular season with {{the best record in the}} league: 49–24–9 for 107 points. The team was also the league's best scoring with an average of 3.38 goals scored per game. The Avalanche met the two lowest seeds of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs: the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers, and defeated them in six games and five games, respectively. During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals, the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Detroit went on to <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche had done the year before.

50|$|The {{algorithm}} maintains both a sweep {{line and}} a beach line, which both move through the plane as the algorithm progresses. <b>The</b> <b>sweep</b> line is a straight line, which we may by convention assume to be vertical and moving left to right across the plane. At {{any time during the}} algorithm, the input points left of <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line will have been incorporated into the Voronoi diagram, while the points right of <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line will not have been considered yet. The beach line is not a straight line, but a complicated, piecewise curve to the left of <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line, composed of pieces of parabolas; it divides the portion of the plane within which the Voronoi diagram can be known, regardless of what other points might be right of <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line, from <b>the</b> rest of the plane. For each point left of <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line, one can define a parabola of points equidistant from that point and from <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line; <b>the</b> beach line is the boundary of the union of these parabolas. As <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line progresses, <b>the</b> vertices of the beach line, at which two parabolas cross, trace out the edges of the Voronoi diagram. The beach line progresses by keeping each parabola base exactly half way between the points initially swept over with <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line, and <b>the</b> new position of <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line. Mathematically, this means each parabola is formed by using <b>the</b> <b>sweep</b> line as <b>the</b> directrix and the input point as the focus.|$|R
