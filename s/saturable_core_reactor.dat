The charger includes a ferroresonant voltage-regulating circuit for providing an output voltage {{proportional to the}} frequency of an input AC voltage. A high frequency converter converts a DC voltage supplied, for example, from a rectifier connected to a standard AC outlet, to a controlled frequency AC voltage which is supplied to the input of the ferroresonant circuit. The ferroresonant circuit includes an output, a <b>saturable</b> <b>core</b> transformer connected across the output, and a first linear inductor and a capacitor connected in series across the <b>saturable</b> <b>core</b> transformer and tuned to resonate at the third harmonic of the AC voltage from the high frequency converter.

40|$|Ag-clad ceramic (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x high {{critical}} temperature superconducting (HTS) wire {{has been developed}} at the University of Wollongong with respect to its critical current density, long length and mechanical flexibility. the present work, the HTS wire was investigated for making a HTS coil, an electrical fault current limiter and an electronic high voltage generator. HTS coils were made using Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x HTS wire prepared by the powder-in-tube technique. The HTS wire was characterised as a conductor. The anisotropic HTS wire has a strongly magnetic-field-dependent critical current, which causes critical cunent degradation when used {{in the form of}} a coil. The magnetic field behaviour of the HTS coil was studied with respect to its critical cunent and magnetic field properties. HTS solenoid and pancake coils were produced using 2 ̆ 2 react and wind 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 wind and react 2 ̆ 2 procedures. Experiments which were carried out included magnetic field measurements of the HTS coils in DC and AC magnetic fields, and critical current ampere-turns when used as a magnetic core bias winding. The magnetic field distribution of the HTS coils was also investigated using a magnetic field analysis computer program. The magnetic field in the radial direction (By) (//c-axis) at the HTS coil side 2 ̆ 7 s edge has the most influence on the HTS coil performance at 77 K. The experimental results and analysis provide basic information for the design and operation of a HTS coil made from the anisotropic Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x wire. The designed electrical fault crrent limiter was based on the principle of a <b>saturable</b> magnetic <b>core</b> <b>reactor,</b> where a DC bias winding with a large number of ampere-turns is required to generate a high magnetic motive force (mmf) on a magnetic core. The HTS coil was also studied for use in this device as the DC bias winding. A small laboratory device rated at 3. 5 kW was made and tested to investigate the electrical behaviour of the <b>saturable</b> magnetic <b>core</b> fault cunent limiter and the HTS coil in this application. The electrical behaviour of this fault cunent limiter was also analysed using the modified device ψ-I characteristics, and also considered for application in a 6 kV power distribution system. The results show that this fault cunent limiter restricts fault cunents effectively both in the transient and steady states. A high voltage generator device was made and analysed with regard to using a HTS wire inductor. A laboratory high voltage generator device was built, based on a R-C-L resonant circuit, where large inductance and low resistance were required to generate high voltages from a low voltage battery source. Analysis showed that by using an HTS inductor to reduce the circuit resistance, the build-up voltage could be significantly increased. 1. 2 kV was generated using a small hybrid inductor from a 12 V battery source, and the potential build-up voltage when using a larger HTS inductor was shown to be very high. Both the electrical fault cunent limiter device and the electronic high voltage generator were analysed from measurements and simulations. With improvements in critical cunents and long lengths of Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x wires, HTS coils with high values of critical ampere-turns could be achieved at 77 K operating temperature. These will enable the above HTS applications to be practicable in electrical engineering...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} model {{based on the}} axisymmetric, thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations is developed to predict the convective, radiation and conductive heat transfer in high temperature space nuclear reactors. An implicit-explicit, finite volume, MacCormack method {{in conjunction with the}} Gauss-Seidel line iteration procedure is utilized to solve the thermal and fluid governing equations. Simulation of coolant and propellant flows in these reactors involves the subsonic and supersonic flows of hydrogen, helium and uranium tetrafluoride under variable boundary conditions. An enthalpy-rebalancing scheme is developed and implemented to enhance and accelerate the rate of convergence when a wall heat flux boundary condition is used. The model also incorporated the Baldwin and Lomax two-layer algebraic turbulence scheme for the calculation of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy diffusivity of energy. The Rosseland diffusion approximation is used to simulate the radiative energy transfer in the optically thick environment of gas <b>core</b> <b>reactors.</b> The {{computational model}} is benchmarked with experimental data on flow separation angle and drag force acting on a suspended sphere in a cylindrical tube. The heat transfer is validated by comparing the computed results with the standard heat transfer correlations predictions. The model is used to simulate flow and heat transfer under a variety of design conditions. The effect of internal heat generation on the heat transfer in the gas <b>core</b> <b>reactors</b> is examined for a variety of power densities, 100 W/cc, 500 W/cc and 1000 W/cc. The maximum temperature, corresponding with the heat generation rates, are 2150 K, 2750 K and 3550 K, respectively. This analysis shows that the maximum temperature is strongly dependent on the value of heat generation rate. It also indicates that a heat generation rate higher than 1000 W/cc is necessary to maintain the gas temperature at about 3500 K, which is typical design temperature required to achieve high efficiency in the gas <b>core</b> <b>reactors.</b> The model is also used to predict the convective and radiation heat fluxes for the gas <b>core</b> <b>reactors.</b> The maximum value of heat flux occurs at the exit of the <b>reactor</b> <b>core.</b> Radiation heat flux increases with higher wall temperature. This behavior {{is due to the fact}} that the radiative heat flux is strongly dependent on wall temperature.
