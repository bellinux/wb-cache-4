25|$|The test {{described}} here is more fully the null-hypothesis statistical <b>significance</b> <b>test.</b> The null hypothesis represents {{what we would}} believe by default, before seeing any evidence. Statistical significance is a possible finding of the test, declared when the observed sample is unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true. The name of the test describes its formulation and its possible outcome. One characteristic of the test is its crisp decision: to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. A calculated value is compared to a threshold, which is determined from the tolerable risk of error.|$|E
25|$|Statistical <b>significance</b> <b>test</b> : A {{predecessor}} to {{the statistical}} hypothesis test (see the Origins section). An experimental result {{was said to}} be statistically significant if a sample was sufficiently inconsistent with the (null) hypothesis. This was variously considered common sense, a pragmatic heuristic for identifying meaningful experimental results, a convention establishing a threshold of statistical evidence or a method for drawing conclusions from data. The statistical hypothesis test added mathematical rigor and philosophical consistency to the concept by making the alternative hypothesis explicit. The term is loosely used to describe the modern version which is now part of statistical hypothesis testing.|$|E

40|$|This paper reminds {{readers of}} the absurdity of {{statistical}} <b>significance</b> <b>testing,</b> despite its continued widespread use as a supposed method for analysing numeric data. There have been complaints about the poor quality of research employing <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> for a hundred years, and repeated calls for researchers to stop using and reporting them. There have even been attempted bans. Many thousands of papers have now been written, {{in all areas of}} research, explaining why <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> do not work. There are too many for all to be cited here. This paper summarises the logical problems as described in over 100 of these prior pieces. It then presents a series of demonstrations showing that <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> do not work in practice. In fact, {{they are more likely to}} produce the wrong answer than a right one. The confused use of <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> has practical and damaging consequences for people's lives. Ending the use of <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> is a pressing ethical issue for research. Anyone knowing the problems, as described over one hundred years, who continues to teach, use or publish <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> is acting unethically, and knowingly risking the damage that ensues...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} methodology literature {{in recent years}} has included a full frontal assault on statistical <b>significance</b> <b>testing.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to promote the position that, while <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> as the sole basis for result interpretation is a fundamentally flawed practice, <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> can be useful as one of several elements in a comprehensive interpretation of data. Specifically, statistical significance is but one of three criteria that must be demonstrated to establish a position empirically. Statistical significance merely provides evidence that an event did not happen by chance. However, it provides no information about the meaningfulness (practical significance) of an event or if the result is replicable. Thus, we support other researchers who recommend that statistical <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> must be accompanied by judgments of the event’s practical significance and replicability. The {{research methodology}} literature {{in recent years has}} included a full frontal assault on statistical <b>significance</b> <b>testing.</b> An entire edition of a recent issue of Experimental Education (Thompson, 1993 b) explored this controversy. There are some who recommend the total abandonment of statistical <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> as a research methodology option, while others choose t...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of the present paper are to address {{the historical development of}} statistical <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> and to briefly examine contemporary practices regarding such testing in the light of these historical origins. Precursors leading to the advent of statistical <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> are examined as are more recent controversies surrounding the issue. As the etiology of current practice is explored, it will become more apparent whether current practices evolved from deliberative judgment or merely developed fron. happenstance that has become reified in routine. Examination of the history of analysis suggests that the development of statistical <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> has indeed involved a degree of deliberative judgment. It may be that the time for <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> came and went, but {{there is no doubt that}} <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> served as an important catalyst for the growLh of science in the 20 th century.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss and {{question}} the use of statistical <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> in relation to university rankings as recently suggested. We outline the assumptions behind and interpretations of statistical <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> and relate this to examples from the recent SCImago Institutions Ranking. By use of statistical power analyses and demonstration of effect sizes, we emphasize that importance of empirical findings lies in “differences {{that make a difference}} ” and not statistical <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> per se. Finally we discuss the crucial assumption of randomness and question the presumption that randomness is present in the university ranking data. We conclude that the application of statistical <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> in relation to university rankings, as recently advocated, is problematic and can be misleading...|$|R
50|$|In statistics, {{an exact}} (<b>significance)</b> <b>test</b> {{is a test}} where all assumptions, upon which the {{derivation}} {{of the distribution of}} the test statistic is based, are met as opposed to an approximate test (in which the approximation may be made as close as desired by making the sample size big enough). This will result in a <b>significance</b> <b>test</b> that will have a false rejection rate always equal to the significance level of the test. For example an exact test at significance level 5% will in the long run reject true null hypotheses exactly 5% of the time.|$|E
50|$|Data {{processing}} for homogeneity tests {{usually involves}} a statistical <b>significance</b> <b>test</b> {{for evidence of}} differences between units of the candidate CRM. For the simple balanced design above, this typically uses an F test following ANOVA. A check for trends with production order is also recommended.Where {{there is evidence of}} inhomogeneity, the homogeneity study data are used to estimate the size of the dispersion in certified value from one unit to another; this is the 'between-unit' or 'between-bottle' variance. This may then be used {{as a part of the}} uncertainty in the certified value. In ISO Guide 35:2006, an allowance for undetected between-unit variation is suggested regardless of the result of the <b>significance</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
50|$|While the {{formulations}} of {{the notions of}} confidence intervals and of statistical hypothesis testing are distinct, they are in some senses related {{and to some extent}} complementary. While not all confidence intervals are constructed in this way, one general purpose approach to constructing confidence intervals is to define a 100(1 − α)% confidence interval to consist of all those values θ0 for which a test of the hypothesis θ = θ0 is not rejected at a significance level of 100α%. Such an approach may not always be available since it presupposes the practical availability of an appropriate <b>significance</b> <b>test.</b> Naturally, any assumptions required for the <b>significance</b> <b>test</b> would carry over to the confidence intervals.|$|E
40|$|<b>Significance</b> <b>testing</b> {{is widely}} used and often criticized. The Task Force on Statistical Inference of the American Psychological Association (TFSI, APA; Wilkinson & TFSI, 1999) {{addressed}} the use of <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> and made recommendations that were incorporated in the fifth edition of the APA Publication Manual (APA, 2001). They emphasized the interpretation of <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> {{and the importance of}} reporting confidence intervals and effect sizes. We examined whether 286 Psychonomic Bulletin & Review articles submitted before and after the publication of the TFSI recommendations by APA complied with these recommendations. Interpretation errors when using <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> were still made frequently, and the new prescriptions were not yet followed on a large scale. Changing the practice of reporting statistics seems doomed to be a slow process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{evaluating}} prediction models, {{many researchers}} flank comparative ex-ante prediction experiments by <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> on accuracy improvement, {{such as the}} Diebold-Mariano test. We argue that basing the choice of prediction models on such <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> is problematic, as this practice may favor the null model, usually a simple benchmark. We explore the validity of this argument by extensive Monte Carlo simulations with linear (ARMA) and nonlinear (SETAR) generating processes. For many parameter constellations, we find that utilization of additional <b>significance</b> <b>tests</b> in selecting the forecasting model fails to improve predictive accuracy. ...|$|R

50|$|Given a {{model for}} a set of {{observed}} data, a set of manipulations of the data can result in a derived quantity which, assuming that the model is a true representation of reality, is a standard normal deviate (perhaps in an approximate sense).

5000|$|Fisher was {{motivated}} to obtain scientific experimental results without the explicit influence of prior opinion. The <b>significance</b> <b>test</b> is a probabilistic version of Modus tollens, a classic form of deductive inference. The <b>significance</b> <b>test</b> might be simplistically stated, [...] "If {{the evidence is}} sufficiently discordant with the hypothesis, reject the hypothesis". In application, a statistic is calculated from the experimental data, a probability of exceeding that statistic is determined and the probability is compared to a threshold. The threshold (the numeric version of [...] "sufficiently discordant") is arbitrary (usually decided by convention). A common application of the method is deciding whether a treatment has a reportable effect based on a comparative experiment. Statistical significance {{is a measure of}} probability not practical importance. It can be regarded as a requirement placed on statistical signal/noise. The method is based on the assumed existence of an imaginary infinite population corresponding to the null hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a brief reply to two {{responses}} to a paper I published previously in this journal. In that first paper I presented a summary of part of the long-standing literature critical {{of the use of}} <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> in real-life research, and reported again on how <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> is abused, leading to invalid and therefore potentially damaging research outcomes. I illustrated and explained the inverse logic error that is routinely used in <b>significance</b> <b>testing,</b> and argued that all of this should now cease. Although clearly disagreeing with me, neither of the responses to my paper addressed these issues head on. One focussed mainly on arguing with things I had not said (such as that there are no other problems in social science). The other tried to argue either that the inverse logic error is not prevalent, or that there is some other unspecified way of presenting the results of <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> that does not involve this error. This reply paper summarises my original points, deals with each response paper in turn, and then turns to an examination of how the responders use <b>significance</b> <b>testing</b> in practice in their own studies.
