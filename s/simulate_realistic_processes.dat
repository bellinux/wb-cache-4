40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{incorporate}} airworthiness requirements for flight characteristics into the entire development cycle of electronic {{flight control system}} (EFCS) equipped civil aircraft, digital virtual flight testing and evaluation method based on handling qualities rating method (HQRM) is proposed. First, according to HQRM, flight characteristics airworthiness requirements of civil aircraft in EFCS failure states are determined. On this basis, digital virtual flight testing model, comprising flight task digitized model, pilot controlling model, aircraft motion and atmospheric turbulence model, is used to <b>simulate</b> the <b>realistic</b> <b>process</b> of a pilot controlling an airplane to perform assigned flight tasks. According to the simulation results, flight characteristics airworthiness compliance of the airplane can be evaluated relying on the relevant regulations for handling qualities (HQ) rating. Finally, this method is applied to a type of passenger airplane in a typical EFCS failure state, and preliminary conclusions concerning airworthiness compliance are derived quickly. The research results of this manuscript can provide important theoretical reference for EFCS design and actual airworthiness compliance verification of civil aircraft...|$|R

40|$|Current {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) {{simulations of}} {{the initiation of}} solar eruptions are still commonly carried out with idealized magnetic field models, whereas the realistic coronal field prior to eruptions can possibly be reconstructed from the observable photospheric field. Using a nonlinear force-free field extrapolation prior to a sigmoid eruption in AR 11283 as the initial condition in a MHD model, we successfully <b>simulate</b> the <b>realistic</b> initiation <b>process</b> of the eruption event, as is confirmed by a remarkable resemblance to the SDO/AIA observations. Analysis of the pre-eruption field reveals that the envelope flux of the sigmoidal core contains a coronal null and furthermore the flux rope is prone to a torus instability. Observations suggest that reconnection at the null cuts overlying tethers and likely triggers the torus instability of the flux rope, which results in the eruption. This kind of simulation demonstrates the capability of modeling the realistic solar eruptions to provide the initiation process. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|R

40|$|Reconstructing the {{evolutionary}} history of biological sequences {{will provide a}} better understanding of mechanisms of sequence divergence and functional evolution. Long-term sequence evolution includes not only substitutions of residues but also more dynamic changes such as insertion, deletion, and long-range rearrangements. Such dynamic changes make reconstructing sequence evolution history difficult and affect the accuracy of molecular evolutionary methods, such as multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and phylogenetic methods. In order to test the accuracy of these methods, benchmark datasets are required. However, currently available benchmark datasets have limitations in their sizes and evolutionary histories of the included sequences are unknown. These are the serious drawbacks as benchmarks. Such problems can be solved by simulating sequences to create benchmark datasets with known evolutionary history. However, currently available simulation methods do not allow biologically realistic dynamic sequence evolution. ^ We introduced indel-Seq-Gen version 1. 0 (iSGv 1. 0), a program that <b>simulates</b> <b>realistic</b> evolutionary <b>processes</b> of protein sequences with insertions and deletions (indels). iSGv 1. 0 allows the user to simulate multiple subsequences according to different evolutionary parameters, tracks all evolutionary events including indels and outputs the 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 MSA of the simulated sequences. With indel-Seq-Gen version 2. 0 (iSGv 2. 0), we aimed at simulating evolution of highly divergent DNA sequences and protein superfamilies. iSGv 2. 0 adds lineage-specific evolution, motif conservation, indel tracking, subsequence length constraints, and incorporates coding and non-coding DNA evolution. We uncovered a flaw in the modeling of indels used in current state of the art methods, and fixed it by using a novel discrete stepping procedure. ^ Finally, we developed a new MSA scoring metric called the gap profile score that utilizes insertion and deletion placements to evaluate MSA accuracy. Using a series of benchmark alignments created with iSGv 2. 0, we examined the performance of our scoring method against currently used character-based scoring metrics, including the sum of pairs score. We examined how well the scoring metric output correlates with accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction. We show that the gap profile score opens a novel way to gauge the efficacy of MSA reconstructions, potentially opening the door to the research of better models of indel placement into MSA reconstruction methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Cytomimetic {{circuits}} {{represent a}} novel, ultra low-power, continuous-time, continuous-value class of circuits, capable of mapping on silicon cellular and molecular dynamics modelled {{by means of}} nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Such monolithic circuits are in principle able to emulate on chip, single or multiple cell operations in a highly parallel fashion. Cytomimetic topologies can be synthesized by adopting the Nonlinear Bernoulli Cell Formalism (NBCF), a mathematical framework that exploits the striking similarities between the equations describing weakly-inverted Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) devices and coupled nonlinear ODEs, typically appearing in models of naturally encountered biochemical systems. The NBCF maps biological state variables onto strictly positive subthreshold MOS circuit currents. This paper presents the synthesis, the simulation and proof-of-concept chip results corresponding to the emulation of a complex cellular network mechanism, the skeleton model for the network of Cyclin-dependent Kinases (CdKs) driving the mammalian cell cycle. This five variable nonlinear biological model, when appropriate model parameter values are assigned, can exhibit multiple oscillatory behaviors, varying from simple periodic oscillations, to complex oscillations such as quasi-periodicity and chaos. The validity of our approach is verified by <b>simulated</b> results with <b>realistic</b> <b>process</b> parameters from the commercially available AMS 0. 35 μ m technology and by chip measurements. The fabricated chip occupies an area of 2. 27 mm^ 2 and consumes a power of 1. 26 μ W from a power supply of 3 V.

Although inverse problem theory can deal with complex a priori information in cases when samples from the a priori pdf can be generated, it is rarely done in practice. Instead rather simple prior constraints are often assumed, that may have little geological and petro-physical justification. Hence the solutions to inverse problems are rarely consistent with geological information. Geostatistics is a discipline where methods have been developed for <b>simulating</b> <b>realistic</b> geological subsurface structures. The first breakthrough was the application of classical covariance based geostatistics and sequential simulation.
