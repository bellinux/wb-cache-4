50|$|The {{method is}} heavily used in central, {{southern}} parts of Africa (i.e. Botswana) and South America. Small scale farmers {{have found the}} process to be more beneficial in their regions. Botswana is an arid area, it can go {{for longer periods of}} time without rain and therefore hermetic storage has helped in times without rain i.e. draught. Seeds are well stored for the next season of plowing even though at times seeds are purchase. Usually seeds purchase is done in <b>supplementary</b> <b>measures.</b> In Botswana, traditional people usually use the hermetic storage placed inside a jute bag to increase efficiency and effectiveness in eradicating living organisms within few days. Also, hermetic is crucial in Africa as most of the seeds are produced and stored in the farm. Experimental results proved that hermetic storage of seeds for twelve months can retain germination and viability characteristics, whilst extremely harsh conditions can render an opposite effect.Brazilian grain producers are starting to use hermetic bags on site to store grains as an alternative to bins. They claim that the cost is accessible and the quality of the grain remains the same for a period of 18 months. The bags are made of polyethylene that are capable of reflect sunlight and avoid the heating of the product as well as degradation by light.Argentina has to, frequently, deal with a storage shortage of 20 to 35 million tonnes of grain. This led to quality and quantity loss since the grain has to be transported directly from the farms to elevators, and from elevators to terminal ports. Hermetically sealed plastic bags (silo bags) has gained popularity among producers to overcome this issue. In 2008 harvest season, more than 33 million tonnes of grain were stored using the silo bags in the country for several grains and oilseeds, and, now, this technology is being adopted by other South American countries.Sealed bag has been used to store mostly silage in North America, however, the use of this storage system started to grown since the early 2000s. Still, instead using hermetic choices, the most common option when dealing with storage shortage is piling the grain on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Faced with {{pressure}} from greenhouse gas reductions and energy price hikes, the Taiwan {{government is in}} the process of developing an energy tax regime to reflect environmental external costs and effectively curb energy consumption, as well as mitigate CO 2 emissions through an adequate pricing system. This study utilizes a CGE model to simulate and analyze the economic impacts of the draft Energy Tax Bill and its complementary fiscal measures. Under the assumption of tax revenue neutrality, the use of energy tax revenue generated for the purpose of reducing income tax is the best choice with double dividend effects since it will effectively stimulate domestic consumption and investment, and, consequently, mitigate the negative impacts of the distortionary tax regime. The double dividend effect is less significant, however, when the <b>supplementary</b> <b>measures</b> being used are for government expenditure. Nevertheless, all <b>supplementary</b> <b>measures</b> have effectively reduced energy consumption, which means they have delivered at least the first dividend [...] in the sense of CO 2 emissions control.

40|$|Purpose– This paper aims {{to examine}} and {{critique}} the accounting literature's dominant readability formula, the Flesch formula. Furthermore, the paper sets out to propose refinement and augmentation to the formula {{with a view to}} expanding its applicability and relevance to researchers' attempts at better understanding and critiquing the effectiveness of accounting communications. This aim extends to setting a more robust foundation for informing policymakers' and practitioners' interest in implementing more effective communications with their target stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach– The paper offers an historically informed methodological critique of the current articulation and application of the Flesch formula, both generally and in accounting research. This critique forms the basis for developing proposed revisions and <b>supplementary</b> <b>measures</b> to augment Flesch's coverage. These are presented with sample empirics. Findings– Illustrative examples suggest that it is feasible and desirable to apply a revised formula that reduces Flesch's misplaced emphasis on word length by respecifying its sentence length variable, a probable cause of low readability. A reader attribute score further enhances the formula by integrating the considerable impact of readers' attributes on readability and accounting communication effectiveness. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>measures,</b> comprising non‐narrative communications dimensions, are introduced as a foundation for further research. Originality/value– The paper provides not only critique but also refinement and augmentation of the much used Flesch readability formula for accounting communications research.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{examined}} the measurement properties of the Japanese version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Hepatocellular Carcinoma-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-HCC 18). Methods EORTC quality of life (QOL) translation guidelines were followed to create a Japanese version of the EORTC QLQ-HCC 18. This was then administered to 192 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma along with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and FACT-Hep questionnaires. Tests for reliability and validity were conducted including comparison of scores between the EORTC and FACT questionnaire and detailed assessment of the new scales and items in clinically distinct groups of patients. Results Multi-trait scaling analysis confirmed three putative scales in the QLQ-HCC 18, fatigue, fever and nutrition. Cronbach’s alpha for these scales were between 0. 68 and 0. 78. The QLQ-HCC 18 scales correlated with scales measuring similar items in the FACT-Hep and the questionnaire was stable over time with an intra-class correlation score of 0. 70 for almost all scales. The questionnaire {{had the ability to}} distinguish between patients with different Karnofsky Performance Status, and Child-Pugh liver function class.
