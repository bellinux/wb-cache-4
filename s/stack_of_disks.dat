40|$|SUMMARY The outer {{segment is}} a {{specialized}} compartment of vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptor cells where phototransduction takes place.

Five hundred and sixteen proteins were identified including 41 proteins that function in rod and cone phototransduction and the visual cycle and most proteins previously shown to be involved in outer segment structure and metabolic pathways.

40|$|AbstractIn photoreceptors of {{the living}} retina both {{activation}} and deactivation of transducin must occur in less than 1 s. In ROS preparations used for in vitro studies, however, deactivation takes minutes. This {{is due to the}} fact that activated transducin is released into the free aqueous space, whereby GTPase activity and consequent deactivation of the protein are slowed down, and due to the dilution of soluble ROS proteins involved in the quenching of rhodopsin activity. In this paper, using a convenient, non-invasive light scattering assay, we demonstrate that in an intact <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>disks,</b> where active transducin stays membrane associated and is rapidly deactivated, the activity of rhodopsin can also be quenched in the time range of seconds when soluble ROS proteins are supplemented. Arrestin, the 48 kDa protein of the photoreceptor, is one of the proteins required for rapid recovery, however, it requires the synergistic action of other soluble proteins (besides rhodopsin kinase) in order to exert its effect: When arrestin is included in the reaction mixture without the ‘helper protein(s) ’, it cannot speed recovery, and when a mixture of soluble proteins is added which lacks arrestin, there is also no effect. The nature and identity of this (these) helper protein(s) are still unclear...|$|E

40|$|Vertebrate retinal rod outer {{segments}} (OS) {{consist of}} a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>disks</b> surrounded by the plasma membrane, where phototransduction takes place. Energetic metabolism in rod OS remains obscure. Literature described a so-called Mg(2 +) -dependent ATPase activity, while our previous results demonstrated the presence of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in OS, sustained by an ATP synthetic activity. Here we propose that the OS ATPase and ATP synthase are {{the expression of the}} same protein, i. e., of F 1 Fo-ATP synthase. Imaging on bovine retinal sections showed that some OXPHOS proteins are expressed in the OS. Biochemical data on bovine purified rod OS, characterized for purity, show an ATP synthase activity, inhibited by classical F 1 Fo-ATP synthase inhibitors. Moreover, OS possess a pH-dependent ATP hydrolysis, inhibited by pH values below 7, suggestive of the functioning of the inhibitor of F 1 (IF 1) protein. WB confirmed the presence of IF 1 in OS, substantiating the expression of F 1 Fo ATP synthase in OS. Data suggest that the OS F 1 Fo ATP synthase is able to hydrolyze or synthesize ATP, depending on in vitro or in vivo conditions and that the role of IF 1 would be pivotal in the prevention of the reversal of ATP synthase in OS, for example during hypoxia, granting photoreceptor survival...|$|E

Activation foils consisting of a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>disks</b> of Co, Ni, Fe, Al, Nb and Cu were irradiated concurrent with mechanical testing samples in the Los Alamos Spallation Radiation Effects Facility (LASREF) at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) facility.

From initial estimates for the fluences and spectra derived from the Los Alamos High-Energy Transport (LAHET) Code System (LCS), comparisons to the measured levels of activation products were made.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{original}} formulation of the Granta-Gravel and Cam-Clay constitutive models, the framework of elasto-plasticity has been successfully applied to describe the geomaterials behaviour. Thanks to the modifications proposed by different authors, several aspects of the granular materials behaviour were progressively taken into account, such as the non associated flow rule {{and the effects of}} induced anisotropy. Recently, a series of triaxial laboratory tests performed by di Prisco and Imposimato (1996) has put in evidence an aspect which is disregarded in elasto-plasticity: the time dependency of the mechanical behaviour of loose sand specimens. The same authors proposed to interpret the observed behaviour within the framework of visco-plasticity. In this paper, the non reversible behaviour of an idealised granular material composed of a 2 D <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>disks</b> is analysed by performing a series of Distinct Element numerical simulations (PFC- 2 D code). Starting from different stress levels (from isotropic to close to failure) previously recorded during a biaxial compression simulation, a series of finite stress probes is applied to the numerical specimen. All the probes have the same (small) magnitude, but they differ in direction in the principal stress plane. For each probe, the stress increments are applied to the boundary plates in an unique finite step, and the corresponding strain increments are recorded during the following time period. The obtained results show that the transient state is reached passing through two phases: a first one, where mainly elastic strains take place as the stress increment propagates within the specimen followed by a second one where the measured strains (non reversible) increase under constant stress; The duration of both phases considerably increases as the initial stress state approaches to failure. These results, which confirm the adequacy of a visco-plastic flow rule, are put in relation to the specimen structure progressive rearrangement caused by the applied stress-increment...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} the phase {{behavior}} of discotic molecules in various circum-stances. We first study the thermodynamics of disk-coil molecules. The system shows rich phase {{behavior as a}} function of the relative attractive strength of coils (A), the <b>stacking</b> interaction strength <b>of</b> <b>disks</b> (p), the number of coarse-grained monomers of the coil (Nc), and the reduced temperature (T*). At high T*, a disordered phase is dominant. At intermediate T*, lamellar, perforated lamellar, and cylinder phases appear as y and Nc are increased.

We find that the confine-ment imposed on the disks by the attached coils strongly contributes to the ordered <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>disks.</b> In particular, the ordered cylinder phase contains highly ordered disks stacked in parallel due to the cylindrical confinement of the coils that restricts the system to a single degree of freedom associated with the director vector <b>of</b> the <b>disks.</b> Our results are important for understanding the self-assembly of supramolecu-lar structures of disk-coil molecules that are ubiquitous in nature, such as chlorophyl...|$|R
