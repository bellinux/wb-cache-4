EBV-negative cell clones isolated from the EBV-positive BL line Akata were infected with an EBV recombinant carrying a selectable marker, and the following <b>selection</b> <b>culture</b> easily yielded EBV-infected clones. EBV-reinfected clones showed BL-type EBV expression and restored the capacity for growth on soft agar and tumorigenicity in SCID mice that were originally retained in parental EBV-positive Akata cells and lost in EBV-negative subclones. Moreover, {{it was found that}} EBV-positive cells were more resistant to apoptosis than were EBV-negative cells. EBV-infected cells expressed the bcl- 2 protein, through which cells might become resistant to apoptosis, at a higher level than did uninfected cells. This is the first report that BL-type EBV infection confers apoptosis resistance {{even in the absence of}} expression of LMP 1 and BHRF 1, both of which are known to have an antiapoptotic function. Surprisingly, transfection of the EBNA- 1 gene into EBV-negative Akata clones could not restore malignant phenotypes and apoptosis resistance, thus suggesting that EBNA- 1 alone was not sufficient for conferring them. Our results suggest that the persistence of EBV in BL cells is required for the cells to be more malignant and apoptosis resistant, which underlines the oncogenic role of EBV in BL genesis...|$|E

Inoculation of Adv-CD 21 followed by exposure to recombinant EBV carrying a selectable marker resulted in the successful entry of EBV into three of seven nonprimate mammalian cell lines as evidenced by expression of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA). The EBV-susceptible cell lines included rat glioma-derived 9 L, rat mammary carcinoma-derived c-SST- 2, and canine kidney-derived MDCK. Subsequent <b>selection</b> <b>culture</b> with G 418 yielded drug-resistant cell clones. In these cell clones, EBV existed as an episomal form, as evidenced through the Gardella gel technique. Among the known EBV latency-associated gene products, EBV-encoded small RNAs, EBNA 1 and transcripts from the BamHI-A rightward reading frame (BARF 0), and latent membrane protein 2 A were expressed in all EBV-infected cell clones. The viral lytic events could be induced in these cell clones by simultaneous treatment with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate and n-butyric acid, but they were abortive, and infectious virus was not produced.

Helper T cells could only be selected with syngeneic, but not allogeneic, antigen-pulsed macrophages and would then collaborate only with syngeneic, but not allogeneic, hapten-primed spleen cells. When F 1 T cells were selected with antigen-pulsed parental macrophages they would only collaborate with B cells of the same parental strain as the macrophages used in the <b>selection</b> <b>culture.</b> These results are strongly {{in support of the}} view that the primed T cell is activated by carrier determinants of the nominal antigen in association with Ia antigens on macrophages and the helper T cell, in turn, activates B cells which bear the same Ia antigens and determinants of the nominal antigen bound to immunoglobulin receptors on their surface.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The limited {{clinical}} response {{observed in}} many patients with colorectal {{cancer may be}} related to the presence of chemoresistant colorectal can- cer stem cells (CRC-SCs). Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4) promotes the differentiation of normal colonic stem cells. We investigated whether BMP 4 might be used to induce differentiation of CRC-SCs and for therapeutic purposes. METHODS: CRC-SCs were isolated from 25 tumor samples based on expression of CD 133 or using a <b>selection</b> <b>culture</b> medium. BMP 4 expression and activity on CRC-SCs were evaluated in vitro; progeny of the stem cells were evaluated by immunofluorescence, immuno- blot, and flow cytometry analyses. The potential thera- peutic effect of BMP 4 was assessed in immunocompro- mised mice after injection of CRC-SCs that responded to chemotherapy (n 4) or that did not (n 2). RESULTS: CRC-SCs did not express BMP 4 whereas differentiated cells did. Recombinant BMP 4 promoted differentiation and apoptosis of CRC-SCs in 12 of 15 independent experiments; this effect did not depend on Small Mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) 4 expression level or mi- crosatellite stability. BMP 4 activated the canonical and noncanonical BMP signaling pathways, including phos- phoInositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and PKB (protein kinase B) /AKT. Mutations in PI 3 K or loss of Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) in Smad 4 -defective tumors made CRC-SCs unresponsive to BMP 4. Administration of BMP 4 to immunocompromised mice with tumors that arose from CRC-SCs increased the antitumor effects of 5 -fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. CONCLUSIONS: BMP 4 promotes terminal differentiation, apoptosis, and chemosensitization of CRC-SCs in tumors that do not have simultaneous mutations in Smad 4 and constitutive activation of PI 3 K. BMP 4 might be de- veloped as a therapeutic agent against cancer stem cells in advanced colorectal tumors...|$|E

This was accomplished by fusing mouse fibroblasts (A 9) to human fibroblasts that contain a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 16 and 11. The murine A 9 cells are deficient in adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), an enzyme present on the long arm of HC 16 (HC 16 q). Hybrid cells were grown in <b>selection</b> <b>culture</b> medium that required the cells to retain human APRT. Therefore, the hybrids exhibited stable retention of the entire HC 16 or the rearranged chromosome containing HC 16 q. We isolated five independent primary and secondary hybrid cell lines which retained either HC 16 or HC 16 q at a high frequency. The presence of human α-globin genes in the various clones was established directly by DNA extraction and hybridization to a cDNA probe for human α-globin genes. Autoradiographs showed that hybrid cells containing the long arm, but not the short arm, of HC 16 showed only the background mouse bands. Hybrid cells that retained the entire HC 16 demonstrated the band(s) containing the human α-globin genes. Hybrid cells that contained HC 16 with its α-globin genes were then placed in culture medium that contained diaminopurine, which is lethal for cells containing APRT. These counter-selected hybrid cells had lost HC 16 and also lost the human α-globin genes as determined by blot hybridization. The presence of α-globin gene sequences in the hybrid clones was concordant with HC 16 only and not with any other human chromosome. These results confirm the assignment of α-globin genes to HC 16 and localize the genes to the short arm. We also assign the locus for phosphoglycollate to the short arm of HC 16...|$|E

40|$|We show clear {{evidence}} for direct infection of various human epithelial cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro. The successful infection {{was achieved by}} using recombinant EBV (Akata strain) carrying a selective marker gene but without any other artificial operations, such as introduction of the known EBV receptor (CD 21) gene or addition of polymeric immunoglobulin A against viral gp 350 in culture. Of 21 human epithelial cell lines examined, 18 became infected by EBV, as ascertained by the detection of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) 1 expression in the early period after virus exposure, and the following <b>selection</b> <b>culture</b> easily yielded a number of EBV-infected clones from 15 cell lines. None of the human fibroblasts and five nonhuman-derived cell lines examined was susceptible to the infection. By comparison, cocultivation with virus producers showed ≈ 800 -fold-higher efficiency of infection than cell-free infection did, suggesting the significance of direct cell-to-cell contact {{as a mode of}} virus spread in vivo. Most of the epithelial cell lines infectable with EBV were negative for CD 21 expression at the protein and mRNA levels. The majority of EBV-infected clones established from each cell line invariably expressed EBNA 1, EBV-encoded small RNAs, rightward transcripts from the BamHI-A region of the virus genome, and latent membrane protein (LMP) 2 A, but not the other EBNAs or LMP 1. This restricted form of latent viral gene expression, which is a central issue for understanding epithelial oncogenesis by EBV, resembled that seen in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma and LMP 1 -negative nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The results indicate that direct infection of epithelial cells by EBV may occur naturally in vivo, and this could be mediated by an unidentified, epithelium-specific binding receptor for EBV. The EBV convertants are viewed, {{at least in terms of}} viral gene expression, as in vitro analogs of EBV-associated epithelial tumor cells, thus facilitating analysis of an oncogenic role(s) for EBV in epithelial cells...|$|E

Recruitment in a knowledge-intensive firmIn recent years {{there has been}} a {{revaluation}} of the concept of recruitment, in particular in corporate settings where knowledge resources are scarce and corporations face tight labour markets. Under these circumstances, the traditional concept of recruitment, basedon a single choice from the organizational perspective, is inappropriate. Instead, critics claim that recruitment should be regarded as a dual matching process of mutual negotiation. Such practices are said to match individual and corporate needs, providing an opportunity for candidates to make more rational decisions about their vocational and organizational choice. Furthermore, it would imply less authoritarian power relations by treating candidates as autonomous, independent subjects. This study investigates how these claims are put into practice. The aim of the study is to contribute to a greater understanding and knowledge concerning the consequences of recruitment practices aiming at cultural match between individuals and corporate culture. The study is a case study of the recruitment practices of a large American consulting firm operating in Sweden. The analysis is inspired by a discourse analytical approach, combining discourse, textual and conversation analysis. It is argued that recruitment could be regarded as a social practice where practitioners engage in social interaction, regulating social and power relations. Thus, the analysis focuses on how power relations between candidates and corporate members are constructed in social interaction, during the process of recruitment. The findings suggest that cultural matching practices produce an employment relationship characterized by subjectivation, i. e. those who are engaged experience the contract of employment {{as a result of their}} own independent decision to work in accordance with the conditions presented by company representatives. It is argued that the recruitment practices of the consulting firm contribute to the establishment of a self-disciplinary mode of control, reversing the division of responsibility between employer and employee.
