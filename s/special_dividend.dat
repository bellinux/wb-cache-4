5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a <b>special</b> <b>dividend</b> of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dividend}} is allocated as a fixed {{amount per}} share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. [...] For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits {{that have not been}} distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders' equity section on the company's balance sheet [...] the same as its issued share capital. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may declare a dividend at any time, sometimes called a <b>special</b> <b>dividend</b> to distinguish it from the fixed schedule dividends. Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.|$|E

Most plausibly, small specials disappeared because their predictability made them close substitutes for regular dividend signals, while large specials survived because their sheer size automatically differentiates them from regulars...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Ever since listed {{companies}} {{have been allowed to}} buy back shares (since the Companies Amendment Act was introduced in 1999), a major question has been whether companies with extra cash should pay out dividends or buy back shares. The larger research project for the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB) will evaluate this question by comparing the rand value of dividends paid to shareholders to the rand value of share buybacks and comparing the rand value of <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> to the rand value of share buybacks. The research described in this report was conducted as part of the bigger research project on dividends and aimed to produce a provisional list of <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> paid from 1999 to 2011 for all companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The list comprises only <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> paid from earnings, hence the term „provisional list‟. The bigger research project to produce a comprehensive list of <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> will include the following additional steps: 1. Determining payments from earnings and share premium. 2. Determining payments from earnings, share premium and <b>special</b> designated <b>dividends</b> (SDD). 3. Determining payments from earnings, share premium, SDD and statistically evaluated dividends. The present research showed that using databases alone would not yield viable data for research purposes. The researcher started to gather data from two databases and afterwards had to evaluate the Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) announcements to eliminate the discrepancies. Furthermore, the physical financial statements gave valuable information to produce the provisional list. The correct method to determine the true rand amounts for dividends is firstly to consult the annual financial reports and secondly to retrieve the SENS announcements. Then the entry can be verified by multiplying the dividend per share by the number of shares on the record date. This rand value {{can be found in the}} financial statements in the statement of changes in equity. The dividends paid out of share premium are easy to identify, as the entry will be specifically stated in the statement of changes in equity. The determination of <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> is rather difficult, because the rand amount of <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> are hardly ever published as such in the statement of changes in equity. The conclusion reached by the researcher is that the only method to obtain the correct entries for any financial evaluation is to consult the audited financial statements. Databases can be useful in obtaining some information; however, the only reliable resource to retrieve the final information is from financial statements...|$|R

40|$|The {{centerpiece}} of President Bush's {{tax cut in}} 2003 was a sharp reduction in the individual dividend tax rate. The dividend tax cut was designed to spur investment and boost the stock market by increasing the after-tax return on corporate earnings, thus raising stock valuations. The tax cut also reduced the tax bias against dividends to spur larger payouts to shareholders. That reduces the amount of discretionary cash available to executives and will likely {{reduce the number of}} Enron-style corporate financial scandals. This study examines the impact of the dividend tax cut after one year. We gathered data on dividend payouts before and after the 2003 tax cut for all Standard & Poor's 500 companies. We found a highly positive response to the tax cut: Annual dividends paid by S&P 500 companies rose from $ 146 billion to $ 172 billion, an increase of $ 26 billion. In addition, <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> of $ 7 billion have been paid, raising the total first-year dividend increase to $ 33 billion. Thus, dividends increased 18 percent without <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> and 23 percent with <b>special</b> <b>dividends.</b> Twenty-two companies that did not previously pay dividends have initiated regular dividends. Equity values rose more than $ 2 trillion after the tax cut. The large and positive response to the dividend tax cut, which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2008, suggests that Congress should make it permanent...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - To {{explain how}} the advance payment of {{corporation}} tax (ACT) distorted the dividend payment system in the UK. Design/approach/methodology - Reviews prior studies of surplus ACT and dividend payments, extending to cover irregular payments such as share repurchases and B (bonus) share schemes. Describes the UK partial imputation corporation tax scheme, and the ACT system from 1970 to 1990, modified by the FID scheme for firms remitting foreign profits in 1994.

5000|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>special</b> <b>dividend</b> of 25% or more, however, special rules that are quite {{different}} apply. If you sell stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a [...] "due bill," [...] which denotes that (though the company will pay the dividend to your account, if you are the shareholder of record on the date three business days prior to the record date), your account must, in turn, turn the amount of that dividend over to the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date of a large <b>special</b> <b>dividend,</b> you are entitled to the dividend and will receive it via the due bill process.|$|E

50|$|For example, say XYZ {{is priced}} at $40 today, {{and has a}} <b>special</b> <b>dividend</b> of $1. Since call option holders are not {{entitled}} to dividends, a holder of an option to buy stock XYZ at $30 will not receive the $1 <b>special</b> <b>dividend.</b> However, after paying the cash dividend, then (all else being equal) XYZ will drop to $39, as it has paid out $1 of its value. However, the option to buy a $39 stock at $30 is worth less than the option to buy a $40 stock at $30. Therefore, option exchanges have formulas to adjust contracts appropriately when special dividends are paid out. In this case, the call option to buy at $30 will be converted to a call option to buy at $29, which will keep the option value roughly the same.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to expand on the available literature that suggests a positive effect of R&D activities and dividend payments on firms' value by considering three additional aspects that differ from previous research. Design/methodology/approach – The analysis of the valuation model is performed in a panel dataset of UK firms from 1994 to 2005 (8, 559 observations). The methodology consists in applying General Method of Moments (GMM) to control for endogeneity, firm-specific effects and time effects. Findings – The findings indicate that the use of GMM in the valuation model is adequate, given the statistical properties of the data. R&D stock is shown to be positively associated with corporate value, but its impact is lower than for R&D expenditure. Both <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> and ordinary dividends are found to be positively associated with corporate value, supporting the signalling hypothesis which presupposes that managers might use dividends as a signal about companies' future profitability. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the empirical literature of corporate finance, not only with respect to the effect of <b>special</b> <b>dividends</b> and R&D stock on corporate value, as opposed to R&D expenditure and ordinary dividends (as in previous studies for the UK), but also in confirming that, after endogeneity has been controlled, there is a significant and positive effect of these variables but with a different impact.
