He took the business from a loss of £297,000 in 1985 to profits of just over £1m in 1986. The profits were used to buy out the existing <b>shareholders</b> and <b>transfer</b> ownership <b>to</b> three Christian charities. He writes in his autobiography that [...] "Most of the non-executive directors were also devout Christians who prayed before every meeting.

40|$|In Italy an {{extremely}} {{large number of}} companies is organized as a pyramidal group. As compared to other control structures, pyramidal groups might offer minority shareholders less protection and hence discourage them from holding shares. We evaluate empirically the impact of some variables that proxy the degree of shareholder protection on non controlling equity finance and, in particular, {{the effect of the}} degree of group vertical integration. Ceteris paribus, vertical integration is associated with lower participation of outside minority shareholders. The paper argues that this finding is due to greater opportunities for the controlling <b>shareholder</b> <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> resources across the subsidiaries, which reduces the incentives for potential outside equity finance...|$|R

40|$|When a <b>shareholder</b> <b>transfers</b> stock <b>to</b> the issuing {{corporation}} {{in exchange for}} money or other property, the transaction may resemble eitheran ordinary sale of stock to an outsider in an arm 2 ̆ 7 s length bargain or the receipt by the shareholder of a dividend from the corporation. The 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 analogy is appropriate, for example, when the owner of preferred stock instructs his broker to sell his stock and the broker, by chance, effects asale to the corporation, {{which happens to be}} buying up its preferred stock at the time. The preferred shareholder {{ought to be able to}} treat the transaction in the same manner as any other sale, reporting the difference between his adjusted basis and the sales price as capital gain or loss. Onthe other hand, when the owner of a one-man corporation having only common stock outstanding foregoes dividends for a period of years andthen 2 ̆ 2 sells 2 ̆ 2 some of his shares to the corporation for cash, the transaction is more like a 2 ̆ 2 dividend 2 ̆ 2 than a 2 ̆ 2 sale. 2 ̆ 2 Although the shareholder hassurrendered some of his stock, his interest in the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s assets and his control of the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s fate are undisturbed.

50|$|Because of {{the unique}} {{structure}} of the DOGIT areas, where a community owned {{the land and the}} council represented the community owners, concerns were raised by the councils about ownership potentially <b>transferring</b> <b>to</b> the new entities and diluting their title over it.

40|$|On the 26 th of January 2010, the Supreme Administrative Court in Sweden gave five rulings which greatly {{affect the}} {{possibility}} to keep a close company within a family by transferring the ownership of the company to the next generation. The five rulings concern {{the interpretation of the}} prerequisite, same or similar activity, which can be found in section 57, clause 4 of the Swedish Income Tax Act.      The prerequisite is fulfilled when an entire or parts of a business is <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> another close company and the receiving company’s business activity is {{within the framework of the}} transferring company’s business activity or when the companies have a similar connection. Depending on which shares that are being evaluated, the prerequisite can refer to both the shares in the receiving or the transferring company. When the prerequisite is fulfilled, a standardized amount of the business income will be taxed as capital gains and the surplus will be taxed as earned income. This tax treatment will continue as long as the original shareholder or a family member is active in either of the companies.   The present interpretation of the prerequisite results in problems when <b>shareholders</b> want <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> ownership of the company to the next generation and at the same time place some of the business income in a passive asset management company. The current interpretation of the prerequisite shows that the shares in the asset management company are affected and will continue to be affected by the previous business activity, when it is controlled by the next generation. Therefore, the special tax treatment will continue to affect the original shareholder.   The current interpretation of the prerequisite results in a more favorable tax treatment when the original shareholder sells the company to a third party instead of <b>transferring</b> ownership <b>to</b> the next generation...|$|R

50|$|The {{railways}} developed {{networks of}} feeder bus {{services in the}} 1920s, but the legal powers of the railway companies (after 1922 the Big Four) to run bus services were unclear and each promoted private legislation (the Road Powers Acts of 1928) to obtain clarity. One result was that the railways were in future to refrain from taking a controlling interest in bus undertakings. This led the companies to enter into partnerships with the bus companies, including the National. In 1929 the London and North Eastern Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the National formed Eastern National Omnibus Company, to which all three <b>shareholders</b> <b>transferred</b> their bus operations in Essex, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire.|$|R

40|$|From {{the angle}} that {{tunneling}} in assets or shares acquisitions {{is in fact}} that the controlling <b>shareholders</b> <b>transfer</b> resources from purchasers to bargainors inside groups, We compare the performance change of listed firms that acquire assets or shares inside groups with that of listed firms that acquire assets or shares outside groups and find the former is significantly worse than the latter. Besides, we examine the stock price changes of purchasers and responding bargainors when the acquisitions occur and find that among acquisitions inside groups while the stock price of purchasers decrease significantly, the stock price of bargainors increase significantly,but among acquisitions outside groups the stock prices of purchasers and responding bargainors do not change significantly. These suggest that there exist in the controlling shareholders expropriate the listed firms by the assets and shares acquisitions inside groups in China...|$|R
