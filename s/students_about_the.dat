25|$|Sex {{education}} programs in the United States teach students about sexual health as well as ways to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted teenage pregnancy.

Sex education has many benefits as it educates <b>students</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> human anatomy and teaches the importance of having healthy relationships.
