40|$|In {{the present}} study the decadal {{variability}} in the strength {{and shape of the}} subpolar gyre (SPG) in a 600 -yr preindustrial simulation using the Bergen Climate Model is investigated. The atmospheric influence on the SPG strength is reflected in the variability of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), which is largely controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillation, the first mode of the North Atlantic atmospheric variability. A combination of the amount of LSW, the overflows from the Nordic seas, and the second mode of atmospheric variability, the East Atlantic Pattern, explains 44 % of the modeled decadal variability in the SPG strength. A prior increase in these components leads to an intensified SPG in the western subpolar region. Typically, an increase of one standard deviation (<b>std</b> <b>dev)</b> of the total overflow (<b>1</b> <b>std</b> <b>dev</b> 5 0. 2 Sv; <b>1</b> Sv [106 m 3 s 21) corresponds to an intensification of about one-half <b>std</b> <b>dev</b> of the SPG strength (<b>1</b> <b>std</b> <b>dev</b> 5 2 Sv).

In both groups we analyzed, the major {{size of the}} exposed bone areas, the number of exposed areas, the location on the jaws {{and the presence of}} others associated and severe complications, such as skin fistulas and jaw fractures. We also investigated the possible local aetiology or trigger factor of the lesions. Results: The major size of the bone exposed areas was 2. 29 ± 2. 02 (mean ± <b>std.</b> <b>dev)</b> in group <b>1</b> and 2. 7 ± 2. 9 (mean ± <b>std.</b> <b>dev)</b> in group 2 (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Sensor fusion {{technique}} has been commonly used {{for improving the}} navigation of autonomous agricultural vehicles by means of combining complimentary sensors mounted on such vehicles for the position and attitude angle measurements. In this research, sensor fusion via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was used to integrate the attitude angle estimates from the Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Terrain Compensation Module (TCM) sensor to improve the roll and pitch angle measurements of a self propelled sprayer. The fusion algorithm was also developed to improve the three-dimensional positioning of the sprayer, in particular the elevation measurements of a GPS receiver mounted on the sprayer. Vehicle attitude and field elevation were measured at two speeds, 5. 6 km/h and 9. 6 km/h, using a set of onboard sensors including a real-time kinematic-differential GPS receiver (RTK-DGPS), a TCM sensor and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). A second order auto-regressive (AR) model was developed to model the TCM roll and GPS-based pitch errors. The derived error states were incorporated into the EKF algorithm and the measurement noise covariance was estimated from the AR model, which limited the fine tuning of noise covariance to the process noise covariance only. The EKF estimations were compared with the IMU measurements to validate {{the performance of the}} developed fusion algorithm. For the slow speed test data, the mean and standard deviation of the errors of roll (Mean: - 0. 2244 º, <b>Std.</b> <b>Dev.</b> : <b>1.</b> 471 º) and pitch (Mean: 0. 0597 º, <b>Std.</b> <b>Dev.</b> : 0. 6621 º) from the EKF estimates were reduced considerably compared to that of the errors of roll (Mean: 0. 2157 º, <b>Std.</b> <b>Dev.</b> : 2. 4610 º) and pitch (Mean: 0. 0473 º, <b>Std.</b> <b>Dev.</b> : <b>1.</b> 3230 º) from DEM. Medium speed test data also showed considerable improvement in the attitude angles estimated using the developed EKF algorithm. The fusion algorithm for improving the elevation measurement of the GPS also showed promising results. Thus, the fusion algorithm was effective in improving attitude and the navigational accuracy of the self-propelled agricultural sprayer, which in turn will also facilitate the automatic control of the implements that interact with the soil surface on undulated topographic surfaces...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of atmospheric trace metals {{was conducted in}} Oxford, UK, a small city ~ 60 miles northwest of London, in 2007 and 2008. Concentrations of Sr, Mo, Cd, Pb, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn in aerosol were measured in bulk and size segregated samples. In addition, total gaseous mercury (TGM) concentrations were monitored semi-continuously by cold vapour-atomic fluorescence spectroscopy. Metal concentrations in Oxford were intermediate between previously reported levels of UK rural and urban areas for most metals studies and levels of Cd, Ni and Pb were within European guidelines. Metal concentrations appeared {{to be influenced by}} higher traffic volume on a timescale of hours. The influence of traffic on the aerosols was also suggested by the observation of carbonaceous particles via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Air mass back trajectories suggest air masses arriving in Oxford from London and mainland Europe contained the highest metal concentrations. Aerosol samples collected over Bonfire Weekend, a period of intense firework use and lighting of bonfires in the UK, showed metal concentrations 6 - 46 times higher than at other times. Strontium, a tracer of firework release, was present at higher concentrations and showed a change in its size distribution from the coarse to fine mode over Bonfire Weekend. The presence of an abundance of spherical Sr particles was also confirmed in SEM images. The average TGM concentration in Oxford was 3. 17 ng m⁻³ (<b>st.</b> <b>dev.</b> <b>1.</b> 59) with values recorded between <b>1.</b> 32 and 23. 2 ng m⁻³. This is a higher average value than reported from nearby rural locations, although during periods when air was arriving from the west, similar concentrations to these rural areas were seen in Oxford. Comparison to meteorological data suggests that TGM in Oxford's air is highest when wind is arriving from the east/southeast. This may be due to emissions from London/mainland Europe with a possible contribution from emissions from a local crematorium situated 4 miles east of the sampling site. A diumal pattern was also observed in the TGM data with a minimum concentration during the day when mercury may have been diluted by thermal mixing of the atmospheric boundary layer. Additionally, this diumal pattern may reflect variations in a local source of TGM.

This sample complements previous samples of PSBs by including green valley PSBs with Seyfert-like emission, {{allowing us to}} analyze {{for the first time}} the molecular gas properties of 116 PSBs with a variety of AGN properties. The distribution of molecular gas to stellar mass fractions in PSBs is significantly different than normal star-forming galaxies in the COLD GASS survey. The combined samples of PSBs with Seyfert-like emission line ratios have a gas fraction distribution which is even more significantly different and is broader (~ 0. 03 - 0. 3). Most of them have lower gas fractions than normal star-forming galaxies. We find a highly significant correlation between the WISE 12 micron to 4. 6 micron flux ratios and molecular gas fractions in both PSBs and normal galaxies.

The TBC runs {{parallel to the}} migratory route of various marine species, including green sturgeon, Chinook salmon, and steelhead trout. In July and August 2014, an extensive series of magnetic field measurements were taken using a pair of submerged Geometrics magnetometers towed behind a survey vessel in four locations in the San Francisco estuary along profiles that cross the cable's path; these included the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge (BB), the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge (RSR), the Benicia-Martinez Bridge (Ben) and an area in San Pablo Bay (SP) in which a bridge is not present. In this paper, we apply basic formulas that ideally describe the magnetic field from a DC cable summed vectorially with the background geomagnetic field (in the absence of other sources that would perturb the ambient field) to derive characteristics of the cable that are otherwise not immediately observable. Magnetic field profiles from measurements taken along 170 survey lines were inspected visually for evidence of a distinct pattern representing {{the presence of the}} cable. Many profiles were dominated by field distortions unrelated to the cable caused by bridge structures or other submerged objects, and the cable's contribution to the field was not detectable. BB, with 40 of the survey lines, did not yield usable data for these reasons. The unrelated anomalies could be up to 100 times greater than those from the cable. In total, discernible magnetic field profiles measured from 76 survey lines were regressed against the equations, representing eight days of measurement. The modeled field anomalies due to the cable (the difference between the maximum and minimum field along the survey line at the cable crossing) were virtually identical to the measured values. The modeling yielded a pooled cable depth below the bay floor of 2. 06 m (± <b>1.</b> 46 <b>std</b> <b>dev),</b> and estimated the angle to the horizontal of the imaginary line connecting the cross-sectional center of the cable's two conductors (0. 1143 m apart) as 178. 9 ° ± 61. 9 ° (<b>std</b> <b>dev)</b> for Ben, 78. 6 °± 37. 0 ° (<b>std</b> <b>dev)</b> for RSR, and 139. 9 °± 27. 4 ° (<b>std</b> <b>dev)</b> for SP.

Net mineralization (% change in ∆Z, LD) were as follows (mean (<b>std.</b> <b>dev.)</b> : G <b>1</b> : 44. <b>1</b> (22. 6), 30. 5 (27. 0); G 2 : 30. 0 (7. 4), 29. 4 (10. 5); G 3 : 23. 8 (16. 4), 25. 7 (15. 5). Furthermore, G <b>1</b> was found to cause significantly more remineralization than G 2 (P = 0. 039) and G 3, (P = 0. 002).

40|$|Abstract Background A {{number of}} {{components}} in soy {{appear to have}} anticancer properties, including the isoflavones, genistein and daidzein. The use of soy by women with breast cancer is now being questioned because of the estrogen-like effects of isoflavones and possible interactions with tamoxifen. Clinicians providing nutrition counseling to these women are concerned because the availability of soy foods has increased dramatically {{in the past few}} years. The goal {{of this study was to}} quantify the intake of isoflavones in women with breast cancer. Methods A cross-sectional study of 100 women with breast cancer treated at Cancer Treatment Centers of America ® between 09 / 03 and 02 / 04. Each patient completed a soy food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was scored by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Demographic and clinical predictors of soy intake were evaluated using one-way non-parametric Mann Whitney test and non-parametric spearman's rank correlation. Results Mean age was 50. 5 years (<b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> = 9. 4; range 31 – 70) and mean BMI was 27. 3 kg/m 2 (<b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> = 6. 75; range 17 – 59). Genistein and Daidzein consumption was limited to 65 patients with a mean intake of 11. 6 mg/day (<b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> = 21. 9; range 0 – 97. 4) and 7. 6 mg/day (<b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> = 14. 1; range 0 – 68. 9) respectively. Soy milk (37 %) and pills containing soy, isoflavones, or "natural" estrogen (24 %) were the two biggest contributors to isoflavone intake. Conclusion Our study suggests that the isoflavone intake of breast cancer patients at our hospital was quite variable. Thirty-five patients reported no soy intake. The mean daily intake of 11. 6 mg genistein and 7. 4 mg daidzein, is the equivalent of less than <b>1</b> / 4 cup of tofu per day. This amount is higher than what has been previously reported in non-Asian American women. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{heterojunction}} formation between GaAs 100 and CuInS 2 is investigated using {{ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy}} UPS, X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS, and {{low energy}} electron diffraction LEED. Thin layers of CuInS 2 films were deposited in a step by step process on wet chemically pretreated GaAs 100 surfaces by molecular beam epitaxy MBE with a total upper thickness limit of the films of 60 nm. The film growth starts from a sulfur rich GaAs 100 surface. XPS core level analysis of the substrate and film reveals initially a transitory growth regime with the formation of a Ga containing chalcopyrite phase. With increasing film thickness, a change in stoichiometry from Cu poor to Cu rich composition is observed. The evaluation of the LEED data shows the occurrence of a recrystallization process where the film orientation follows that of the substrate with the epitaxial relation GaAs 100 CuInS 2 001. On the completed junction with a CuInS 2 film thickness of 60 nm, the band discontinuities of the GaAs 100 CuInS 2 structure measured with XPS and UPS were determined as <b>DEV</b> 0. <b>1</b> 0. <b>1</b> eV and DEC 0. 0 0. <b>1</b> eV, thus showing a type II band alignmen...|$|R

A total 232 patients {{of the eye}} department at Hospital Tuanku Ja’afar, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia were recruited over 9 weeks. Participants were divided into ARMD (Non-Neovascular ARMD, and Neovascular ARMD) and control groups. 107 participants with non-neovascular ARMD, 6 with neovascular ARMD, and 119 controls participated in the study. The control patients had a similar average Serum Uric Acid level to the average of all patients with ARMD (P = 0. 617). Control group: mean 299. 19 µmol/l ± <b>std</b> <b>dev.</b> 89. 847 µmol/l. ARMD group: mean 302. 53 µmol/l ± <b>std</b> <b>dev.</b> 80. 794 µmol/l. The average serum uric acid levels were higher in patients with neovascular ARMD (median = 397 mean ± <b>std</b> <b>dev</b> = 389. 67 ± 38 µmol/l) than in the non-neovascular ARMD group (288. 5 µmol/l, 297. 86 ± 80. 26 µmol/l), and control group (295. 5 µmol/l, 299. 19 ± 89. 95 µmol/l). Comparing the standardised serum uric acid levels {{in the control group}} (Median = 0. 5) against the two ARMD groups separately, {{there was no significant difference}} to the non-neovascular group (P = 0. 448) but there was a difference significant to the neovascular ARMD group (P = 0. 044). The neovascular and non-neovascular ARMD groups had median CRP value of 0. 25 mg/l and were not significantly different. There is no association between serum uric acid levels and ARMD as a whole. There is potentially an association between serum uric acid and neovascular ARMD, an association needs to be established further. There is no association between serum CRP and ARMD...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{randomization}} {{of nuclear}} counting data into N replicate sets {{is the basis}} of a simple and effective method for estimating error propagation through complex analysis algorithms such as those using neural networks or tomographic image reconstructions. The error distributions of properly simulated replicate data sets mimic those of actual replicate measurements and can be used to estimate the <b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> for an assay along with other statistical quantities. We have used this technique to estimate the standard deviation in radionuclide masses determined using the tomographic gamma scanner (TGS) and combined thermal/epithermal neutron (CTEN) methods. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by a comparison of our Monte Carlo error estimates with the error distributions in actual replicate measurements and simulations of measurements. We found that the <b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> estimated this way quickly converges to an accurate value on average and has a predictable error distribution similar to N actual repeat measurements. The main drawback of the Monte Carlo method is that N additional analyses of the data are required, which may be prohibitively time consuming with slow analysis algorithms...|$|R

It {{has been shown that}} lower limb amputees can improve certain gait characteristics when they perceive additional information about the kinematics and kinetics of their prosthetic leg. In this paper, we address the question whether it is feasible to provide centre of pressure location information via electrotactile displays by exploiting the phantom sensation phenomenon, where relative intensity of two electrode pairs is used to encode position between them, creating a single illusory stimulus. Four healthy subjects were asked to identify different locations or movement patterns of the illusory stimulus on a discrete scale under static and dynamic conditions. These stimuli resembled CoP patterns in different locomotor activities. An average recognition accuracy of 73 % (<b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> 17 %) was achieved under static conditions, and of 71 % (<b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> 11 %) under dynamic conditions. This indicates that the proposed display and mapping can be used to present centre of pressure location, and future work will focus on evaluation with patients...|$|R
30|$|Agreement with {{statements}} {{associated with}} feelings of ‘assimilation’ did not see any change at all; however, ‘separation’ saw a reduction (reduction seen as a favorable direction) from a 1.68 mean/ 0.48 <b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> from the first survey to a 1.42 mean/ 0.51 <b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> from the second survey. In regard to the feelings/statements in the survey surrounding that of integration (again, the most desirable area of acculturation balance), the participants showed an extremely slight improvement/increase. Integration levels from the first survey for group A had a mean of 1.63 /std. dev of 0.83 from the first survey and a 1.68 mean/std. dev. of 0.82. This equates to a single respondent in agreement of one additional statement related to feelings of ‘integration’. The final area of acculturation balance, ‘marginalization,’ saw a slight decrease (decrease being favorable) from a mean of 0.89 /std. dev. of 0.66 to a mean of 0.79 /std. dev. of 0.71. These findings demonstrate that group A did have desirable change in relation to acculturation balance overall over the 3 -month period.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel topo-bathymetric laser profiler. The sensor system (RIEGL BathyCopter) {{comprises}} a laser range finder, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, a control unit, and digital cameras mounted on an octocopter UAV (RiCOPTER). The range finder operates on the time-of-flight measurement principle and utilizes very short laser pulses (< <b>1</b> ns) {{in the green}} domain of the spectrum (λ= 532 nm) for measuring distances to both the water surface and the river bottom. For assessing the precision and accuracy of the system an experiment {{was carried out in}} October 2015 at a pre-alpine river (Pielach in Lower Austria). A 200 m longitudinal section and 12 river cross sections were measured with the BathyCopter sensor system at a flight altitude of 15 - 20 m above ground level and a measurement rate of 4 kHz. The 3 D laser profiler points were compared with independent, quasi-simultaneous data acquisitions using (i) the RIEGL VUX <b>1</b> -UAV lightweight topographic laser scanning system (bare earth, water surface) and (ii) terrestrial survey (river bed). Over bare earth the laser profiler heights have a <b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> of 3 cm, the water surface height appears to be underestimated by 5 cm, and river bottom heights differ from the reference measurements by 10 cm with a <b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> of 13 cm. When restricting the comparison to laser profiler bottom points and reference measurements with a lateral offset below <b>1</b> m, the values improve to 4 cm bias with a <b>std.</b> <b>dev.</b> of 6 cm. We report additionally on challenges in comparing UAV-borne to terrestrial profiles. Based on the accuracy and the small footprint (3. 5 cm at the water surface) we concluded that the acquired 3 D points can potentially serve as input data (river bed geometry, grain roughness) and validation data (water surface, water depth) for hydrodynamic-numerical models...|$|R
