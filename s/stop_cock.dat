They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a <b>stop</b> <b>cock</b> in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

To provide for any malfunction in the water supply, a hand-operated <b>stop</b> <b>cock</b> was provided on the fresh water tank.|$|E

Suddenly, in conflict with her desire to remain indefinitely talking with this strange man, Janet felt an intense impulse to leave. She could bear the conversation no longer, she might burst into tears--such was the extraordinary effect he had produced on her.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of 1954 the SE range all {{received}} raised bases as well as cosmetic updates and changes. By 1958 all but the MM1 had received the new vaporising spirit burners, which had first appeared in 1957 {{with the introduction of}} the all new twin cylinder SE3. Again there was another round of cosmetic changes with updated boiler bands and fireboxes. Combinations of these old and new parts {{can be found in the}} 'transitional' engines of the late 1950s period (e.g. the SE1, 2 and MM2). By the mid-1960s the engines were using pop rivets for the engine frame securing method (along with the entire Mamod range) as well more cosmetic changes. In 1967 the SE range received its next major update with the introduction of the SE1a and SE2a replacing the SE1 and 2. The superheating was gone and the simplified pipe work was all new. The SE2a also got a reversing lever like the 'MEC1' Meccano engine of 1965. Other details such as paint colour, boiler end cap and whistle design as well as decal layout were gradually changed. One point worth mentioning was the fact that from 1967 until about 1972 the Se1, 2 and 3 could be found with a different green paint on their engine frames. This paint was similar to a hammered effect type finish and was probably purchased as a job lot by the Managing Director at the time, Eric Malins. Steve Malins has confirmed that this was the case and his father would try anything new or changes which made production cheaper. The Minor range never received this paint finish. The SE3 was unchanged bar the introduction of the Griffin and George (educational suppliers) version in 1969. This engine was the only real variation to Mamod's biggest post-war stationary engine. It featured the very first silver soldered boiler (at the insistence of G&G) and also had a steam pipe union nut at the boiler instead of the usual <b>stop</b> <b>cock.</b> It carried an extra foil G&G lozenge logo by the engine too. About 2,000 were made until about mid-1970s. It was only sold to schools and came complete with a comprehensive manual for using the engine in lab experiments. Later examples of this engine were standard SE3s but carrying a revised G&G logo of a different design. This Griffin badge could sometimes be found placed alongside the warning labels applied to all stationary engines in 1976 explaining the use of inappropriate fuel containers and refuelling techniques.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out as a study of flow rate using a single channel {{acoustic}} emission (AE) technique. The objective of this project is to study the effect of ball valve, brass gate valve and brass <b>stop</b> <b>cock</b> valve to flow rate using AE technique. A test rig consists of the circumferential galvanized steel pipe, ball valve, gate valve and <b>stop</b> <b>cock</b> valve to run the experiments. The fluid used was water throughout the experiments. The pressure of water was controlled by a valve. The source of AE signal was from the valve and it was captured using AE sensor {{with the help of}} Acoustic Emission Detector 2. 1. 3 software. For all valve conditions, the value of hits, count and RMS (average, maximum and minimum) were recorded and analyzed. All the value recorded were compared among the ball valve, gate valve and <b>stop</b> <b>cock</b> valve. The results were gained from 10 marked points each for all type of valve. The result showed that there was no AE activity on the pipe without valve, the AE activities are greater for high pressure or full close valve. In addition from the RMS against distance graft, RMS value increased when pressure is increased. From the flow rate against RMS graf show that flow rate will decrease when RMS is increased...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} distal {{perfusion}} of the limb using a cannula, the limb can have ischemic events {{if there is}} an undetected kink or clot anywhere in the line or thrombus in the artery. There are several ways to monitor and assess the limb ischemia. Monitoring for clinical signs of limb ischemia like temperature change and pallor is reliable and mandatory. We report a method where we used color Doppler to document the blood flow. Curvilinear vascular probe of an echo machine is used to identify the flow in the distal femoral artery of the lower limb.. As we have demonstrated in the video attached, once flow to the distal limb perfusion system is shut off by closing the three way <b>stop</b> <b>cock,</b> we can appreciate the immediate cessation of flow in the artery by Doppler...|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} mandated a grip {{safety and}} a manual safety. A grip safety, sear disconnect, slide <b>stop,</b> half <b>cock</b> position, and manual safety (located {{on the left}} rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s. Several companies have developed a firing pin block safety. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith & Wesson, use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety.

Ere long the sound assumed the definite tone of footsteps, and the dragon fancy seemed about to become a reality when he beheld a long narrow thing of uncertain form emerging from the darkness.|$|R

5000|$|Gen. Howard's report, dated Dec. 7, 1864, {{details the}} {{destruction}} that he witnessed. His report states that several major buildings were not destroyed, including the City Hall, the Gate City hotel, the Masonic Hall, the Medical College, {{and several of}} the churches located downtown. His report also relays to Gov. Brown that [...] "The property of the State was destroyed by fire, yet a vast deal of valuable material remains in the ruins. Three-fourths of the bricks are good and will be suitable for rebuilding if placed under shelter before freezing weather. There is a quantity of brass in the journals of burned cars and in the ruins of the various machinery of the extensive railroad shops; also, a valuable amount of copper from the guttering of the State depot, the flue pipes of destroyed engines, <b>stop</b> <b>cocks</b> of machinery, etc." [...] His report also states that many businesses, private homes, and several churches were destroyed. In addition to the destruction caused by the war, Gen. Howard notes that: [...] "There were about 250 wagons in the city on my arrival, loading with pilfered plunder; pianoes, mirrors, furniture of all kinds, iron, hides without number, and an incalculable amount of other things, very valuable at the present time. This exportation of stolen property had been going on ever since the place had been abandoned by the enemy. Bushwhackers, robbers and deserters, and citizens from the surrounding country for a distance of fifty miles have been engaged in this dirty work." ...|$|R

5000|$|Hubert's confession, at first, was of {{starting}} a fire in Westminster. However, this story proved unsatisfactory, and his confession changed upon learning that the fire never reached Westminster. Having learned that the fire started in Pudding Lane, {{in the house of}} the baker Thomas Farriner (or Farynor), he then claimed to have thrown a crude fire grenade through the open window of the Farriner bakery. [...] He claimed to have acted with accomplices, who <b>stopped</b> the water <b>cocks</b> to sabotage the effort to put out the fire. Hubert's confessed motive was, apparently, that he was a French spy, and an agent of the Pope.|$|R
40|$|The {{apparatus}} used by Kazda and Dunn for {{the determination}} of the critical photo electric potential of mercury has been completely reconstructed. The <b>stop</b> <b>cocks,</b> the grease of which was the source of contaminating vapors, have been replaced by mercury cut offs and the high temperature cement used {{in the construction of the}} photo cell has been replaced by a graduated quartz-pyrex seal. Fresh clean mercury was returned to the still. With this new apparatus and under these new working conditions the long wave length limit for running mercury has been found to be 2735 [angstroms]. The conditions within the apparatus have been found to be practically free from contaminating vapors so that the critical frequency has been found for stationary mercury, namely 2375 [plus or minus] 10 [angstroms], which is in entire agreement with Kazda for flowing mercury. This impurity in the old apparatus caused the photo current to increase four fold its original value in thirteen to twenty minutes after the still was turned off. It then slowly receded, falling below its initial value in three or four days. This increase in the photo current was accompanied by a raise in the threshold to 2850 [angstroms], hence falling in time to a constant value 2680 [angstroms]. In the apparatus as it now stands this same four fold increase is not reached until some eighty hours after the still is turned off and remains perfectly constant indefinitely thereafter. The long wave length limit for this maximum sensitivity was found to be 2910 [angstroms]. The effect of hydrogen, helium and argon in contact with the surface and dissolved in the body of the mercury was found to have no influence whatever upon the photo electric behavior of the mercury or upon the rate of rise of sensitivity upon turning off the still except that each had a marked cleansing effect in reducing the concentration of the impurity which slowly contaminates the surface. Nitrogen in contact with the surface was found to have no effect except that the maximum threshold reached when nitrogen was present was 28 OO[angstroms]. Water vapor at very low pressure inhibits the action of the sensitizing impurity and gives a threshold of 2800 [angstroms] after being in contact with the surface for seventy hours. Oxygen has a decided reducing effect upon the threshold value, bringing it down to 2555 [angstroms] in eighteen hours. Another fifty-two hours exposure to oxygen does not materially change this value. Air, at atmospheric pressure, in contact with the surface gave this same threshold value, namely, 2555 [angstroms]...|$|R
5000|$|... the New York City Subway has [...] {{cars on the}} roster. The system {{maintains}} {{two separate}} fleets of cars: one for the IRT routes, the other for the BMT/IND routes. All BMT/IND equipment is about 10 ft wide and either 60 ft or 75 ft long whereas IRT equipment is approximately 8 ft wide and 51 ft long. The A Division and B Division trains operate only in their own division; operating in the other division is not allowed because the IRT sections have narrower tunnel segments, tighter curves, and tighter platform clearances than the BMT/IND sections. IRT Division trains would have an unacceptably large gap between the platform and train if they were allowed in the BMT/IND Division, and BMT/IND trains would not fit in the IRT tunnels and stations. The safety train <b>stop</b> (trip <b>cock)</b> mechanism between divisions is also incompatible, being located {{on opposite sides of}} the track and train in each division. Service and maintenance trains are composed of IRT sized cars, do not carry passengers, and can operate on either division as the safety train stop is built on both sides of the trucks. However, all rolling stock, in either A or B Division, runs on the same 4 foot 8.5 inch mm gauge.|$|R
60|$|He was {{interrupted}} by the hunter, who held up his finger with an expressive gesture for silence. He then moved softly along {{the margin of the}} road, keeping his eyes steadfastly fixed on the branches of a pine. When he had obtained such a position as he wished, he <b>stopped,</b> and, <b>cocking</b> his rifle, threw one leg far behind him, and stretching his left arm to its utmost extent along the barrel of his piece, he began slowly to raise its muzzle in a line with the straight trunk of the tree. The eyes of the group in the sleigh naturally preceded the movement of the rifle, and they soon discovered the object of Natty’s aim. On a small dead branch of the pine, which, at the distance of seventy feet from the ground, shot out horizontally, immediately beneath the living members of the tree, sat a bird, that in the vulgar language of the country was indiscriminately called a pheasant or a partridge. In size, it was but little smaller than a common barn-yard fowl. The baying of the dogs, and the conversation that had passed near the root of the tree on which it was perched, had alarmed the bird, which was now drawn up near the body of the pine, with a head and neck so erect as to form nearly a straight line with its legs. As soon as the rifle bore on the victim, Natty drew his trigger, and the partridge fell from its height with a force that buried it in the snow.|$|R
