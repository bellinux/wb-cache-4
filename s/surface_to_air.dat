5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|By 21 June 2011, the Libyan {{government}} had dubiously {{claimed to have}} successfully shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these claims and no Apache losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released information on {{the first month of}} Apache combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of <b>Surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>Air</b> missiles (SAM), and the presence of civilians, enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the Apache and the Eurofighter Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.|$|E
5|$|The {{evacuation}} proceeded without {{interference from}} the PAVN. Aircraft flying air {{cover for the}} evacuation reported being tracked with <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> radar {{in the vicinity of}} Bien Hoa Air Base (which had fallen to the PAVN on 25 April), but there were no missile launches. The Hanoi leadership, reckoning that completion of the evacuation would lessen the risk of American intervention, had apparently instructed General Dũng not to target the airlift itself. Members of the police in Saigon had been promised evacuation in exchange for protecting the American evacuation buses and control of the crowds in the city during the evacuation. Disgruntled ARVN troops repeatedly hit American helicopters with small arms fire throughout the evacuation, without causing serious damage. Despite receiving sporadic NVA AAA fire, USAF and USN aircraft made no attacks on AAA or SAM sites during the evacuation.|$|E

25|$|Development of the Regulus II {{was well}} under way when the program was {{canceled}} {{in favor of the}} UGM-27 Polaris SLBM (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile) system, which gave unprecedented accuracy as well as allowing the launch submarine to stay submerged and covert. Prototype and initial production missiles were later converted to Vought KD2U-1 supersonic target drones for the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force, which used the KD2U-1 during tests of the Boeing IM-99/CIM-10 Bomarc SAM (<b>Surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>Air</b> Missile).|$|E

In situ processing of microelectronics may permit the fabrication ofsemiconductor devices by dramatically simpler and more precise methods than those of current technology [1). These processingmethods arebased onnewand potentially revolutionary nonlithographic technologies, and rely heavily on the still developing area of beam-controlled techniques for microfabrication...|$|R
25|$|In November 1961 {{the unit}} was re-formed as 120 Squadron of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The {{squadron}} {{was equipped with}} Nike-Hercules <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> missiles and formed part of 1 Guided Missile Wing (Groep Geleide Wapens; GGW) along with 118, 119 and 121 Squadrons. The Nike-Hercules missiles were armed with nuclear warheads and were provided to the Netherlands and other NATO countries by the United States. From August 1964, 120 Squadron was stationed at Borgholzhausen in West Germany. It was transferred to 12 GGW in May 1975 but remained at Borgholzhausen. 12 GGW also included 118, 220 and 223 Squadrons. The squadron was disbanded during 1983.|$|E

25|$|The UK {{was already}} a major {{supplier}} of arms to Saudi Arabia prior to Al Yamamah. In 1964 The British Aircraft Corporation conducted demonstration flights of their Lightning in Riyadh and in 1965 Saudi Arabia signed a letter of intent for the supply of Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft as well as Thunderbird <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> missiles. The main contract was signed in 1966 for 40 Lightnings and 25 Strikemasters (eventually raised to 40). In 1973 the Saudi government {{signed an agreement with}} the British government which specified BAC as the contractor for all parts of the defence system (AEI was previously contracted to supply the radar equipment and Airwork Services provided servicing and training). Overall spending by the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) was over £10 billion GBP (SAR 57 Billion).|$|E

25|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the {{squadron}} continued to fly surveillance and escort flights over northern New Guinea during September and October 1945. The Dutch wished to move No. 18 and No. 120 Squadrons to Java, however, and to facilitate this the RAAF element of {{the squadron}} was disbanded on 30 October 1945. The last RAAF personnel left the squadron in February 1946 and No. 120 Squadron was assigned to the Netherlands East Indies Air Force (NEIAF) on 20 June, thereby ending its relationship with the RAAF. The squadron retained its designation of No. 120 Squadron of the NEIF, and saw combat in the Indonesian National Revolution. It was disbanded on 1 March 1950 following the Dutch defeat. The unit was re-formed as 120 Squadron of the Royal Netherlands Air Force in 1961 as an air defence unit equipped with nuclear-tipped Nike-Hercules <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> missiles and continued in this role until it was disbanded during 1983.|$|E
25|$|Surface-to-Air Missiles, Night Vision Devices, Firearms to Foreign Terrorists: On July 10, 2008, Erik Wotulo, {{a retired}} Indonesian Marine Corps general, {{was convicted in}} the District of Maryland for {{conspiracy}} to provide material support to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a designated terrorist organization, and money laundering. Beginning in April 2006, Wotulo conspired with Haji Subandi, Haniffa Bin Osman and Thirunavukarasu Varatharasa to export state-of-the-art firearms, machine guns and ammunition, <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> missiles, night vision goggles and other military weapons to the Tamil Tigers operating in Sri Lanka, {{to be used to}} fight against Sri Lankan government forces. The conspirators contacted an undercover business located in Maryland about the sale of military weapons. In September 2006, the defendants arrived in Guam, where they met with undercover officers to inspect and take possession of the weapons, and were eventually arrested. Two additional defendants, Rinehard Rusli and Helmi Soedirdja, pleaded guilty to export and money laundering violations on January 30, 2007, as part of a related plot to provide military night vision devices to the Indonesian military.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{cancelling}} the DDL project, {{the government}} endorsed the RAN's requirement for new destroyer-type warships and requested {{a review of}} existing foreign designs to find a replacement. The process of evaluating new designs was managed by what had been the DDL project office, and in line with the government's priorities it initially focused on selecting affordable warships of a proven design for further consideration. A large number of designs were studied by the project office, and the United States' s and a variant of the British Type 42 destroyer armed with SM-1 <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> missiles were eventually short listed for detailed evaluation. The project team found that the Type 42 was the only design capable of meeting the Navy's requirement, and stated that the Oliver Hazard Perry class was [...] "a second rate escort that falls short of the DDL requirements on virtually every respect". Despite this, there were serious concerns over whether {{it would be possible to}} fit SM-1 missiles to the Type 42, and this led the government to approve the purchase of two Oliver Hazard Perry ships from the United States in April 1974.|$|E

Equipped with both anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles, as well as area defence and point defence <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> missiles, torpedoes and a pair of 100 mm guns, the ship gave the Soviet Union a visible platform for power projection in the immediate absence of large aircraft carriers. Following the appearance of Kirov, two more units, [...] and , were commissioned at four-year intervals. When Frunze was commissioned in 1984, it was seen to have a different weapons fit to Kirov, with the pair of single 100mm guns swapped for a twin 130mm turret, and the SS-N-14 Silex ASW missile system deleted in favour of adding eight SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM launchers.
