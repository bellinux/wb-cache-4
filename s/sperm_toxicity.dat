40|$|Ficopomatus enigmaticus is an {{ubiquitous}} fouling reef-forming species, easy {{to sample}} and recognize, diecious with gamete spawning along different seasons in different salinity conditions. Due to its characteristics {{it could become}} a good candidate for the monitoring of both marine and brackish waters. The suitability of F. enigmaticus as a promising model organism in ecotoxicological bioassays was evaluated by a <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> and a larval development assay. The fertilization rate in different salinity conditions (range 5 - 35 ‰) was first assessed in order to detect the salinity threshold within which profitably perform the assays. Afterward copper (Cu 2 +), cadmium (Cd 2 +), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 4 -n-nonylphenol (NP) were used as reference toxicants in exposure experiments with spermatozoids (<b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> assay) and zygotes (larval development assay). A dose-response effect was obtained for all tested toxicants along all salinity conditions except for 5 ‰ salinity condition where a too low (< 30 %) fertilization rate was observed. NP showed the highest degree of toxicity both in <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> and larval development assay. In some cases the results, expressed as EC 50 values at 35 ‰ salinity condition, were similar to those observed in the literature for marine organisms such as the sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) and the marine serpulid Hydroides elegans, while the exposure of F. enigmaticus spermatozoids' to Cd 2 + and NP resulted in toxicity effects several orders of magnitude higher than observed in P. lividus. Spermatozoids resulted to be slightly more sensitive then zygotes to all different toxicants...|$|E
40|$|While {{numerous}} studies have documented the ovotoxic effect of galactose, few available studies on male gonad are {{of the opinion that}} it seems to fully escape the toxic effects galactose exerts on the ovary. The present study was therefore designed to further investigate the effects of galactose on male sperm parameters and some reproductive hormones. Thirty male albino rats (200 – 250  g) were randomly divided in a blinded fashion into 6 groups (n =  5). Group A received normal saline and served as control. Groups B, C, D, E and F received 3  mg/kg, 10  mg/kg, 20  mg/kg, 30  mg/kg, and 40  mg/kg of galactose respectively through oral gavage for 42  days. The results showed that chronic administration of galactose promotes <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> by reducing epididymal sperm count, motility and percentage of morphologically normal sperm. Moreover, galactose increased luteinizing hormone but slightly decreased testosterone and had no effect on follicle stimulating hormone. Galactose also caused a slight decrease in superoxide dismutase and increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity but no effect on catalase. The present study thus showed that chronic administration of galactose could promote <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> which could be mediated partly by oxidative stress. Moreover, the response of the hormones is similar to that in premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in female galactosemic model...|$|E
40|$|Background: The role of {{oxidative}} stress in endosulfan-induced reproductive toxicity has been implicated. This study {{was performed to}} evaluate the possible protective effect of vitamins E and C, against endosulfan-induced reproductive toxicity in rats. Methods: Fifty adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (n= 10 each). The groups included a control receiving vehicle, a group treated with endosulfan (10 mg/kg/day) alone, and three endosulfan-treated group receiving vitamin C (20 mg/kg/day), vitamin E (200 mg/kg/day), or vitamine C+vitamin E at the same doses. After 10 days of treatment, sperm parameters, plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), plasma testosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the testis were determined. Results: Oral administration of endosulfan caused {{a reduction in the}} sperm motility, viability, daily sperm production (DSP) and increased the number of sperm with abnormal chromatin condensation. Endosulfan administration increased testis MDA and plasma LDH. Supplementation of vitamin C and vitamin E to endosulfan-treated rats reduced the toxic effect of endosulfan on sperm parameters and lipid peroxidation in the testis. Vitamin E was more protective than vitamin C in reducing the adverse effects of the endosulfan. Conclusion: The findings data suggest that administration of vitamins C and E ameliorated the endosulfan-induced {{oxidative stress}} and <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> in rat. The effect of vitamin E in preventing endosulfan-induced <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> was superior to that of vitamin C...|$|E
40|$|A {{reliable}} <b>sperm</b> cell <b>toxicity</b> {{test procedure}} {{has been developed}} for the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. The sensitivity and discriminatory ability of the test were investigated with regard to surfactants and their biotransformation products. Aromatic and aliphatic surfactants of anionic (linear alkylbenzene sulfonates [LAS]) and nonionic (alcohol polyethoxylates [AE] and nonylphenol polyethoxylates [NPE]) types and their aerobic biodegradation products, i. e., sulfophenylcarboxylates (SPC), polyethylene glycols (PEG), carboxylated polyethylene glycols (PEGC), carboxylated AE (AEC), and nonylphenol (NP), were examined in order to elucidate the influence of their molecular structure on toxicity. Experimental results reveal that the sperm cell test showed good discriminatory ability among all tested compounds, median effective concentration (EC 50) values differing by about four orders of magnitude. The toxicity of anionic surfactants depends {{on the length of}} the alkyl chain and that of nonionic surfactants is due to their length and branching. Much lower toxicity was shown by aerobic biodegradation products in comparison with that of their parent compounds, with the exception of NP. The obtained EC 50 s were comparable with available literature data and constitute new toxicity data regarding surfactants for sea urchins...|$|R
40|$|Background & aim: Diazinon (DZN) is an {{organophosphate}} pesticide {{that can}} cause male infertility via the production of free radicals. Considering the antioxidant properties of Nigella sativa (NS) seed, the effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of NS seed were investigated on spermatogenesis in toxicity induced by DZN in male wistar rats. Methods: Thirty adult male rats were used and randomly divided into 6 groups (n= 6) : the negative control group received nothing, the sham group received corn oil and saline, the positive control group received DZN at a dose of 16 mg/kg body weight, the experimental groups 1 and 2 received DZN and doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight NS extract; respectively and the experimental group 3 received a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight NS extract. All of treatment was done via gavage for two months. After 2 months, sperm parameters such as sperm count, motility and morphology of sperms were evaluated and the testicular tissue sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Data were analyzed using Prism Software Version 5 and One-way ANOVA and Tukey ̕s post hoc test. Results: DZN (16 mg/kg) significantly decreased the number (P< 0. 01) and motility of sperms (P< 0. 001) compared to the sham group but didn’t significantly alter sperm viability and morphology compared to the sham group. The doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight of NS extract increased sperms counts (P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 001; respectively) compared to DZN group. NS did not significantly change the sperm motility {{in the presence of}} DZN. Histological studies showed the number of primary spermatocytes and spermatids significantly reduced in DZN group compared to the sham group) P< 0. 05). In treatment groups with the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg of NS extract, a significant increase was observed in the number of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes and spermatids compared to DZN group) P< 0. 05). In the experimental group 3 increased the number of sperm compared to sham group) P< 0. 05) but didn’t change testis tissue. Conclusion: The results indicated protective effects of NS extract on testis tissue which may increase spermatogonia, primary spermatocyte, spermatids and the number of <b>sperms</b> in <b>toxicity</b> induced by DZN in male rats but no change sperm motility.  ...|$|R

The male rats were divided into five groups of six rats each. The rats were administered with MSG and vitamin C treatments for 65 days. Vitamin C attenuated the MSG induced toxicity on weight of testes and epididymes, sperm motility, count and sperm head abnormality.

40|$|Endogenous {{nitric oxide}} (NO) is an {{important}} functional mediator in several physiological systems, including the reproductive system. However, when generated in excessive amounts for long periods, mainly during immunological reactions, NO is cytotoxic and cytostatic for invading microbes, {{as well as for}} the cells generating it and the tissues present around it. Since infertility associated with urogenital tract infection in males and females is also accompanied by reduced sperm motility and viability, it is possible that reduced fertility in these patients is due to NO-induced <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity.</b> We therefore evaluated the direct effects of NO, chemically derived from S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 0. 012 - 0. 6 mM) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 0. 25 - 2. 5 mM), on the motility and viability of human spermatozoa. Furthermore, we tested whether inhibition of NO synthesis prevents sperm motility and viability by incubating washed total cells present in the semen (spermatozoa, round cells) with N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME), a NO synthesis inhibitor. Treatment of purified spermatozoa with SNAP or SNP decreased forward progressive sperm motility and straight line velocity, and also increased the percentage of immotile spermatozoa in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the percentage of immotile spermatozoa positively correlated with the percentage of dead spermatozoa. In contrast to freshly prepared SNAP, SNAP preincubated for 48 h had no effect on the motility and viability of the spermatozoa. Furthermore, as compared to untreated controls, a significantly higher percentage of forward progressive sperm motility as well as viability (P < 0. 05) was maintained in washed semen incubated with L-NAME (0. 15 mM). Seminal plasma concentrations of nitrite-nitrate (stabile metabolites of NO/ 106 spermatozoa correlated positively (P < 0. 05) with the percentage of immotile spermatozoa. Our results suggest that NO can cause <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> as well as inhibit sperm motility. In conclusion, excessive NO synthesis in response to infection and inflammation could be an important factor contributing to functional change of the spermatozoa, leading to their dysfunction and to infertilit...|$|E
40|$|Lipid peroxidation {{products}} such as the naturally occurring aldehyde 4 -hydroxynonenal (4 -HNE) {{are known to be}} cytotoxic toward different cell types, including spermatozoa. In order to understand this at the molecular level, we have employed a proteomic approach to characterize direct 4 -HNE adducts on human spermatozoa. Several proteins were identified to be of particular interest, including aldehyde labeling of histone methyltransferase and dynein heavy chain. In addition, we found that 4 -HNE bound to part of the activation segment, cysteine residue 199, of protein kinase A (PKA). Interestingly, at low levels, addition of 4 -HNE had a stimulatory effect on PKA. However, this did not correlate to increased phosphotyrosine levels during capacitation. This data explains the link between reactive oxygen species and <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Given that epigenetic regulation is likely affected in oxidative-stressed spermatozoa, this data show that spermatozoa appear to shut down under these conditions before reaching the egg...|$|E
40|$|Fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} Fusarium species that exerts its toxic effect through {{interference with the}} sphingolipid pathway by inhibiting ceramide synthase. A FB 1 -dependent <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> was reported in boars. No information on FB 1 -related reproductive toxicity in stallions, the most sensitive animal species, has been reported. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the in vitro toxicity of FB 1 on fresh and frozen-thawed equine spermatozoa by analyzing sperm viability, chromatin stability (SCSA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by flow cytometry and sperm motility by CASA system. Fumonisin B 1 did not affect viability of fresh spermatozoa after 2 h exposure up to 25 μM. Damage on sperm chromatin structure was observed only in one frozen sample after exposure up to 2. 5 x 10 ⁻⁵ μM FB 1 without associated increase of ROS. Increase of ROS, at FB 1 levels up to 2. 5 x 10 ⁻⁴ μM, was found on another frozen-thawed sperm sample, may be as a consequence of seminal plasma removal.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the sperm parameters such as cauda epididymis weight, sperm count, sperm morphology and sperm DNA stability of adult CF- 1 male mice treated daily (oral exposure) with the toxic sodium arsenite (As, 7. 0 mg/kg/body weight); Melatonin (Me, 10. 0 mg/kg/bw), Me (10. 0 mg/kg/bw) plus As (7. 0 mg/kg/bw) and Negative Control (NaCl 0. 9 %) to assess acute (8. 3 days), chronic (33. 2 days) and recovery of testicular damage (66. 4 days). Arsenic decreases {{the number of}} sperm from chronic treatment (33. 2 days) and this effect continued until 66. 4 days of treatment. The toxic effect of As also altered the morphology of spermatozoa in all treatment periods {{when compared to the}} negative control group. However, Metalonin induced protective effects in periods of 33. 2 and 66. 4 days of treatment. Additionally, the stability of DNA was significantly affected by arsenic in all periods, but the chronic treatment (33. 2 days) in the AsMe revealed increased stability compared to the group treated with arsenic only.

Forty-eight young adult male mice (8 - 12 weeks) were randomly divided into six groups including control and test groups. The control group received normal saline orally, and the test groups were treated MTX (20 mg kg- 1, ip, once weekly), MTX + CMFE (250 mg kg- 1), MTX + CMFE (500 mg kg- 1), MTX + CMFE (1000 mg kg- 1), and MTX + Vit E (100 IU kg- 1, po) for 35 consecutive days. On day 35, after euthanasia the epididymal sperms were isolated. Then the total mean sperm count, sperm viability and motility were determined. The total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) of all experimental groups were also evaluated. The MTX-treated animals showed a significant changes in all parameters of sperm quality assessment compared to the control group. Both Vit E and CMFE were able to protect from MTX-induced effects on sperm maturity and DNA damage. Co-administration of MTX and CMFE and/or Vit E resulted in protection from MTX-reduced TAOC. In conclusion, these data suggested that MTX administration could adversely affect the sperm quality.

40|$|Oxidative {{stress in}} known to {{contribute}} to the male reproductive dysfunction induced by mercury (Hg). Our study tested the hypothesis that the egg white hydrolysate (EWH), a potent antioxidant in vitro, is able to prevent the effects of prolonged Hg exposure on male reproductive system in rats. For this, rats were treated for 60 days with: a) Untreated - saline solution (i. m.); b) Hydrolysate - EWH (1  g/kg/day, gavage); c) Mercury - HgCl (1 st dose 4. 6  μg/kg, subsequent doses 0. 07  μg/kg/day, i. m.); d) Hydrolysate-Mercury. At the end of the treatment, sperm motility, count and morphological studies were performed; Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant capacity, histological and immunohistochemical assays on testis and epididymis were also carried out. As results, HgCl-treatment decreased sperm number, increased sperm transit time in epididymis and impaired sperm morphology. However, these harmful effects were prevented by EWH. HgCl-treatment also increased ROS levels, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity in testis and epididymis as well as promoted testicular inflammation and histological changes in epididymis. EWH improved histological and immunohistochemical alterations, probably due to its antioxidant property. In conclusion, the EWH could represent a powerful natural alternative to protect the male reproductive system against Hg-induced <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity.</b> This research was supported by a Brazilian Government (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico – CNPq – 203440 / 2014 - 5) and a Spanish Goverment (MINECO - AGL 2012 - 32387; CSIC – Intramural 201570 I 028).

40|$|Abstract: Ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGEE) {{can cause}} damage to testes and sperm, and its {{metabolites}} {{are believed to}} play an important role in its toxicity. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH 2) is involved in the metabolism of this chemical. To investigate whether and how the enzyme affects the toxicity of EGEE, we conducted experiments comparing Aldh 2 knockout mice with wild-type mice. Administration of EGEE at 100 and 600 mg/kg/day for one week did not induce any significant change in the weight and body weight ratios of testes, prostate and epididymides in either Aldh 2 knockout or wild-type mice. However, motion of sperm from the spermaduct, as analyzed with a Hamilton-Thorne Sperm analyzer, was slightly decreased in the low dose group, and significantly lower in the high dose group; and the percentage of progressive sperm was also reduced in the two EGEE groups. This effect of EGEE treatment was observed in the wild-type, but not in the Aldh 2 knockout mice. Sperm motion from the cauda epididymides was not affected. On the other hand, the concentration of ethoxyacetic acid, a metabolite of EGEE, in 24 h pooled urine of EGEE-treated Aldh 2 knockout mice was not significantly lower than that of the wild-type mice on most days of urine sampling. These results suggest that inactivation of the ALDH 2 enzyme due to gene mutation may be linked to differences in the susceptibility to EGEE-induced <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|The role of {{oxidative}} stress in Cannabis sativa (CS) -associated reproductive toxicity is inconclusive. The present study employed {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) -total antioxidant capacity (TAC) score to understand the effect of CS on {{oxidative stress}}, while the possible anti-oxidative effect of melatonin and vitamin C were also investigated in rats receiving them alone or together with cannabis. Fifty-four male albino rats were randomized to 9 oral treatment groups (n =  6) as follow: Groups I and II served as control and received 1  ml/kg normal saline and 10 % ethanol (vehicle for CS administration) respectively. Groups III–V received melatonin (4  mg/kg), vitamin C (1. 25  g/kg) and their combination respectively. Group VI received CS (2  mg/kg), while groups VII–IX received melatonin, vitamin C, and their combination respectively in addition to CS. All treatment lasted for 30  days. The CS reduced the sperm parameters, TAC, and the ROS-TAC score but increase the ROS, while only melatonin and/or vitamin C improved these parameters. Supplementation of rats receiving CS with either melatonin or vitamin C exacerbated the CS-induced oxidative stress and spermatotoxicity but their combination (melatonin + vitamin C) prevented these conditions in them. Furthermore, ROS-TAC score better predicted the condition of sperm than either TAC or ROS. In conclusion, this study further implicates oxidative stress in CS-induced spermatotoxicity using the ROS-TAC score. It also provides evidences for the preventive effect of melatonin and vitamin C on oxidative stress and <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> when combined but not when administered separately in rats receiving CS...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) exerts an adverse effect on human sperm motility, which has been ascribed to inhibition of mitochondrial activity. This seems to be at variance with evidence suggesting a major role of glycolysis in supplying ATP for sperm motility; furthermore, the role of AEA-binding receptors in mediating mitochondrial inhibition has not yet been explored. In this study, human sperm exposure to Met-AEA (methanandamide, nonhydrolyzable analog of AEA) in the micromolar range significantly decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), similarly to rotenone, mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. The effect of Met-AEA (1 μm) was prevented by SR 141716, CB 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist, but not by SR 144528, CB 2 antagonist, nor by iodoresiniferatoxin, vanilloid receptor antagonist. The effect of Met-AEA did not involve activation of caspase- 9 or caspase- 3 and was reverted by washing. In the presence of glucose, sperm exposure either to Met-AEA up to 1 μm or to rotenone for up to 18 h did not affect sperm motility. At higher doses Met-AEA produced a CB 1 -independent poisoning of spermatozoa, reducing their viability. Under glycolysis blockage, 1 μm Met-AEA, similarly to rotenone, dramatically abolished sperm motility, an effect that was prevented by SR 1 and reverted by washing. In conclusion, CB 1 activation induced a nonapoptotic decrease of ΔΨm, the detrimental reflection on sperm motility of which could be revealed only under glycolysis blockage, unless very high doses of Met-AEA, producing CB 1 -independent <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity,</b> were used. The effects of CB 1 activation reported here contribute to elucidate the relationship between energetic metabolism and human sperm motility...|$|E
40|$|Extract] A casual {{reader of}} the {{behavioural}} ecology literature might think that sexual selection provides boundless evolutionary benefits to females. Females can directly choose a mate, or let males establish their worth by fighting amongst themselves {{for the chance to}} mate. We know that males trade the advantages of being chosen as a mate against the energy loss and risk to their lives of competing with one another and signalling to females. In contrast, our understanding of the process from the female perspective is dominated by attempts to resolve the benefits that females derive from mate choice or from multiple mating. The idea that a single mating can decrease a female's lifespan, and each additional mating or refusal to mate further decreases her survival and fecundity has received attention from only a handful of researchers. The hidden costs to females when males compete to mate can be understood in terms of conflict between the sexes in the way that reproductive success is optimized 5. A competitive male that outsignals or outfights other males will mate with more females and thus sire more offspring, even if his actions lead to a reduction in each mated female's reproductive output. The higher the potential variance in male mating success, the more important sexual selection becomes, and the greater the likelihood that it will lead to the evolution of traits incidentally harmful to females 6. Female mate choice is one, but by no means the only, female adaptation that results from competition between males for mates. How females balance the costs of courtship and harassment by males with those of mating (e. g. <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> 7 and vulnerability to predators 2) is a crucial aspect of female ecology. Variation in female tendency to remate greatly influences the strength and form of sexual selection in a population...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{need for}} woman-controlled, cheap, safe, effective, easy-to-use and easy-to-store topical {{applications}} for prophylaxis against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) makes surfactant-containing formulations an interesting option {{that requires a}} more fundamental knowledge concerning surfactant toxicology and structure-activity relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings We report in vitro effects of surfactant concentration, exposure time and structure on the viability of mammalian cell types typically encountered in the vagina, namely, fully polarized and confluent epithelial cells, confluent but non-polarized epithelial-like cells, dendritic cells, and human sperm. Representatives of the different families of commercially available surfactants – nonionic (Triton X- 100 and monolaurin), zwitterionic (DDPS), anionic (SDS), and cationic (CnTAB (n = 10 to 16), C 12 PB, and C 12 BZK) – were examined. Triton X- 100, monolaurin, DDPS and SDS were toxic to all cell types at concentrations around their critical micelle concentration (CMC) suggesting a non-selective mode of action involving cell membrane destabilization and/or destruction. All cationic surfactants were toxic at concentrations far below their CMC and showed significant differences in their toxicity toward polarized as compared with non-polarized cells. Their toxicity was also dependent on the chemical nature of the polar head group. Our results suggest an intracellular locus of action for cationic surfactants and show that their structure-activity relationships could be profitably exploited for STI prophylaxis in vaginal gel formulations. The therapeutic indices comparing polarized epithelial cell toxicity to <b>sperm</b> <b>toxicity</b> for all surfactants examined, except C 12 PB and C 12 BZK, does not justify their use as contraceptive agents. C 12 PB and C 12 BZK are shown to have a narrow therapeutic index recommending caution in their use in contraceptive formulations. Conclusions/Significance Our results contribute to understanding the mechanisms involved in surfactant toxicity, have a predictive value {{with regard to their}} safety, and may be used to design more effective and less harmful surfactants for use in topical applications for STI prophylaxis.
