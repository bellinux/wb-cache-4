40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of <b>shellside</b> {{pressure drop in}} a baffled shell-and-tube heat exchanger is very difficult because of the complicated <b>shellside</b> geometry. Ideally, all the <b>shellside</b> fluid should be alternately deflected across the tube bundle as it traverses from inlet to outlet. In practice, up to 60 % of the <b>shellside</b> fluid may bypass the tube bundle or leak through the baffles. This short-circuiting of the main flow reduces {{the efficiency of the}} exchanger. Of the various <b>shellside</b> methods, it is shown that only the multi-stream methods, which attempt to obtain the <b>shellside</b> flow distribution, predict the pressure drop with any degree of accuracy, the various predictions ranging from - 30 % to + 70 %, generally overpredicting. It is shown that the inaccuracies are mainly due to the manner in which baffle leakage is modelled. The present multi-stream methods do not allow for interactions of the various flowstreams, and yet it is shown that three main effects are identified, a) there is a strong interaction between the main cross flow and the baffle leakage streams, enhancing the crossflow pressure drop, b) there is a further short-circuit not considered previously i. e. leakage in the window, and c) the crossflow does not penetrate as far, on average, as previously supposed. Models are developed for each of these three effects, along with a new windowflow pressure drop model, and it is shown that the effect of baffle leakage in the window is the most significant. These models developed to allow for various interactions, lead to an improved multi-stream method, named the "STREAM-INTERACTION" method. The overall method is shown to be consistently more accurate than previous methods, with virtually all the available <b>shellside</b> data being predicted to within ± 30 % and over 60 % being within ± 20 %. The method is, thus, strongly recommended for use as a design method...|$|E

By employing CFD software FLUENT, the numerical simulation of models under different media, different Re number and different rod-baffle pitch are carried out.

40|$|A cupronickel heat {{exchanger}} failed after 10 years of service. The cooling {{heat exchanger}} was in service in a marine environment, with water flowing along <b>shellside</b> {{and natural gas}} along tubeside. Many tubes showed leakages during a regular maintenance test. A comprehensive failure analysis of the heat exchanger revealed the de-nickelification process on the external side of the damaged tubes (<b>shellside).</b> The de-nickelification originated from a large deposit of sea water scale, over tube lengths, which completely covered the area just outside the internal portion of the tubesheet, and occurred because of {{a failure of the}} regular cleaning operation. Stagnant water and possible hot spot formations on the tubes probably caused the phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{some results}} from a research programme to study forced flow <b>shellside</b> boiling in a TEMA E-type shell and tube heat exchanger. It focuses on the particular issue {{of the effect of}} apparent transitions in the two-phase flow pattern. The results from the programme show a drop in the heat transfer performance at lower mass fluxes and higher vapour qualities. The sudden drop in performance may be caused by a change in the two-phase flow pattern on the <b>shellside</b> from a homogeneous type to a stratified type of flow with separation of the liquid and vapour phases. Support for this conclusion is that the transition in heat transfer performance appears to coincide with a change in the behaviour of the measured two-phase pressure drop multiplier. A model is described which allows for the effects of separated flow and also attempts to predict the apparent transition in the two-phase flow pattern...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} indeterminates in the design as well as {{operation}} of heat exchangers is the rate of fouling a select heat exchanger geometry would exhibit over the operation cycles. Gradual deterioration of heat exchanger performance due to the accumulation of fouling film on the heat transfer surface is often accounted for {{in the form of}} a fouling resistance, or commonly known as the fouling factor, while determining the heat transfer surface required for a specific heat duty. More often, the fouling mechanism responsible for the deterioration of heat exchanger performance is flow-velocity dependent. Maldistribution of flow, wakes and eddies caused by poor heat exchanger geometry can have detrimental effect on heat exchanger performance and reliability. Helixchanger heat exchangers have demonstrated significant improvements in the fouling behavior of heat exchangers in operation. In a Helixchanger heat exchanger, the quadrant shaped <b>shellside</b> baffle plates are arranged at an angle to the tube axis creating a helical flow pattern on the <b>shellside.</b> Uniform velocities and near plug flow conditions achieved in a Helixchanger heat exchanger, provide low fouling characteristics, offering longer heat exchanger run-lengths between scheduled cleaning of tube bundles. This article demonstrates the Helixchanger heat exchanger option in reducing the velocity-dependent fouling in heat exchangers...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Shell and tube heat exchangers are an extremely effective and mechanically feasible method of transferring thermal energy between two fluids. There is great demand for effective design methods capable of producing highly efficient models. To further improve efficiency, there must be an increased understanding of the physics of <b>shellside</b> flow at a local level. To accomplish this end, an experimental investigation was conducted to obtain flow visualization and internal local pressure drop information in the <b>shellside</b> flow. A scale-model shell and tube heat exchanger with an outer diameter of 30. 5 cm and a length of 61 cm was designed and constructed out of acrylic. Water was utilized as the working fluid and flowrates ranging from 0. 32 to 2. 21 L/s were studied. Flow visualization photographs confirmed the existence of leakage streams and recirculation zones. Anomalous vortices were also detected under certain circumstances. Global experimental pressure drops were in good agreement with values predicted from other methods. Local internal pressure dro s were also recorded {{for the first time and}} were in good agreement with what would be expected from conventional theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} a "Divided-flow" heat {{exchanger}} is generalized by locating the shell inlet (or outlet) nozzle off-center such that the two shell sub-streams are unequal and traverse unequal flow paths. The governing equations for heat transfer in such an exchanger are derived and solved leading to an optimization problem. In this problem, the optimal subdivision of heat transfer surface to minimize required overall heat transfer surface, under certain restricted conditions, is sought. It is shown that the off-center nozzle location can be selected judiciously so as to maintain (or even improve heat transfer) while reducing the gross <b>shellside</b> pressure loss. Thus, the pumping costs are minimized without sacrificing heat transfer...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} pressure distributions {{and fluid}} flow {{patterns on the}} <b>shellside</b> of a cylindrical shell-and-tube heat exchanger. The apparatus used was constructed from glass enabling direct observation of the flow using a dye release technique and had ten traversable pressure instrumented tubes permitting detailed pressure distributions to be obtained. The `exchanger' had a large tube bundle (278 tubes) and main flow areas typical of practical designs. Six geometries were studied: three baffle spacings both with and without baffle leakage. Results are also presented of three-dimensional modelling of <b>shellside</b> flows using the Harwell Laboratory's FLOW 3 D code. Flow visualisation provided flow patterns in the central plane of the bundle and adjacent to the shell wall. Comparison of these high-lighted significant radial flow variations. In particular, separated regions, originating from the baffle tips, were observed. The size of these regions was small in the bundle central plane but large adjacent to the shell wall and extended into the bypass lane. This appeared to reduce the bypass flow area and hence the bypass flow fraction. The three-dimensional flow modelling results were presented as velocity vector and isobar maps. The vector maps illustrated regions {{of high and low}} velocity which could be prone to tube vibration and fouling. Separated regions were also in evidence. A non-uniform crossflow was discovered with, in general, higher velocities in the central plane of the bundle than near the shell wall. _The form of the isobar maps calculated by FLOW 3 D was in good agreement with experimental results. In particular, larger pressure drops occurred across the inlet than outlet of a crossflow region and were higher near the upstream than downstream baffle face. The effect of baffle spacing and baffle leakage on crossflow and window pressure drop measurements was identified. Agreement between the current measurements, previously obtained data and commonly used design correlations/models was, in general, poor. This was explained in terms of the increased understanding of <b>shellside</b> flow. The bulk of previous data, which dervies from small-scale rigs with few tubes, {{have been shown to be}} unrepresentative of typical commerical units. The Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow Service design program TASC provided the best predictions of the current pressure drop results. However, a number of simple one-dimensional models in TASC are, individually, questionable. Some revised models have been proposed...|$|E

The objective is to evaluate the possibility of replacing classical {{heat exchangers}} with the aim of improving heat transfer performance and material cost reduction. The Nusselt numbers for water flows with a helical angle [alpha] = 65 Â°, a pitch-to-height ratio p/e = 1 Â· 45, and two aspect ratios (<b>shellside</b> diameter to tubeside diameter) of Do/Di = 2 Â· 68 and 5 Â· 1 are obtained and a comparison of these results with those for a smooth tube at the same aspect ratios is also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>shellside</b> {{pressure}} drop between the inlet and outlet nozzles {{as well as}} the {{pressure drop}}s through individual sections of different shell-and-tube test-exchanger configurations are measured under water flow. The segmentally baffled test exchanger is nominally 0. 6 m (2 ft) in diameter, 3. 7 m (12 ft) long and contains a tube bundle of 19 mm (0. 75 in.) outside-diameter tubes. Results are reported of 24 test cases obtained from various combinations of parameters: 30 degrees triangular or 90 degrees square tube layout patterns (all on a 1. 25 pitch-to-diameter ratio), numbers of cross-passes, sizes of nozzles, plain or finned tubes, and full or special fix tube bundles. The exponential change of pressure drop as a function of flow-rate is also investigated and an attempt is made to calculate nozzle losses...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} {{to determine the}} feasible region for shell and tube heat exchanger designs on a pressure drop diagram. By accounting for operating as well as geometrical constraints, the feasible region is defined so as to eliminate trial-and-error during the design activity. Every point on this plot of <b>shellside</b> versus tubeside pressure drop corresponds to a unique design in terms of tube length, shell diameter and baffle spacing. Furthermore, curves may be plotted for designs corresponding to a specified heat exchange area or a given total annual cost. Such curves permit screening of various design options prior to detailed rating of the exchangers, and allow heat exchanger design targets to be established for minimum area or cost. The area target ensures an exchanger of the smallest size with minimum capital cost, whereas the cost target yields the optimum pressure drops accounting for the tradeoff between power consumption and heat exchanger area. The methodology is equation-based and can be conveniently implemented on a computer...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the numerical simulation {{on the performance}} of mini-scale reactors for hydrogenproduction coupled with liquid methanol/water vaporizer, methanol/steam reformer, and methanol/aircatalytic combustor. These reactors are designed similar to tube-and-shell heat exchangers. The combustorfor heat supply is arranged as the tube or shell side. Based on the obtained results, the methanol/airflow rate through the combustor (in terms of gas hourly space velocity of combustor, GHSV-C) and themethanol/water feed rate to the reformer (in terms of gas hourly space velocity of reformer, GHSV-R) control the reactor performance. With higher GHSV-C and lower GHSV-R, higher methanol conversioncan be achieved because of higher reaction temperature. However, hydrogen yield is reduced and the carbonmonoxide concentration is increased due to the reversed water gas shift reaction. Optimum reactorperformance is found using the balance between GHSV-C and GHSV-R. Because of more effective heattransfer characteristics in the vaporizer, it is found that the reactor with combustor arranged as the <b>shellside</b> has better performance compared with the reactor design having the combustor as the tube sideunder the same operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} drop across a heat exchanger {{is an important}} parameter, along with the heat transfer capacity. In fact, the operating cost throughout {{the life of the}} exchanger depends on the pressure losses. Therefore, {{it is important to be}} able to predict {{pressure drop}} accurately as it is to predict heat transfer. A new data set of shell-side pressure drop measurements taken during isothermal flow of brines in shell and tube evaporators was collected in the Alfa Laval laboratory. It covers several different configurations of industrial shell and tube evaporators and a wide range of operating conditions, with cross flow Reynolds number ranging from 170 to 33, 000. The database is compared against two predictive procedures available in the literature for computing shell-side pressure drop, showing that no method is accurate enough for design purpose. As a further step, a new suggested procedure is presented, which extends the Wills and Johnston [Wills MJN, Johnston D. A new and accurate hand calculation method for <b>shellside</b> pressure drop and flow distribution. 22 nd National Heat Transfer Conference, HTD N. 36.

40|$|International audienceMembrane wetting is a {{limitation}} to mass transfer in industrial Hollow-Fiber Membrane Modules (HFMM). The influence of transmembrane pressure on wetting is investigated through both experimental and numerical works. On the one hand, experiments for CO 2 absorption in softened water {{are carried out}} at pilot scale with Liqui-Cel Extra-Flow modules operating in a cross-flow mode. After several hours of operation (50 - 300 min), the membrane partially wetted mode is established at steady state and decreases the absorbed CO 2 flowrates up to 10. 5 % compared to membrane dry mode. Interestingly, CO 2 absorption {{is found to be}} independent on different transmembrane pressure (0. 5 and 2. 5 bar), both in the dry and partially wetted mode. On the other hand, a 2 D predictive tool is developed to help in the design of HFMM gas absorption systems. The model depicts the complex hydrodynamics in commercial cross-flow modules. The liquid in the <b>shellside</b> is flowing through the fiber bundle considered as a porous medium. The liquid mass-transfer coefficient is non-uniform over the membrane module and is estimated at a local scale. The parameters from the empirical Chilton-Colburn correlation are optimized with experimental results in the dry mode through a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments (- 131 + 17 %). In the partially wetted mode at steady state, wetting is then described by considering a log-normal pore size distribution and the Laplace-Young equation. The transmembrane pressure decreases the simulated absorbed CO 2 flowrate. By comparing to experimental data, the numerical relative error is increasing with transmembrane pressure. Therefore, a suggestion is made to adapt the description of wetting in HFMM gas -liquid models...|$|E
40|$|This liquid/gas {{separator}} {{provides the}} basis for a first stage of a fuel cell product water/oxygen gas phase separator. It can separate liquid and gas in bulk in multiple gravity environments. The system separates fuel cell product water entrained with circulating oxygen gas from the outlet of a fuel cell stack before allowing the gas to return to the fuel cell stack inlet. Additional makeup oxygen gas is added either before or after the separator to account for the gas consumed in the fuel cell power plant. A large volume is provided upstream of porous material in the separator to allow for the collection of water that does not exit the separator with the outgoing oxygen gas. The water then can be removed as it continues to collect, so that the accumulation of water does not impede the separating action of the device. The system is designed with a series of tubes of the porous material configured into a shell-and-tube heat exchanger configuration. The two-phase fluid stream to be separated enters the shell-side portion of the device. Gas flows to the center passages of the tubes through the porous material and is then routed to a common volume {{at the end of the}} tubes by simple pressure difference from a pumping device. Gas flows through the porous material of the tubes with greater ease as a function of the ratio of the dynamic viscosity of the water and gas. By careful selection of the dimensions of the tubes (wall thickness, porosity, diameter, length of the tubes, number of the tubes, and tube-to-tube spacing in the shell volume) a suitable design can be made to match the magnitude of water and gas flow, developed pressures from the oxygen reactant pumping device, and required residual water inventory for the <b>shellside</b> volume...|$|E
