5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943.

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long <b>service</b> <b>life,</b> often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E

5|$|The Panzer IV saw {{service in}} all combat theaters {{involving}} Germany {{and was the}} only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war.

5|$|The {{ship had}} a very limited <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|To reduce {{operating}} costs and lengthen the F-22's <b>service</b> <b>life,</b> some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators, while the T-38 Talon {{is used for}} adversary training. DoD budget cuts led to F-22 demonstration flights being halted in 2013 before resuming in 2014.

5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} the backbone of RAF Fighter Command, and saw action in the European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe {{was designed to be}} powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its <b>service</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bravo November is the {{original}} identification code painted on a British Royal Air Force Boeing Chinook HC4 military serial number ZA718. It was one of {{the original}} 30 aircraft ordered by the RAF in 1978 and has been in service ever since. It has been upgraded several times in its history, now being designated as an HC4 airframe. It has seen action in every major operation involving the RAF in the helicopter's 30-year <b>service</b> <b>life.</b> Since 1982 it has served in the Falkland Islands, Lebanon, Germany, Northern Ireland, Kurdistan, Iraq and Afghanistan. The aircraft has seen four of its pilots awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for actions whilst in command of Bravo November.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the intended use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never intended for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its <b>service</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|From June 2000 until 21 April 2004, Tula {{underwent}} overhaul at the Zvezdochka shipyard, Severodvinsk, {{the third}} boat after Verkhoturie (K-51) and Ekaterinburg (K-84). The overhaul extended her <b>service</b> <b>life</b> by ten years, and {{allowed her to}} carry R-29RMU Sineva missiles. She conducted sea trials in early 2006 and re-entered service shortly thereafter, despite plans {{to do so in}} 2005. Tula post-overhaul operational history is characterised by a number of missile launches, the first of which occurred on 17 December 2007, when she launched a Sineva missile aimed at the Kura Test Range in the Kamchatka Peninsula. Within eight days, Tula launched another missile, again aimed at Kura; both tests were successful.|$|E
