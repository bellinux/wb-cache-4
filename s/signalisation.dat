Communications equipment and the semi-automatic <b>signalisation</b> infrastructure dates to the 1970s, and was imported from China and the Soviet Union. The poor state of the infrastructure severely restricts operational speeds - average train speeds are as low as 20 km/h-60 km/h (in South Korea 60 km/h-100 km/h on non-high speed lines): only on the P'yŏngbu Line are speeds of 100 km/h possible.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{stochastic}} {{model for the}} intersection of two urban streets. The vehicular traffic at the intersection is controlled {{by a set of}} traffic lights which can be operated subject to fix-time as well as traffic adaptive schemes. Vehicular dynamics is simulated {{within the framework of the}} probabilistic cellular automata and the delay experienced by the traffic at each individual street is evaluated for specified time intervals. Minimising the total delay of both streets gives rise to the optimum <b>signalisation</b> of traffic lights.

In this paper, we extend OTC’s observer with a time series forecast component to create forecasts of future traffic developments for turning movements.

Vehicular dynamics is simulated {{within the framework of the}} probabilistic cellular automata and the delay experienced by the traffic at each individual street is evaluated for specified time intervals. We discuss the impact of the geometrical properties of the roundabout on the total delay.

40|$|The {{process chain}} in optical {{measurement}} techniques can be subdivided into four main components: the camera system, the object range, the network {{design and the}} analysis system. The included influences (e. g. camera geometry, illumination, algorithms for image measurement) cause remaining deviations on the results due to insufficiently known effects on the photogrammetric system. This article will introduce a simulation technique based on Monte-Carlo-Methods to analyse effects of camera geometry, object space, <b>signalisation</b> and illumination. First two topics will be discussed based on simulation results. It allows {{a closer look at}} single system components, their uncertainty and randomly distribution simultaneously to the estimation of their influence on the photogrammetric system. The described Monte-Carlo-Simulation provides an economical process where the effects can be separated and modelled within an acceptable period of time and amount of work.

The emphasis is on designing of a corporate solution for traffic layout of the area using conventional forms of intersectons or roundabouts in order to encrease safety and clarity by more appropriate <b>signalisation.</b> The development of three possible solutions, which are drawn as conceptual designs, is described.

J. : Equipe Remodelage Musculaire et <b>Signalisation</b> Contact: leibovs@supagro. inra. frThe mTORC 1 pathway is {{required}} for both the terminal muscle differentiation and hypertrophy by controlling the mammalian translational machinery via phosphorylation of S 6 K 1 and 4 E-BP 1. mTOR and S 6 K 1 are connected by interacting with the eIF 3 initiation complex. The regulatory subunit eIF 3 f {{plays a major role}} in muscle hypertrophy and is a key target that accounts for MAFbx function during atrophy. Here we present evidence that in MAFbx-induced atrophy the degradation of eIF 3 f suppresses S 6 K 1 activation by mTOR, whereas an eIF 3 f mutant insensitive to MAFbx polyubiquitination maintained persistent phosphorylation of S 6 K 1 and rpS 6. During terminal muscle differentiation a conserved TOS motif in eIF 3 f connects mTOR/raptor complex, which phosphorylates S 6 K 1 and regulates downstream effectors of mTOR and Cap-dependent translation initiation. Thus eIF 3 f plays a major role for proper activity of mTORC 1 to regulate skeletal muscle size...|$|E

40|$|The National Department of Transport?s Vision of the Public Transport Action Plan {{encourages}} the utilisation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) {{as part of}} Integrated Rapid Transport Networks (IPTN?s). The roll out of BRT is currently being pursued {{in all of the}} major cities in South Africa. The design and <b>signalisation</b> of intersections needs to comply with the South African Road Traffic Signs Manual (SARTSM) in order to be legal. The SARTSM was drafted prior to BRT being envisaged and as yet has not been modified to adapt {{to the demands of the}} road based public transport requirements. The implementation of the SARTSM to active BRT projects is discussed, as are the challenges of conforming to SARTSM and the lessons learned from observations in the field. Alternative <b>signalisation</b> techniques have been implemented internationally to manage bus and light rail systems in street networks. The paper reviews various good international examples of these techniques with a view to encouraging decision makers within South Africa to update the SARTSM and hopefully improve the legibility of traffic signals at these complex BRT junctions and hence improve the safety of all road users.
