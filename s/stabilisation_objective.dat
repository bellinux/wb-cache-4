40|$|International audienceIn this work, an output-feedback {{scheme for}} the global {{stabilisation}} of the planar {{vertical take-off and landing}} aircraft with bounded inputs is developed taking into account the positive nature of the thrust. The global <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objective</b> is proven to be achieved avoiding input saturation and by exclusively considering the system positions in the feedback. To cope with the lack of velocity measurements, the proposed algorithm involves a finite-time observer. The generalised versions of the involved finite-time stabilisers have not only permitted to solve the output-feedback stabilisation problem avoiding input saturation, but also provide additional flexibility in the control design that may be used in aid of performance improvements. With respect to previous approaches, the developed finite-time observer-based scheme guarantees the global <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objective</b> disregarding velocity measurements in a bounded input context. Simulation tests corroborate the analytical developments. The study includes further experimental results on an actual flying device...|$|E
40|$|We build a {{model of}} a fixed {{exchange}} rate regime with escape clauses and output persistence. In the spirit of the literature following the Asian crisis in 1997, persistence in our model arises from the inability of the domestic financial institutions to intermediate international credit. Our main message is that since persistence generates long run credibility effects that are sensitive to the prevailing policy preferences, the choice of an optimal exchange rate regime and the preference for a policy target should reflect the degree of development of the domestic financial institutions. If the domestic financial market suffers from credit constraints that generate persistence, the likelihood of self-fulfilling currency crisis may be reduced if the government assigns a greater weight on the output <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objective.</b> However, if financial market liberalisation successfully eliminates the credit constraints, liberalisation should be associated with a switch in policy preferences more in favour of exchange rate stability. ...|$|E

First, the extent of farm income variability over time has been assessed. Second, {{the contribution of the}} three main income components (Revenues, DP and costs of external factors) to the variability of farm income has been analysed. This has allowed to establish that DP play an income stabilising effect. Third, the {{analysis has}} explored how DP reduce farm income variability. Addressing these three topics provided pieces of information {{that could be used to}} design a DP policy that better pursues farm income <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{surveyed}} {{the state of}} international banking. OverviewSince 2007, actions by central banks have prevented financial collapse. Further accommodation is borrowing time for others to act.   But the time must be used wisely. The focus of action must be on balance sheet repair, fiscal sustainability and, most of all, the economic and financial reforms needed to return economies to the real growth paths authorities and the public both want and expect (Chapter I). After reviewing the past year 2 ̆ 7 s economic developments (Chapter II), the remaining economic chapters of the 83 rd Annual Report cover the critical policy challenges in detail: reforming labour and product markets to restore productivity growth (Chapter III), ensuring the sustainability of public finances (Chapter IV), adapting financial regulation to ensure resilience of the increasingly complex global system (Chapter V), and re-emphasising the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objectives</b> of central banks (Chapter VI) ...|$|R
40|$|Central {{banks in}} charge of banking {{regulation}} are less aggressive in their inflation mandate since tight monetary policy conditions could have an adverse effect on {{the stability of the}} banking system. Due to the conflict between the two mandates, {{it has been argued that}} banking supervisory powers should be assigned to an independent authority to avoid inflation bias and enhance social welfare. The first part of the paper develops a theoretical model to examine the interaction between the credit and bank’s balance sheet policy transmission channels in influencing macroeconomic outcomes. When mandates are combined to a single authority, price and financial <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objectives</b> can be complementary or conflicting, depending on the policy instruments and types of macroeconomic shocks, with an important impact on social welfare. The second part of the paper empirically assesses whether central banks’ combined mandates leads to an inflation bias problem using panel data for 25 industrialised countries from 1975 to 2007. The estimation results show that, once we control for relevant policy and institutional factors (such as the presence of inflation targeting and deposit insurance schemes), the separation of banking supervision and monetary policy does not have a significant effect on inflation outcomes...|$|R
40|$|African {{central banks}} have covered an {{extraordinary}} distance {{since the early}} 1990 s—closing the gap, in the process, between their own policy challenges and those of richer-country central banks. Some striking differences are nonetheless easily missed, amid the many parallels between central banking reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{and those in the}} industrial and emerging-market economies. The abandonment of soft pegs in low-income SSA, for example, had less to do with capital mobility than with the failures of exchange control systems under pressure from fiscal imbalances and external shocks. Fiscal and quasi-fiscal demands, in turn, have almost certainly been more important than conventional <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objectives</b> as potential sources of inflation bias in SSA. Money-based disinflation programmes, to take a final example—often supported by tight fiscal rules under IMF conditionality—do not appear to have involved costly sacrifices of output, outside of South Africa.   These observations, and more in the papers collected here, suggest that the distinctive structural and institutional features of low-income countries may have distinctive implications for the design and conduct of monetary policy. Collectively, the papers in this volume issue a compelling call for monetary policy research that focuses squarely on the economic environment of low-income Africa.

40|$|The {{prospect}} of the European monetary union moving ahead on schedule has recently revived the discussion on stabilisation policies. The starting point of this discussion has been the observation that, because of relatively low labour mobility {{and the presence of}} country-specific shocks, monetary policy at the EC-level might not have the capacity to satisfy national <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objectives.</b> If it leaves economies more exposed to aggregate shocks, the loss of national monetary stabilisation instruments may prove costly and require the Community to insure against regional shocks by use of the other instrument at her disposal: fiscal policy. This paper addresses two main issues. First, it investigates the extent to which macroeconomic stabilisation is desirable {{from the point of view}} of the consumer in the European Community, by estimating the perceived costs of consumption instability. Second, being aware that consumption shocks can probably not be entirely eliminated and the individual countries' consumption risk could at best be diversified through an EC-level insurance mechanism, we focus explicitly on the benefits of such a stabilisation policy. Our estimations are based on three alternative models for consumption: a trend stationary, a random walk and an autoregressive model. The results show that traditional stabilisation policies associated with temporary shocks may not generate significant benefits. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} challenges, decisions, issues, and dilemmas facing the International Community (IC) {{in attempting to}} re-establish and rebuild public administration and other government institutions {{in a country that}} continues to suffer from instability and remains at high risk of further conflict. The research looks specifically at a subset of Public Administration Reform (PAR) : Civil Service and Administrative Reform (CSAR). The research concludes that CSAR in a Fragile and Conflict Affected State (FCAS) such as Afghanistan is clearly a ‘wicked problem’ requiring innovative, iterative and adaptive responses by the IC over an extended time period. However, the IC treats CSAR in Afghanistan as a ‘tame’ problem simply framed in terms of ‘we are coming to build your capacity’, resulting in slow progress on public sector reform overall and little understanding of the relationship with overarching statebuilding and <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objectives.</b> Despite the acknowledgement of the importance of CSAR, IC support has fallen dramatically in recent years. The current approach to supporting CSAR in Afghanistan is therefore almost guaranteed to fail. The research calls for a new approach to PAR in these types of cases, one that recognises the severe limits to progress utilising existing approaches and structures rooted in Western notions of good government. A new approach goes beyond the overwhelming focus on capacity development; emphasises the importance of understanding what space exists for reform; recognises the need to pragmatically confront trade- offs between the competing <b>objectives</b> of reconciling <b>stabilisation</b> imperatives with wider considerations of ‘good governance’; and poses an alternative expanded framework for considering public administration, legitimacy, authority and representation in the government of an FCAS, partly as an organising framework but also as an aid to understanding the complexity of interrelated systems prevalent in an FCAS. The research also concludes that a great deal more independent academic research is required to understand how to make progress in Public Sector Reform (PSR), stabilisation and longer-term development that will help prevent countries slipping back into conflict...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{conservation}} of ferrous cultural heritage, dechlorination processes of archaeological iron artefacts are studied in subcritical conditions which consist of immerging an artefact inside an alkaline bath under pressure (30 [*]bar) and temperature (160 [*]°C). Submarine archaeological environments lead {{to the presence of}} chlorides inside the corrosion layers. After exposure to the atmosphere following excavation, initial corrosion phases evolve. Chlorides remain trapped inside the structure of corrosion products particularly during the crystallisation of akaganeite. <b>Stabilisation</b> treatment <b>objectives</b> are to remove chlorides from the corrosion layers and to obtain more stable phases. A Roman archaeological bar has been studied on cross-section before and after treatment in sub-critical conditions. Less stable phases, such as ferrihydrite and akaganeite, transformed into hematite. That was confirmed by the use of synthetic and pure phases treated in the same conditions. The presence of goethite before and after the treatment in the corrosion profile raises the question of its reactivity during dechlorination process. Akaganeite has been synthesised and compared to archaeological powder sampled on an artefact. The results highlight reactivity differences indicating that sub-critical transformation processes are not only dependent on the nature of phases but also on intrinsic physical characteristic...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{faced by}} the United Kingdom in realising its <b>stabilisation</b> <b>objectives</b> in the War in Afghanistan (2001 - 2014) have precipitated a change in rhetorical approach by successive British Governments, from one based on liberal normative principles to one that emphasises traditional, rationalist precepts of ‘national security interests’. This transformation of ‘narrative’ is identified in this work as chronologically analogous with the institutionalisation of ‘strategic communication’ practices and doctrine emanating from the defence establishment of the British state. In this work, I argue that changes in narrative approach {{and the emergence of}} strategic communication can be understood as a consequence of an overburdened British state attempting to free itself from a ‘transnational dilemma’ (King 2010) : that is, to find a means of appealing coherently and succinctly to the benefits of participation in collective security whilst avoiding threatening the viability of collective security membership by acknowledging its costs. This transnational dilemma has been exacerbated by intra-state competition over the material and ideational aspects of British strategy in Helmand, and is traceable by close empirical analysis of three competing ‘policy narratives’ for Afghanistan: stabilisation, counter-narcotics, and counter-terrorism, respectively. Intra-state competition can, in turn, be conceptualised as the result of embedded inter-state relationships of political obligation and military cooperation referred to by Edmunds (2010) as the ‘transnationalisation’ of defence policy. UK policy in Afghanistan has been guided by transnational issues, specifically the maintenance of NATO as a collective security apparatus and of the ‘special relationship’ with the United States, through which Britain secures and projects its national interest. I argue that the UK’s grand strategic commitment to transnationalisation underscores an ‘unstatable’ ultimate policy of meeting the expectations of the United States and NATO, and that the development of various policies and narratives for Afghanistan can be understood primarily in such terms. In Afghanistan, transnationalisation and the concordant pursuit of satisfying American and NATO expectations has come at the cost of a significant divestment of strategic autonomy, which has uprooted traditional, nationally-based concepts of strategy and policy to the transnational level and resulted in a strategic vacuum wherein intra-state competition has flourished. This, I argue, has compromised the ability for Britain to link policy to operations (to ‘do’ strategy) d in Afghanistan, a point which can be empirically measured by reference to the discordant and contradictory aspects of aforementioned policy narratives, which have been rooted in the institutional interests of various elements of the state. Strategic communication has arisen out of this situation as a means for the state to overcome the transnational dilemma by promoting a unified ‘strategic narrative’ for Afghanistan that has reconfigured the narrative for the conflict to one that emphasises the conflict not in terms of collective security but in ‘national’ terms. This work concludes by arguing that, in sidestepping rather than confronting the core dilemmas of British strategy, the emergence of strategic communication can be seen as posing as many problems as solutions for the UK state...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the appropriateness}} of the euro area fiscal stance. In this context, the paper presents the relevant definitions and how the euro area fiscal stance has evolved over time. Furthermore, it contains an evaluation of {{the appropriateness of}} the euro area aggregated fiscal stance set out in the European Commission 2 ̆ 019 s Spring 2016 European Economic Forecast, concluding that, while it is broadly appropriate from the stabilisation perspective, it deviates slightly from the sustainability objective. Finally, the paper investigates the impact of a fiscal stimulus in Germany on the main euro area macroeconomic variables under an adverse risk scenario. The analytical exercise conducted in the paper is agnostic about the relative weights of the <b>stabilisation</b> and sustainability <b>objectives</b> and considers them separately. This is distinct from the SGP framework, which synthesises the two, placing a stronger emphasis on the latter.

40|$|A {{review of}} current {{treatment}} options in multiple myeloma is presented, including data on health-related {{quality of life}} and pharmacoeconomics. For induction chemotherapy, no combination of cytostatic drugs {{has been shown to be}} consistently superior to the simple cyclic oral treatment with melphalan and prednisone that has been available for 30 years. The total resource consumption and direct costs per patient treated with melphalan and prednisone is approximately $US 10 000 (1995 values). As median survival is prolonged from less than a year in untreated patients to 30 to 36 months, this treatment must be considered cost effective. Interferon-alpha has a modest effect on progression-free and overall survival when added to chemotherapy regimens. However, the high cost and toxicity of this drug results in an unfavourable cost-utility ratio, estimated to be between $US 50 000 to $US 100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Clinical trials suggest that high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell support administered to patients who have achieved disease <b>stabilisation</b> or <b>objective</b> response to conventional induction chemotherapy, prolongs median survival by about 1. 5 years. Preliminary cost-utility analyses suggest a cost per life-year gained of $US 30 000 to $US 40 000. Further potential improvements of this therapeutic modality are under way. Several bisphosphonates have been tested for the ability to prevent the skeletal complications of multiple myeloma. Monthly infusions of pamidronate have been shown in 1 randomised trial to significantly reduce the rate of skeletal complications. Unfortunately, the rapid and widespread acceptance of this therapy seems to preclude further prospective, placebo-controlled trials with cost-utility evaluation.

40|$|Introduction : We {{investigated}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of pemetrexed with gemcitabine in heavily pre-treated, chemotherapy refractory, KRAS mutated colorectal cancer (mCRC) and the prognostic value of quantitative levels of cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma. Methods : Inclusion criteria comprised; histopathologically verified, KRAS mutant, chemotherapy resistant mCRC, adequate organ function and performance status. Patients received pemetrexed (initially 500 mg/m 2 q 3 w) + g emcitabine (1250 mg/m 2 days 1 and 8) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. RECIST version 1. 1, NCI-CTCAE version 4. 0 and Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for endpoint evaluation. Cell free DNA was quantified from pre-treatment EDTA plasma-samples by an in-house qPCR. Results : Forty patients were included. The median number of cycles was 3 (range 0 - 12). Thirty-six percent obtained disease <b>stabilisation,</b> but no <b>objective</b> response w as observed. Median PFS and OS were 2. 8 (range 2. 1 - 4. 0) and 5. 4 (range 4. 3 - 7. 0) months, respectively. Adverse events caused immediate discontinuation of treatment or delay of the next cycle and consequently discontinuation in 5 patients. Translational research revealed a shorter PFS and OS with increasing levels of cfDNA. The median PFS in patients with cfDNA levels above the 75 percentile was 2 months compared to 4 months in the remaining patients, HR 3. 23 (1. 05 - 9. 89), p = 0. 0008. The median OS was 3 and 6 months, respectively, HR 2. 9 (95 %CI 0. 98 - 8. 34). Cox regression analysis confirmed that cfDNA remained a significantly independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. Conclusion : Pemetrexed and gemcitabine did not prove sufficient benefit and unacceptable toxicity was observed. The potential value of cfDNA should be investigated further. </p...|$|R
40|$|Man-induced {{changes in}} the {{vegetation}} of New Zealand {{over the last century}} have resulted in large areas of actively eroding land, both in the steeplands which still retain a form of forest cover, and in large areas of moderate to steep hill country cleared for pastoral use. By 1941, the seriousness of the problem had been recognised, and Catchment Authorities were constituted, {{under the auspices of the}} Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Council, to undertake river and erosion control programs. Many techniques were used in erosion control work, but most emphasis has been placed on the planting of trees, largely Populus and Salix species. The planting of trees has proven to have a beneficial effect on counteracting erosion by slumping and gullying, both in retired areas and in those still grazed. It may be assumed that this effect is due primarily to the reinforcing and binding effect of their root systems. The reduction of soil moisture by evapotranspiration is considered to be of secondary importance, as water loss from these deciduous trees is very low in winter, which is the period of maximum soil moisture content and thus maximum instability. In the past, the selection of poplars and willows for erosion control purposes has been based on the growth and characteristics of the shoot of the tree, while almost nothing was known of the root systems. Variations in morphology and strength of root systems obviously are important factors in the selection of the most suitable species or varieties for soil <b>stabilisation</b> purposes. <b>Objectives</b> of the study The primary objective of the study was to Investigate the morphology, anatomy, and soil binding capacity of the root systems of a representative number of Populus and Salix clones, in order to determine whether any of the clones were likely to be superior for soil stabilisation purposes, and to determine which characteristics of the root systems were most important for this purpose, as a basis for the selection of improved varieties...|$|R
40|$|Following {{more than}} one decade of violent and {{uncertain}} transitions in the Balkans, the EU has envisaged a new strategy comprising the perspective of membership for all {{the countries in the}} region. The so-called Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) has become a word of faith loaded with high expectations for change. This paper seeks to analyze the potential of the SAP to foster promised transformation in the region. The paper proceeds in three parts. First, it elaborates on different forms of post-cold war interventions in the region; Second, it outlines the main instruments of the SAP. Third, it delves into the innovative features of the SAP compared to the previous enlargement framework and analyses the implications of these innovations. The paper suggests that the SAP is an undisputed progress compared to the EU previous strategies in the region to the extent it has for the first time embraced the promise of membership and outlined the procedures of accession for all the countries left out of the previous enlargement. Yet, the analysis puts forward that the SAP suffers from the overloaded and not easily reconcilable double agenda including both <b>stabilisation</b> and association <b>objectives.</b> In addition, the SAP commitment to membership is rather vague compared to the previous framework of enlargement. Overall, those features might emasculate the transformative power of the EU enlargement strategy in the region since extensive conditionalities correspond to merely weaker incentives. Moreover, the ambiguity of membership inherent in the SAP, leaves it to the dynamics within the EU to mould the speed and the tone of the eventual enlargement. It cannot certainly be taken for granted as long as the EU suffers from the enlargement fatique and member countries keep resisting further enlargement...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{different}} types of laryngoscopes have been invented to improve the laryngoscopic view of the glottis in normal and difficult airway which helps anaesthesiologists to safeguard the airway during anaesthesia. Patients with cervical spine injury have deleterious compression forces on the spinal cord {{and that should be}} avoided by taking protective measures which include application of rigid collar, a forehead tape and manual-in-line axial <b>stabilisation</b> (MILAS). The <b>objective</b> {{of the study was to}} evaluate the ease of intubation with Airtraq and McCoy laryngoscope as per intubation difficulty score (IDS) with manual-in-line axial stabilization of cervical spine. Methods: In this prospective observational study, 100 adults of ASA I-II, aged 18 to 60 years, with Mallampati classification I and II, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia with oral endotracheal intubation were included. Fifty patients were intubated using Airtraq (Group A). Another fifty patients were intubated using McCoy laryngoscope (Group B). During intubation with both devices, neck was immobilized using MILAS. Ease of intubation as per IDS, insertion of device as per Likert scale, duration of laryngoscopy and intubation, number of attempts, haemodynamic changes and complications were compared for both devices. Results: Demographic characteristics were comparable in both groups. There is no significant difference observed in the heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure during device insertion, intubation and up to 10 minutes after intubation in Airtraq and McCoy group. There is statistically significant difference in number of intubation attempts, duration of laryngoscopy and intubation in both groups. As per Likert scale, ease of insertion of device was statistically insignificant between two groups. McCoy group had statistically significant higher intubation difficulty scores (2. 9 +/- 0. 68) compared to Airtraq group (0. 56 +/- 0. 54) (p= 0. 000). All patients in Airtraq group showed Cormack and Lehane grade 1, while 30 % patients in McCoy group had Cormack and Lehane grade more than 1. Conclusions: The Airtraq facilitates the ease of intubation by providing a better view of the larynx as compared to McCoy laryngoscope in patients with manual-in-line axial stabilization of cervical spine.
