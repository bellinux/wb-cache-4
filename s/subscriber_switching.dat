40|$|This paper explores {{competition}} in the post 1996 long distance telephony market by employing an unusually detailed data set. New evidence of third degree price discrimination is found with rural and low income customer groups facing higher prices. Results indicate that individuals who are less willing to switch carriers frequently pay significantly higher prices. A multi-dimension mixture model is used to characterize switching behavior and finds significant heterogeneity in <b>subscriber</b> <b>switching</b> costs. The switching behavior model provides insight into price differential ranges which support resale firm survival. These findings can be useful for determining optimal firm response as well as optimal telecommunications market policy.

50|$|AXE10 covers {{two main}} types of digital {{telephony}} switching equipment: the remote <b>subscriber</b> <b>switch</b> (RSS) and the AXE10 local switch. RSS {{acts as a}} remote concentrator and deals with the conversion of analogue telephony signals used in the access network, which is the copper pairs between exchange buildings and customer premises, also called local loop, and the multiplexing of customer lines over cabling to the AXE10 local switching unit. The AXE10 local switch uses a processor-controlled switch to route calls and data depending on the destination of the telephony transmission.|$|R

Albrecht, an {{independent}} newspaper carrier, bought from Herald Publishing Company at wholesale and sold at retail copies of Herald's morning newspaper, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, under an exclusive territory arrangement terminable if a carrier exceeded the maximum retail price advertised by Albrecht. When Albrecht exceeded that price, Herald Co. protested {{to him and}} then informed Albrecht's subscribers that it would itself deliver the paper at the lower price. Herald Co. engaged an agency (Milne) to solicit petitioner's customers. About 300 of Albrecht's 1200 <b>subscribers</b> <b>switched</b> to direct delivery by Herald.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} whether a consumer's decision to switch from one mobile phone provider to another is driven by individual consumer characteristics or by actions of other consumers in her social network. Such consumption interdependences are estimated using a unique dataset, which contains transaction data based on anonymized call records from a large European mobile phone carrier to approximate a consumer's social network. Results show that network effects have an important impact on consumers' switching decisions: switching decisions are interdependent between consumers who {{interact with each other}} and this interdependence increases in the closeness between two consumers as measured by the calling data. In other words, if a <b>subscriber</b> <b>switches</b> carriers, she is also affecting the switching probabilities of other individuals in her social circle. The paper argues that such an approach is of high relevance to both switching of providers and to the adoption of new products...|$|R
50|$|The {{deepening}} divide {{within the}} women's movement reached a breaking point with the acrimonious disputes at the American Equal Rights Association meeting in May 1869, {{which led to}} the demise of that organization. Two days after that meeting, the split began to be formalized when the two founders of The Revolution hosted a gathering at which the National Woman Suffrage Association was formed, led by the same two people, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.In November 1869 the competing American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) was formed, with Lucy Stone in the lead. In January 1870 Stone launched a rival newspaper called the Woman's Journal. Both the AWSA and the Woman's Journal supported the Fifteenth Amendment. Despite conjecture at the time, {{there is little evidence that}} The Revolution suffered significantly from competition with the Woman's Journal. Few <b>subscribers</b> <b>switched</b> allegiance, many subscribed to both journals and subscriptions to The Revolution continued to increase.|$|R

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s world, {{mobile phone}} {{penetration}} {{has reached a}} saturation point. As a result, subscriber churn has become an important issue for mobile operators as <b>subscribers</b> <b>switch</b> operators {{for a variety of}} reasons. Mobile operators typically employ churn prediction algorithms based on service usage metrics, network performance indicators, and traditional demographic information. A newly emerging technique is the use of social network analysis (SNA) to identify potential churners. Intuitively, a subscriber who is churning {{will have an impact on}} the churn propensity of his social circle. Call detail records are useful to understand the social connectivity of subscribers through call graphs but do not directly provide the strength of their relationship or have enough information to determine the diffusion of churn influence. In this paper, we present a way to address these challenges by developing a new churn prediction algorithm based on a social network analysis of the call graph. We provide a formulation that quantifies the strength of social ties between users based on multiple attributes and then apply an influence diffusion model over the call graph to determine the net accumulated influence from churners. We combine this influence and other social factors with more traditional metrics and apply machine-learning methods to compute the propensity to churn for individual users. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm over a real data set and quantify the benefit of using SNA in churn prediction...|$|R

5000|$|At {{midnight on}} January 6, 2007, Sinclair pulled KDSM from Mediacom systems in Central Iowa, {{including}} those in Des Moines and Ames, as part of Mediacom's ongoing retransmission dispute with Sinclair. As a result, KDSM began offering $150 rebates (payable as $10 monthly bill credits) for Mediacom <b>subscribers</b> to <b>switch</b> to DirecTV during that time period. Mediacom offered free dipole antennas to subscribers and aired programming from other cable networks in KDSM's place during the impasse. The dispute also affected KFXA in Cedar Rapids, which is operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement. It attracted attention from lawmakers in Iowa and in Washington, D.C.. Finally, on February 2, Mediacom announced that it had signed a retransmission consent agreement with Sinclair. KDSM was restored to Mediacom systems shortly after the announcement.|$|R

40|$|The power {{management}} of ICT systems, that is, data processing (Dp) and telecommunication (Tlc) systems, {{is becoming a}} relevant problem in economical terms. Dp systems totalize millions of servers and associated subsystems (processors, monitors, storage devices, etc.) {{all over the world}} that need to be electrically powered. Dp systems are also used in the government of Tlc systems, which, besides requiring Dp electrical power, also require Tlc-specific power, both for mobile networks (with their cell-phone towers and associated subsystems: base stations, <b>subscriber</b> stations, <b>switching</b> nodes, etc.) and for wired networks (with their routers, gateways, switches, etc.). ICT research is thus expected to investigate into methods to reduce Dp- and Tlc-specific power consumption. However, saving power may turn into waste of performance, in other words, into waste of ICT quality of service (QoS). This paper investigates the Dp and Tlc {{power management}} policies that look at compromises between power saving and QoS...|$|R

Furthermore, mobile number portability has enhanced mobility of subscribers across networks. Mobile number portability means that <b>subscribers</b> can <b>switch</b> mobile network service providers without changing their mobile number despite it being {{issued by the}} network they are leaving. The price war amongst service providers means that all mobile network operators offer mobile voice calls and access to mobile data at comparable rates.

40|$|Mobile number {{portability}} (MNP) means {{the ability of}} mobile <b>subscribers</b> to <b>switch</b> between service providers while retaining their original mobile phone numbers. MNP removes barriers to competition by lowering the switching costs of the end-users. MNP has been implemented {{in most of the}} advanced markets throughout the world. In the European Union, the MNP regulation is based on the Universal Service Directive (Directive 2002 /EC/ 22). The directive requires operators to implement fixed-tofixed and mobile-to-mobile {{number portability}}. In some markets, for example in the US, also fixed-to-mobile number portability is required. In Japan, MNP is not yet required by the regulator. In Finland, MNP was implemented in July 2003, having a strong effect on the competition on the market. Numbers of portings have far exceeded those in experienced in other countries. Reasons for this include e. g. the banning of handset subsidies and long subscription contracts, user-friendly and free-of-charge porting process, and heavy marketing campaigns of mobile operators...|$|R
