40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{performances}} of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils, {{it is necessary to}} store more energy within a shorter HTS tape length and to reduce leakage magnetic fields. To attain these goals, we need to increase the critical current of the coil. The critical currents and n-values of the HTS tape generally depend on the magnitudes and angles of the applied magnetic field. Therefore, we calculated the transport current performances of HTS coils with anisotropic properties. In general, anisotropy generates relatively large electric fields at the coil edges, limiting the transport current performances of the coil. To solve this problem, we proposed a new symmetric, lattice shaped HTS coil cross sections. The coil assembly consists of small ring-shaped coils of rectangular cross section forming pairs of Helmholtz coils. As a result, the angle between the magnetic field and tape and electric fields decreased, resulting in an increase in the critical current of the coil. Through this optimization, the stored energy increased 2. 2 times compared with a normal rectangular <b>solenoid</b> <b>coil</b> <b>with</b> the same HTS tape length. Furthermore, the leakage magnetic field was substantially reduced...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Characterization of {{magnetic}} material embedded in soil subsurface using portable controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) methods requires {{a source of}} continuous signal having frequency more than 1 kHz. This signal is generated by the function generator whose output is amplified by a power amplifier. Alternating current (AC) output of the power amplifier can be varied from 0. 10 A – 0. 45 A at frequency of 5 kHz. To generate AC magnetic field, {{the output of the}} power amplifier is then connected to the <b>solenoid</b> <b>coil</b> <b>with</b> ferrite core which has 130 turns of wire and diameter of 3 cm. The AC magnetic field was detected by a fluxgate sensor with high sensitivity (568 mV/µT or 1. 76 nT/mV). In order to work at higher frequencies, the excitation and phase-frequency detector is adjusted in the electronic circuit of the fluxgate sensor. The signal processing circuits of the fluxgate sensor utilize the 2 nd-order of Butterworth filter with cut-off frequency of 10. 6 kHz. By this method, the fluxgate sensor can detect frequency of AC magnetic field up to 10 kHz. The output voltage of this sensor has a maximum measurement range of 0. 23 – 2. 95 V at 5 kHz.

A soft iron yoke was set below the bulk for the solenoid coil and two yokes are inserted in the bores of the split coil. The maximum trapped held B$_{Zmax}$ {{at the center of}} the bulk surface was 1. 73 T at 40 K in the case of the <b>solenoid</b> <b>coil,</b> <b>with</b> a distorted profile. On the other hand B$_{Zmax}$ was enhanced to 3. 05 T at 40 K for the split coil with two yokes for which a symmetric trapped-held profile was observed. The behavior of the magnetic flux motion indicated two conditions for the enhancement of the trapped held: that the magnetic flux intrudes easily into the bulk even for lower applied fields and then saturates with minimal flux creep. We have also investigated the electromagnetic and thermal properties of the bulk during PFM using a numerical simulation in which the magnetic flux tended to align along the z-axis due to the presence of the soft iron yoke. The use of the split coil with two yokes is effective in enhancing the trapped held for the rectangular-shaped bulks.

40|$|In this thesis, it is {{investigated}} if the Barkhausen noise can {{be detected}} in a rotating environment using a new, passive sensor design. The sensor relies on the relative movement between the measured material and the sensor to function. The idea behind the thesis is to investigate if this sensor can detect changes in the Barkhausen noise measured on a ferromagnetic material as it is being subjected to stress until the point of breakage, and if this change {{can be related to}} fatigue in the material. If this is the case, the sensor-technology could be valuable for e. g. condition monitoring purposes. The work was focused on improving the design of an existing sensor, to build an accompanying measurement system - composed of the sensor, an amplifier, a data acquisition box and a computer - and to provide a proof of concept that the sensor can detect the Barkhausen noise. The sensor in its most basic form consist of a <b>solenoid</b> <b>coil,</b> <b>with</b> or without a core, and a permanent magnet. A number of different sensor versions were made and tested, to investigate the effects of the following parameters: the thread size in the coil, the core material, and the number of magnets and their orientation. To test the functionality of the sensor design, a rotating bending test rig (RotaBend by Sincotec) was used. This machine also allow to expose the specimen to stress, to investigate if a change related to fatigue {{can be detected}}. MATLAB were used as an interface to the data acquisition box, to acquire and analyse data from the measurements using the sensor. The analysis were performed by calculating the RMS-voltage and the Fourier transform of the data. The thesis shows that the sensor can detect the Barkhausen noise in a rotating element. The limited amount of tests also indicates {{that it is possible to}} detect a change in the Barkhausen noise RMS-value as the material of the specimen is fatigued. It has not yet been proven if or how this change can be related to fatigue in the material. The tests also indicates that there is no change in the frequency content of the Barkhausen noise as the material of the specimen is fatigued.
