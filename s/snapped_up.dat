5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E

25|$|A three-year hiatus {{occurred}} before {{the band was}} <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by Rick Rubin's Def American Records for whom they recorded a second self-titled album (Trouble) in 1990 with Rubin producing. More experimental than previous efforts, the album (featuring new drummer Barry Stern, formerly of Zoetrope) expanded upon the group's tentative psychedelic notions within its traditional use of power chords.|$|E
25|$|Campese quickly {{went from}} hero to villain. Standing in a tackle near the sideline, {{he threw a}} madcap pass infield which was <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by Joe Stanley, the All Black centre. He sped clear before being pulled down short of the line in a desperate tackle by Lynagh. The damage had been done. Stanley popped up a pass to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden, who capped a superlative game by scoring a try beside the posts.|$|E

25|$|In the {{two years}} after the {{organizing}} drive, the company continued to see wide swings in profitability. In 1920, the company's profits fell again, and a merger was rumored. The company declared itself profitable in late 1920, and then reported large deficits in 1921. Rumors that the company might sell itself emerged in mid-October 1921, but in fact the firm went on a buying spree and <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> a pig iron manufacturer and a steel bridge maker.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the greatly {{increased}} accuracy and ease-of-use of Loran-C, Loran-A remained in widespread use. This was due largely to two important factors. One was that the electronics needed to read a Loran-C signal were complex, and {{in the era of}} tube-based electronics, physically very large, generally fragile, and expensive. Further, as military ships and aircraft moved from Loran-A to Loran-C, the older receivers were made surplus. These older units were <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by commercial fisherman and other users, keeping it in widespread service.|$|E
25|$|In February 1964, he traded Dick Duff, Bob Nevin {{and three}} young {{prospects}} – Rod Seiling, Arnie Brown and Bill Collins – to the Rangers for Andy Bathgate and Don McKenney. Nevin {{played a major}} role in the Rangers' resurgence in the late 1960s, while Duff won four more Cups with the Canadiens. The players acquired by the Leafs were both gone following the next season. In the 1965 intra-league draft, Imlach left Gerry Cheevers, a young goaltending prospect, unprotected. He was <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by the Boston Bruins and went on to have a Hall-of-Fame career there.|$|E

25|$|Having been a {{free agent}} for over a month, Collins was <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by League Two side Grimsby Town on 12 September 2016 on a 6-month {{contract}}. He made his full debut with Grimsby on 24 September 2016, in their 1–0 win at Mansfield Town. He scored his first goal for the club on 19 November 2016 from a corner, he placed a header from close range {{to take the lead}} in their 3–0 victory at Plymouth Argyle. Having been ever-present under Paul Hurst and new manager Marcus Bignot, Collins agreed to extend his contract until the end of the season.|$|E
25|$|While {{the action}} in La Bisbal was going on, Schwarz's other {{outposts}} were being <b>snapped</b> <b>up.</b> Fane and Doyle landed their troops at Palamós and captured it. Colonel Aldea's column overran Calonge while Colonel Fleires's column seized Sant Feliu. Rouyer at Girona was unable to intervene because O'Donnell called out the local miquelets to harass his garrison. Schwarz, two colonels, 56 officers, 1,183 men, and 17 guns were captured {{for a total of}} 1,242 prisoners. The Germans also lost approximately 400 killed and wounded. Spanish losses were not reported but were probably light. However, they included O'Donnell who was badly wounded in the foot at La Bisbal. The Spanish general and the German prisoners were taken aboard Fane's squadron before it sailed back to Tarragona.|$|E
25|$|After {{achieving}} fame on the L.A. club scene, {{the band}} recorded a demo tape in September 1987 for Paisley Park Records, a record label owned by musician Prince. With major labels taking an interest and after recording tracks for A Records the band also {{put in a}} showing on the movie soundtrack to Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Eventually {{it was announced that}} Columbia had <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> the band. Lane immediately spent his advance on a black Corvette which he promptly crashed. Warrant opened their campaign in September billed with D'MOLLS followed by dates with Britny Fox. The label immediately arranged for them to work with the in demand Beau Hill as producer on what would become the band's debut album.|$|E

60|$|I {{did not go}} {{till the}} {{following}} week, when I found {{that no one had}} attempted to <b>snap</b> <b>up</b> the Conwell place. In fact, it rather <b>snapped</b> me <b>up,</b> I secured it with so little trouble. I reported it so perfect that all my wife's fears of a latent objection to it were roused again. But when I said I thought we could relinquish it, her terrors subsided; and I thought this the right moment to deliver a stroke that I had been holding in reserve.|$|R
25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. We had it {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, he flicked the ball back infield where it was <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts. The easiest of conversions made it one point the difference, and in the dozen minutes remaining we had to tackle like mad dogs in the fierce wind and pelting rain to keep them out. We were tremendously relieved at fulltime...|$|E
25|$|He was <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> {{quickly by}} then Celtic manager Gordon Strachan, {{to cover for}} the loss of Chris Sutton, on a {{contract}} {{until the end of the}} season. At Celtic, Dublin achieved double success, with Scottish League Cup and Scottish Premier League winner's medals. On 19 March 2006, Dublin came on as a sub and scored the final goal as Celtic defeated Dunfermline 3–0 to win the Scottish League Cup final, and also played enough matches with Celtic to merit a title medal. In the league, he made three league starts and eight substitute appearances for Celtic, scoring once against Kilmarnock on 9 April 2006 in a 4–1 win at Rugby Park. Despite one or two decent performances for the Parkhead outift, Dublin was released by manager Gordon Strachan in May 2006.|$|E
25|$|August {{started with}} a {{friendly}} against Rangers at Tannadice and United showed that they could still compete with the best as they narrowly lost 2–1. Just days later, United played Dundee at Tannadice in Dave Bowman's testimonial match, with United winning 2–0. The season got under way with a draw with Morton at Tannadice with five new players in the starting line-up, then a short trip down the road saw Cowdenbeath beaten in the 2nd round of the League Cup. With United now playing in the First Division, they were entered into the Scottish Challenge Cup for the first time, and won 2–0 at Stranraer. a 3–0 defeat away to Dunfermline meant United had picked up only one point in their opening two league matches. Kirkwood then <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> former Rangers and Aberdeen player Jim Bett, following his release from Hearts. The 3rd round of the League Cup saw Motherwell win 2–1 at Tannadice, giving United one less distraction during a difficult season.|$|E
50|$|The Rossoneri won {{again the}} {{following}} Sataurday, <b>snapping</b> <b>up</b> a 1-0 victory in Turin against Juventus.

25|$|Grout's last Test {{was played}} in the 1965-66 Ashes series. In the first innings of the Second Test he took 3 catches in an innings and {{although}} Australia lost the Third Test at Sydney by an innings Colin Cowdrey, M.J.K. Smith, Dave Brown and Jim Parks were caught by Grout off Neil Hawke in succession. Grout then <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> Fred Titmus off Doug Walters to give him five catches in an innings. In the Fourth Test Cowdrey thought a shout was Grout was Ken Barrington calling him for a run and he was run out as England collapsed to 241 all out {{on the first day}} and lost by an innings, Grout taking 3 catches in the second innings. In the first innings of the Fifth Test he took 4 catches in his last Test to bring his total to 15 catches and 1 stumping in the series as Australia retained the Ashes with a 1-1 draw.|$|E
25|$|Guglielmo Dei set up Scuderia Centro Sud to {{publicise}} {{his business}} as distributor of Maserati cars to {{central and southern}} Italy, hence the name he chose for his team. Having fielded Maserati 250Fs for several years he switched to T51s midway through 1960, with the Climax replaced with a two-year-old 2.5-litre Maserati straight-4 250s engine which was used in Maserati's unspectacular 250S sportscar. In this configuration Centro Sud entered the T51 in 14 World Championship races, {{more than any other}} entrant. After converting to the 1.5-litre formula post-1960, Centro Sud's Cooper Maseratis still made the occasional appearance in minor Italian F1 races as late as 1963. Dei never kept his drivers for long, as they tended to be either journeymen, faded former stars like Maurice Trintignant, or up-and-coming racers like Wolfgang Von Trips who would soon be <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by bigger teams. In all, more than a dozen drivers drove T51s for Centro Sud.|$|E
25|$|Today modern Egyptologists {{evaluate}} Herodotus's and Diodorus's {{stories as}} some sort of defamation, based on both author's contemporary philosophy. Oversized tombs such as the Giza-pyramids must have appalled the Greeks and even the later priests of the New Kingdom, because they surely remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniac building projects. This extremely negative picture was obviously projected onto Khafra and his daunting pyramid. The view was possibly promoted by the fact, that during Khafra's lifetime the permission of the creation of oversized statues made of precious stone and their displaying at open places in public was limited to the king only. At their lifetime, the Greek authors and mortuary priests and temple priests couldn't explain the impressive monuments and statues of Khafra better than {{as the result of a}} megalomaniac character. These views and resulting stories were avidly <b>snapped</b> <b>up</b> by the Greek historians and so they made their also negative evaluations about Khafra, since scandalous stories were easier to sell to the public than positive (and therefore boring) tales.|$|E
