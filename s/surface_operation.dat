40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades the successes of Traffic Flow Management (TFM) {{initiatives}} have successfully decreased the airborne delay for the flights in the National Airspace System (NAS). The next opportunity for efficiency improvement is airport <b>surface</b> <b>operations.</b> Research on <b>surface</b> <b>operations</b> has focused on methods of analysis and metrics using time-stamped event data and surface track data to quantify performance of “normal ” operations. This paper describes a method using time-stamped event data to quantify and diagnose “irregular ” <b>surface</b> <b>operations</b> (i. e. <b>surface</b> counts in excess of two standard deviations from the mean worst-case surface count). An analysis of <b>surface</b> <b>operations</b> at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) airport for 2012 identified an average surface count of 25 active flights, with an average daily maximum surface count of 67. The daily maximum surface count ranged from 46 to 124 active flights. On 18 days the daily maximum surface count exceeded 2 standard deviations from the average (i. e. 2 = 86 flights). Fifteen of these days occurred between May and August. There are multiple patterns in the surface counts in excess of 2 : (i) reduced airport departure rates coupled with arrivals being delayed by a ground delay program (ii) changes in runway configuration, (iii...|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} World War I, it was {{realized}} that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem. This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two hulls; internal for holding pressure, and external for optimal shape. Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial cover on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged. Germany went further with the Type XXI, a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for <b>surface</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Qualification of motors {{for deep}} space under extreme thermal environments to be {{encountered}} during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission {{is required to}} verify the reliability and validate mission assurance requirements. The motor assembly must survive all ground operations, plus the nominal 670 Martian-day (or sol) mission that includes summer and winter seasons of the Mars environment. The motor assembly was tested and characterized under extreme temperature conditions with reference to hardware requirements. The motor assembly has been proved to be remarkably robust and displayed no sign of degradation due to the 3 X (three times per JPL design principles) thermal environmental exposure to the punishing Mars <b>surface</b> <b>operations</b> cycles. The motor characteristics obtained before, during, and post-test comparisons for the <b>surface</b> <b>operations</b> cycles are within measurement error of one another.

Foxleigh currently produces a low volatile pulverised coal injection (PCI) coal product for use in steelmaking applications around the world. Foxleigh coal is taken from the Middlemount, Tralee, Roper and Pisces seams from within the Rangal coal measures in the southern Bowen Basin. Annual Production: Foxleigh produces approximately 2.5 million tonnes per annum of pulverised coal injection (PCI) coal for the steelmaking industry. The mine’s production capacity is 3.3 million tonnes per annum of product coal. Reserves: Estimated coal resources are approximately 290 million tonnes - Foxleigh and surrounding tenements are the subject of ongoing exploration and feasibility studies.|$|E
50|$|Operation Rheinübung was a failure, and {{although}} the Germans scored an incidental success by sinking the old battlecruiser HMS Hood, {{this was more than}} offset with the loss of the modern battleship Bismarck, which represented one-quarter of the Kriegsmarines capital ships. No merchant ships were sunk or even sighted by the German heavy surface units during the 2-week raid. Allied convoys were not seriously disrupted; most convoys sailed according to schedule, and there was no diminution of supplies to Britain. On the other hand, the Atlantic U-boat campaign was disrupted; boats in the Atlantic sank just 2 ships in the last weeks of May, compared to 29 {{at the beginning of the}} month. As a result of Bismarcks sinking, Hitler forbade any further Atlantic sorties, and her sister ship Tirpitz was sent to Norway. The Kriegsmarine was never again able to mount a major <b>surface</b> <b>operation</b> against Allied supply routes in the North Atlantic; henceforth its only weapon was the U-boat campaign.|$|E

Deposits at the project named Touquoy hold an estimated 635,000 ounces (~18 tons) of gold, worth $700 million in 2012. [...] The <b>surface</b> <b>operation</b> will involve drilling, blasting, and gold cyanidation to process the ore.

The Moose River mine will have a life of five years and Beaver Dam just three. There are more deposits at Cochrane Hill and Fifteen Mile Stream, 57 km away.|$|E

We present charts that depict structured information transfer across shifts. These charts show personnel schedules, meetings attended, handovers, and hand-offs on both the MER and on the earlier Mars Pathfinder Mission (MPF).
