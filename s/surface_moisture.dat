40|$|Soil {{moisture}} and its distribution {{in space and}} time plays a decisive role in terrestrial water and energy cycles. It controls the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and runoff as well as the partitioning of solar radiation into latent and sensible heat flux. Therefore it has a strong impact on numerous processes, e. g., controlling floods, crop yield, erosion, and climate processes. Soil <b>moisture,</b> and <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> in particular, is highly variable {{in space and time}} and its spatial and temporal patterns in an agricultural landscape are affected by multiple natural (precipitation, soil, etc.) and agricultural (soil management, fertilization etc.) parameters. Against this background, the current study investigates the spatial and temporal patterns of <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> in an agricultural landscape, to determine the dominant parameters and the underlying processes controlling these patterns. The study was conducted on different spatial scales, from the field scale to the whole catchment scale of the river Rur (2364 km 2) in Western Germany, because observed patterns are intrinsically connected to the scale on which they are observed. For the investigation three different approaches were used: Analysis based on A) Field measurements, B) Radar remote sensing, and C) Ecohydrological modeling. Extensive field measurements were carried out in a small arable land and grassland test site, measuring <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture,</b> plant parameters, meteorological parameters, and soil parameters. These measurements were used to analyze the small scale (field scale) patterns of <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and for the validation of the two other methods. Since large scale investigations based on field measurements are generally not feasible, <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> maps from radar remote sensing and ecohydrological modeling were used to analyze large scale patterns of <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and their scaling properties. Precipitation, vegetation patterns, topography and soil properties were found to be the dominant parameters for soil moisture patterns in an agriculturally used landscape. Precipitation can be assumed to be homogeneous on the small scale, but can be very heterogeneous on the large scale at the same time. Evapotranspiration causes high small scale variability, especially during the growing season. If analyzed on coarser resolutions, this small scale pattern is smoothed out. Topography is a source of small scale patterns only on wet <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> states, because of the lateral redistribution of water during or shortly after precipitation events. Soils have a major influence on the variability of <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> on all scales, due to the large heterogeneity of soil properties within a given soil type (small scale) and between different soil types (large scale). Altogether, the variability of <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> increases with an increasing size of the investigation area and with an increasing resolution within the investigation area. During {{the course of the year}} <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> variability and its scaling properties are being influenced by different parameters with temporally varying intensities. During the growing season, at the time of high small scale variability of evapotranspiration, the variability of <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is high and decreases much stronger with decreasing spatial resolution of the investigation, than during times outside the growing season. In the beginning and towards the end of the year (outside the growing season, when the soil is wet) the patterns and their scaling properties are mainly determined by soil properties. Precipitation events generally superimpose their large scale patterns for a short period of time and diminish the small scale variability induced by evapotranspiration. This thesis improves the knowledge about <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> patterns in agriculturally used areas and their underlying processes. The results of the scaling analysis indicate the potential to use vegetation and precipitation parameters for downscaling purposes. Understanding the subscale soil moisture heterogeneity is, for example, particularly relevant to better utilize coarse scale soil moisture data derived from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) or the upcoming SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite measurements. ...|$|R

L-MEB parameters are key ancillary information for the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) retrieval algorithm that produces estimates of the <b>surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> from measurements of the surface brightness temperature at L-band. L-band data sets from three ground-based experiments over grass are analysed in this paper: BARC (orchard grass and alfalfa), ELBARA-ETH (clover grass), and SMOSREX (grass and litter from a field left fallow). Modelling of the brightness temperature using the zero-th order radiative transfer model in L-MEB indicates that the vegetation appears isotropic to microwaves propagating with horizontal polarisation, and that the single scattering albedo can be neglected. At vertical polarisation, non-zero scattering is observed for all the grass data sets. <b>Surface</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is retrieved with enough accuracy for all data sets as long as the soil and litter emission are calibrated beforehand.
