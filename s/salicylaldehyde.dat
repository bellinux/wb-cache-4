2500|$|<b>Salicylaldehyde</b> (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) was {{identified}} as a characteristic component of buckwheat aroma. 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, phenylacetaldehyde, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, (E)-2-nonenal, decanal and [...] hexanal also contribute to its aroma. They all have odour activity value more than 50, but the aroma of these substances in an isolated state does not resemble buckwheat.|$|E
2500|$|Leaf beetles {{produce a}} {{spectrum}} of chemicals for their protection from predators. In {{the case of the}} subtribe Chrysomelina (Chrysomelinae), all live stages are protected by the occurrence of isoxazolin-5-one derived glucosides that partially contain esters of 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The latter compound is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. Hence, 3-NPA inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition leads to neurodegeneration with symptoms similar to those caused by Huntington's disease. [...] Since leaf beetles produce high concentrations of 3-NPA esters, a powerful chemical defense against a wide range of different predators is obvious. The larvae of Chrysomelina leaf beetles developed a second defensive strategy that is based on the excretion of droplets via pairs of defensive glands {{at the back of the}} insects. These droplets are immediately presented after mechanical disturbance and contain volatile compounds that derive from sequestered plant metabolites. Due to the specialization of leaf beetles to a certain host plant, the composition of the larval secretion is species-dependent. For instance, the red poplar leaf beetle (Chrysomela populi) consumes the leaves of poplar plants, which contain salicin. This compound is taken up by the insect and then further transformed biochemically into <b>salicylaldehyde,</b> an odor very similar to benzaldehyde. The presence of salicin and <b>salicylaldehyde</b> can repel potential predators of leaf beetles.|$|E
2500|$|Cancer is a {{complicated}} disease that is not well understood. Some researchers are investigating the possible role of copper in angiogenesis associated with different types of cancers. [...] A copper chelator, tetrathiomolybdate, which depletes copper stores in the body, is under investigation as an anti-angiogenic agent in pilot and clinical trials. The drug may inhibit tumor angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma, pleural mesothelioma, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and kidney cancer.
