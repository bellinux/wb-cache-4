40|$|The {{presence}} of N -nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) {{in drinking water}} supplies has raised concern over its removal by common drinking water treatment processes. A simple detection method based on scintillation spectroscopy {{has been used to}} quantify the concentration of 14 C-labeled NDMA at various ratios of sample to <b>scintillation</b> <b>liquid.</b> Without sample pretreatment, the method detection limits are 0. 91, 0. 98, 1. 23, and 1. 45 ng/L of NDMA at scintillation intensity ratios of 10 : 10, 5 : 15, 15 : 5, and 2. 5 : 17. 5 (sample: <b>scintillation</b> <b>liquid),</b> respectively. The scintillation intensity in all cases is linear (R 2 > 0. 99) and is in the range of 0 to 100 ng/L of NDMA. In addition, because scintillation intensity is independent of solution pH, conductivity, and background electrolyte ion types, a separate calibration curve is unnecessary for NDMA samples at different solution conditions. Bench-scale experiments were performed to simulate individual treatment processes, which include coagulation and adsorption by powdered activated carbon (PAC), as used in a drinking water treatment plant, and biosorption, a technique used in biological treatment of waste water. The commonly used coagulation process for particulate control and biosorption is ineffective for removing NDMA (< 10 % by coagulation and < 20 % by biosorption). However, high doses of PAC may be applied to remove NDMA...|$|E

There were few significant differences in the efficiency of 14 C and ³H counting obtained with biodegradable or non-biodegradable scintillation liquids.

40|$|Authors: Palanimurugan R & R Jürgen Dohmen ### Abstract We have {{established}} an ultrafiltration-based *in vitro* assay for determining polyamine binding to proteins. In the protocol described {{here we have}} used *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* ODC antizyme protein produced in *E. coli* and radioactive polyamines to measure the direct binding of polyamines to ODC antizyme protein. ### Introduction Polyamines are small aliphatic polycations present in all cells. Polyamines {{are known to have}} several important functions, which are essential for life (Ref. 1). The cellular polyamine pool contains several modified forms of polyamines, however putrescine, spemidine and spermine are the most abundant among others. Normally polyamines exert their molecular functions by direct binding to cellular macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins (Refs. 1 and 2). We {{have established}} an in vitro polyamine binding assay that enables identification and characterization of novel polyamine targets. Using this ultrafiltration-based protocol, we have assayed polyamine (spermidine or spermine) binding to yeast or human ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) antizyme (AZ) (Refs. 3 and 4) protein produced in *Escherichia coli*. Apart from being easy and fast, this protocol requires only small quantities of purified proteins for determination of polyamine binding. Combined with protein fractionation methods, this protocol can be applied for the identification of novel intra or extra cellular polyamine binding proteins. The protocol given below describes determination of polyamine binding for 6 His-tagged *S. cerevisiae* ODC antizyme (OAZ 1). An adopted version of this protocol was used to determine polyamine binding to human antizyme fused to maltose binding protein (Ref. 4). ### Reagents 1. Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. 8 at 4 °C) - [3 H]-spemidine (PerkinElmer, cat No: NET 522001 MC) - [14 C]-spermine (GE Healthcare, cat No: CFA 511) - 6 His-OAZ 1 (*S. cerevisiae*) in IMAC elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. 8 containing 250 mM imidazole) after expression in E. coli and purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). - Mock preparation from *E. coli* cells transformed with an empty vector not expressing 6 His-OAZ 1. - <b>Scintillation</b> <b>liquid</b> (picard) - Microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) ### Equipment 1. Refrigerated Microcentrifuge - Centrifugal filter, Modified polyethersulfone (PES) 10 K (VWR, Cat No: 82031 - 350) - Scintillation counter ### Procedure 1. Keep all reagents on ice. Pre-cool the centrifuge to 4 °C. - Label the microcentrifuge tubes and keep them on ice. - Prepare the polyamine binding mix in the pre-cooled microcentrifuge tubes as shown Table A & B shown in figures section. - Mix the polyamine binding mix gently and incubate on ice for 60 min. - Place the filtration device in a 1. 5 ml collection tube and pre-cool on ice. - After the 60 min incubation time, transfer 100 μL of the polyamine binding mix to the appropriately labelled filtration devices. - Filter the free polyamines by spinning at 2500 xg for 5 min at 4 °C - Prepare microcentrifugefuge tubes with 1 mL <b>scintillation</b> <b>liquid</b> (two tubes with <b>scintillation</b> <b>liquid</b> for every filter device used) and keep them at room temperature. - Remove 10 μL of the retentate from inside the cut-off filter device and add it to microcentrifuge tube with <b>scintillation</b> <b>liquid</b> marked as “retentate”. - Remove 10 μL of filtrate from the collection tube of the filtration device and add it to the second microcentrifuge tube with <b>scintillation</b> <b>liquid</b> marked as “filtrate”. - Vortex for 10 s and proceed with scintillation counting. - From the resulting CPM (Counts per Minute) values, calculate the percentage of protein-bound polyamines using the following formula. Percentage polyamine Binding = {(CPMretentate- CPMfiltrate) / CPMretentate} x 100 ### Timing About 2 hours ### Troubleshooting No Binding: Verify that the protein did not precipitate during the assay. Perform the polyamine binding assay immediately after purification of protein. Strictly avoid freezing and thawing of purified OAZ 1. ### Anticipated Results 1. Binding: CPM in filtrate will be less than retentate - No Binding: CPM in filtrate will be similar to retentate Representative results for spermine and spermidine binding to *S. cerevisiae* OAZ 1 are shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 9 of Kurian et al.

40|$|Direct {{searches}} for light dark matter particles (mass $< 10 $ GeV) are especially challenging {{because of the}} low energies transferred in elastic scattering to typical heavy nuclear targets. We investigate {{the possibility of using}} liquid Helium- 4 as a target material, taking advantage of the favorable kinematic matching of the Helium nucleus to light dark matter particles. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to calculate the charge, scintillation, and triplet helium molecule signals produced by recoil He ions, for a variety of energies and electric fields. We show that excellent background rejection can be achieved based on the ratios between different signal channels. We also present some concepts for a liquid-helium-based dark matter detector. Key to the proposed approach is the use of a large electric field to extract electrons from the event site, and the amplification of this charge signal, through proportional <b>scintillation,</b> <b>liquid</b> electroluminescence, or roton emission.

40|$|Dark matter can be gravitationally {{captured}} by the Sun after scattering off solar nuclei. Annihilations of the dark matter trapped and accumulated in {{the centre of the}} Sun could result {{in one of the most}} detectable and recognizable signals for dark matter. Searches for high-energy neutrinos produced in the decay of annihilation products have yielded extremely competitive constraints on the spin-dependent scattering cross sections of dark matter with nuclei. Recently, the low energy neutrino signal arising from dark-matter annihilation to quarks which then hadronize and shower has been suggested as a competitive and complementary search strategy. These high-multiplicity hadronic showers give rise to a large amount of pions which will come to rest in the Sun and decay, leading to a unique sub-GeV neutrino signal. We here improve on previous works by considering the monoenergetic neutrino signal arising from both pion and kaon decay.

Commercial sealed standards usually contain a toluene or xylene based cocktail and carbon tetrachloride or nitromethane as quencher. However, the unknown samples may contain another solvent and other chemical quenchers.

As reported in earlier literature, different solvents and chemical quenchers lead to different quench curves, but no physical explanation has been given. In this work, quench curves for several commercial cocktails with chemical quenchers and one color quencher have been measured. The counting efficiency and the mean pulse height of the isotope (3 H) were recorded for different amounts of quencher and with varying coincidence resolving time of the counter. The differences in quenching characteristics can be explained as differences in the scintillation pulse shapes. The shape of the scintillation pulse is primarily dependent on the way the excitation energy is deposited in the solvent and on how the chemical quenchers act on the excited solvent molecules. The data indicate that there are mainly two different chemical quenching mechanisms: quenching of the higher excited states, which are precursors of the triplet states, and quenching of the lower singlet states...|$|E

A fast {{method is}} {{presented}} for determining radioactive isotopes of Sr in environmental and bioassay samples using extraction chromatography and {{liquid scintillation counting}} performed in a 3 -window region under normal counting mode, which yields the best sensitivity values (E 2 /B). Prior to application of radiochemical separation procedures, all samples are spiked initially with almost carrier-free 85 S tracer for calculation of the chemical recovery. After i) preconcentration of Sr via oxalic acid (soil, grass) or carbonate precipitation (urine, waste water) and ii) redissolution in nitric acid and purification using SrSpec resin, iii) LS counting is performed in a 3 -window region, i. e. ranging from 0 – 10 keV (85 Sr spike); 10 – 300 keV, the maximum energy of 90 Sr on the LS scale (for 90 Sr + 89 Sr); and 300 – 1200 keV (for 89 Sr + ingrowing 90 Y). Constant quench conditions are obtained by preparing cocktail solutions consisting of a mixture of 2 mL toluene sulfonic acid (in which the Sr fraction is dissolved) and 18 mL Ultima Gold LLT <b>scintillation</b> <b>liquid.</b> This mixture results in highly reproducible β spectra, i. e. the counting efficiencies of the different isotopes remain constant and independent on the starting matrix taken for anal-ysis.

Using low-level LS spec-trometers such as the PerkinElmer Tri-Carb 2550 TR/AB, detection limits for both Sr radioisotopes of < 0. 1 Bq/L are obtained in a 5 × 100 -min counting interval if 0. 2 -L water aliquots are processed. The 3 -isotope/ 3 -window approach was validated internally on various matrices and by participation in an intercomparison exercise on artificial reactor water samples (Germa...|$|E

The development of a low-background <b>liquid</b> <b>scintillation</b> counter is currently underway to further augment the measurement capabilities within this underground laboratory. <b>Liquid</b> <b>scintillation</b> counting is especially useful for measuring charged particle (e. g., β, α) emitting isotopes with no (or very weak) gamma-ray yields. The combination of high-efficiency detection of charged particle emission in a <b>liquid</b> <b>scintillation</b> cocktail coupled with the low-background environment of an appropriately-designed shield located in a clean underground laboratory provides the opportunity for increased-sensitivity measurements {{of a range of}} isotopes. To take advantage of the 35 meters-water-equivalent overburden of the underground laboratory, a series of simulations have evaluated the scintillation counter's shield design requirements to assess the possible background rate achievable.
