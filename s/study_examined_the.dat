5|$|A {{laboratory}} <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> {{effects on}} the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of fishers preying on cats and small dogs; in Massachusetts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517202212/http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/wildlife/living/living_with_fisher.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2016}} but in general, the evidence suggests these attacks are rare. A 1979 <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> stomach contents of all fishers trapped in the state of New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only 1 of over 1,000 stomachs. More recent studies in suburban upstate New York and Massachusetts found no cat remains in 24 and 226 fisher diet samples (scat and stomach contents) respectively. While there is popular belief for more frequent attacks on pets, zoologists suggest bobcats or coyotes are more likely to prey upon domestic cats and chickens.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{individual}} differences is well established in psychology, but has not been extensively applied to clergy. This dissertation identifies seven areas {{of individual differences}} relevant {{to the field of}} ministry <b>studies</b> and <b>examines</b> each of these areas through two perspectives. The first perspective draws together insight from the wider psychological literature. <b>The</b> second perspective <b>examines</b> new data from a survey conducted among 370 clergy currently serving in the Church in Wales. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> begins by <b>examining</b> <b>the</b> psychological type profile of clergy, drawing on Jung's model of psychological type and using the Francis Psychological Type Scales. Second, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> work-related psychological health of clergy, drawing on the balanced affect model of wellbeing and using the Satisfaction in Ministry Scale and the Scale of Emotional Exhaustion in Ministry. Third, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> preferred ministry styles exercised by clergy using the Payne Index of Ministry Styles. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> Emotional Intelligence of clergy using the Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale. Fifth, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> diurnal rhythms displayed by clergy using the Francis Owl Lark Index. Sixth, the study assesses the personality of clergy using the three dimensional model of personality developed by Eysenck. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> ministry lifestyle modelled by clergy, using a new instrument developed for this survey.

5|$|A 2017 <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> {{histology}} of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, {{and contemporary}} accounts, to recover {{information about the}} life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E

5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points {{out that it is}} impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E

In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.|$|E

25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The <b>study</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> extent to which religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E
