40|$|The {{response}} of a vertical pile {{embedded in a}} dry dense sand when subjected to cyclic lateral loading is studied numerically. Three-dimensional finite element analyses with a new constitutive model of cyclic behavior of sand reproduce published centrifuge tests results. Three types of cyclic loading, two asymmetric and one symmetric are applied. Performance measure parameters (the normalized tangent and <b>secant</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> {{with respect to the}} first cycle of loading and the relative pile head displacement between two consecutive loading-unloading reversal points) are introduced to evaluate the results of the overall {{response of}} the pile-soil system. The results replicate the plastic shakedown response of the pile -soil system during cyclic loading, a response which is attributed to two mechanisms (a) soil densification and (b) "" system"" densification due to the gradual enlargement of the resisting soil mass to greater depths with cyclic loading. It is shown that the hardening mechanism of "" system"" densification dominates upon soil densification in cyclic loading. The response of a 1. ×. 2 pile group under cyclic lateral loading is also numerically investigated, emphasizing the role of cyclic loading on (a) the pile-to-pile interaction, (b) the additional pile distress due to the group effect, and (c) the shadow effect. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

This paper identifies various challenges associated with the application of both initial stiffness and <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> based DBD methods and considers whether one form is more effective than the other. Four of the most recent DBD methods that utilise response spectra are reviewed, two of which are initial stiffness based and two of which are <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> based.

Finally, the performance of each procedure is assessed by means of non-linear time history analyses. Despite the differences in strength, the performance assessment indicates that each of the DBD methods ensure design limit states are not exceeded. The results of the study infer that DBD utilising response spectra with either initial stiffness or <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> structural characteristics may be equally effective. The biggest difference between approaches may be related to the ease with which they can be accurately applied to various structural forms.

Analyses based on limit equilibrium are generally sufficient to establish hazard zones.

The observable damage initiation and evolution {{as a function of}} the cyclic number were directly measured at the notched specimen surface with a video-camera system. The fatigue strengths of the unnotched and notched specimens were determined. The results show that the normalized apparent <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> change curves as a function of cyclic numbers can be divided into three stages. For the first and the second stages in notched specimens and for total life of unnotched specimens, the damage has not been evidently observed and certainly verified with the traditional experimental methods such as radiography and microscopy although many acoustic emission signals can be obtained. The last stage for the notched specimens (N/Nf> 0. 4, the <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> decreases fast) corresponds to the initiation and evolution of the observable damages. The fatigue strength of these woven composite laminates is dominated by the third stage during which the observable damage develops along the specimen ligament until fracture. During the third stage, a critical dimension at the specimen ligament and a life threshold can be found beyond which a final catastrophic fracture will immediately occur. The quasi-isotropic laminate is of a fatigue strength lower than the two orthotropic laminates of which the fatigue strengths are approaching to each other.

The proposed method {{is based on}} an iterative, <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> formulation and employs constitutive laws for cracked reinforced concrete, while considering strain compatibility. The <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> formulation approach has previously been implemented in nonlinear finite element procedures to predict the nonlinear response of reinforced concrete membrane elements (Vecchio 1989), as well as to estimate the load-carrying capacity of deep beams (Park and Kuchma 2007).

This method is used successfully to predict the load-carrying capacity of 455 corbels that have been tested experimentally.

The complexity {{give rise to}} both advanced and simplified analytical tools. Today numerical approaches such as the finite element method are most commonly used. Although many analytical and simplified methods have been developed, no standardized approach is established for caisson foundations. At the ISFOG-conference held in Oslo 2015, the Simplified Modal Non-linear Analysis was introduced. The method use springs to represent the subgrade in a two degree of freedom system. Based on force-displacement and moment-rotation relations from external soil-caisson analyses, <b>secant</b> spring <b>stiffness</b> are used. An iterative modal analysis procedure is then conducted, giving non-linear properties to the springs. Relevant accelerations are retrieved from an acceleration response spectrum. Dynamic force and overturning moment are calculated with corresponding lateral displacement and rocking motion. Foundation mass and soil added mass have been neglected in previous studies of the SMNA-method. This work is a parametric study to further develop the method studying inertial effects. Numerical analyses are first conducted in PLAXIS 3 D, which provide indicative results. The simplified model is then calibrated based on consistency with the numerical model. The initial SMNA-results show very low dynamic forces and excessively large moments, when soil added mass are introduced.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the interface between dry Ottawa sand and concrete has been studied using a new device developed for the cyclic testing of interfaces and joints. The stress conditions existing in the test device are investigated using stress cell measurements and a two-dimensional finite element analysis. A series of cyclic displacement-controlled interface tests are described in which the {{behavior of}} the interface is found to be a function of the applied normal stress, the amplitude of the applied displacement, the density of the sand, and the number of applied loading cycles. The (<b>secant)</b> shear <b>stiffness</b> is shown to increase with number of loading cycles, corresponding to an increase in sand density. The results of the laboratory tests are used to determine the parameters for use in a Ramberg-Osgood model to describe the interface shear stress-deformation response. This model is shown to describe the hysteresis {{behavior of the}} interface as a function of normal stress, density, and number of loading cycles. The model is used to predict the results of cyclic direct shear tests, and was found to yield satisfactory results. The interface model is implemented in a dynamic one-dimensional finite element procedure in which the soil and interface response are represented by nonlinear springs attached to the nodal points. The finite element procedure is verified by solving some simple problems for which exact or closed-form solutions are available. The response of a stress-controlled sand-concrete interface test is then predicted using the FE procedure with the nonlinear sand-concrete interface model. Although the one-dimensional idealization is a gross approximation to the three-dimensional test condition, reasonable results are obtained. A pile subjected to a harmonic axial load is then analyzed. The computed response is compared to an analytical solution and the observed response of a test pile reported by others. The effects of including interface behavior is demonstrated by solving the pile problem with and without the nonlinear interface effects.

The foundation modulus calculated in this way can be used to predict the stiffness of complete connections for analysis of vibration in frames modelled with semi-rigid joints.

40|$|An {{integrated}} programme of experimental and analytical work {{was carried out}} to evaluate the nonlinear semi-rigid characteristics of timber connections using fully overlapping nails subjected to short duration lateral loading and moment. The investigation {{is part of a}} continuing programme of research at Napier University into the behaviour of timberjoints using fully overlapping nails as the connecting Z - 1 mechanism. The effects of the factors and material properties that influence the behaviour of nailed joints were addressed in a structured and controlled way allowing semi-empirical models to be developed for the lateral load behaviour of rnulti-nailed timber joints using steel and plywood gusset plates. A quality control procedure was established for the testing programme and consistent standards were applied to the preparation and testing work. The semi-empirical models that were developed included for the effect of timber density: crussept late material effect- nail strength; number of nails: nail diameter; row spacing and the effect of the moisture content in the timber. They covered joints assembled with and without a gap between the timber and the gusset plates and for joints assembled with steel gusset plates, the effect of the predrill size used in the gusset plate was also investigated. The model results compared very well with the results from tests, accurately predicting the non-linear behaviour of the joints up to failure. An extensive analytical and experimental study was carried out to investigate the moment-rotation behaviour of these types ofjoints. Two linear arýd four non-linear models were developed for each type of joint and the efficiencies of the models were compared to detennine the one that best simulated the joint behaviour. The linear models consistently underestimated the capacity of the joint, giving conservative results. The best solutions were obtained by applying the torsion formula used for steel connections and incorporating the nail behaviour models developed for the non-linear lateral load joints. Account was taken of the non-linear behaviour of the connection and alternative models using fixed and moveable centres of rotation were developed. Very good comparisons were achieved between these models and the test results. A detailed comparison was made between the behaviour of the joints using the lateral load displacement models and Eurocode 5 (EC 5) and it was concluded that EC 5 rules did not accurately simulate the behaviour of this type of joint. It was concluded that the nail spacing rules in the code did not apply to fully overlapping nails. A limit state design method based on the principles used in EC 5 has been developed from the models for the design of joints using fully overlapping nails and subjected to lateral loading or moment. The semi-rigid behaviour of the joints was also investigated and it was concluded that to safely predict the response of structures assembled with fully, overlapping nails. the semi-rigid behaviour must be included for in the analysis procedure. Rigidity factors, end fixing moment reduction factors and the <b>secant</b> rotational <b>stiffness</b> coefficients for the joints were derived. It was also shown that where the analysis was limited to the serviceability limit state. a modified elastic method of analysis could be used and where it was beyond this state a non-linear method of analysis was required.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} panels find {{widespread use}} in many engineering structures and accurate prediction of their structural behaviour {{is important in}} achieving a safe structural design. The shear strengths of these panels depend strongly on the softening of concrete struts in the principal compression direction due to the principal tension in the orthogonal direction. Intensive investigations of the nonlinear structural behaviour of RC panels and shear walls by finite elements method {{have been reported in}} the last decades. Despite commendable progress made in developing new computational methods, accurate and efficient prediction of both the overall load-deflection and the local stress-strain cyclic responses of RC panels is still challenging because of the complicated nonlinear behaviour of these structures, especially in the case of coupled in-plane membrane-shear nonlinear behaviours. The main issues are the development of proper finite element models and the enhancement of effective constitutive laws for concrete, for reinforcement and for their interactions. Many finite element models have been developed for the nonlinear analysis of RC elements and generally there are three types of models: the discrete model, the smeared-crack model, and the layered model. In the discrete approach [1]-[2], the concrete and steel reinforcement are modelled separately by two different types of finite elements. The creation of discrete models can be quite difficult especially for complex structures. Since a large number of degrees of freedom are generated in the discrete model, it is significantly less efficient, which is of particular concerns in the nonlinear analysis of these structures [2]. In the smeared-crack model [3]-[4], the cracking of concrete and the degradation of its material properties are considered by using averaged stress-strain relationships, that are established directly from full-scale biaxial tests. The resulting models turn out to have low computational efficiency or even to cause numerical instability. The layered approach has been widely used for FE analysis of RC structures, and it has been demonstrated to be effective, particularly in predicting the cracking and the ultimate behaviour of RC panels and slabs in bending and shear [5]-[6]. In this model, the element is formulated by assembling a finite number of concrete layers and equivalent smeared steel layers. Each layer may have different material properties corresponding to its particular material states, and the material properties of each layer are usually assumed to be constant throughout the thickness of the layer. In this case the material constitutive laws for general stress states can follow analytical approaches as the theory of fracture and the theory of continuum damage mechanic. For out-of-plane loaded slabs, cracking and crushing of concrete and yielding of reinforcement through the thickness of the cross-section can be monitored progressively using the layered model, thereby providing an accurate and realistic representation of the structural behaviour [6]. The aim of the work herein is the investigation of the nonlinear modelling of reinforced concrete panels by means of a concrete constitutive law based on damage mechanics applied to a layered quadrilateral element. The concrete constitutive law, that took its bases on the works of Faria et al. [7], Lee et al. [8], Berto et al. [9], is presented in its general formulation having the possibility to represent softening isotropic and orthotropic material behaviour. The tensile branch takes into account the concrete energy of fracture and the tension-stiffening effects. A particular effort has been made to improve the convergence speed through the definition of an adequate <b>secant</b> material <b>stiffness</b> matrix. For what concerns the reinforcing steel, in sake of simplicity, a simple elastic-plastic law has been used with both kinematic and isotropic hardening. The material models have been implemented in the finite open source code Opensees of the University of California, Berkeley [10]. The already implemented quadrilateral layered element has been enhanced with the possibility of taking into account more than one nonlinear material. The validation of the proposed model has been made by comparison with entire experimental sets such as Bhide and Collins [11] and Mansour and Hsu [12]. These test campaigns have been chosen for representing a wide range of coupled membrane-shear nonlinear behaviours. In particular Bhide and Collins [11] carried out 32 tests on square panels applying combined tension, compression and shear stressed on their edge whereas Mansour and Hsu [12] presented 12 full-size reinforced concrete panel tests investigating the behaviour of reinforced concrete membrane elements under reversed cyclic shear stresses. These last set outlined the effects of the variation of angle of steel bar orientation with respect to the applied principal vertical stress and different percentages of reinforcing steel in the panels. The results of the numerical simulations are presented critically with the aim of showing the achievements and the model drawbacks in order to clearly delineate the future developments. The model showed its ability to interpret the experimental evidences especially in uniaxial stress states, biaxial compression and biaxial tension both locally and discretely, but it demonstrated the need of improvements on biaxial tension-compression due to its simplified definition of the damage limit surface in these stress regions.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} curves {{between the}} external static loads of Thermoplastic Polyurethane Elastomer (TPE) rail pads and their compressive deformations were measured. A {{finite element model}} (FEM) for a rail-fastener system was produced to determine the nonlinear compressive deformations of TPE rail pads and their nonlinear static stiffness under the static vehicle weight and the preload of rail fastener. Next, the vertical vehicle-track coupled model was employed to investigate {{the influence of the}} amplitude- and frequency-dependent stiffness of TPE rail pads on the vehicle-track random vibration. It is found that the static stiffness of TPE rail pads ranges from 19. 1 to 37. 9 [*]kN/mm, apparently different from the classical <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> of 26. 7 [*]kN/mm. Additionally, compared with the nonlinear amplitude- and frequency-dependent stiffness of rail pads, the classical <b>secant</b> <b>stiffness</b> would not only severely underestimate the random vibration acceleration levels of wheel-track coupled system at frequencies of 65 – 150 [*]Hz but also alter the dominant frequency-distribution of vehicle wheel and steel rail. Considering that these frequencies of 65 – 150 [*]Hz are the dominant frequencies of ground vibration accelerations caused by low-speed railway, the nonlinear amplitude- and frequency-dependent stiffness of rail pads should be taken into account in prediction of environment vibrations due to low-speed railway...|$|E
