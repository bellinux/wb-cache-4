5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A <b>semiochemical</b> is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of <b>semiochemical,</b> are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development <b>semiochemical</b> attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E
40|$|Since their discovery, many <b>semiochemicals</b> (behavior modifying chemicals) {{have been}} {{identified}} and synthetized, {{and a number of}} techniques have been developed to use them in integrated pest management (IPM) programs against insect pests. In particular, the uses of <b>semiochemicals</b> in IPM to monitor insect pest populations and to interfere with their behavior preventing agricultural damage are widely adopted by the growers. In the same time, evidences that <b>semiochemicals</b> can also modify the behavior of insect natural enemies inspired researchers to explore the possibility to use <b>semiochemicals</b> to conserve and/or enhance the efficacy of natural enemies in cropping systems. However the use of <b>semiochemicals</b> integrated with natural enemies in IPM is still limited despite the fact that scientists have made important advances in recent years to elucidate semiochemical-natural enemies interactions in multitrophic contexts. Here we provide an overview of the IPM strategies integrating <b>semiochemicals</b> and natural enemies; furthermore, the factors that could be considered for more widely adoption of these strategies are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} assess and respond to {{predation}} risk is a strong selective force. Detection of predators is carried out {{by one or more}} sensory modalities, but the use of chemoreception has significant advantages. This study examines the chemosensorial assessment of snake predation risk and corresponding behaviours in different species and populations of Liolaemus lizards naturally exposed to different levels of snake predation pressure. The species studied were sympatric (Liolaemus lemniscatus), parapatric (L. nigroviridis) and allopatric (L. fitzgeraldi) to the saurophagous snake, Philodryas chamissonis. Additionally, two populations of L. lemniscatus from areas differing in snake densities were compared. Chemo-assessment of predation risk was determined by comparing the number of tongue-flicks (TF) and the behavioural responses of lizards submitted to three treatments (with <b>semiochemicals</b> of snake, conspecifics, and without <b>semiochemicals</b> - control). The results suggest that Liolaemus lizards can chemo-assess snake predation risk, but this was modulated by the predation pressure experienced by lizards in their natural habitats. When exposed to snake <b>semiochemicals,</b> the sympatric prey showed less chemical exploratory behaviour (i. e. lower number of TF), a higher frequency of antipredator behaviours that would reduce its detection by a predator, and did not show the behaviour triggered by conspecific <b>semiochemicals.</b> The parapatric prey showed similar number of TF across different treatments, suggesting an absence of recognition of snake semiochemicals; however, it did show antipredatory behaviours when confronted with snake <b>semiochemicals.</b> The allopatric prey showed similar behaviour in all treatments. Both populations of the sympatric species, L. lemniscatus, showed a similar ability to detect predation risk when confronted with snake <b>semiochemicals</b> (i. e. similar number of TF), but antipredatory behaviours were diminished, and marking behaviours were present in the population subject to lower predation pressure. Relaxed predation pressure from a predator that releases and detects <b>semiochemicals</b> had similar consequences at species and population levels...|$|R
25|$|The preorbital gland is a paired {{exocrine gland}} {{found in many}} species of hoofed animals, which is {{homologous}} to the lacrimal gland found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial canthus of each eye. They are lined {{by a combination of}} sebaceous and sudoriferous glands, and they produce secretions which contain pheromones and other <b>semiochemical</b> compounds. Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a means of communication with other animals.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} host location, female {{mosquitoes}} hunt their blood host by detecting organic substances such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol produced from the host, and through visual recognition. Mosquitoes prefer some people over others. The preferred victim's sweat simply smells better than others' {{because of the}} proportions of the carbon dioxide, octenol and other compounds that make up body odor. The most powerful <b>semiochemical</b> that triggers the keen sense of smell of Culex quinquefasciatus is nonanal. Another compound identified in human blood that attracts mosquitoes is sulcatone or 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, especially for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the odor receptor gene Or4. A {{large part of the}} mosquito’s sense of smell, or olfactory system, is devoted to sniffing out blood sources. Of 72 types of odor receptors on its antennae, at least 27 are tuned to detect chemicals found in perspiration. In Aedes, the search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until the perception of host stimulants, then it follows a targeted approach.|$|E
25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed mealybug under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It {{has been found to be}} effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan. The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile <b>semiochemical</b> which repels the whitefly.|$|E

500|$|Another {{category}} of plant defenses are those features that indirectly protect the plant by enhancing {{the probability of}} attracting the natural enemies of herbivores. Such an arrangement is known as mutualism, in this case of the [...] "enemy of my enemy" [...] variety. One such feature are <b>semiochemicals,</b> given off by plants. <b>Semiochemicals</b> are a group of volatile organic compounds involved in interactions between organisms. One group of <b>semiochemicals</b> are allelochemicals; consisting of allomones, which play a defensive role in interspecies communication, and kairomones, which are used by members of higher trophic levels to locate food sources. When a plant is attacked it releases allelochemics containing an abnormal ratio of these herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Predators sense these volatiles as food cues, attracting them to the damaged plant, and to feeding herbivores. The subsequent {{reduction in the number}} of herbivores confers a fitness benefit to the plant and demonstrates the indirect defensive capabilities of <b>semiochemicals.</b> Induced volatiles also have drawbacks, however; some studies have suggested that these volatiles also attract herbivores.|$|R

Most conventional insecticides used to control fruit flies have been banned, and fruit producers are seeking new economical fruit fly control options. Bait stations can be a suitable alternative, provided they are affordable, effective and pest-specific. <b>Semiochemicals</b> are important for fruit flies to locate their host fruit and to reproduce. They could therefore be good candidates to improve existing bait stations. In this literature review, we summarize the available data on Rhagoletis <b>semiochemicals,</b> including the pheromones and allelochemicals used for host location.

25|$|In some {{instances}} growers’ demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, {{to less than}} 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% {{in the same time}} period. Additionally, {{in the past five years}} there has been a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony losses at near 30%. At present, there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honey bees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings. ISCA Technologies, from Riverside California, created a <b>semiochemical</b> formulation called SPLAT Bloom, that modifies the behavior of honey bees, inciting them to visit flowers in every portion of the field.|$|E

The three main crops that Adelphocoris lineolatus show the most attraction for are flowering alfalfa, cotton, and mung bean crops. Biologists have observed a relationship between three chemosensory proteins found in the antennae of A. lineolatus and the <b>semiochemicals</b> released by flowering alfalfa, cotton, and mung bean crops resulting in a greater attraction towards these crops. AlinCSP1, AlinCSP2, and AlinCSP-3 are the three chemosensory proteins found in the antennae of Adelphocoris lineolatus.
