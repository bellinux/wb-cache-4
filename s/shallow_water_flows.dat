40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{research}} is to develop an accurate and efficient solver for <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> in porous media. The hydraulics is modeled by the two-dimensional <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> with variable horizontal porosity. The variation of porosity in the water flows {{can be attributed to the}} variation of bed properties of the water system. As an example of porous <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> is the passage of water discharge over vegetated areas in a river. Driving force of the phase separation and the mixing is the gradient of the porosity. For the numerical solution procedure, we propose a non-homogeneous Riemann solver in the finite volume framework. The proposed method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe’s scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. The efficiency of the solver is evaluated by several test problems for <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> in porous media. The numerical results demonstrate high resolution of the proposed non-homogeneous Riemann solver and confirm its capability to provide accurate simulations for porous shallow water equations under flow regimes with strong shocks...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> model over non-flat bottom topography by high-order schemes. Most of the numerical schemes in the literature are developed from the original mathematical model of the <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> The novel contribution of this study consists in designing a finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme based on the alternative formulation of the <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> model, denoted as "pre-balanced'' <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> equations and introduced in Rogers et al. (2003) [23]. This formulation greatly simplifies {{the achievement of the}} well-balancing of the present scheme. Rigorous numerical analysis as well as extensive numerical results all verify that the current scheme preserves the exact conservation property. It {{is important to note that}} this resulting scheme also maintains the non-oscillatory property near discontinuities and keeps high-order accuracy for smooth solutions at the same time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analysis and}} optimal control of <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> considering moving boundary. There are several methods to analyze moving boundary problem of <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> In this paper, {{the method used}} in this study is that the finite element mesh is generated at whole domain before analysis, then judges existence of water depth in each element. The reason is that the remeshing is not necessary and treatment of nodal information is easy. Moreover, fixed finite element mesh is necessary for the inverse problem because the inverse problem needs the fixed nodal point such like object point. On the judgment of presence of the water depth, the minute water depth is applied. As the numerical study, analysis and optimal control of <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> are carried out using some simple models. As the spatial discretization, the Galerkin method is applied. The bubble function element is used to the interpolation function. The stabilized bubble function and the shock capturing term is applied for stability. The Crank-Nicolson method is applied to the temporal discretization. As the minimization technique of the performance function, the weighted gradient method is utilized...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to solve the system of partial {{differential}} equations governing the flow of two superposed immiscible layers of <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows.</b> The system contains source terms due to bottom topography, wind stresses, and nonconservative products describing momentum exchange between the layers. The presence of these terms in the flow model forms a nonconservative system which is only conditionally hyperbolic. In addition, two-layer <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> are often accompanied with moving discontinuities and shocks. Developing stable numerical methods for this class of problems presents a challenge {{in the field of}} computational hydraulics. To overcome these difficulties, a new composite scheme is proposed. The scheme consists of a time-splitting operator where in the first step the homogeneous system of the governing equations is solved using an approximate Riemann solver. In the second step a finite volume method is used to update the solution. To remove the non-physical oscillations in the vicinity of shocks a nonlinear filter is applied. The method is well-balanced, non-oscillatory and it is suitable for both low and high values of the density ratio between the two layers. Several standard test examples for two-layer <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> are used to verify high accuracy and good resolution properties for smooth and discontinuous solutions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> is {{performed in the}} present paper. The base flow is modeled as a wake-shear layer and it is described by a two-parameter family of velocity profiles where one parameter characterizes the velocity deficit in the wake while the other parameter is the velocity ratio typical {{for the analysis of}} mixing layers. The linear stability problem is solved numerically for different values of the parameters. It is shown that the increase in velocity deficit as well as larger velocity ratios leads to less stable flow, but the velocity deficit is more destabilizing than the velocity ratio. The {{results of the present study}} can be applied in practice to control water quality on the sheltered side of islands.

40|$|A {{modified}} lattice Boltzmann {{model is}} proposed to describe <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> over complex topography. In the proposed model, the quadratic depth term is {{excluded from the}} equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs), and the hydrostatic pressure term is combined with the bed slope term {{to be treated as}} a part of the sourcing term in the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). Therefore, it is unnecessary to match the coefficients of the quadratic depth term in the EDFs with those of the bed slope term in the sourcing terms in the LBE. This would bring more flexibility to the treatment of the sourcing terms in the LBE. In order to recover the shallow water equations (SWEs), the basic constraints are redefined, and under these constraints, the coefficients of the EDFs are derived afterwards. Several benchmark problems are used to validate the proposed model, including stationary case, steady flows over a two-dimensional bump and tidal wave flows over irregular bed elevation. The computed results are in excellent agreement with the results of the other numerical methods and the analytical solutions, indicating that the proposed model is capable of simulating <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> over complex bathymetry. It also proves that the proposed model has potential to produce competitive solutions to <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> over complex bed topography.

A simple method is adapted for flow over initially dry bed. A new formulation is introduced for modeling the net pressure force and gravity terms in discontinuous Galerkin method. To validate the scheme, numerical tests are performed to model steady and unsteady shock waves. Applications include circular dam break with shock, shock waves in channel contraction, and dam break in channel with 45 ∘ bend.
