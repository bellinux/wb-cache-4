For this purpose, a custom-built inter-particle loading apparatus was designed and constructed, the main features of which are described briefly in this paper. This apparatus is capable of performing shearing tests at the contacts of soil minerals of a particle–particle type in the range of very small displacements, from less than 1 μm to about 300 μm, and very small normal loads, between about less than 1 N and 15 N. The laboratory data showed that the effects of the normal force and the sliding velocity on the coefficient of dynamic friction are not significant, while dry and saturated surfaces had similar frictional characteristics. The steady state sliding was mobilized within a range of 0. 5 – 3. 0 μm of horizontal displacement, and the coefficient of static friction was very similar to the corresponding coefficient during constant shearing.

The applications include optical shear wave elastography and ultrasound modulated optical tomography. The {{first half of the}} thesis provides a systematic study on <b>tracking</b> <b>shear</b> waves in optical turbid media using CCD-based laser speckle contrast analysis. The theory, simulation and experiment are developed and cross-validated. The simulation quantitatively relates CCD speckle contrast signal with shear waves, providing useful information to understand the underlying physics. In addition, multiple <b>shear</b> waves are <b>tracked</b> using laser speckle contrast detection. Results show that two counter-propagating shear waves produce a modulation pattern in the optical signal, and the modulation pattern was suggested by simulation {{as a result of the}} dual shear wave interference. Shear wave speed measurements in phantoms suggest that the dual shear wave approach is more accurate than the single shear wave approach as that the standard deviation of the speed measurement is reduced by a factor of at least 2. The the dual shear wave approach also provides a reduced boundary effect. Both factors suggest that the dual shear wave approach should improve the accuracy of elasticity measurements. In the second half of the thesis, instead of detecting ARF response in the late phase, the study is motivated by detecting ARF response in the early stage for enhancement of ultrasound modulation of light.

40|$|Acoustic {{radiation}} force impulses (ARFI) {{have been}} used to generated transverse-traveling mechanical waves in various biological tissues. The velocity of these waves is related to a medium's stiffness and thus can offer useful diagnostic information. Consequently, shear wave velocimetry has the potential to investigate cardiac disease states that manifest themselves as changes in tissue stiffness (e. g., ischemia). The work contained herein focuses on employing ARFI-based shear wave velocimetry techniques, similar to those previously utilized on other organs (e. g., breast, liver), for the investigation of cardiac tissue. To this end, ARFI excitations were used to generate slow-moving (under 3 m/s) mechanical waves in exposed myocardium (with access granted through a thoracotomy); these waves were then tracked with ultrasonic methods. Imaging techniques to increase frame-rate, decrease transducer/tissue heating, and reduce the effects of physiological motion were developed. These techniques, along with two shear wave velocimetry methods (i. e., the Lateral Time-to-Peak and Radon sum transformation algorithms), were utilized to successfully <b>track</b> <b>shear</b> wave propagation through the mid-myocardial layer in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments focused on the investigation of a shear wave anisotropy through the myocardium. This experimentation suggests a moderate shear wave velocity anisotropy through regions of the mid-myocardial layer. In vivo experiments focused on shear wave anisotropy (which tend to corroborate the aforementioned in vitro results), temporal/spatial stability of shear wave velocity estimates, and estimation of wave velocity through the cardiac cycle. Shear wave velocity was found to cyclically vary through the cardiac cycle, with the largest estimates occurring during systole and the smallest occurring during diastole. This result suggests a cyclic stiffness variation of the myocardium through the cardiac cycle. A novel, on-axis technique, the displacement ratio rate (DRR) method, was developed and compared to conventional shear wave velocitmetry and ARFI imaging results; all three techniques suggest a similar cyclic stiffness variation. Shear wave velocimetry shows promise in future investigations of myocardial elasticity. The DRR method may offer a means for transthoracic characterization of myocardial stiffness. Additionally, the future use of transesophageal and catheter-based transducers presents a way of generating and <b>tracking</b> <b>shear</b> waves in a clinical setting (i. e., when epicardial imaging is not feasible).

Subsequent intensification resulted in the JMA upgrading the system to a tropical storm and assigning it the name Haiyan (...) at 0000 UTC on November 4.

In light of the formation of an eye, the JTWC estimated Haiyan to have achieved typhoon status around 0000 UTC that day. The JMA followed suit 12 hours later, by which time the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds to have reached 165 km/h.|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} velocity of shear waves relates to tissue stiffness. We prove that a regular clinical cardiac ultrasound system can determine {{shear wave velocity}} with a conventional unmodified tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) application. The investigation was performed on five tissue phantoms with different stiffness using a research platform capable of inducing and <b>tracking</b> <b>shear</b> waves and a clinical cardiac system (Philips iE 33, achieving frame rates of 400 – 700 Hz in TDI by tuning the normal system settings). We also tested the technique in vivo on a normal individual and on typical pathologies modifying {{the consistency of the}} left ventricular wall. The research platform scanner was used as reference. Shear wave velocities measured with TDI on the clinical cardiac system were very close to those measured by the research platform scanner. The mean difference between the clinical and research systems was 0. 18 ± 0. 22 m/s, and the limits of agreement, from − 0. 27 to + 0. 63 m/s. In vivo, the velocity of the wave induced by aortic valve closure in the interventricular septum increased in patients with expected increased wall stiffness.
