Neither man was wearing a seat belt, which likely contributed to each of their deaths. Found with Callahan's body were two Grateful Dead tickets from Washington, D.C., which had been scalped, a dollar in quarters, and a yellow BIC lighter.

50|$|One God: - There is {{only one}} God who has {{infinite}} qualities and names. God is Creator and Sustainer - all that <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>around</b> <b>you</b> is His creation. He is everywhere, in everything. He is without birth or death, and has existed before Creation and will exist forever. Sikhism does not acknowledge an anthropomorphic God. This is true to the extent than one can interpret Him as the Universe Itself. Sikhism also does not acknowledge the belief of a Personal God, as does Christianity. Instead, God is usually interpreted as being unfathomable, yet not unknowable.|$|R

He made several appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien where he performed short skits.

He starred in a 2006 episode of Masters of Horror entitled [...] "Family", directed by John Landis and played Santa Claus in the ABC Family original film Santa Baby. Wendt performed alongside Richard Thomas in Twelve Angry Men in October 2006 in the Eisenhower Theatre in Washington, D.C..

40|$|Stereo {{vision is}} {{something}} {{that most people do}} everyday without even realizing it. More specifically, as we walk around our environment, our two eyes are constantly taking in a pair of images of the world. Our brain then fuses these two images and unconsciously computes the approximate depth of the objects <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> In the field of computer vision, our two eyes are replaced by two cameras and our brain is replaced by a computer. However, the aim of stereopsis remains the same. That is, given a pair of stereo images, we want to compute the scene depth. Now, with human vision, in order to calculate scene depth, your brain probably needs to know how far apart your eyes are and what orientations your eyes are in. Similarly, with computer vision, you need to know the translation and rotation between the cameras before you can calculate scene depth. Determining the translation and rotation is known as stereo calibration. This thesis deals with the problem of stereo calibration. More specifically...|$|R

[...] "The main thing about playing the guitar, though, was that I was able to sit by myself and play and dream. And I was always happy doing that. I used to go off in the bathroom, because the bathroom had tiles, so it was a slight echo chamber. I'd turn on the faucet so that water would run (I like that sound, it's very soothing to me) and I'd play. In the dark. 'Hello darkness, my old friend / I've come to talk with you again'." [...] In a more recent interview, Simon was directly asked, [...] "How is a 21 year old person thinkin' about the words in that song?" [...] His reply was, [...] "I have no idea." [...] According to Garfunkel, Simon originally wrote the lyric as [...] "Aloha darkness, my old friend."
