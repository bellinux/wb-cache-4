5|$|The tale of Revanta's {{birth is}} narrated in scriptures like Vishnu Purana and Markandeya Purana. Once, Sanjna, the {{daughter}} of celestial architect Vishvakarma and wife of Surya, unable to take the fervour of the Sun-god, repaired to the forests to engage in devout austerities {{in the form of}} a mare. <b>She</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> shadow Chhaya, who looked just like Sanjna in her position as Surya's wife. When Surya realised that Chhaya was not the real Sanjna, he searched for Sanjna and finally found her in the forests of Uttar Kuru. There, Surya approached Sanjna disguised as a horse. Their union produced the twin-Ashvins and Revanta. In Kurma Purana and Matsya Purana, the mother of Revanta is named Rajni, another wife of Surya. While in another chapter of Markandeya Purana, he is son of Chhaya and his brothers are the Saturn-god Shani and Savarni Manu.|$|E
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, <b>she</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
25|$|Hill ran {{the best}} times of her career in 1996. These {{included}} times of 6.69 seconds for the 55m, 7.21 seconds for the 60m indoors, and 22.49 seconds for the 200m outdoors. The 1996 United States Olympic Trials saw her improve her 100m best four times consecutively, recording 11.00 seconds in the first round, 10.99 seconds in the next round, 10.97 seconds in the semi-final, before crossing the line in 10.92 seconds to place third in the final. Working with LSU coach Dennis Shaver, <b>she</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> improvements down to her being in a competitive training group, which included hurdler Kim Carson, and sprinters Sheila Echols and Zundra Feagin. Her place at the trials earned her selection for the United States at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Despite her {{being one of the}} three individual 100m runners (alongside Gail Devers and Gwen Torrence), she was not picked for the relay team on the basis of her being a straight-away specialist (positions occupied by the more favoured Devers and Torrence). At the 1996 Atlanta Games she reached the semi-finals of the 100m, but failed to improve in that round and was eliminated in sixth position.|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{appeared}} in the film Ziegfeld Follies as herself. This {{was followed by the}} musical Thrill of a Romance. Van Johnson co-starred as a decorated war veteran who falls in love with Williams while on her honeymoon. Thrill of a Romance was the 8th highest-grossing film of 1945. Williams had to help Johnson swim, and <b>she</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> hand under his back to keep him afloat. The studio's publicity department tried to put the two together in public as much as possible in the hopes of encouraging a romance, even though Williams was involved with Gage at the time. When asked why they didn't date, Johnson replied, [...] "because I'm afraid she can't get her webbed feet into a pair of evening sandals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The goddess Iðunn interrupts, asking Bragi, as {{a service}} to his {{relatives}} and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in Ægir's hall. Loki tells Iðunn to be silent, calling her the most [...] "man-crazed" [...] of all women, and saying that <b>she</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. Iðunn says that she won't say words of blame in Ægir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want {{the two of them}} to fight. The goddess Gefjun asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that [...] "all living things love him." [...] Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a [...] "white boy" [...] who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.|$|E
2500|$|Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva ( [...] ; 31 August 1941) was a Russian and Soviet poet. Her work is {{considered}} {{among some of}} the greatest in twentieth century Russian literature. She lived through and wrote of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Moscow famine that followed it. In an attempt to save her daughter Irina from starvation, <b>she</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> in a state orphanage in 1919, where she died of hunger. Tsvetaeva left Russia in 1922 and lived with her family in increasing poverty in Paris, Berlin and Prague before returning to Moscow in 1939. Her husband Sergei Efron and her daughter Ariadna Efron (Alya) were arrested on espionage charges in 1941; and her husband was executed. Tsvetaeva committed suicide in 1941. As a lyrical poet, her passion and daring linguistic experimentation mark her as a striking chronicler of her times and the depths of the human condition.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1964, Mitchell {{discovered}} {{that she was pregnant}} by her Calgary ex-boyfriend Brad MacMath. She later wrote, [...] " [...] left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed fuel for last winter's occupants." [...] At the time, [...] "the pill" [...] was legally unavailable in Canada, as was abortion, yet there was a strong social stigma against women giving birth out of wedlock. In Toronto, she could at least do so quietly, without alarming her relatives back home. In February 1965 she gave birth to a baby girl. Unable to provide for the baby, <b>she</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, for adoption. The experience remained private for most of her career, but she made allusions to it in several songs, for example [...] "Little Green", which she performed in the 1960s and eventually recorded for the 1971 album Blue.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, Lopez {{starred in}} the biographical film El Cantante, {{which is based on}} the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe. In the film, Lavoe is portrayed by then-husband Marc Anthony while Lopez plays Lavoe's wife Puchi. Lopez {{revealed}} that she felt her performance in the film El Cantante should have earned her an Oscar. [...] "I feel like I had that [...] in 'El Cantante,' but I don't think the academy members saw it". El Cantante did not perform well at the box office, earning just $7.6 million. Lopez and Anthony also launched their co-headlining North American concert tour on September 28. Lopez's sixth studio album Brave, released in October, was her lowest-charting album worldwide. The album produced two singles, [...] "Do It Well" [...] and [...] "Hold It Don't Drop It". The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to make any significant impact on the charts. A five-part miniseries, , based on the lyrics of Como Ama una Mujer aired on Univision from October 30 to November 27, 2007. <b>She</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> career on hiatus after giving birth to twins in February 2008.

2500|$|The Kewpie doll {{has been}} the mascot of the school for the last 100 years. Hickman is the only known school {{in the world with}} a Kewpie as its mascot. The name dates back to the {{basketball}} season of 1913 -1914 at what was known then as Columbia High School. Apparently, the school secretary owned a Kewpie doll, as they were popular figurines then, and she kept it on her desk. [...] At one of the first basketball games in December 1913 <b>she</b> <b>placed</b> <b>her</b> Kewpie doll {{in the center of the}} court, and the entire game was played around it without it being broken. [...] This was somewhat remarkable since the dolls were very fragile. [...] Because it survived the game and brought a victory, it was thereafter considered the good luck mascot. [...] You can see a picture of that Kewpie doll beneath Sam Church in the team photograph in the 1914 school annual. That team had a straight claim to the state championship of Missouri for 1914 as they had an undefeated season. Coincidentally Sam Church was the Captain of the 1914 Kewpie basketball team and was the first Kewpie to letter in four sports. The school annual, the Cresset of 1914 was the first annual to display a Kewpie. In addition to the doll between Sam’s feet in the team picture a drawing of a Kewpie appeared as a dedication to the team. The dedication said, “To the Basket Ball Team of 1914, whose loyalty to the school and to the Kewpie motto, ‘Keep Smiling’, has won the State Championship, this volume of the Cresset is dedicated.” The only previous known mascot for Columbia High School, which became David Henry Hickman High School in 1927, was the Trojans. [...] It is referenced in the first school annual, the Cresset of 1912. Columbia/Hickman High School has graduated over 35,000 “Kewpies” in its history and they are still proud to be called “Kewpies!” ...|$|E
