50|$|When an {{individual}} is vaccinated against a disease, the individual's immune system is triggered and memory B cells store the <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> These cells remain in circulation the pathogen infection is cleared. Because the telomeres in genes degenerate after each successive cell division, lymphocytes, including memory B cells are not capable of proliferating indefinitely. Typically, the cells live for multiple decades, but there is variation in the longevity of these cells {{depending on the type}} of vaccine they were stimulated with and vaccine dosage. The reason for the differences in the longevity of memory B cells is currently unknown. However, it has been proposed that the differences in memory B cell longevity are due to the speed at which a pathogen infects the body and, accordingly, the number and type of cells involved in the immune response to the pathogen in the vaccine.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} mount a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> is the main {{determinant}} of susceptibility to RF. The target of antibody-mediated clearance is the major outer membrane lipoproteins, which are highly variable in sequence and define the serotype. In the RF spirochaete B. turicatae (Bt), these proteins occur in two sizes, variable small proteins (Vsp) around 22 kDa and variable large proteins (Vlp) around 37 kDa. Relapsing fever spirochaetes have a unique process of DNA rearrangement {{that allows them to}} periodically change the expression of the VMPs in their outer membrane, which results in the generation of multiple serotypes. This process, called antigenic variation, allows the spirochaete to evade the host’s immune response and cause relapsing episodes of fever and other symptoms. Antibodies in the blood that bind to and clear spirochaetes expressing the old VMP do not recognize spirochaetes expressing the new VMP. This results in the characteristic pattern of febrile relapses and remissions.|$|E
40|$|Antigen <b>specific</b> human <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> can be {{modulated}} {{in vitro}} {{by the addition}} of 4 F 2 antibody, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) which recognizes an antigen on activated T cells and B cells. <b>Specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> induced with the antigen are suppressed {{by the addition of}} 4 F 2. However, <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> induced with the polyclonal activator, pokeweed mitogen (PWM), are significantly enhanced by the addition of 4 F 2. Proliferative responses to both antigen and PWM are suppressed by the addition of 4 F 2. The enhancement of PWM stimulated responses by 4 F 2 is mediated by T cells. However, in the absence of T cells, 4 F 2 can directly inhibit antigen specific B cells. Polyclonal Ig production stimulated by PWM was also enhanced by 4 F 2. Thus, the immunomodulating effects of the 4 F 2 MoAb are the result of a balance of enhancement and suppression mediated at the T cell and the B cell level, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In Africa, {{helminth}} and HIV {{infection is}} highly prevalent, making co-infection with helminths and HIV likely common. Both infections impact the host immune response through immune suppression and dysregulation, which {{also may have}} implications for vaccine efficacy and efforts to decrease vaccine preventable deaths. We sought to determine the impact of helminth infection on humoral immune responses to HIV and to previously administered measles and tetanus vaccines. We developed a method to evaluate HIV-specific <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> using protein microarray and principal components analysis, and identified distinct patterns of HIV-specific <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> that correlate with concurrent viral load and subsequent change in CD 4 count. Within two randomized trials examining the effect of deworming on HIV disease progression, we conducted nested serologic studies to {{examine the impact of}} helminth infection (n= 100) and deworming (n= 35) on <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> The prevalence of HIV <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> was similar between individuals with any helminth infection compared to helminth uninfected individuals. However, those with schistosomiasis infection had significantly lower HIV <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> compared to helminth uninfected adults. The prevalence of measles and tetanus <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> were similar between helminth infected and uninfected individuals.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of TB is most complicated. The routine diagnosis for TB patient is sputum culture based. But culture need 6-8week with 10-20% false positive results. A rapid serological test for diagnosis, follow-up of disease activity, {{and response to}} therapy {{would be useful to}} clinicians. The purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (Mantoux test) is an important tool for {{diagnosis of}} latent TB infection and disease in the developed world, but it has low predictive value in bacille Calmette-Gue´rin (BCG)-vaccinated individuals, as well as in individuals living in areas where TB is endemic. The low predictive value is a result of cross-reactivity with BCG and atypical mycobacteria, as well as falsenegative reactions in malnourished children. BCG has been used as an antigen in EIAs in in vitro studies to determine disease activity, but its use was suspended because of difficulties in interpretation, problems differentiating between active or past disease, and low sensitivity and specificity. The antibodies from lymphocyte secretion (ALS) assay was earlier used to detect <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> after oral vaccination with a killed cholera vaccine in healthy adults without any requirement for in vitro antigen stimulation.|$|E
50|$|Pigs {{build up}} natural {{resistance}} against recurring infections rather quickly. Significant levels of protection were detected in pigs following one or multiple inoculations with infective eggs or L3s of A. suum (Eriksen, 1982; Helwigh and Nansen, 1999). This provides some hope for future vaccination strategies. Developing vaccines against parasites is highly desirable {{and the search}} for a vaccine against Ascaris has been on-going for about half a century. Still, their development so far has been very limited and the information gathered on this topic remains scarce.Initial experiments showed that oral immunisation of pigs with eggs that had been UV-irradiated induced high percentages of protection (Tromba, 1978; Urban and Romanowski, 1985; Urban and Tromba, 1982a, 1984). However these high percentages of protection could not be obtained after vaccination with native worm extracts or excretory/secretory (E/S) products (Hill et al., 1994; Rhodes et al., 1988; Urban and Romanowski, 1985) except for Lukes (1992), who was able to obtain a 89% reduction in lung and liver larvae retrieved from mice immunized twice with 100 mg of antigen in a liposome with levamisole as an immunomodulator. Only one study by Serrano et al., (2001) investigated the protective capacity of purified native antigens. All three antigens that were tested (14, 42 and 97 kDa) showed to induce significant levels of protection after 6 weekly immunizations of 1 µg of antigen in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. Since the year 2000, interest has shifted from the use of native parasite products towards recombinantly produced proteins as vaccine antigens. Different recombinants were expressed in E. coli. The As14 and As16 recombinants coupled to cholera toxin subunit B were administered three times intranasally to mice or pigs and could induce a reduction of approximately 60% in lung stage larvae recovered from the lungs of the vaccinated animals in comparison with their controls (Tsuji et al., 2004; Tsuji et al., 2003; Tsuji et al., 2001). Similarly, immunizing mice by subcutaneous injection with recombinant As24 in Freund’s complete adjuvant induced 58% of protection (Islam et al., 2005). On the other hand, no protection could be produced when the As37 antigen was tested in a similar setup (Tsuji et al., 2002).Attempts have been made to produce larval antigens in rice plants (Matsumoto et al., 2009; Nozoye et al., 2009). Immunizing mice by feeding them transgenic rice showed to elicit an antigen <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> indicating that the transgenic rice was able to prime the immune response of mice. Orally immunized mice also showed a reduced amount of larvae recovered from the lungs after challenge infection in comparison with non-immunized controls (Matsumoto et al., 2009). In the future, this could provide an easy way of producing and administering parasite antigens. However, this technique should be further optimized and evaluated.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that exogenous Nef protein induced activation of normal human T cells up-regulating IL- 15 production by monocytes. Since HIV- 1 infection {{results in the}} early impairment of immune functions we decided to evaluate if Nef is able to modulate the induction of a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> Human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from healthy donors were induced in vitro to mount a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to the Candida albicans antigen. We show that Nef inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the induction of the anti-C. albicans antibody response. The ability of an anti-Nef antibody to prevent such inhibition indicates that the effect was indeed Nef-specific. In the Nef-treated cultures an early increase of IL- 15 production was observed and the addition of anti-IL- 15 antibody abrogated the Nef-induced inhibitory effect. Moreover the addition of IL- 15 to the cultures inhibited, as well as Nef, the induction of the <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> Thus, our results suggest that Nef may inhibit the induction of a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> by an early up-regulation of IL- 15 production. A better comprehension of this phenomenon may be important for unravelling some aspects of the B cell defects in HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether quantification of <b>specific</b> antifungal <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in serum can provide supplemental {{information for the}} diagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus infections and the monitoring of antifungal treatment in patients after lung transplantation. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Center for lung transplantation, University Hospital Groningen, the Netherlands. Patients: 4 patients with proven A. fumigatus infections after lung transplantation and fatal outcome. Measurements: The IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> <b>specific</b> for A. fumigatus antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was compared with radiographic features, cytologic findings, microbiological cultures, and clinical diagnosis. Results: Increasing IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> <b>specific</b> for A. fumigatus antigens closely paralleled cytologic or microbiological identification of A. fumigatus from bronchoalveolar ravage fluid and decrease of lung function. Increasing <b>specific</b> IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> were found to precede radiographic identification of lung cavitation by 1 to 2 weeks, precede the diagnosis of aspergillosis by 2 to 20 weeks, and detect fungal reinfection. In most cases, successful antifungal treatment decreased <b>specific</b> IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> A decrease in <b>specific</b> IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> correlated with the inability to culture or identify A. fumigatus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and with radiographic and clinical improvement. Conclusions: <b>Specific</b> IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in serum correlate with radiographic, cytologic, and microbiological findings and with the clinical diagnosis of A. fumigatus infections in patients who have had lung transplantation.

40|$|Summary. -It has {{previously}} been shown that rat embryo cells treated in vitro with 3 -methylcholanthrene (MCA) elicit antibodies in syngeneic rats which react specifically against established MCA-induced sarcomas. To examine the possibility that clonal amplification of {{one or a few}} antigenic, preneoplastic clones is responsible for the previously observed <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses,</b> MCA-treated rat embryo cells have been subjected to 150 Gy of y-irradiation before injection into host animals. The resulting antisera were screened for reactivity against a panel of established syngeneic tumours by membrane immunofluorescence and an isotopic antiglobulin test. A positive reaction was observed between an antiserum pool raised against y-irradiated MCA-treated cells and the cells of an immunogenic spontaneous mammary carcinoma.

Hereby we present results of a meta-analysis of QTL on chicken chromosome 9, 14 and 18 using data from three separate experiments and joint QTL analysis for chromosome 14 and 18. Meta QTL analysis uses information from multiple QTLs studies. Joint QTL analysis is based on combining raw data from different QTL experimental populations. QTLs under the study were related to <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to keyhole lymphet hemocyanin (KLH), and natural antibodies to envi-ronmental antigens, lipopolisaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA).

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that exposure to long-term spaceflight conditions (stress, isolation, sleep disruption, containment, microbial contamination, and solar radiation) or to ground-based models of spaceflight will alter human immune <b>responses,</b> but <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> have not been fully evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether exposure to the 8 -month Antarctic winter-over model of spaceflight would alter human <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> METHODS: During the 1999 Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, 11 adult study subjects at Casey, Antarctica, and 7 control subjects at Macquarie Island, sub-Antarctica, received primary and secondary immunizations with the T cell-dependent neoantigen bacteriophage phi X- 174. Periodic plasma samples were analyzed for <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> function. RESULTS: All of the subjects from Casey, Antarctica, cleared bacteriophage phi X- 174 normally by 1 week after primary immunization, and all had normal primary and secondary <b>antibody</b> <b>responses,</b> including immunologic memory amplification and switch from IgM to IgG antibody production. One subject showed a high normal pattern, and one subject had a low normal pattern. The control subjects from Macquarie Island also had normal immune responses to bacteriophage phi X- 174. CONCLUSIONS: These data {{do not support the}} hypothesis that de novo <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> of subjects become defective during the conditions of the Antarctic winter-over. Because the Antarctic winter-over model of spaceflight lacks the important factors of microgravity and solar radiation, caution must be used in interpreting these data to anticipate normal <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in long-term spaceflight...|$|R

Here, we compare the HPV 16 -specific <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> elicited by nasal immunization with recombinant S. typhimurium strains harboring attenuations that, in contrast to PhoPc, are suitable for human use. For this purpose, χ 4989 (Δcya Δcrp) and χ 4990 [Δcya Δ(crp-cdt) ] were constructed in the ATCC 14028 genetic background, and comparison was made with the isogenic PhoPc and PhoP− strains.

40|$|Antibody {{production}} to influenza A strain virus X 31 (H 3 N 2) {{was measured in}} cultures of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) stimulated with either antigen (X 31) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). With some donors, X 31 antibody was produced in response to antigenic stimulation, but not as part of the polyclonal response to PWM, suggesting that antigen and PWM may be acting on different B-cell subpopulations. To test this hypothesis, T-cell depleted PBMC (E-) cells were fractionated on discontinuous Percoll gradients and assayed for <b>antibody</b> production in <b>response</b> to antigen or PWM. Fraction I (FrI = SG less than 1. 070) cultured in the presence of T cells responded well to PWM, but not at all to X 31. FrII (1. 070 less than SG less than 1. 075) and FrIII (SG greater than 1. 075) cultured in the presence of T cells both responded well to X 31, but only the medium-density B cells (FrII) were able to make <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> when T cells were replaced with T-cell replacing factor (TRF). <b>Specific</b> X 31 <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> by medium- and high-density B cells (FrII and FrIII) were suppressed equally by the addition of allogeneic T-suppressor (Ts) cells.

40|$|Identifying the {{properties}} of a molecule involved in the efficient activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses that lead to long-lasting immunity is crucial for vaccine and adjuvant development. Here we show that the papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) is recognized by the immune system as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and as an antigen in mice (Pamptigen). A single immunization of PapMV without added adjuvant efficiently induced both cellular and <b>specific</b> long-lasting <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> PapMV also efficiently activated innate immune responses, {{as shown by the}} induction of lipid raft aggregation, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on dendritic cells and macrophages, and long-lasting adjuvant effects upon the <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to model antigens.

In this investigation, the role of Fc receptors for IgG (FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII) and complement receptors 1 and 2 (CR 1 / 2) for antibody-mediated enhancement of <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> are investigated. IgM is known to efficiently activate complement and thereby enhance <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> but it is not known if this involves binding to CR 1 / 2. Using CR 1 / 2 deficient mice, immunized with sheep erythrocytes alone or together with specific IgM, we present evidence that IgM-mediated enhancement is completely dependent on CR 1 / 2 expression, whereas IgG or IgE in complex with bovine serum albumin (BSA) induce strong <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in CR 1 / 2 -deficient mice. Enhancement by IgE is mediated via the low affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRII, CD 23). However, the receptors which are involved in IgG-mediated enhancement are not known. We find that γ-chain-deficient mice (lacking FcγRI and FcγRIII) have impaired <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to IgG/BSA complexes. In contrast, FcγRIII deficient mice have normal responses, suggesting that FcγRI mediates the effect. Furthermore, IgG/BSA complexes induce up to 189 -fold stronger <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in FcγRIIB-deficient mice than in wild-type mice. The threshold dose of IgG/BSA required was lower, the response was sustained for longer and initiated earlier in FcγRIIB-deficient than in wild-type animals.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) antigens was examined by immunohistochemistry in the nervous and non-nervous organs of juvenile European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) {{during the course}} of an intramuscular infection. Histological changes resulting from the infection were evaluated from 3 days to 2 months post-infection. The <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> was also studied 2 months post-challenge. Viral proteins were present throughout the experimental period in the retina (inner nuclear layer, ganglion layer, outer limiting membrane, and outer plexiform layer), brain (cerebellum and tectum opticum), and liver (hepatocytes and endothelial cells). These proteins were also observed in the renal tubular cells, white pulp of spleen, and in fibroblasts and cartilage of caudal fin. This is the first report of RGNNV proteins appearing in these organs, where the immunostaining was only detected at certain sampling times after the onset of mortality. Brain and retina of virus-exposed fish showed high levels of vacuolation, while accumulation of fat vacuoles was observed in the liver. RGNNV infection also induced a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> as measured by an ELISA. In summary, this is the first study demonstrating the presence of viral proteins in cells of caudal fin, kidney and spleen of European seabass...|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{anti-human}} T cell antibodies {{have been}} used to identify cells which provide help for an in vitro <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to influenza virus and also those which suppress the response of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The helper cells carry antigens defined by the Leu 3 a and OKT 4 -antisera, whereas the suppressor cells are predominantly Leu 2 a- and OKT 8 -positive. Help and suppression in this secondary in vitro antibody response are therefore provided by antigenically distinct T cell subsets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sequential oligopeptides {{based on}} a pentapeptide (TKPKG) derived from tuftsin with {{different}} lengths were synthesized by stepwise solid phase methodology. These highly soluble oligomers were nontoxic on mouse spleen cells, and other biological data suggested that tuftsin-like properties were also presented. The (TKPKG) n (n 2, 4, 6, 8) oligopeptides were not immunogenic; however, they in-creased sheep red blood cells (SRBC) antigen <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> in mice, demonstrating their immunostimulatory effect. Chemotactic activity was also found on J 774 monocyte cells, while MRC...|$|E
30|$|Rubio-Infante and Moreno-Fierros [52] {{summarised}} some {{findings regarding}} the Cry 1 Ac toxin {{and its effect}} on the immune system. They classify Cry 1 Ac as a potent mucosal and systemic immunogen and adjuvant [36, 53]. They mention the high immunogenicity of the Cry 1 Ac protoxin demonstrated by its capacity to induce significant <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in serum and mucosal-secretions recovered from the small and large intestine, bronchoalveolar and vaginal lavages of mice after immunisation by every tested route, such as intraperitoneal, intragastric, intranasal, rectal [36, 54] and vaginal [55]. In summary, the adjuvant effects of Cry 1 Ac protoxin were evaluated regarding the <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> attained at both mucosal and systemic levels to co-administered antigens of different nature. In a further publication [56], it is shown in more detail how Cry 1 Ac induces macrophage activation. Rubio-Infante and Moreno-Fierros [52] conclude further risk research is necessary: “(…) the immunogenicity of these proteins and their possible risks in humans after short- and long-term exposure must be determined. Evaluation of the risks of Cry proteins in other systems such as the respiratory and nervous systems is also needed. The toxicity definition must include the adverse effects caused by these toxins not only in the short term; therefore, subchronic and chronic studies in humans should be performed, and the immunotoxicological features of these toxins should be determined”.|$|R
40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that rat embryo cells treated in vitro with 3 -methylcholanthrene (MCA) elicit antibodies in syngeneic rats which react specifically against established MCA-induced sarcomas. To examine the possibility that clonal amplification of {{one or a few}} antigenic, preneoplastic clones is responsible for the previously observed <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses,</b> MCA-treated rat embryo cells have been subjected to 150 Gy of gamma-irradiation before injection into host animals. The resulting antisera were screened for reactivity against a panel of established syngeneic tumours by membrane immunofluorescence and an isotopic antiglobulin test. A positive reaction was observed between an antiserum pool raised against gamma-irradiated MCA-treated cells and the cells of an immunogenic spontaneous mammary carcinoma. Antiserum to gamma-irradiated control (acetone-treated) cells was negative. Thus gamma-irradiation of carcinogen-treated cells before injection failed to abolish <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in immunized rats. To investigate further the relationships between cell-carcinogen interaction, neoantigen induction and malignancy, the cells of a non-immunogenic, spontaneous mammary carcinoma were treated with MCA in vitro, and antisera against treated and untreated cells were tested against a panel of established tumours. A positive membrane-immunofluorescence reaction was obtained with an antiserum to MCA-treated cells, but not to untreated cells against an aminoazodye-induced hepatoma, indicating that the previously non-immunogenic mammary carcinoma cells had acquired new antigenic specificities as a consequence of carcinogen treatment...|$|R
40|$|Suppressed {{antibody}} and interleukin- 6 {{responses to}} acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy. This {{study examined the}} effect of pregnancy on the host response to acute pyelonephritis. Urine and serum samples were obtained {{at the time of}} diagnosis and after two weeks, from nonpregnant and pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis. The samples were analyzed for interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> activity to antigens extracted from the Escherichia coli strain infecting each patient. The host response to infection was further quantitated as fever, C-reactive protein, and renal concentrating capacity. Acute pyelonephritis in non-pregnant and pregnant women was accompanied by a significant serum and urine <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> The serum <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> was significantly lower in the pregnant group. The IL- 6 levels in serum and urine at diagnosis were significantly higher in the nonpregnant compared to the pregnant women. These results demonstrate that the immunosuppression of pregnancy includes the mucosal IL- 6 and <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to acute pyelonephritis caused by E. coli...|$|R
