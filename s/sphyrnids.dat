40|$|Understanding the {{ecological}} factors that regulate elasmobranch abundance in nearshore waters {{is essential to}} effectively manage coastal ecosystems and promote conservation. However, {{little is known about}} elasmobranch populations in the western South Atlantic Ocean. An 8 -year, standardized longline and drumline survey conducted in nearshore waters off Recife, northeastern Brazil, allowed us to describe the shark assemblage and to monitor abundance dynamics using zero-inflated generalized additive models. This region is mostly used by several carcharhinids and one ginglymostomid, but <b>sphyrnids</b> are also present. Blacknose sharks, Carcharhinus acronotus, were mostly mature individuals and declined in abundance throughout the survey, contrasting with nurse sharks, Ginglymostoma cirratum, which proliferated possibly due to this species being prohibited from all harvest since 2004 in this region. Tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, were mostly juveniles smaller than 200 cm and seem to use nearshore waters off Recife between January and September. No long-term trend in tiger shark abundance was discernible. Spatial distribution was similar in true coastal species (i. e. blacknose and nurse sharks) whereas tiger sharks were most abundant at the middle continental shelf. The sea surface temperature, tidal amplitude, wind direction, water turbidity, and pluviosity were all selected to predict shark abundance off Recife. Interspecific variability in abundance dynamics across spatiotemporal and environmental gradients suggest that {{the ecological}} processes regulating shark abundance are generally independent between species, which could add complexit...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} adaptive significance of the <b>sphyrnid</b> cephalo-foil, including potential advantages of spacing the olfac-tory organs at the distal tips of the broad surface. We employed comparative morphology to test whether the <b>sphyrnid</b> cephalofoil provides better stereo-olfaction, in-creases olfactory acuity, and samples a greater volume of the medium compared {{to the situation in}} carcharhiniform sharks. The broadly spaced nares provide <b>sphyrnid</b> spe-cies with a significantly greater separation between the olfactory rosettes, which could lead to an enhanced ability to resolve odor gradients. In addition, most <b>sphyrnid</b> spe-cies possess prenarial grooves that greatly increase the volume of water sampled by the nares and thus increase the probability of odorant encounter. However, despite a much greater head width, and a significantly greater number of olfactory lamellae, scalloped hammerhead sharks do not possess a greater amount of olfactory epi-thelial surface area than the carcharhiniform sandbar sharks. Therefore, <b>sphyrnid</b> sharks might not possess any greater olfactory acuity than carcharhinids. Despite this, there are clear olfactory advantages to the cephalofoil head morphology that could have led to its evolution, persistence, and diversification. J. Morphol. 264 : 253 â€“ 263...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{form and function}} {{is often used to}} elucidate the biological role of a structure. Hammerhead sharks offer a unique opportunity to study form and function through phylogeny. Because <b>sphyrnid</b> sharks display a range of cranial morphologies this group can be used to address questions about the evolution of cranial design and investigate the effects of changes in head morphology on feeding structures and bite force. Geometric morphometrics, volumetric analyses, morphological dissections, and phylogenetic analyses of the cephalofoil were used to gain insight into changes in cranial design through evolutionary history. External morphometrics and internal volumetric analyses indicated that while the external shape of the cephalofoil and placement of the sensory structures is variable through evolutionary history, the volumes of the internal cranial elements do not change. Constructional constraints within the cephalofoil were confined to sensory structures while feeding morphology remained relatively unchanged. Analysis of the morphology and biomechanics of the feeding apparatus revealed that through phylogeny the feeding system does not change among <b>sphyrnid</b> species. However, size-removed bite force was lower than predicted for all <b>sphyrnid</b> species except Sphyrna mokarran. Despite differences in head morphology between <b>sphyrnid</b> and carcharhinid sharks, the feeding bauplan is conserved in <b>sphyrnid</b> sharks with few changes to the feeding structures. Instead the chondrocranial and sensory structures are modified around the relatively static feeding core. Finally, the durophagous S. tiburo was found to consume hard prey {{in a manner that is}} biomechanically and morphologically different from other durophagous fishes. Furthermore, the diet of S. tiburo is constrained by the properties of its preferred prey...|$|R
