50|$|Much of what {{is known}} today of Vijayanagara palaces is drawn from archaeological {{excavations}} at Hampi as no royal palace structures have survived.

The activities of the Brixworth Poor Law Union attracted controversy, particularly in the latter part of the 19th century, because of its reluctance to provide relief to poor people unless they agreed to enter the Workhouse. Brixworth is the focus of a substantial work on the political, social and personal implications of welfare policies during the period. The Workhouse was closed in 1935.|$|E

Thankfully the fire happened at midnight, with the safety curtain lowered, saving the auditorium which retains many of its original features to this day. The theatre was closed until January 1922.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} variations and styles of motorcycle lifts. Some are simple and only large enough to handle a simple motorbike.
