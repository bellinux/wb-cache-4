40|$|In {{order to}} see under low light {{conditions}} nocturnal insects rely on neural strategies based on combinations of spatial and temporal summations. Though these summation techniques when modelled are effective in {{improving the quality of}} low light images, using the temporal summation in <b>scenes</b> <b>where</b> image velocity is high only come at a cost of motion blurring in the output scenes. Most recent research has been towards reducing motion blurring in <b>scenes</b> <b>where</b> motion is caused by moving objects rather than effectively reducing motion blurring in <b>scenes</b> <b>where</b> motion is caused by moving cameras. This makes it impossible to implement the night vision algorithm in moving robots or cars that operate under low light conditions. In this paper we present a generic new method that can replace the normal temporal summation in <b>scenes</b> <b>where</b> motion is detected. The proposed method is both suitable for motion caused by moving objects as well as moving cameras. The effectiveness of this new generic method is shown with relevant supporting experiments...|$|R

During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted the <b>scene</b> <b>where</b> Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
