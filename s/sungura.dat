5000|$|It is very unfotunate that [...] "sungura {{has taken}} the fast paced tempo class of Zimbabwean music due to it having been {{promoted}} by record companies who seek commercialisation of sound as opposed to maintaining the social culture and tradition of a people. <b>Sungura</b> is a basterdised Kenyan rumba and the singing {{to a certain degree}} emulates the [...] "kanindo" [...] or East African rumba. Jit type of music is celebratory in its context when used socially either in marriage celebrations, success in games or bumper harvests and many others function of the society.The songs maybe satirical with a deep hidden meaning and a good selection of words of praise or counseling. Jit can be fused with a lot of different types of instruments such as,saxophone,flute even xylophones [...] "marimba"and some would think it has crossed over to jazz.If one listens to James Chimombe's music one may wonder if he/she is not listening to Jazz music as it borders along that fine line. Jit music in the Northeastern part of Zimbabwe called Murehwa it is known as Jazz or [...] "Pfonda" [...] as mentioned earlier on. You will notice why it boarders along with Jazz.

5000|$|Dembo {{seemed to}} have been {{interested}} in songs of love. In fact, most of his songs are particularly loved by youth as they find them appropriate to their situations. Leornard was known as the King Of <b>Sungura</b> music, due to the lead guitarist skills he had from the creative melodies he created and which would match his beautiful unparalleled lead-vocal voice. The great mastery which he used to construct his music, and the amount of album production he did, gave him the nick name [...] "Musoro We Nyoka", which literary translates to [...] "Head of a snake". This refers to the slyness, willy attitude and intelligence of a snake, which Leonard Dembo was compared to. The poetic lyrics of his songs are cleverly crafted full of deep-rooted meanings. Arguably today still unmatched by any artist to come out of Zimbabwe.At various times, Dembo also used to address other social ills of his times, especially the suffering of the orphans and young kids. Although Dembo lived through the tumultuous years of Zimbabwean liberation struggle, he never seemed to be very much interested in the political affairs of his day. However, he sang a few tunes such as Kana Ndorangarira found on his 1987 album, Kuziva Mbuya Huudzwa which immediately found itself a hit on all the radio stations in the land. He even alluded to the struggle in such songs as Matsotsi (when he said that now that people were free, those who used to thrive in pickpocketing were to be punished).|$|E
5000|$|Examples of pre-colonial African {{literature}} are numerous. Oral literature of west Africa includes the [...] "Epic of Sundiata" [...] composed in medieval Mali, {{and the older}} [...] "Epic of Dinga" [...] from the old Ghana Empire. In Ethiopia, {{there is a substantial}} literature written in Ge'ez going back at least to the fourth century AD; the best-known work in this tradition is the Kebra Negast, or [...] "Book of Kings." [...] One popular form of traditional African folktale is the [...] "trickster" [...] story, in which a small animal uses its wits to survive encounters with larger creatures. Examples of animal tricksters include Anansi, a spider in the folklore of the Ashanti people of Ghana; Ijàpá, a tortoise in Yoruba folklore of Nigeria; and <b>Sungura,</b> a hare found in central and East African folklore. Other works in written form are abundant, namely in north Africa, the Sahel regions of west Africa and on the Swahili coast. From Timbuktu alone, there are an estimated 300,000 or more manuscripts tucked away in various libraries and private collections, mostly written in Arabic but some in the native languages (namely Fula and Songhai). Many were written at the famous University of Timbuktu. The material covers a wide array of topics, including astronomy, poetry, law, history, faith, politics, and philosophy.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{repeated}} {{over the years}} that Zimbabwean popular music is a male-domain and the best-selling <b>sungura</b> genre is nearly exclusively composed by male musicians. Female musicians have opted for the socially acceptable gospel music, avoiding the secular <b>sungura</b> for fear of stigmatisation. Many other reasons have been provided to explain womenâ€™s virtual absence from the <b>sungura</b> genre, some of them sound, and yet others purely sexist and ludicrous. Using Cultural Studies and critical political economy approaches, which seek to both critique and transform the current gender demographics of <b>sungura</b> band leadership, vocalism and monopoly of instrument playing, this paper attempts to provide ways of introducing and nurturing female <b>sungura</b> musicians into the recording and performing industry. Such introduction of female <b>sungura</b> personalities is not only to add to the exciting diversity of creative <b>sungura</b> suppliers, but to expand the discursive and democratic spaces in which women can self-articulate, ironically within a medium that has been accused of negatively stereotyping and objectifying them...|$|E
