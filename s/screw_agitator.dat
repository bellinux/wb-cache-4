40|$|Newtonian and non-Newtonian laminar {{fluid flow}} has been {{simulated}} using Computational Fluid Dynamics for a cylindrical vessel stirred by a helical <b>screw</b> <b>agitator.</b> Simulations {{have been performed}} for a vessel geometry with and without a draft tube. Simulated flow patterns in the vessel have been examined and compared with the experimental work of previous authors. The power number and the circulation number have been evaluated, and interpreted {{in a similar manner}} to other works. The PO. Re constant, A, has been determined to be 295 for the geometry with the draft tube and 150 for that without the draft tube. These results are in the same range as previously reported values. The Metzner and Otto constant, k, has been evaluated to be 16. 23 which is in excellent agreement with experimental results reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Most {{information}} on pumping efficiency {{that is available}} in the literature is limited to the turbulent region (centrifugal pumps). The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the effect of the Reynolds number on the pumping efficiency of <b>screw</b> <b>agitators</b> for a wide range of Reynolds number values from creeping to the turbulent flow region. The dependence of pumping efficiency on Reynolds number extends our knowledge about the efficiency of classical impeller pumps restricted usually to the turbulent region...|$|R
40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>agitators</b> {{rotating}} in {{tubes are}} very efficient tools for mixing and pumping viscous liquids. The power {{characteristic of the}} agitator-tube assembly must be known to enable its power consumption in a given configuration to be calculated. The dimensionless power characteristic is described by Eq. (6). An estimate of power consumption from the power characteristic is schematically shown in Fig. 1. The dependence of the coefficients in Eq. (6) on the Reynolds number is shown in Fig. 5. The power characteristics for selected Reynolds number values are shown in Figs. 6 - 9...|$|R
40|$|Mixing {{processes}} are becoming today a huge concern for industrialists in various domains like the pharmaceutical production, oil refining, food industry and manufacture of cosmetic products {{especially when the}} {{processes are}} related to the mixing of highly viscous products. So the choice of a stirring system for this category of products or fluids must be rigorously examined before use because of the flows which are laminar in the most cases, something that is not good to obtain homogeneous particles or suspensions after the mixing operation. This CFD study allows developing a new geometrical model of mechanical agitator with high performance for mixing of highly viscous fluids. It consists of a combination of two bladed and helical <b>screw</b> <b>agitators.</b> The investigations of the flow structure generated in the vessel are made by using the computer code ANSYS CFX (version 13. 0), which allows us to realize and test the effectiveness of the new stirrer on the resulting mixture and power consumption...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the special}} {{performances}} obtained {{by means of the}} optimisation method applied to the axial runners of run-of-river hydraulic turbines and of wind turbines, {{as well as in the}} case of the screws for boat propulsion, perfected by the first of the authors [1] - [10], in this work one extend the application of this method at the case of an organic mud <b>agitator</b> <b>screw</b> for fermentation and biogas production. One presents the obtaining of the bio liquid circulation minimal velocity in the two possible cases [3]: extracting the fluid velocity from the peripheral force exerted by the runner, as well as from the mechanical power consumed for its driving. After the obtaining of the optimal relative peripheral angle one determines also the optimal incidence angles of the profile for other blade radii. This method permits in the same time to find the optimal profile, using the multitude of the profile characteristics, experimentally studied...|$|R
