In aquatic systems, oxygen regulates respiratory metabolism, mediates biogeochemical cycles, and is an integral component of water quality. In this work, a simple predictive tool for dissolved oxygen <b>saturation</b> <b>concentrations</b> in aquatic systems {{as a function of}} chloride concentration and temperature using a novel Arrhenius-type asymptotic exponential function has been formulated. The proposed method predicts the amount of dissolved oxygen <b>saturation</b> <b>concentrations</b> for temperatures up to 50 °C and chloride concentrations up to 25 g/l.

40|$|Organic aerosol from primary semivolatile and {{intermediate}} volatility compounds is estimated using a global chemical transport model. Semivolatile organic compound (SVOC, <b>saturation</b> <b>concentrations</b> between about 0. 1 and 10 4 &mu;g/m 3 ) oxidation {{is predicted to}} be a much larger global source of net aerosol production than oxidation of traditional parent hydrocarbons (terpenes, isoprene, and aromatics). Using a prescribed rate constant and reduction in volatility, the yield of aerosol (defined as the net mass of aerosol formed divided by the total mass of the parent hydrocarbon emitted) from SVOCs is predicted to be about 75 % on a global, annually averaged basis. Intermediate volatility compound (IVOC, <b>saturation</b> <b>concentrations</b> between about 10 4 and 10 6 &mu;g/m 3 ) emissions and oxidation are highly uncertain since they are not typically measured. The use of a naphthalene-like surrogate with different high-NOx and low-NOx parameterizations produces an aerosol yield of about 30 % or roughly 5 Tg/yr of aerosol from IVOC oxidation on a global basis. Estimates of the total global organic aerosol source presented here range between 60 and 100 Tg/yr. This range reflects uncertainty in the parameters for SVOC volatility, SVOC oxidation, SVOC emissions, and IVOC emissions, as well as wet deposition. The highest estimates result if SVOC emissions are significantly underestimated (by more than a factor of 2) or if wet deposition of the gas-phase semivolatile species is less effective than previous estimates. Compared to a traditional non-volatile primary organic aerosol model without IVOCs, the global estimate of organic aerosol production is at most roughly 10 % higher than previous studies. Additional information is needed to constrain the emissions and treatment of SVOCs and IVOCs, which have traditionally not been included in models. Comparisons to winter organic carbon observations over the US indicate that SVOC emissions are significantly underestimated by the traditional POA inventories. The degree to which IVOC emissions or other parameters are uncertain is unknown...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{this thesis}} we explore {{the two major}} {{mechanisms}} that organic carbon compounds experience in the atmosphere when reacting with major oxidizers: fragmentation and functionalization. We start by exploring the photo-oxidation of n-aldehydes – including their chemistry and organic aerosol formation – because they are known to fragment strongly in their first-generation chemistry with the OH radical. It is found that this strong fragmentation path suppresses their ability to form OA when compared to similar n-alkanes. n-Aldehydes with fewer than thirteen carbons do not produce OA under atmospheric concentrations. We also study two sequences of molecules with different <b>saturation</b> <b>concentrations</b> that systematically increase in oxygenation. Higher oxygenation was found to suppress {{the ability of a}} molecule to form OA. The position of a functional group in a carbon backbone was also found to affect OA formation. Functional groups located {{in the center of a}} large carbon backbone suppress OA formation when compared to functional groups on the end (e. g., 7 - and 2 -tridecanol, respectively). In the sequences mentioned, pinonaldehyde is a key molecule studied since it is an important oxidation product of alpha-pinene which is one of the most emitted molecules from biogenic sources. Production of OA from pinonaldehyde confirms the importance of biogenic aging. As complement to the experimental work, two different computer simulations are used as prognostic tools of OA formation for the chemical species presented in this thesis. The first simulation is the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2 D-VBS) developed by Donahue and coworkers at Carnegie Mellon University. This box model predicts OA evolution of bulk organic aerosol systems by knowing initial oxygenation and <b>saturation</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The second one is GECKO-A developed by Aumont and co-workers from the University of Paris. Its approach consists of following every reaction and species involved in the chemistry of OA formation. Both simulations give reasonable results when compared to the experimental OA formation potential of different molecules presented in the first half of this thesis. This is despite their very two different approaches in predicting OA formation. We conclude that by properly considering fragmentation and functionalization paths, atmospheric OA formation can be reasonably predicted...|$|R
