5000|$|Speed <b>skates</b> Speed <b>skates</b> differ {{greatly from}} hockey <b>skates</b> and figure <b>skates.</b> Unlike hockey <b>skates</b> and figure <b>skates,</b> speed <b>skates</b> cut {{off at the}} ankle and are built more like a shoe than a boot to allow for more ankle compression. The blades range in length on average from 12" [...] to 18" [...] {{depending}} on the age and height of the skater. Short track blades are fixed to the boot in two places once at the heel and the other right behind the ball of the foot. Long track <b>skates,</b> also called klap <b>skates,</b> attach firmly to the boot only at the front. The heel of the boot actually detaches from the blade every stroke. This is accomplished through a spring mechanism located at the front connector. Speed <b>skates</b> cannot be sharpened at a shop like most <b>skates.</b> Instead each skater sharpens {{his or her own}} <b>skates.</b> This is accomplished using a jig which is a frame to hold the <b>skates</b> in place while they are manually sharpened.|$|R
