Meanwhile, stakeholders focus is being broadened {{and it is now}} important not only to supply a particular product or service but also show that they are actively pursuing an environmental agenda. Companies can use various tools to aid in environmental efforts, but also to demonstrate to the world that the company is actively engaged in environmental activities. One such tool is the environmental standard ISO 14001 which provides the company with guidance and support on how the business must manage its environmental efforts. To show a business' progress in environmental performance, it is advantageous to use environmental performance indicators as they enable stakeholders to easily understand how the business works with environmental issues. Authors in the field explain that the environmental management system propagation is limited in service organizations. It is known that also a service organization contributes to environmental impact in some way. Therefore, it is interesting to examine a service organization's direct environmental impact and to create environmental performance indicators to the organization. This case study has been carried out on a case-company that has the intention to implement an environmental management system. The case-company needs help to identify its <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects,</b> formulate <b>environmental</b> performance indicators and environmental goals and therefore the study's purpose is: to identify a service organizations environmental impact and to develop environmental indicators. This is going to be applied to a technology consulting company.

50|$|Conventionally, {{environmental}} management systems have always addressed the impacts of products on local surroundings. ISO 14001 (ISO 14001:3) provides a formalized framework for managing <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and improving environmental performance through a ‘‘Plan, Do, Check, Review’’ continual improvement cycle.During the phase of product planning, consumer demands and market opportunities are evaluated. At this time a product description and execution plans for a successful program launch are developed and product requirements are defined.During the phase of product development, specific design specifications are finalized, models are built, and designs are reviewed and released for manufacture planning. Once manufacturing begins, the product is commercially launched for general availability and volume deployed to the marketplace. Once a prototype is available, LCA {{is used as a}} fundamental standard to identify significant social and environmental aspects and quantify environmental impact.Once a product is launched into market and becomes commercialized, it enters the maturity phase, which means that the sales and the profits both reach the peak. The maturity phase contains two stages: during the first stage of maturity, the customer is utilizing the product. Modifications may still be made to the product to enhance or change it. The product enters the second stage of maturity when it approaches near to the decline phase. Where applicable, end-of-life products are taken back and subsequently reused or recycled efficiently. While being a legal requirement in the EU, the take back of end-of-life products offers the chance to review the final life cycle stage of a product through direct contact with recyclers. This knowledge can then be applied to future designs and product improvement.|$|E

40|$|Construction of {{a second}} runway at Manchester Airport (1997 - 2000) {{included}} a £ 17 million environmental package concerned with habitat restoration, relocation of species and translocation of valuable habitat components. One focus was on legally protected vertebrates such as great crested newts and badgers. To this end, a monitoring programme was established to assess earthworm communities (significant prey items for the given protected animals) within areas of translocated grassland. Major upheaval of turf can have negative consequences on soil biota, so its integration with receptor subsoil was essential. The work reported here relates to annual (autumn) monitoring (1998 - 2014) of 4 translocated grassland areas. Digging and hand sorting of soil, followed by vermifuge application to replicated plots was used to extract earthworm specimens. Twelve species of earthworm were recorded, representing litter dwelling, shallow, and deep burrowing ecological groups. Presence of Lumbricus terrestris in vertical burrows showed these grasslands have been integrated into their new locations. Total earthworm numbers fluctuated during the monitoring period, with lowest density at 4 per square metre and highest {{more than a hundred}} times larger. Similarly, biomasses have ranged between 1 g to 110 g per square metre. Significant differences can be attributed to a number of factors including type of translocation undertaken (turf transfer vs. soil alone) and also between grassland sites (wetter lower lying, vs. constructed hillocks). Meteorological data suggests that the most <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> during monitoring was rainfall, with dramatic earthworm reductions in 2003, a year with a particularly dry summer. Great crested newts have been located from soil pits when sampling for earthworms at one of the areas. Earthworm community composition has been dynamic over the monitoring period suggesting that this and population size need to be appraised over realistic timescales...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the European Ecodesign Directive {{has emerged}} as a new {{approach}} to integrate environmental concerns into the product design and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, without compromising performances and costs. In addition, the recent Ecodesign Directives require products which are increasingly eco-friendly and eco-efficient, preserving high-performances. It is very important for producers measuring performances, for electric cooking ranges, hobs, ovens, and grills for household use, and a low power consumption of appliances represents a powerful selling point, also in terms of ecodesign requirements. The Ecodesign Directive provides a clear framework about the sustainable design of products and it has been extended in 2009 to all energy-related products, or products with an impact on energy consumption during the use. The European Regulation establishes measures of ecodesign of ovens, hobs, and kitchen hoods, and domestic use and energy efficiency of a product has a <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> in the use phase which is the most impactful in the life cycle. It is important that the product parameters and performances are not affected by ecodesign requirements from a user’s point of view, and the benefits of reducing energy consumption in the use phase should offset the possible environmental impact in the production stage. Accurate measurements of cooking appliance performance are essential to help the industry to produce more energy efficient appliances. The development of ecodriven products requires ecoinnovation and ecodesign tools to support the sustainability improvement. The ecodesign tools should be practical and focused on specific ecoobjectives in order to be largely diffused. The main scope of this paper is the development, implementation, and testing of an innovative tool, which could be an improvement for the sustainable design of induction hobs. In particular, a prototypical software tool is developed in order to simulate the energy performances of the induction hobs. The tool is focused on a multiphysics model which is able to simulate the energy performances and the efficiency of induction hobs starting from the design data. The multiphysics model is composed by an electromagnetic simulation and a thermal simulation. The electromagnetic simulation is able to calculate the eddy current induced in the pot, which leads to the Joule heating of material. The thermal simulation is able to measure the energy consumption during the operational phase. The Joule heating caused from the eddy currents is the output of electromagnetic simulation and the input of thermal ones. The aims of the paper are the development of integrated tools and methodologies of virtual prototyping {{in the context of the}} ecodesign. This tool could be a revolutionary instrument in the field of industrial engineering and it gives consideration to the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of product design and focus on the ecodesign of energy-related products, in order to achieve a reduced environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|All organisations {{make some}} {{contribution}} to the {{degradation of the environment}} through their use of resources and production of waste. Environmental management systems (EMS) standards can provide a tool for companies to systematically reduce their environmental impacts. ISO 14001 was published in 1996. This fitted in with plans of the case study company to take proactive action in this area, even though there was no legislative requirement for them to do so. As EMS implementation was a new area at the time, appropriate methodologies were developed to address different aspects of the implementation, and ISO 14001 was successfully implemented in the company. The results of the primary research included: ♦ Drawing up a methodology for identifying and interpreting the environmental legislation that may {{have an impact on the}} organisation and compiling a register of such regulations. ♦ Developing a robust methodology for assessing <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and impacts and applying this to the software company. ♦ Establishing objectives and targets for those aspects identified as significant and implementing environmental management programmes to meet these. ♦ Developing an internal environmental audit procedure based on auditing against the significant aspects. ♦ Integrating areas of the EMS with the existing quality management system in order to avoid duplication of effort. ♦ Undergoing an external assessment process in order to achieve certification of the system. The thesis concludes that the systematic approach defined in ISO 14001 provided a mechanism that the organisation was able to adopt to bring about improvement in its environmental performance. The system was based on a thorough evaluation of the organisation's <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> in order to bring about a reduction in its negative impacts.

Trees which {{are part of the}} forest help to stabilize the forest soil, improve soil fertility, reduce the velocity of wind, protect watershed and reduce the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere. Many industries use trees as raw materials and in most cases impact the environment, but there are great differences in the impact they make. There is a need therefore to continually evaluate the operational activities of these industries to ensure that the environment is protected. The use of environmental management systems like ISO and EMAS standards has helped in the evaluation of organizations and industries. In this thesis, two sawmills Iretunde and Irepodun in Etsako-West local government area Edo state Nigeria were evaluated with the aim to determine their operational activities and how the environment is being affected by them. Subaims were to determine the most <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of the sawmill and their organizational structure.

This new approach {{was determined to be}} necessary due to the generic nature and broad applicability of the ISO 14001 standard, the lack of appropriate methodology in the professional literature, and the lack of related knowledge and ability in most small or medium sized organizations. As controlling and influencing operations is a vital characteristic of an effective environmental management system, currently available federal and state guidance manuals for small or medium size environmental management systems were reviewed to determine the support that they provided in this area. Unfortunately, these guidance manuals lacked specific direction for identifying potential operational controls. Working with six organizations participating in the Monroe County Strategic Environmental Management Initiative, a new approach was developed and utilized to determine appropriate operational controls for each organization 2 ̆ 7 s <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> as part of its environmental management system development and implementation. This approach employed the use of: 1) An Operational Control Flowchart (developed for this thesis); 2) Decision Block Descriptions for the Operational Control Flowchart (developed in support of the Operational Control Flowchart); and 3) A cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, it was found that identifying and evaluating operational controls for one obvious environmental aspect in each organization before the organization 2 ̆ 7 s environmental aspects were competitively evaluated for significance, provided a convincing example for skeptical participants and enhanced the EMS implementation process. The new approach began by first identifying potential operational controls for all identified significant aspects. Next, a practical cost-benefit analysis was performed for each of the potential operational controls before finalizing performance objectives and targets. As the potential operational controls were found to provide an economic as well as an environmental benefit, the MCSEMI participating organizations were eager to implement them and take advantage of the cost and environmental benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{logistic}} chain {{has evolved}} from being a concept of integrated transport activity {{to that of a}} fully functioning, dynamic, and complex multi-component system with the primary function of delivering effective management of freight mobility. Whilst humanity is faced with the challenge of reducing the impact of transport on the environment without losing the benefits to society and economies, a holistic approach to the environmental management of the logistic chain emerges as a necessity. The thesis follows a multi-method and interdisciplinary, phased pathway in order to (1) assess the feasibility and practicability of delivering sustainable development through such a chain, (2) address the challenges inherent to its implementation, and (3) develop a model that guides the development and delivery of an environmental management system specifically focussed on the logistic chain. Following an environmental management based methodology, the <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of the logistic chain operations are identified and analysed. Focus is then placed on the major players in the chain (transport buyers, providers and operators) and, in particular, on selected practices that have the potential to improve chain environmental performance and guide the future trends of the sector's response. Seaports are selected for purposes of evaluation and validation of various options as they arguably represent the major and most complex of the logistic nodes in terms of intense intermodal and multi-actor interest. The evolution and trends in the field of integrated seaport area management are evaluated by specifically designed surveys and case studies. Similarly, noise is selected as a multi-source, trans-boundary and complex issue in order to examine the potential options for control of <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of the logistic chain. The feasibility of integrated noise management throughout the chain is assessed through the demonstration of available management response options.
