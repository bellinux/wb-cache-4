60|$|George {{fell back}} and stood {{watching}} the girl, {{who was in}} a white dress, with a little hood trimmed with <b>swansdown</b> over her head.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bremmil {{came out}} of the cloak-room in a <b>swansdown</b> cloak with a white [...] "cloud" [...] round her head. She looked radiant; and she had a right to.|$|E
6000|$|Reading my old diary, I {{came on a}} {{sentence}} of yours last year about the clouds being all [...] "trimmed with swansdown," [...] so pretty. (I copied {{it out of a}} letter.) The thoughts of you always trim me with <b>swansdown.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the stuff}} to sleep on," [...] he cried. [...] "None of your spring-mattresses and <b>swansdown.</b> I never sleep so soundly {{anywhere}} as here. YOU will sleep between sheets. My dear fellow, I pity {{you from the}} bottom of my soul." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the hotel}} {{he glanced at}} the clock. It was just eight, and he was to {{accompany}} the Bullsoms to the theatre. He met them in the hall, and Selina looked with reproach at his morning clothes. She was wearing a new <b>swansdown</b> theatre cloak, with a collar which she had turned up round her face like a frame. She was convinced that she had never looked so well in her life.|$|E
60|$|On {{entering}} the tent {{they found a}} table set for two, with snowy linen, bright silver and sparkling glassware, a vase of roses {{in the center and}} many dishes of delicious food, some smoking hot, waiting to satisfy their hunger. Also, {{on either side of the}} tent were beds, with satin sheets, warm blankets and pillows filled with <b>swansdown.</b> There were chairs, too, and tall lamps that lighted the interior of the tent with a soft, rosy glow.|$|E
6000|$|Ulric. [...] In the boatman's shed, [...] Near to the ferry: you mistook the ford-- [...] 150 [...] Tis higher to the right:--their {{entertainment}} [...] Will be but rough--but 'tis {{a single}} night, [...] And they had best be {{guardians of the}} baggage. [...] The shed will hold the weather from their sleep, [...] The woodfire warm them--and, for beds, a cloak [...] Is <b>swansdown</b> to a seasoned traveller: [...] It has been mine for many a moon, and may [...] Tonight, for aught it recks me.|$|E
60|$|When I {{caught sight}} of this little girl, she was {{twisting}} herself round on her heel, swinging from her conductress's hand, flinging herself {{from side to side}} with wanton and fantastic gyrations. These perverse movements arrested my attention, they struck me as of a character fearfully familiar. On close inspection, no less so appeared the child's equipment; the lilac silk pelisse, the small <b>swansdown</b> boa, the white bonnet--the whole holiday toilette, in short, was the gala garb of a cherub but too well known, of that tadpole, Désirée Beck--and Désirée Beck it was--she, or an imp in her likeness.|$|E
6000|$|Dearest sweetheart, before I stop, let me {{tell you}} that if I have brought any {{happiness}} into your life, you have brought far, far more into mine. My soul seemed to come into full being upon the day when I loved you. It was so small, and cramped, and selfish, before--and life was so hard, and stupid, and purposeless. To live, to sleep, to eat, for some years, and then to die--it was so trivial and so material. But now the narrow walls seem in an instant to have fallen, and a boundless horizon stretches around me. And everything appears beautiful. London Bridge, King William Street, Abchurch Lane, the narrow stair, the office with the almanacs and the shining desks, it has all become glorified, tinged with a golden haze. I am stronger: I step out briskly and breathe more deeply. And I am a better man too. God knows there was room for it. But I do try to make an ideal, and to live up to it. I feel such a fraud when I think of being put upon a pedestal by you, when some little hole where I am out of sight is my true place. I am like the man in Browning who mourned over the spots upon his 'speckled hide,' but rejoiced in the <b>swansdown</b> of his lady. And so, my own dear sweet little <b>swansdown</b> lady, good-night to you, with my heart's love now and for ever from your true lover, ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked very}} smart {{in her new}} hat, a large black straw with a great many {{inexpensive}} flowers on it; and round her neck floated a long boa of imitation <b>swansdown.</b> She was still very thin, and she stooped a little when she walked (she had always done that,) but her eyes did not seem so large; and though she never had any colour, her skin had lost the earthy look it had. They {{walked down to the}} sea. Philip, remembering he had not walked with her for months, grew suddenly conscious of his limp and walked stiffly in the attempt to conceal it.|$|E
6000|$|Lydgate, {{inclined}} to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith {{of the people in}} the efficacy of [...] "the bill," [...] while nobody cared about the low state of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions. One evening in March, Rosamond in her cherry-colored dress with <b>swansdown</b> trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate, lately come in tired from his outdoor work, was seated sideways on an easy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his brow looking a little troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the [...] "Pioneer," [...] while Rosamond, having noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking at him, and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody disposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the curtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of [...] "When first I saw thy face;" [...] while the house spaniel, also stretched out with small choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of the rug with silent but strong objection.|$|E
60|$|They {{were all}} {{taken up with}} the small {{grandson}} the next day. He was ready in his fairy-page trimness {{to go to the}} early service at the Minster; but he was full of the colonial nil admirari principle, and was quite above being struck by the grand old building, or allowing its superiority--either to papa's own church or Auckland Cathedral. They took him to present to Mary on their way back from church, when he was the occasion of a great commotion by carrying the precious Master Charlie all across the hall to his mamma, and quietly observing in resentment at the outcry, that of course he always carried little Ethel about when mamma and nurse were busy. After breakfast, when he had finished his investigations of all Dr. May's domains, and much entertained Gertrude by his knowledge of them, Ethel set him down to write a letter to his father, and her own to Meta being engrossing, she did not look much more after him till Dr. May came in, and said, 'I want you to sketch off a portrait of her dicky-bird for Meta;' and he put before her a natural history with a figure of that tiny humming-bird which is endowed with <b>swansdown</b> knickerbockers.|$|E
50|$|To {{promote the}} show, Dietrich had a photo sitting with Milton Greene, which {{produced}} a famous portrait of her, appearing to wear nothing but her famous <b>swansdown</b> coat.|$|E

5000|$|She {{would often}} perform {{the first part}} of her show in one of her body-hugging dresses and a <b>swansdown</b> coat, and change to top hat and tails for {{the second half of the}} performance. This allowed her to sing songs usually {{associated}} with male singers, like [...] "One for My Baby" [...] and [...] "I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face".|$|E
50|$|From 1951-59, Sarmi {{was head}} {{designer}} for Elizabeth Arden. He then opened his own high quality ready-to-wear salon in New York in 1959, using the label Sarmi. In 1960, {{he won a}} Coty Award. It was during this time that he developed {{a reputation as a}} top designer, wooing an influential clientele that included celebrities, New York socialites, and foreign dignitaries. Pat Nixon wore a Sarmi for Arden gown to her husband's second Inaugural Ball in 1957. He was best known for his opulent evening looks, and for his use of extravagant fabrics such as <b>swansdown.</b> He became a naturalised United States citizen on 12 January 1959.|$|E
