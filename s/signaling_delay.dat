50|$|The self re-excitation of hyperactive stretch {{reflexes}} theory {{involves a}} repetitive contract-relax cycle {{in the affected}} muscle, which creates oscillatory movements in the affected limb. In order for self re-excitation to exist, both an increase in motor neuron excitability and nerve signal delay are required. Increased motor neuron excitability is likely accomplished by alterations to the net inhibition of neurons occurring {{as a result of}} injury to the CNS (stroke/ spinal cord injury). This lack of inhibition biases neurons to a net excitatory state, therefore increasing total signal conduction. <b>Signaling</b> <b>delay</b> is present due to an increased nerve conduction time. Long delays are primarily due to long reflex pathways, which are common in distal joints and muscles. This may therefore explain why clonus is typically found in distal structures like the ankle. Frequency of clonus beats {{have been found to be}} directly proportional to the length of the reflex pathway it is found in.|$|E

40|$|Next-generation {{wireless}} {{networks have}} been envisioned {{to be an}} integration of heterogeneous wireless access networks such as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Networks) and the IEEE 802. 11 based WLAN (Wireless Local Area Networks). It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless vertical handoff management in such an integrated architecture that provides the mobile users uninterrupted service continuity anywhere, any time. In such a networking environment, the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> of the vertical handoff is not fixed due to the traffic load in the backbone Internet, wireless channel quality and the distance between a mobile node and its home network. However, the currently handoff solutions implicitly considers the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> as a constant value. In this thesis, we study a typical link layer assisted handoff, identifying its deficiency due to the considerably large handoff delay. We propose an adaptive vertical handoff management scheme for integrated UMTS and WLAN networks. The proposed scheme incorporates the idea of pre-handoff with adaptive handoff threshold. We estimate the handoff <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> in advance, therefore, providing the delay information required for making an adaptive handoff decision. Instead of setting a fixed threshold, an adaptive handoff threshold value is determined for every single MN based on the estimated handoff <b>signaling</b> <b>delay.</b> The RSS and the RSS's rate of change are {{used to determine the}} estimated handoff time instant. Extensive simulation has been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed handoff scheme...|$|E

In our distributed system, each user has its own optimized system configuration, which results in the minimal signaling traffic.

40|$|Abstract — Mobile IP is a {{solution}} for mobility on the global Internet. However, the basic Mobile IP does not support paging. The main benefit of providing paging services is to save the battery power consumption at mobile terminals. Next generation Internet is expected to support multimedia communications. For real-time data traffic, Quality of Service (QoS) provision must be guaranteed. The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) was proposed to support the signaling of end-to-end IP QoS. When both IP paging and RSVP are supported in the network, the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> for connection setup {{is the sum of}} the paging delay and the time for RSVP path setup. This paper introduces a new scheme for fast connection setup of real-time communication. The connection is set up with the help of Mobile IP location registration and paging.

3000|$|In {{order to}} link the study to {{practical}} systems, we have employed a simple TBF method (known as closed-loop mode 1) that resembles the one applied in HSDPA in presence of two transmit antennas [24]. A similar method has also been adopted in LTE and, although our method is not exactly the same, the performance difference between HSDPA closed-loop method and its LTE counterpart is negligible. In HSDPA, the mobile user defines the 1 -bit (phasing) message that is reported to the serving base station at each time instant. The base station thus maintains the phase at the first antenna, and then adjusts the phase of the second antenna based on the sliding averaging over two consecutive feedback commands, see [25] for more details. Note that if {{the speed of the}} mobile user is low (or equivalently, the coherence time of the channel is large compared to the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay),</b> closed-loop mode 1 is equivalent to have error-free QPSK phasing information at the second antenna.

40|$|Abstract- In {{wireless}} networks, {{efficient management}} of mobility {{is a crucial}} issue to support mobile users. The Mobile Internet Protocol (MIP) has been proposed to support global mobility in IP networks. Several mobility management strategies have been proposed which aim reducing the signaling traffic related to the Mobile Terminals (MTs) registration with the Home Agents (HAs) whenever their Care-of-Addresses (COAs) change. They use different Foreign Agents (FAs) and Gateway FAs (GFAs) hierarchies to concentrate the registration processes. For high-mobility MTs, the Hierarchical MIP (HMIP) and Dynamic HMIP (DHMIP) strategies localize the registration in FAs and GFAs, yielding to high-mobility signaling. The Multicast HMIP strategy limits the registration processes in the GFAs. For high-mobility MTs, it provides lowest mobility <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> compared to the HMIP and DHMIP approaches. However, it is resource consuming strategy unless for frequent MT mobility. Hence, we propose an analytic model to evaluate the mean <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> and the mean bandwidth per call according {{to the type of}} MT mobility. In our analysis, the MHMIP Outperforms the DHMIP and MIP strategies in almost all the studied the contribution of this paper is the analytic model that allows the mobility management approaches performance evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Feedback {{signaling}} plays a {{key role}} in flow control because the traffic source relies on the signaling information to make correct and timely flow-control decisions. Design of an efficient signaling algorithm is a challenging task since the signaling messages can tolerate neither error nor latency. Multicast flow-control signaling imposes two additional challenges: scalability and feedback synchronization. Previous research on multicast feedback-synchronization signaling has mainly focused on the algorithm design and implementation. However, the delay properties of these algorithms are, despite their vital importance, neither well understood nor thoroughly studied. In this paper, we develop both deterministic and statistical binary-tree models to study the delay performance of the multicast signaling algorithms. The deterministic model is used to derive the expressions of each path’s feedback roundtrip time in a multicast tree, while the statistical model is employed to derive the general probability distributions of each path becoming the multicast-tree bottleneck. Using these models, we analyze and contrast the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> scalability of two representative multicast signaling protocols—the Soft-Synchronization Protocol (SSP) and the Hop-By-Hop (HBH) scheme—by deriving the first and second moments of multicast signaling delays. Also derived is the optimal flow-control update interval for SSP to minimize the multicast <b>signaling</b> <b>delay...</b>|$|E
