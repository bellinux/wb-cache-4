25|$|To give {{an idea of}} {{the scale}} of the problem, {{assuming}} a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg/kW, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. This would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLLV) launches to send the material to low earth orbit, where it would likely be converted into <b>subassembly</b> solar arrays, which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to (slowly) reach GEO (Geostationary orbit). With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based HLLVs of $500 million to $800 million, and launch costs for alternative HLLVs at $78 million, total launch costs would range between $11 billion (low cost HLLV, low weight panels) and $320 billion ('expensive' HLLV, heavier panels). To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively); another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of $24 billion (1970s' dollars), taking inflation into account, would cost $140 billion today, more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station.|$|E

[...] The wing of the Renton built B-29A-BN used a different <b>subassembly</b> process and was a foot longer in span. The Georgia built B-29B-BA weighed less through armament reduction. A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built.|$|E

2500|$|The Nash-Healey is a two-seat {{sports car}} that was {{produced}} for the American market between 1951 and 1954. Marketed by Nash-Kelvinator Corporation with the Nash Ambassador drivetrain and a European chassis and body, it served as a halo (or image) vehicle, or flagship car, for the automaker to promote the sales of the other Nash models. It was [...] "America's first post-war sports car", and the first introduced in the U.S. by a major automaker since the Great Depression.

2500|$|The {{impact of}} {{computers}} continued in 1956. Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson composed Illiac Suite for string quartet, the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using algorithmic composition. [...] "...

[...] Later developments included the work of Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories, who developed the influential MUSIC I program in 1957, {{one of the first}} computer programs to play electronic music. Vocoder technology was also a major development in this early era. In 1956, Stockhausen composed Gesang der Jünglinge, the first major work of the Cologne studio, based on a text from the Book of Daniel. An important technological development of that year was the invention of the Clavivox synthesizer by Raymond Scott with <b>subassembly</b> by Robert Moog.|$|E

This expands current approaches in sequence generation applicable for binary assembly process to a k-ary assembly process by including: (i) nonbinary state between two parts, i. e., multiple joints between two parts or <b>subassemblies,</b> is taken into consideration, and (ii) simultaneous assembly of Y (Y 3) parts or <b>subassemblies.</b> The methodology is based upon proposed k-piece graph and k-piece mixed graph approaches for the assemblies without and with assembly precedence relationship, respectively.
