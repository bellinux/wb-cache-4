5|$|On February 20, 1997, {{which was}} the 35th anniversary of his Friendship 7 flight, Glenn {{announced}} that his retirement from the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> occur {{at the end of}} his term in December 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} Vice President had been vacant sixteen times {{due to the}} death or {{resignation}} of the Vice President or his succession to the presidency. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly {{four years after the}} assassination of Abraham Lincoln. During the impeachment of Andrew Johnson there was no Vice President to succeed him. At that time, the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 provided that the President pro tempore of the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> succeed Johnson if he was removed from office. Had the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson resulted in Johnson being removed from office, Senator Benjamin Wade, then the President pro tempore of the <b>Senate,</b> <b>would</b> have become acting president pending a special presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Kerr invited Whitlam and Minister for Labour Senator Jim McClelland {{to lunch}} on 30 October, {{immediately}} preceding an Executive Council meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, and the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> not convene until 1 July, thus obviating {{the threat of}} a possible temporary Labor majority. Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser's leadership and the Senate's right to block supply, refused any compromise.|$|E

5|$|As of 2012, the United States National Helium Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's helium. The reserve was expected {{to run out of}} helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease the shortage.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress {{also made it}} difficult to build the Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E
5|$|Robinson again {{assumed the}} {{position}} as Speaker of the Senate on August 16, 1862 {{as part of}} a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office in 1859, and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next in line for the governorship, to succeed him. Magoffin agreed to resign if the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next in line for the governorship. This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation. Because he never resigned from the Senate, Robinson technically held both his legislative seat and the governorship concurrently.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. had {{acquired}} {{over a thousand}} vessels during World War I, and still owned most of them when Harding took office. Congress had authorized their disposal in 1920, but the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> not confirm Wilson's nominees to the Shipping Board. Harding appointed Albert Lasker as its chairman; the advertising executive undertook to run the fleet as profitably as possible until it could be sold. Most ships proved impossible to sell at anything approaching the government's cost. Lasker recommended a large subsidy to the merchant marine to enable the sales, and Harding repeatedly urged Congress to enact it. Unpopular in the Midwest, the bill passed the House but was defeated by a filibuster in the Senate, and most government ships were eventually scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} branch {{consists of a}} unicameral National Assembly of 193members who are elected every five years, and although the Malawian constitution provides for a Senate of 80seats, one {{does not exist in}} practice. If created, the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> provide representation for traditional leaders and a variety of geographic districts, as well as special interest groups including the disabled, youth and women. There are currently nine political parties, with the Democratic Progressive Party acting as the ruling party and the Malawi Congress Party and the United Democratic Front acting as the main opposition parties in the National Assembly. Suffrage is universal at 18 years of age, and the central government budget for 2009/2010 is $1.7billion.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of {{governor}} becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the <b>senate</b> <b>would</b> act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
50|$|This {{would be}} Senator Carl Hayden's final run for U.S. <b>Senate,</b> he <b>would</b> be succeeded in office by former U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in 1968.|$|R

50|$|In 2016 Lee Bright {{introduced}} {{a bill in the}} South Carolina <b>Senate</b> that <b>would</b> have prevented any municipality in the state from passing or maintaining transgender equality ordinances.|$|R
5|$|The first {{election}} {{under the}} 1776 constitution {{took place in}} 1781, and the system would not change again until 1838. In the interim, {{a number of problems}} had cropped up in the appointment process, and the 1838 election saw the passage of a number of constitutional amendments that fundamentally changed how Senators were chosen. The electoral college was abolished, terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such that a third of the <b>senate</b> <b>would</b> be elected every two years, and a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore. The Senate no longer acted as the Governor's Council, although they would continue to confirm the Governor's appointments. Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851, when terms were shortened to four years, and 1864, when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one, but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not come again until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius' brother Gaius {{was elected}} tribune in 123 BC. Gaius Gracchus' {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces. In the past, for example, the <b>senate</b> <b>would</b> eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum ("ultimate decree of the senate"). Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support. He stood for election to a third term in 121 BC, but was defeated and then murdered by representatives of the senate with 3,000 of his supporters on Capitoline Hill in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{appointed}} four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The {{first was}} David Josiah Brewer, a {{judge on the}} Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Brewer, the nephew of Justice Field, had previously been considered for a cabinet position. Shortly after Brewer's nomination, Justice Matthews died, creating another vacancy. Harrison had considered Henry Billings Brown, a Michigan judge and admiralty law expert, for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second. For the third vacancy, which arose in 1892, Harrison nominated George Shiras. Shiras's appointment was somewhat controversial because his age—sixty—was older than usual for a newly appointed Justice. Shiras also drew the opposition of Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania {{because they were in}} different factions of the Pennsylvania Republican party, but his nomination was nonetheless approved. Finally, {{at the end of his}} term, Harrison nominated Howell Edmunds Jackson to replace Justice Lamar, who died in January 1893. Harrison knew the incoming <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> be controlled by Democrats, so he selected Jackson, a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he was friendly to ensure his nominee would not be rejected. Jackson's nomination was indeed successful, but he died after only two years on the Court.|$|E
25|$|The House and <b>Senate</b> bill <b>would</b> differ, somewhat, {{in their}} overall impact. The <b>Senate</b> bill <b>would</b> cover an {{additional}} 31 million people, at a federal budget cost of nearly $850 billion (not counting unfunded mandates) over ten years, reduce the ten-year deficit by $130 billion, {{and reduce the}} deficit in the second decade by around 0.25% of GDP. The House bill, meanwhile, would cover an additional 36 million people, cost roughly $1050 billion in coverage provisions, reduce the ten-year deficit by $138 billion, and slightly reduce the deficit in the second decade.|$|R
50|$|Murphy {{took office}} on January 3, 2013. Murphy pledged to support {{filibuster}} {{reform in the}} <b>Senate,</b> which <b>would</b> change a passing requirement of 60 votes to a simple majority.|$|R
50|$|This {{period was}} marked {{by a number of}} broken {{treaties}} either by the Roman generals, or their <b>senate,</b> that <b>would</b> not ratify the treaties, or by the native people.|$|R
25|$|Gates was {{nominated}} {{to become the}} Director of Central Intelligence (head of the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> reject the nomination due to controversy {{about his role in}} the Iran-Contra affair.|$|E
25|$|Between 1931 and 1982, {{the federal}} {{government}}, {{on behalf of}} the Canadian House of Commons and the <b>Senate,</b> <b>would</b> issue an address to the British government requesting an amendment. The request would include a resolution containing the desired amendments. These in turn, were always passed by the British Parliament, with little or no debate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} move to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig by 2020. As the Senate is renting GSIS for {{the office}} space, it asked the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to present suitable sites for it to move to, with the Senate eyeing the Navy Village property along Lawton Avenue as its favored site.|$|E
50|$|Mourdock faced Democratic nominee Joe Donnelly and Libertarian nominee Andy Horning in {{the general}} election. Mourdock said that if elected to the <b>Senate,</b> he <b>would</b> limit himself to two terms.|$|R

25|$|May 19, 2005 - Paul Martin's {{minority}} government survives a close (153-152) {{motion of}} confidence; with the Liberals still {{in power and}} Stephen Harper's Conservatives hinting that they'll back off future votes of non-confidence. Bill C-38 showed a strong promise of being made law (after a 3rd reading and vote) sometime before Parliament adjourns for the summer as the Prime Minister indicated MPs may sit in the summer, and the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> deal with the bill in July.|$|E
25|$|By October 28, the Senate {{had already}} been {{discussing}} the designation amendment. Republican DeWitt Clinton expected that the Senate, with a 24-9 Republican majority would quickly passing the amendment. Federalist Jonathan Dayton proposed that {{the office of the}} Vice President should be eliminated and his colleague, Uriah Tracy, seconded it. On the other side, Wilson Cary Nicholas was simply worried that Congress would not submit the amendment in time for the states to ratify it before the 1804 election. Despite Nicholas’ concern, the <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> not seriously deal with the amendment again until November 23.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persisted solely as an {{underground}} organization, {{supported by the}} Catholic Church. However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate Jaruzelski's attempts at reform, and nationwide strikes in 1988 forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a bicameral legislature called the National Assembly. The already existing Sejm would become the lower house. The <b>Senate</b> <b>would</b> be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers (Polish Round Table Agreement).|$|E
