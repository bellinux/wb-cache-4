50|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> {{nematodes}} are migratory endoparasites. Their lifecycle {{occurs in}} five stages {{with the first}} molt occurring in the egg and {{the second and third}} molt occurring in the soil. By the fourth stage, juveniles have entered the plant through young tissue and/or seedlings. The fourth molt then occurs inside the plant. The adult female must mate with a male to reproduce and lay eggs. A complete reproductive lifecycle of the <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematode is 19-25 days (egg to egg). Reproduction takes place in succulent, rapidly growing tissues or in storage organs and continues throughout. A female can lay 200-500 eggs in her lifespan. However, if conditions are unfavorable, the nematodes can halt their lifecycle. The lifespan of <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematodes is about 70 days. Most generations are passed inside <b>bulbs,</b> <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> leaves. Eggs and larvae overwinter in dried infected host material. They are also found in weed hosts and seeds of composite. <b>Stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematodes can survive up to two years in freezing or extremely dry environments in the soil. D. dipsaci can survive on or in plant tissue by entering cryptobiosis and survive for 3-5 years in this stage. During dormancy, D. dipsaci shows no sign of life and the metabolic activity is almost at a standstill.|$|R

50|$|Ditylenchus dipsaci is an plant {{pathogenic}} nematode that primarily infects {{onion and}} garlic. It is {{commonly known as}} the stem nematode, the <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> eelworm, or onion bloat (in the United Kingdom). Symptoms of infection include stunted growth, discoloration of <b>bulbs,</b> <b>and</b> swollen <b>stems.</b> D. dipsaci is a migratory endoparasite that has a five-stage lifecycle and the ability to enter into a dormancy stage. D. dipsaci enters through stomata or plant wounds and creates galls or malformations in plant growth. This allows for the entrance of secondary pathogens such as fungi and bacteria. Management of disease is maintained through seed sanitation, heat treatment, crop rotation, and fumigation of fields. D. dipsaci is economically detrimental because infected crops are unmarketable.|$|R
5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly 450 {{different}} {{plant species}} {{are susceptible to}} D. dipsaci due to the vast number of races. Many of these plants are economically valuable food crops and ornamentals and cannot be sold if they are infected or damaged by <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematodes. [...] D. dipsaci is especially important economically because the damage it can cause renders the plants unmarketable. Crops such as onions and carrots cannot be sold because the products are infected and damaged. Other crops such as alfalfa, oats, and tulips that are not used primarily for their roots still suffer necrosis and stunting that slowly destroys the plant. Seeds, bulbs, or saplings infected with nematodes often do not survive to maturity and are worthless.|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of volatile constituents from tissues of Korean wild garlic, Allium victorialis var. platyphyllum collected from different habitats of Ulleung Island, Korea, was determined. The concentrations of total volatile constituents in garlic <b>bulbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> were variable. The most abundant volatile compound in A. victorialis bulb extract was alanine (47 – 65 %), followed by dimethyl tridisulfide (5. 1 – 10. 3 %) and allyl disulfide (0. 1 – 12. 1 %). Dimethyl trisulfide (5. 2 – 10. 3 %), diallyl disulfide (0. 1 – 12. 1 %) and dimethl pentasulfide (0 – 0. 3 %) were abundant in stem tissues.

40|$|Morphologial, biochemical, {{molecular}} and karyological {{analyses of}} different populations and races of the <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci {{have suggested that}} it represents a species complex, of which only D. dipsaci sensu stricto and its morphologically larger variant, known as the giant race of the <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematode, are plant parasites of economic importance. The present study singles out the giant race from this complex, herein described as a new species named Ditylenchus gigas n. sp., {{on the basis of}} morphological and molecular data obtained from several populations collected from broad beans in southern Italy, southern Spain and Lebanon. The new species epithet, which refers to the large body size of the nematode with respect to the normal races, must be considered to be conspecific with the D. dipsaci'giant race' from Fabaceae in recent literature. Morphologically, the new species is characterized by a body size 1 · 5 - 2 times longer than the 'normal race', stylet delicate (11 · 5 - 13 · 0 μm long) with knobs distinctly sloping backwards, and long post-vulval uterine sac (81 - 150 μm long). Results of molecular analysis of rDNA sequences including the ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 region, the D 2 -D 3 fragment of the 28 S gene, the small 18 S subunit, the partial mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOI), and hsp 90 gene sequences, support the new taxonomic species status for the former D. dipsaci giant race from Vicia faba, and clearly distinguish D. gigas n. sp. from D. dipsaci sensu stricto. © 2011 The Authors.

5000|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> {{nematodes}} are migratory endoparasites and can {{be spread}} through irrigation water, tools and animals. [...] When the plants are covered in a film of moisture, D. dipsaci can move upwards to new leaves <b>and</b> <b>stems.</b> They enter through stomata or wounds. D. dipsaci feeds on the parenchymatous cells of the cortex once inside the plant. They release an enzyme, pectinase, that dissolves the cell walls. Once D. dipsaci begins to feed on the plant, cells near {{the head of the}} nematode lose all or a portion of their contents. The cells surrounding these begin to divide and enlarge. This develops into a gall or malformation of the seedling. This opening allows secondary pathogens to enter such as bacteria and fungi. Favorable entry of young seedlings in the soil occurs through the root cap or from inside the seed. The plant cells become enlarged due to the disappearance of chloroplasts and an increase of intracellular spaces in parenchyma tissue. Once the bulbs enlarge, D. dipsaci migrates down the stem. This causes the stem to become puffy and soft due to cavities, which can lead to collapse. D. dipsaci only enters the soil again if conditions become unfavorable.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn Europe, the <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> {{nematode}} Ditylenchus dipsaci {{has been}} {{listed as a}} quarantine pest by EPPO: without any control, it may cause complete failure of alfalfa crops. Movement of nematodes associated with seeds {{is considered to be}} the highest-risk pathway for the spread of this pest. Since the 2010 official withdrawal of methyl bromide in Europe, {{and in the absence of}} any alternative chemical, fumigation of contaminated seed batches is no longer possible, which makes the production of nematode-free alfalfa seeds difficult to achieve and leads to unmarketable seed batches. Thermotherapy is being considered as a realistic alternative strategy, but its efficiency still remains to be validated. The combination of the currently available methods (i. e. use of resistant cultivars, seed production according to a certification scheme, mechanical sieving, seed batch inspection) could significantly reduce the likelihood of seed contamination. However, it does not guarantee a total eradication of the nematode. Although it is already widely distributed all over Europe, reclassification of D. dipsaci as a regulated non-quarantine pest to reduce the possibility of further introductions and the rate of spread of this pest appears to be a risky strategy because of the lack of up-to-date documented data to evaluate damage thresholds and determine acceptable tolerance levels...|$|R
40|$|Stunted {{growth of}} fall-sown sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) {{associated}} with high incidence of crownroot infections and large soil infestations by Ditylenchus dipsaci were observed {{at the end of}} the crop growing season in southern Spain by early June 2005. The largest proportion (75 %) of the nematode life-stages in plant and soil was the fourth-stage juvenile. The large number (up to 3, 750 nematodes per gram of fresh tissue) of D. dipsaci individuals and severe anatomical alterations observed in storage sugar beet roots suggest that the <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematode is the causal agent of the impaired growth of sugar beets observed in commercial fields. Observed morphological traits of nematode specimens and results of specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the population of D. dipsaci infecting sugar beet belongs to the normal (nongiant) biological type of the nematode. Results of host-range bioassays indicated that the population of D. dipsaci infecting sugar beet in southern Spain reproduces on pea (including seeds and pods), onion, potato, spinach, and tomato, but not on bean, cotton, maize, and tobacco. These results indicate that D. dipsaci may be an important constraint for sugar beet crops in the affected area, but also for other important crops commonly used in rotation with them.

40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} composition of essential oil hydrodistillized from Allium roseum var. grandiflorum subvar. typicum Regel. leaves was analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Nine extracts obtained from flowers, <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> leaves <b>and</b> <b>bulbs</b> <b>and</b> bulblets of A. roseum var. grandiflorum were tested for their total phenol, total flavonoid and total flavonol content. All these extracts and the essential oils from fresh <b>stems,</b> leaves <b>and</b> flowers were screened for their possible antioxidant and antifungal properties. The {{results showed that}} the hexadecanoic acid was detected as the major component of the leaf essential oil (75. 9 %). The ethyl acetate extract of <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> leaves had the highest antioxidant activity with a 50 % inhibition concentration (IC 50) of 0. 35 ± 0. 01 mg/mL of DPPH and 0. 71 ± 0. 01 mg/mL of ABTS+. All the extracts appeared to be able to inhibit most of the tested fungi. The essential oil of the leaves had an antifungal growth effect on Fusarium solani f. sp. cucurbitae and Botrytis cinerea (39. 13 and 52. 50 %, respectively). This could be attributed to the presence of hexadecanoic acid, known for its strong antifungal activity. In conclusion, in addition to the health benefits of A. roseum, it can be used as an alternative pesticide in the control of plant disease and in the protection of agriculture products...|$|R
40|$|The plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} important pests around the world. Many species of the plant-parasitic nematodes cause high losses of crop yield and many of them have a quarantine status. The <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci (Kühn 1857) Filipjev 1836 is a migratory endoparasite nematode of over five hundred vas-cular plant species. The stem nematode D. dipsaci is prevalent {{in a wide range of}} climatic condi-tions, where moisture regimes enable nematode infection, multiplication and dispersal. The main method of D. dipsaci control is crop rotation, but the presence of morphologically indistinguishable host races with different host preferences makes rotation difficult (Wendt et al. 1993). The biologi-cal races exhibit different degrees of reproductive isolation, such as partial or complete reproduc-tive incompatibility (Erikson 1974). Each biologi-cal race is able to complete its life cycle only on a specific plant host. Among the most important plant hosts of D. dipsaci in Central Europe are bulb vegetables (onion, garlic and leek), carrot, alfalfa, clover, sugar beet, chicory, potatoes, strawberry, ornamental bulb plants (Narcissus spp.), and also many common weeds. Symptoms on host plants are not always specific as for appearance. Early infested plants and low infested seeds show no symptoms.

40|$|The <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulb</b> nematode, Ditylenchus dipsaci, is {{a serious}} pest of forage, horticultural and other crops. The two races of D. dipsaci that occur in Australia are the oat and lucerne races. These two races have the 'normal' {{morphology}} compared to the 'giant' type that attacks Vicia faba. The oat and lucerne races {{have been found in}} eastern Australia but not in Western Australia. There are no morphological or specific molecular tests to differentiate races within closely related 'normal' types of D. dipsaci. The aim of this work was to find protein biomarkers that would differentiate oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS), 2 -D PAGE and associated proteomics techniques. Three protein biomarkers at m/z 4313 ± 0. 1 %, 6300 ± 0. 1 % and 7460 ± 0. 1 % were found that discriminate the oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci using MALDI-TOFMS. The biomarker at m/z 4313 ± 0. 1 % was the prominent race-specific marker for the lucerne race and is almost absent in the oat race. In addition, proteomic maps were obtained by 2 -D PAGE of proteins extracted from oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci. This analysis allowed a comparison of acetone soluble proteins of oat and lucerne races of D. dipsaci. A prominent protein spot was identified with an isoelectric point (pI) of about 5 and molecular mass ca 4. 5 kDa for the lucerne race, which was absent in the oat race.

Recent concern over the safety of formaldehyde and growers' requests for a shorter treatment time prompted a reevaluation of the procedure. The time (Y, in minutes) required to raise the temperature at the bulb center from 25 to 44 C was related to bulb circumference (X, in cm) and is described by the linear regression Y = - 15 + 3. 4 X. The time required for 100 % mortality of D. dipsaci in vitro without formaldehyde was 150, 60, and 15 minutes at 44, 46, and 48 C, respectively. Hot water treatment (HWT) with 0. 37 % formaldehyde at 44 C for 150 minutes controlled D. dipsaci {{and did not have}} a detrimental effect on plant growth and flower production. Shorter formaldehyde-HWT of 90, 45, and 30 minutes at 46, 48, and 50 C, respectively, controlled D. dipsaci but suppressed plant growth and flower production. Fungal genera commonly isolated from the bulbs in association with D. dipsaci were Penicillium sp., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, and Mucor plumbeus, representing 60, 25, and 5 %, respectively, of the total fungi isolated. These fungi caused severe necrosis in daffodil bulbs. HWT at 44 C for 240 minutes reduced the number of colonies recovered from bulbs. The effects of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and sodium hypochlorite in reducing the population of fungi within bulbs were variable. Satisfactory control of D. dipsaci within bulbs can be achieved with HWT of bulbs at 44 C for 150 minutes with 0. 37 % formaldehyde or at 44 C for 240 minutes without chemicals...|$|R

The tricholomatoid habit, the scales on the cap and {{at the base of the}} <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> the sclerotial <b>bulb</b> of Schreier's species are reminiscent of Lepiota odorata, but the brownish yellow colour and the much larger size point to a distinct species. Schreier's publication caused three independent reactions. First, Imbach (1942 : 152) proposed the creation of the genus Squamamanita [!] for Tricholoma X and to name that species S. schreieri, but Latin descriptions were lacking. Some year...|$|R

The flower stalk appears after the leaves have died back, unlike the similar Allium ursinum, in which leaves and flowers {{can be seen at}} the same time. Ramps grow in close groups strongly rooted just {{beneath the surface of the}} soil.|$|R

Blesmols are herbivorous, and primarily eat roots, tubers, <b>and</b> <b>bulbs.</b> They are even able to pull smaller plants underground by their roots, without having to leave their burrows, enabling them to eat leaves, <b>stems,</b> <b>and</b> {{other parts of the}} plant that would otherwise be inaccessible. Blesmols burrow in search of food, and the great majority of their tunnel complex consists of these foraging burrows, surrounding a smaller number of storage areas, nests, and latrine chambers.|$|R
