50|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War, WEU {{tasks and}} {{institutions}} were gradually transferred to the Common Security and Defence Policy of the geographically larger, and in terms of integration more comprehensive, European Union. This process was completed in 2009 when a <b>solidarity</b> <b>clause</b> between the member states of the European Union, which was similar (but not identical) to the WEU's mutual defence clause, entered into force with the Treaty of Lisbon. The states party to the Modified Treaty of Brussels consequently decided to terminate that treaty on 31 March 2010, with all the remaining WEU's activities to be ceased within 15 months. On 30 June 2011, the WEU was officially declared defunct.|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} argues on European Defense issues, {{considering}} a triple perspective: Past Legacy, Present Changes and Future Challenges. The first part looks at European defense from an historical perspective; from its European integration origins {{to the foundation}} of a European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), reviewing its decade in existence. The second part analyzes the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, as well as the most significant developments of a Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) : <b>solidarity</b> <b>clauses,</b> mission enlargement, European Defense Agency (EDA), news forms of cooperation, CSDP democratic control. Thirdly, this paper considers future challenges and concludes the need for new developments: at the institutional level, the strengthening of European defense parliamentary control through the creation of a CSDP inter parliamentary assembly and the EU´s external action inter and cross pillar coordination; at the capability level, the need to strengthen EDA and implement new cooperation mechanisms foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty; at the strategic level, the drive to clarify the EU´s international identity and define a new international strategy enabling the EU as a global security producer...|$|R

40|$|The present {{work will}} focus on the {{principle}} of solidarity in the event of natural or man-made disaster in accordance with Article 222 TFEU. Furthermore, it considers the emergence of a sort of “solidarity system” based on the connection with other EU provisions to face a wide range of disasters. In the framework of the European integration process, the introduction of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>clause</b> has led to a renewed debate on a basic principle that has informed the entire EU construction. In such a perspective, the present work will confirm that this clause should be read in conjunction with other rules of EU primary and secondary law to which necessarily, although implicitly, it refers. More attention will be paid, in particular, to EU civil protection which pursues an interlinked objective. All of this with the aim to highlight that, although the <b>solidarity</b> <b>clause</b> has been rightly considered 'an integral part of a permanent EU crisis response, crisis management and crisis coordination system', a lot of consistency and efficiency are necessary to find a good balance in the combination of solidarity and security...|$|E
40|$|Work in progress. Please do not cite 2 The {{challenges}} {{for the implementation of}} the ESDP and the <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Clause</b> in the draft Treaty are great. The main difficulty being that the efficiency of these policies to a large extent depends on the Union’s ability to transcend the deep-rooted division between ‘internal ’ and ‘external ’ security manifested in the EU pillar structure and a long tradition of national security thinking. Today the EU’s objective is to extend stability beyond Union borders through international conflict prevention, peace keeping and ‘soft security ’ cooperation and at same time create a capacity to meet transnational threats such as terrorism on the European continent. Union and national institutions have had a hard time {{to keep up with the}} demands stemming from these new global and transboundary security goals. This paper offers an in-depth analysis of the policy and institutional implications for the ESDP and the <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Clause.</b> The requirements for an efficient implementation of these policies are examined in terms of a need to bridge the pillar structure, overcome traditional demarcation lines between policy areas such as trade, aid, diplomacy, external and internal crisis management, and, strategically engage new levels of national security actors including the ones of states neighbourin...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the innovations {{which the new}} EU Reform Treaty brings to the foreign and defense policyof the European Union. The study begins with an observation {{on the time of}} entry into force of the Reform Treaty, and then stops onthe main reforms introduced by the new text in the foreign policy sector. Thus, in the Common Fordign and SecurityPolicy (CFSP) sector, two are the major institutional innovations under the Reform Treaty: “The High Representativeof the Union for foreign affairs and security policy” and “The Eurnpean External Action Service”. The High Representative for foreign affairs and security policy, which the Constitutional Treaty boldly named“Minister of Foreign Affairs of the European Union”, will bring together the roles and powers of two differentinstitutional figures: the High Representative (CFSP) and the Commissioner for Foreign Relations. This fusion, whichshould simplify the institutional framework, aims to give greater coherence and effectiveness to the European foreignpolicy. The study then proceeds to analyze the innovations introduced in the Common Security and Defense Policy(PSAC) and in particular: the permanent structured cooperation; the <b>solidarity</b> <b>clause</b> and the collective defense one;the increase of the peace missions of the European Union, the so-called Petersberg missions, i. e. humanitarian and aidmissions, peacekeeping missions and crisis-fighting missions, including missions aimed at restoring peace...|$|E

40|$|The European Security Strategy, {{which was}} adopted in December 2003 by the European Council, serves three functions. Firstly, it {{provides}} a frame of reference both for long-term strategies and for current political problems. Secondly, it is a basis for consultation with major partners on central strategic issues. Thirdly, it leads to concrete follow-up in five areas identified by the European Council: (1) {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destruction, (2) the fight against terrorism, (3) effective multilateralism with the UN at its core, (4) a strategy towards the region of the Middle East, and (5) a comprehensive policy towards Bosnia-Herzegovina. Where do we stand on these five issues? On WMD the European Union has adopted a comprehensive strategy which is being implemented. On terrorism, as a consequence of the attacks in Madrid, the European Council on 25 and 26 March 2004 agreed on a wide-ranging Declaration reaffirming the EU's determination to systematically confront the terrorist threat. The appointment of an EU counter-terrorism coordinator will help to improve coordination and visibility of EU actions in this field. Progress has been achieved on a number of third pillar directives and regulations (Directive on compensating victims of crime, Regulation on the Schengen Information System, Decision establishing the Visa Information System, Europol and Eurojust agreement) as well as on the prospect of integrating in the Council Secretariat an intelligence capacity on all aspects of the terrorist threat. In March, the European Council also brought forward the <b>solidarity</b> <b>clause</b> thus anticipating the Constitutional Treaty...|$|E

While policy making is still under way, one of the options frequently mentioned is that of an increased cooperation with the Nordic countries. The article thus reviews the Nordic countries‘ security policies, especially in light of the recent revision of the EU‘s Lisbon Treaty, creating a <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Clause.</b> The article employs the Securitization theory presented by Ole Wæver and the Copenhagen School in international relations toshed a lighton the Nordic countries‘ different approaches to security. The security and defence policies of the four Nordic countries are analyzed, but for Iceland speeches of the Minister for Foreign Affairs are used, as no formal {{security policy}} exists. The article concludes that the Nordic countries are likely to continue their cooperation with NATO and the EU, although Norway, Sweden and Finland may, in particular, benefit from increased Nordic cooperation. Iceland‘s security interests are not likely to be served by increased Nordic cooperation, such as that proposed by the Stoltenberg Report, as it would be more symbolic than practical.

40|$|Executive summary. CSDP: Strategy Needed. Why does Europe {{develop the}} {{military}} and civilian capabilities that it does? Why does it undertake {{the military and}} civilian operations that it does? And why in other cases does it refrain from action? The {{answers to these questions}} would amount to a civilian-military strategy for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Starting from the EU’s vital interests, an analysis of the threats and challenges to these interests, and the EU’s foreign policy priorities, a CSDP strategy would outline the priority regions and issues for CSDP and, in function of the long-term political objectives and the appropriate political roadmap for those regions and issues, scenarios in which launching an operation could be appropriate. Without strategy, we can never be sure that the operations that we do are actually the most relevant and important that we could undertake. We cannot direct the operations that we do undertake to achieve the desired strategic effect. And we cannot focus capability development if we do not know our strategic priorities. Many of the building-blocks of a CSDP strategy already exist. What remains to be done is to connect the dots and render explicit: (1) for which priority regions and issues we must plan and prepare, (2) for which possible scenarios that may require a CSDP operation, and (3) identify the implications for our capabilities and a roadmap to meet those requirements. Priority Regions and Issues. The regions and issues on which CSDP ought to focus are those where our vital interests are most directly at stake: • Defence against any military threat to the territory of the Union. • Open lines of communication and trade (in physical as well as in cyber space). • A secure supply of energy and other vital natural resources. • A sustainable environment. • Manageable migration flows. • The maintenance of international law (including the UN Charter and the treaties and regulations of the key international organizations) and of universally agreed rights. • Preserving the autonomy of the decision-making of the EU and its Member States. That {{does not mean that the}} EU will disregard other regions and issues, but it does provide the focus for early warning and prevention, and for permanent contingency planning for: • The Eastern Neighbourhood (the Baltic to the Black Sea). • The Southern Neighbourhood (the Dardanelles to Gibraltar). • The Gulf. • Central Asia. • Sub-Sahara Africa. • Maritime security. • Collective security under the UN, notably the Responsibility to Protect. If the main focus of CSDP is on the external security of the Union, it does have a complementary role to play in our internal security as well, notably in the implementation of the <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Clause,</b> and including perhaps, in the future, in our collective defence. Scenarios for Operations. For the purpose of military planning, as well as to guide military capability development, the EU military bodies have elaborated five illustrative scenarios. These no longer cover all operations that the EU already is undertaking. Five new scenarios ought to be added: • A Maritime Security Scenario. • A Cyber Security Scenario. • A Support Operations Scenario. • A Counter-Terrorism Scenario. • An Internal Security Scenario. Capability Implications. In order to stay in tune with today’s higher level of crisis management activity, the existing military Headline Goal has to be interpreted broadly. The aim to be able to sustain a corps level deployment (50 to 60, 000 troops) for at least one year should be understood as a deployment which EU Member States must be able to undertake at any one time over and above ongoing operations. Then the EU would be able to deal with every eventuality. Generating the necessary capabilities requires an ambitious approach to pooling & sharing, but also to go beyond it and create a Permanent Capability Conference as a durable strategic-level platform for harmonization of national defence planning as such, rather than project-by-project coordination only. With regard to civilian capabilities, achieving the original civilian Headline Goal would already constitute a significant improvement, but there is a lack of implementation and follow-through by the Member States. If decentralised civilian capacity-building does not work, the EU should have recourse to sizeable standby pools of civilian personnel which are pre-identified, trained, and ready for deployment. There is scope for combining military and civilian capability development in at least five areas: communications, information, transport, protection and logistics. The EU could be the first to create a permanent civilian-military Operational Headquarters (OHQ), in Brussels, which could plan for and conduct both civilian and military operations and, allowing for close interaction with all relevant EU actors, could implement a truly comprehensive approach to crisis management. Information gathering, analysis and dissemination are strategic enablers for any military or civilian operation or mission. A real Intelligence Fusion and Analysis Centre should replace the scattered poles of intelligence within the EU institutions. From Strategy to Action. Adopting a strategy for CSDP will not in itself guarantee resolute action in each and every crisis. But forging a consensus on priority regions and issues and drawing the conclusions from that for our capabilities, including planning and conduct, will focus our preventive, long-term efforts, and will certainly make us better prepared for action in any contingency. Being more prepared and knowing in advance what our priority regions and issues are, and why, will then hopefully also strengthen the political will to generate action under the EU flag by the able and willing Member States, and will thus make for an EU that carries its weight on the global stage...|$|E
