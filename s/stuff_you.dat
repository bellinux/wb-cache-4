500|$|... "There is {{this one}} scene when the {{director}} cuts from Zeenat (Gul Panag) trying to fix her house literally from the outside, perched on a ladder, with a hammer in hand, to Meera (Ayesha Takia) inside the house and behind a veil. The play of such visual metaphors throughout gives the film a world-class feel, the kind of <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> usually see in Iranian cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{motion picture}} censors asked for further cuts. [...] Derogatory {{references}} to Mexicans were removed, as was an off-color {{joke about the}} effects of exposure to radioactive substances ("Is it true if you fool around with that <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> don't like girls anymore?" [...] "Not that I've noticed"), and one about politics ("I got it confidential−we're makin' the front ends of horses. We ship 'em to Washington to hook on to the other end.") ...|$|E

500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Hubert Selby, Jr., saw no reason the content in their works couldn't translate well to rock and roll music. An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed {{said in an interview that}} he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious". [...] "That's the kind of <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> might read. Why wouldn't you listen to it? You have the fun of reading that, and you get the fun of rock on top of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording that we really do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E
500|$|According to Jean, the episode's table read went [...] "great" [...] {{until the}} third act. The Simpsons writers found the third act [...] "pretty challenging" [...] to write, because by having Homer's jaws wired shut, they [...] "took [...] funniest character" [...] and [...] "remove comedy." [...] In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Selman {{described it as}} [...] "It's the comedy of saying: 'Oh, he [...] can't do all the <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> want him to do'." [...] It was also hard to [...] "keep the story moving" [...] back to normal, since they kept having to [...] "re-use the premise". The episode features American comedian John Kassir {{as one of the}} dogs in the gay pride parade {{in the beginning of the}} episode. Barbara Walters and Star Jones, the hosts of The View, were portrayed by American voice-actor Tress MacNeille. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean stated that MacNeille is [...] "very versatile". Lisa Ling and Joy Behar were portrayed by voice-actor Pamela Hayden.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{accounting}} for tastes," [...] remarked the Pumpkinhead, with a sigh. [...] "An old crow {{once told me}} I was very fascinating, {{but of course the}} bird might have been mistaken. Yet I have noticed that the crows usually avoid the Scarecrow, who is a very honest fellow, in his way, but stuffed. I am not <b>stuffed,</b> <b>you</b> will observe; my body is good solid hickory." ...|$|R

500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} the album's {{production}} was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating [...] "The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but they turned the album into this dancey electro-pop. A lot of it had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, {{not only did they}} change the music, they changed it into something [...] I couldn't relate.'" [...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap. They cooked up some electronic <b>stuff,</b> <b>you</b> know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Darabont wrote a 60-page pilot {{script for}} [...] "Days Gone Bye". His initial script for the episode was split {{in half and}} embellished. Darabont {{explained}} that he did this to [...] "slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven <b>stuff.</b> <b>You</b> really want to drag these characters into the equation." [...] Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene. Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. [...] "Reading that pilot was just a revelation. It's extremely faithful. There {{are things that are}} so much like the comic, I can't really remember the nuance of what's different and what's not from the comic. He's definitely being more faithful than I expected, and everything that he's changing is brilliant. I couldn't be happier. I think the fans of the book are going to just love it." [...] The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series.|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E

Why, for {{what do you suppose}} the devils have been feeding us up in this kind of style for during the last three days, unless it were for {{something}} that you are too much frightened at to talk about? Look at that Kory-Kory there!—has he not been <b>stuffing</b> <b>you</b> with his confounded mushes, just in the way they treat swine before they kill them? Depend upon it, we will be eaten this blessed night, and there is the fire we shall be roasted by.” ...|$|R
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|Still {{hoping to}} work on Cheers, Mirkin sent a spec script of an episode of Taxi to Cheers writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs. The two {{approved}} and offered Mirkin a freelance job writing one of the final nine episodes of the show's first season, pending their commissioning by NBC. The episodes were commissioned, but Mirkin's agent rejected the Cheers job without telling his client, failing to see why Mirkin would want {{to work on}} {{what was then the}} lowest-rated comedy on television. Mirkin sacked the agent and signed on with Robb Rothman. Rothman knew Dan Wilcox, the executive producer of Newhart, which like Cheers was more character-focused. Rothman persuaded Wilcox to hire Mirkin. Mirkin wrote a freelance script and in 1984 beat seven other writers to a staff position on the series. He served as a writer and supervising story editor, before being promoted to executive producer and showrunner after one and a half years. Mirkin [...] "felt [...] was where I belonged. I'd finally come to a place in my life where everything I'd ever wanted had come together." [...] In 1987, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Newhart. It was the first nomination the show had received in that category and for the first episode Mirkin wrote as the series' showrunner. Mirkin directed several of the Newhart episodes he wrote because he saw directing as [...] "a means of protecting the writing". A philosophy he carried into his later work, Mirkin felt that [...] "being the head writer... was not enough; you had to see the material through its execution– especially the weirder <b>stuff.</b> <b>You</b> had to be right there to make sure every sick idea didn't lose any disturbing nuance." [...] Mirkin left Newhart in 1988, desiring to work on a single-camera sitcom.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking on the duo's impact, Hines {{stated that}} he felt [...] "what we were doing brought a twist to the game without {{watering}} anything down.

2500|$|Flair {{has made}} {{numerous}} appearances in television shows. In 1996, Flair, {{along with other}} WCW wrestlers, appeared in an episode of Baywatch as themselves. In 2013, Flair made an appearance in, <b>Stuff</b> <b>You</b> Should Know, in the episode, [...] "Bacteriopolis", as Dr. Roland Grayson. In 2014, Flair voiced himself in the animated series, Uncle Grandpa, in the episode, [...] "History of Wrestling".|$|E
