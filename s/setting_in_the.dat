5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava {{in the early to}} mid-2000s, the city was a <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed in the city and suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E

5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures.

Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Many astronomical {{alignments}} {{have been}} claimed for Stonehenge, {{a complex of}} megaliths and earthworks in the Salisbury Plain of England.

5|$|Events {{come to a}} {{head when}} Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses the protagonist of being {{involved}} in the murders. Nanako is kidnapped during the protagonist's interrogation, leading Ryotaro to engage in a vehicular pursuit with the culprit. The chase ends as they both crash; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set in his truck, and the gravely-injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group. The group tracks them down within the TV world; the culprit, Taro Namatame, becomes a god-like monster—Kunino-sagiri—which attacks them but is defeated, and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital. When Nanako appears to die, the group furiously confronts Namatame; as the protagonist, the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by pointing out the lack of a proper motive, and subsequently work to determine that Ryotaro's assistant, Tohru Adachi, is the true killer. Failure to do so ends the game with the party unable to solve the case; Nanako either remaining dead, or reviving but remaining hospitalised; and the recurring fog permanently <b>setting</b> <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> last of which will eventually lead to humanity's demise.|$|E
5|$|Halo 4 {{takes place}} in a futuristic science fiction <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3. Backstory details that {{hundreds}} of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations on a planet, which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the}} idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and <b>setting.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E
