2500|$|Amina and <b>Sarah</b> <b>Said</b> {{were the}} {{children}} of Egyptian immigrant Yaser Abdel Said and American Patricia [...] "Tissie" [...] Owens. Both girls were born in Dallas, Texas, Amina on March 2, 1989, and Sarah on March 16, 1990. The girls were found {{shot to death in}} a taxi at the Omni Mandalay Hotel in Irving, Texas, on January 1, 2008. Both girls had left their home in Lewisville, Texas, earlier that evening, with their father Yaser Said. At 7:33 pm CT a call came into the Irving Police Department’s 911 call center. The call was from <b>Sarah</b> <b>Said.</b> She had been shot nine times and told the operator, “My dad shot me and my sister. I’m dying!” Their mother, Patricia Said, claims that both girls were killed for having non-Muslim boyfriends. Death threats had been made by Yaser against the girls. They ran away and were safe, but their mother brought them back. Yaser Said is still at large, as a FBI Top Ten Fugitive, at the present time the FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Said has been featured on America's Most Wanted as well as on a Fox News special about honor killings in America; he is also the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.

2500|$|When {{brought before}} Pharaoh, <b>Sarah</b> <b>said</b> that Abram was her brother, {{and the king}} thereupon {{bestowed}} upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. [...] As a token of his love for Sarai the king deeded his entire property to her, and gave her the land of Goshen as her hereditary possession: for this reason the Israelites subsequently lived in that land. Sarai prayed to God to deliver her from the king, and He thereupon sent an angel, who struck Pharaoh whenever he attempted to touch her. Pharaoh was so astonished at these blows that he spoke kindly to Sarai, who confessed that she was Abraham's wife. The king then ceased to annoy her. According to another version, Pharaoh persisted in annoying her after {{she had told him}} that she was a married woman; thereupon the angel struck him so violently that he became ill, and was thereby prevented from continuing to trouble her. According to one tradition it was when Pharaoh saw these miracles wrought in Sarai's behalf that he gave her his daughter Hagar as slave, saying: [...] "It is better that my daughter should be a slave in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house." [...] Abimelech acted likewise. Sarah is the sister of Abram by another mother and wife of Abram as described in the Hebrew Bible (the Book of Genesis). In Genesis 17:15, God changes her name to Sarah (princess) ("a woman of high rank") as part of the covenant with El Shaddai after Hagar bears Abram his first born son Ishmael. The name Sarai uses the semitic root Šarai or law and like El has the sense of power, authority, lord, deity, natural law, law as might be expected for the lady of the house. The Hebrew name Sarah indicates a woman of high rank (less than that of 1st wife) and is sometimes translated as [...] "princess." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Stars, Debbie Foy refers to Tony as having lived through several {{dramatic}} episodes. Foy {{went on to}} describe Tony as being famous for his [...] "many on-screen relationships, affairs and engagements" [...] but always has plenty of heartache. The Daily Star described Tony as going [...] "through more women than he’s served hot meals in his restaurant Gnosh" [...] before adding {{that he is a}} [...] "loser-in-love". They commented that after dumping Cindy [...] "this time he’s only got himself to blame". On the character Sky said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson is our fave character on the show. Probably because he's been on it the whole time since it started in 1995". An Inside Soap critic responded negatively to a plot centring on Tony catering for the college ball saying [...] "Just who do the Hollyoaks writers think they are catering for with a plot like this? Do us a favour and serve up something decent!" [...] The Liverpool Echos Caroline Corcoran reviewed Hollyoaks: Movin' On saying the spinoff provided [...] "an insight in to Tony's character that we don't get in Hollyoaks, and I actually found myself feeling for a character that is normally written to be deliberately irritating". Another critic for Inside Soap felt Hollyoaks was back to a high standard before adding that [...] "Tony Hutchinson has been on fine comedy form following the disastrous transformation of his garden by 'Charlie Dimmock'". Inside Soaps Lucy said that [...] "You've got to feel sorry for Hollyoaks's Tony Hutchinson ... Give the man a break!" [...] Following Tony's relationship with Mandy becoming troubled. Lucy's colleague Sam also reviewed the storyline saying: [...] "Feel sorry for Tony? Oh get over it! He deserves everything he's got coming to him. What is Mandy doing with him anyway? He's far too old, a total fuddy duddy, and has had the same naff hairstyle for seven years!" [...] While reflecting on [...] "some of soap's more memorable business ideas", an Inside Soap writer, on Tony's business ideas, said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson, {{is not so much the}} king of money-making schemes - more of an old skin-flint ... he came up with the idea of recycling all his guest's used water ... When his recycling racket was discovered, his claims that it was just an innovative method of being environmentally friendly wouldn't wash - we all knew it was just his cheap-skate way of reducing his water bill! However, to this day his roses continue to bloom strangely well". Inside Soap critic Sam expressed disinterest in a storyline in which Tony and Ruth kiss, questioning if they have [...] "gone back in time or something?" [...] Merle Brown of the Daily Record bemoaned the lack of realism in Tony's storylines saying: [...] "why on earth would Izzy go out with Tony? Yes, she's slightly irritating, but in the real world would a man like Tony honestly have a constant stream of girlfriends?" [...] Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail felt that [...] "Asking Tony for guidance is the equivalent of asking the obese for dieting tips, such a fat lot of good he is". Stephens later said Tony has [...] "enjoyed the company of as many women as Hugh Hefner".

6000|$|It begins {{indeed to}} look as if I were writing this {{narrative}} upside down, for I have said nothing about children. Perhaps one reason for this omission is that I did not really appreciate them, that I found it impossible to take the same minute interest in them as Tom, for instance, who was, apparently, not content alone with the six which he possessed, but had adopted mine. One of them, little <b>Sarah,</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] before [...] "Father." [...] I do not mean to say that I had not occasional moments of tenderness toward them, but they were out of my thoughts much of the time. I have often wondered, since, how they regarded me; how, in their little minds, they defined the relationship. Generally, when I arrived home in the evening I liked to sit down before my study fire and read the afternoon newspapers or a magazine; but occasionally I went at once to the nursery for a few moments, to survey with complacency the medley of toys on the floor, and to kiss all three. They received my caresses with a certain shyness--the two younger ones, at least, as though they were at a loss to place me as a factor in the establishment. They tumbled over each other to greet Maude, and even Tom. If I were an enigma to them, what must they have thought of him? Sometimes I would discover him on the nursery floor, with one or two of his own children, building towers and castles and railroad stations, or forts to be attacked and demolished by regiments of lead soldiers. He was growing comfortable-looking, if not exactly stout; prematurely paternal, oddly willing to renounce the fiercer joys of life, the joys of acquisition, of conquest, of youth.|$|E
