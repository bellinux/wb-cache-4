For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001). Equation (2) is useful for processes where <b>system</b> <b>volume,</b> entropy, and number of moles of various components change because internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.|$|E

2500|$|It may {{be noted}} that railgun {{velocities}} generally fall {{within the range of}} those achievable by two-stage light-gas guns; however, the latter are generally only considered to be suitable for laboratory use while railguns are judged to offer some potential prospects for development as military weapons. Another light gas gun, the Combustion Light Gas Gun in a 155mm prototype form was projected to achieve 2500m/s with a [...]70 caliber barrel. In some hypervelocity research projects, projectiles are [...] "pre-injected" [...] into railguns, to avoid the need for a standing start, and both two-stage light-gas guns and conventional powder guns have been used for this role. In principle, if railgun power supply technology can be developed to provide safe, compact, reliable, combat survivable, and lightweight units, then the total <b>system</b> <b>volume</b> and mass needed to accommodate such a power supply and its primary fuel can become less than the required total volume and mass for a mission equivalent quantity of conventional propellants and explosive ammunition. Arguably such technology has been matured with the introduction of the EMALS aircraft launch system (albeit that railguns require much higher system powers, because roughly similar energies must be delivered in a few milliseconds, as opposed to a few seconds) [...] Such a development would then convey a further military advantage in that the elimination of explosives from any military weapons platform will decrease its vulnerability to enemy fire.|$|E

The Verge {{felt that}} the Priv's design was [...] "quite good", noting that the thinness of the device's two halves averted it from feeling [...] "top-heavy" [...] when its keyboard was in use. The Wall Street Journal described the frame and curved screen as being [...] "a pleasure to hold and look at." [...] Ars Technica was critical of the device's overall build quality, with its back cover described as feeling [...] "spongy" [...] its sliding mechanism described as being [...] "scratchy" [...] and [...] "friction-filled", while its curved screen was considered a [...] "rather useless gimmick" [...] that was inappropriate for the device's target market. Ars Technica also panned the hardware mute button for being [...] "counterintuitive", as it does not mute the device unless it is already playing audio, otherwise triggering the <b>system</b> <b>volume</b> controls. The hardware keyboard received mixed reviews. The Wall Street Journal described the keyboard as being the [...] "smartphone equivalent of a Colonial butter churn", noting that, although it was faster to type on in comparison to virtual keyboards, the BlackBerry Classic had a larger and wider keyboard. Ars Technica felt it was [...] "unpleasant" [...] to use due to its size, flat keys and how it interacts with the OS.

2500|$|Manual {{removal of}} a rootkit is often too {{difficult}} for a typical computer user, {{but a number of}} security-software vendors offer tools to automatically detect and remove some rootkits, typically as part of an antivirus suite. , Microsoft's monthly Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool is able to detect and remove some classes of rootkits. [...] Also, Windows Defender Offline can remove rootkits, as it runs from a trusted environment before the operating system starts. [...] Some antivirus scanners can bypass file system APIs, which are vulnerable to manipulation by a rootkit. Instead, they access raw filesystem structures directly, and use this information to validate the results from the system APIs to identify any differences that may be caused by a rootkit. There are experts who believe that the only reliable way to remove them is to re-install the operating system from trusted media. This is because antivirus and malware removal tools running on an untrusted system may be ineffective against well-written kernel-mode rootkits. Booting an alternative operating system from trusted media can allow an infected <b>system</b> <b>volume</b> to be mounted and potentially safely cleaned and critical data to be copied off—or, alternatively, a forensic examination performed. Lightweight operating systems such as Windows PE, Windows Recovery Console, Windows Recovery Environment, BartPE, or Live Distros can be used for this purpose, allowing the system to be [...] "cleaned". Even if the type and nature of a rootkit is known, manual repair may be impractical, while re-installing the operating system and applications is safer, simpler and quicker.|$|E
