Neste trabalho foram estudadas a composicao floristica e a estrutura fitossociologica destas sinasias em uma floresta arenosa (restinga) da Planicie Costeira do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. Os dados fitossociologicos foram obtidos em 30 parcelas de 2 x 2 m. Em cads parcela anotou-se a presenca e a altura maxima das especies herbaceas e arbutivas, e a cobertura foi estimada pela escala de Causton. A composicao floristica total da area compreende 61 especies, 52 generos e 33 familias. As familias que apresentaram mais de duas especies foram: Poaceae, Commelinaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae, Rubiaceae e Asteraceae.

40|$|ABSTRACT The phytosociological {{structure}} of upper montane grasslands (high altitude grasslands) was studied in six subranges of Serra do Mar. Throughout 324 (1 m 2) plot samples, we identified 195 taxa out of 280 taxa previously {{found in a}} floristic survey. Besides the general analysis of these communities, five physiognomies (<b>synusiae)</b> of these grasslands were previously determined based upon the species with greater cover. Cryptangium triquetrum and Croton mullerianus had the highest phytosociological importance value among the upper montane grasslands sampled in the present study. The first species {{was the most important}} of the grassy physiognomy of all sampled subranges and the second one of the shrubby physiognomy within three subranges. Chusquea pinifolia, Machaerina austrobrasiliensis, Deschampsia caespitosa, Gleichenella pectitata, Tibouchina dubia, Xyris stenophylla, Eryngium koehnearum and Eriochrysis holcoides were also structurally important. Although considerable species richness has been observed, the dominance of one or few species in the community was common in all subranges and physiognomies. In a brief comparison with upper montane vegetation studies (mainly on rocky outcrops) carried out in Southeastern Brazil, a low sharing of species was verified. Furthermore, the scarcity of studies in the literature regarding floristic and sociological {{structure of}} upper montane grasslands hampers a deeper analysis at level of species...|$|R

We investigatedspecies composition and <b>synusia</b> structure. ANOVA was used to test for differences in characteristic parameters among bryophyte communities, and Sørensen similarity coefficients were used to measure variation in β diversity. Plantations had higher bryophyte species richness than the primary forest, and the young plantation (0. 05) among plantations, but the composition of dominant and subdominant species differed. Common species in both primary and plantation forests included photophilic and drought-tolerant species, and the 4 -year old plantation and primary forest shared the highest number of common species (19 species). Twenty-four bryophyte species dwelling in primary forest, except Rhytidium rugosum, were shared among the primary forest and plantations, and species turnover rate (0. 24 – 0. 60) was increasing with stand age, indicating that species replacement occurred. Our results suggested that ground disturbance during clear cutting and reforestation should be reduced in order to restoration of species in later successional stage. In addition, suitable thinning application in the 16 – 20 -year-old plantations may be useful when the bryophyte species richness begin to decline...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the ecology of small mammals in forest {{ecosystems}} of Moravia (Czech Republic). Data were obtained in the period 2002 - 2013. The monitored habitats were at different altitudes, of diverse forest composition, under various methods of management and {{at different stages of}} succession. The localities were situated in lowland forests of rural landscape in southern Moravia and in upland forests of Jeseníky Mts. and Beskydy Mts. During the research, small ground mammals were captured with snap traps. Captured animals were classified according to species, measured, and weighed. The stomachs were removed and stored for subsequent ingested food analysis by NIRS. Saplings on forest plantations were monitored for damage caused by small mammals. At locations of interest in southern Moravia and in the Beskids, seed-mast crop of main broadleaved species was being detected there. In the evaluation of the obtained data, the diversity of small mammals <b>synusias</b> was monitored at sites in lowland and upland forest ecosystems. Habitat preferences of individual species were examined too. In the most abundant species, changes in the population dynamics during monitored period were detected.

40|$|In {{this report}} the author’s {{attention}} is focused on the role and position of the phytocenosis in the ecosystem and the importance of phytoceno- logical investigations for the ecological, zoocenological and microbioceno- logical researches, and for the complex (teamwork) research of the ecosystem. The vegetable kingdom, as the only transformator of solar energy and the only of organic matter on the earth, constitutes a primarly, basic component not only of the biosphere, but also of every concrete biogeocenosis (ecosystem) on the earth. All the components of biosphere and particular ecosystems are, however, linked together with interrelations of conditionality and constant dependence (phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenosis and the biotope) in the unique process of matter and energy circulation. Thanks to this circulation, the survival and permanent regeneration of the ecosysten as a unique whole and of each of its components are made possible. Therefore, the true and complete ecological reality on the earth are only the biosphere and biogeocenosis (ecosystem), and not the phytosphere, phytocenosis and other components. When the position and role of one of the ecosystem components is separately determined, {{this does not mean that}} other components are underrated or that this is done by a conscious phylosophical or practical (research) dismemberment of the ecosystem, but that this is a methodically justified and necessary analysis of the significance of each of individual components for other components and the ecosystem as a whole. This may undoubtedly be useful not only in specialized (phytocenological, zoocenological, microbio- cenological) investigations, but also in complex investigations of the ecosystem. In addition to its basic and primary role in the metabolism of the ecosystem, the phytocenosis also represents a structurally most organized, most complex, most stable and most durable component of the ecosystem. As such, it constitutes its basis not only as regards the metabolism and structure but also the dynamics and succession. The vertical and horizontal differentiation of the ecosystem is to a large measure determined by the differentiation of the phytomass and the whole structure of the phytocenosis. Thus, for instance, the phytocenosis strata constitute the basis of biogeocenotic <b>synusiae</b> (Sukachev), that is, the basic structural parts of the ecosystem. But these may by further differentiated into biogeocenotic horizonts on the basis of animal and microbic species, groups and communities (Bjalovic). The time (seasonal and many-year) structure of phytocenosis and their historical successive development represent the basis for the dynamic and succession of zoo- and microbiocenoses and biotope, despite the phytocenosis dependence on other ecosystem components which obey their own laws of development and variability. As indicators of general climate, microclimate, phytoclimate and soil climate, and of other conditions of the biotope, the plant species, their cenotic groups (<b>synusiae,</b> micro- and macrocenotic complexes) and whole phytocenoses, may help analyze and differentiate the biocenosis and biotope. The bounderies of phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenoses often do not coincide, because the animal species and microorganisms and their communities are more variable and dynamic and with different manners of life and different reaction norms than the plant species and communities. In spite of this, a phytocenosis, (association) may serve as a basis for singling out, analyzing and classifying biogeocenoses, and provided that a teamwork system is employed in biocenotical investigations of concrete biogeocenoses, each particular case by itself may be solved, and in this way unique biogeocenotic types may gradually be formed. Investigations made no for by the local and foreign researches are eharakterized, on the one hand, by a very limited utilization of the results of phytocenological investigations, and on the other, by an insufficient collaboration of ecologists of different specialities in the complex study of ecosystem. And this is the task of the contemporary biocenology...|$|R

In this forest, {{the presence of the}} Delphinium simonkaianum Pawł. var. psilocarpum (Simk.) Pawł species, a threatened endemic taxon, was reported in 1953. In 2011, this globally threatened taxon was identified, after 58 years, on the upper side of the Copăcel slope, in a mixed oak and hornbeam forest. These oak and hornbeam mixtures are the result of impacts exerted on oak forests. The identified association, Melampyro bihariensis-Carpinetum (Borza 1941) Soó 1964 em.

40|$|Ecobiogeographical {{research}} of desiccation tolerant non-lichenized fungi from the phylum Ascomycota in the Croatian forest ecosystems has started in 2010. It is mainly focused on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), a tree species that {{plays an important}} economic role. Desiccation tolerant (xerotolerant) fungi are taxonomically and ecologically very poorly known ecological group of fungi. They live in aerophytic <b>synusia</b> (dead branches and bark still attached to plant individual) extremely exposed to atmospheric and cosmic influence. These fungi normally survive complete loss of their chemically unbound water and are capable to continue with all their metabolic functions after rehydration. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore biodiversity of desiccation tolerant fungi on pedunculate oak and to determine their possible bioindication value since their ecology is very similar to lichens that are already proved to be excellent bioindicators (e. g. for detection of air pollution and other anthropogenic influence, overall habitat quality assessment etc.). The present research is performed both in the field on the selected plots (sampling) and in the laboratory where morphological, cytological, histological, ecological and biostatistical methods are applied. Quantitative biodiversity analysis will be conducted by determining species-area relationships and spatial modelling of biodiversity parameters as a function of environmental variables. Preliminary results based on 6 plots on selected locality show relatively high biodiversity of fungi with 40 identified species from overall 760 collections.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} the occurrence of epigeic moss assemblages in different grasslands and the microhabitats (pits, dolines, brooks and mounds) occurring in a karst, almost flat basin. The bryophytes tend to form specific synusiae in grassland communities that cover particular microhabitats differentiated on the basis of microtopography. Except for pits and mounds, all other microhabitats are clearly distinguishable in terms of bryophyte composition. The most discriminant species between the moss synusiae of dolines, brooks and pits are Drepanocladus aduncus, Fontinalis antipyretica and Polytrichum commune, respectively. The mounds have no differential species and are poorly distinguished from pits based only on the low cover of Polytrichum commune. A combined soil acidity-moisture gradient determined by both land microtopography and surface water runoff is responsible for the good compositional distinctiveness of dolines and brooks from pits and mounds. A relatively broad section of this gradient is occupied by the niche of Calliergonella cuspidata, which could be the indicator of a different <b>synusia</b> occurring in microhabitats with ecological conditions intermediate between dolines and brooks. A weaker gradient of soil organic matter content accounts for the distinction of pits from dolines and brooks in the species multidimensional space. Overall, there is a good Agreement between the structure of epigeic bryophyte assemblages and the corresponding type of vascular plant communities developed in the same karst habitat, which supports the hypothesis of their dependence and the methodological approach of integrated releve´s in phytocoenosis sampling...|$|E
40|$|Ephemeral {{plants in}} the {{southern}} part of Gurbantunggut Desert were systematically monitored from 2002 to 2004 and the meteorological data and soil moisture during the same period were analyzed. The results show that the ephemeral plants germination and growth are sensitive to the changes of water and heat condition. The time for daily temperature over 0 degrees C in early spring in 2003 was delayed nearly 10 d compared with that in 2002, while the soil water changed little in the same period. Observation showed that there were 28 ephemeral species germinated in 2002, their life period was about 70 d in spring, and the maximum cover of ephemeral <b>synusia</b> reached 46. 4 %. However, only 17 ephemeral species germinated in 2003, their life period was about 50 d in spring, and their maximum cover was only 20. 8 %. The height of ephemeral plants was significantly higher in 2002 than that in 2003. It can be seen that ephemeral plant germination and growth in spring are strongly dependent on temperature. The changes of water conditions can affect ephemerals germination and growth as well. Because no heavy precipitation occurred during summer in 2002, only a few ephemerophytes were observed in autumn after ephemerals completed their life circle in early spring. However, about 60 mm precipitation was recorded from July to August both in 2003 and in 2004. Some ephemerals such as Erodium oxyrrhynchum and Carex physodes, etc. covered the dune surface rapidly with a cover > 10 %. Therefore, the ephemerals not only germinate in autumn after the early spring, some species may germinate in summer if adequate rainfall occurs. The study on responses of ephemerals growth to water and heat conditions not only has a certain ecological significance but also contributes a better understanding to the effect of climate changes on the desert surface stability...|$|E
40|$|The aim is {{to reveal}} {{theoretically}} possible productivity of pasture phytocenosis on meadow-chestnut soils in protected area of Terek-Kuma Lowland. Methods. To determine {{the dynamics of the}} basic physical and chemical properties of soil, evaporation, humidity coefficient (HC) of the area, the productivity of phytocenoses and utilization factors of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Results. Highly productive ephemeral <b>synusia</b> (5 q/ha of air-dry weight) is formed in years with precipitation of 80 - 85 mm during April - May at a relative humidity of 70 - 73 %, with evaporation of 130 - 140 mm, humidity coefficient of 0. 30, and integral of moisture of 29. 8. Decreasing precipitation amount in the same period to 25 - 26 mm, the relative humidity to 61 %, humidity coefficient to 0. 06, evaporation to 200 - 202 mm form an integral of aridity of 37. 3, where the 0 - 24 cm Cl ion content in the soil increase to 5. 56 mgEq/ 100 g, the yield of a biomass is reduced to 1. 0 q/ha. Increase of 102 mm in rainfall in July – August period results in humidity coefficient increase - 0. 21, decrease of Cl- content in horizons of А+В to 1. 40 mg-eq. / 100 g. Productivity of grasses and saltwort increases to 21. 1 q/ha. The utilization factor of PAR by phytocenosis makes up 0, 023 - 0, 033 (21. 4 % share of ephemera, herbs and saltwort make up 78. 6 %) and had little effect on productivity of phytocenosis. Main conclusion. The formation of a biomass in the meadow-chestnut soil {{is the result of the}} combined effects of the amount of rainfall, evaporation, humidity coefficient, the degree and the chemistry of soil salinity. Were calculated multiple regression equations expressing the relationship between these factors. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhytobase is a {{relational}} {{database management system}} devoted to the management of vegetation survey data, following the concepts of the integrated synusial phytosociology. This 4 D application has been developed from the 1990 s and applied to various ecosystems (wood-pastures, forests, floodplains, wetlands and grasslands) in various regions, mostly in Switzerland and in France. Integrated synusial phytosociology considers that vegetation is organized in nested hierarchical levels, each of them being potentially described in a typological and classification system. The first, finest, level is the <b>synusia,</b> a concrete plant community composed of plant species co-occurring in a local similar environment, with comparable size and habitat use. Phytobase distinguishes three categories of synusiae, i. e. tree, shrub, herb and moss synusiae, classified into elementary syntaxa. They are eventually integrated into phytocoenoses, the second level of vegetation description, based {{on a list of}} synusial syntaxa co-occurring in a given phytocoenosis, such as a forest stand with its different layers, sylvogenetic phases and dependent (e. g. epiphytic) communities. Phytocoenoses are classified into elementary coenotaxa according to their synusial composition. Higher organization levels (tesela/sigmataxa and catena/geosigmataxa) are included in Phytobase as well, but only used so far for floodplain vegetation. The classification of synusiae is based on Julve’s ‘baseveg’ system. An automatic diagnostic of plot records is implemented in Phytobase, including classification in Julve’s system, assignment to an elementary syntaxon, ecological indicator values (Landolt, Ellenberg, Julve), life forms, Grime’s CSR strategies, functional traits, taxonomic diversity indices, pastoral value, etc. Each elementary syntaxon or coenotaxon is described by the centroid of all plot records that were assigned to it, and Phytobase includes various diagnostics for species (or elementary syntaxon) fidelity (IndVal, Phi, etc.), compositional homogeneity and ecology. Phytobase is freely available from the Tela-botanica website ([URL] including a sample of relevés. It is used by more than two hundred registered users in Europe. The current version 8. 3 has a user interface in French language but an English version is planned to allow a broader diffusion to the international community of vegetation scientists...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the floristics, structure and spatial distribution of vascular epiphytes and ground herbs along an altitudinal gradient of the Atlantic Rainforest in the Serra da Prata mountain range (48 ‹ 41 ' 59. 39 "W, 25 ‹ 36 ' 46. 39 "S), Parana State, and to explore the existence of relationships among these elements and the environmental variation along the gradient. The study area has 6. 3 hectares between 400 and 1, 100 m a. s. l. The epiphytic component was quantified using 120 phorophytes with diameters around 35 cm with canopy crowns distributed equally at 400, 600, 800 and 1, 000 m of altitude. The phorophytes were divided into six vertical zones. Dominance and coverage estimates of the epiphytes were taken for each zone. The data collection on the herbaceous <b>synusia</b> was done using 716 quadrats of 1 x 1 m placed continually in rows 2 m wide with variable length in the altitudes 500 m (208 m 2), 700 m (108 m 2), 800 m (200 m 2) e 1, 100 m (200 m 2). The maximum height {{and the percentage of}} coverage of all rooted herbaceous species in the quadrats were registered. To evaluate the climatic aspects two temperature and air moisture recorders were installed at 400 and 1, 000 m a. s. l. Daily data was obtained from July, 2009, until June, 2010. In total, 277 species and 30 families of vascular epiphytes were recorded. Orchidaceae included 103 species, followed by Bromeliaceae (37) and Polypodiaceae (28). The Shannon index was 4. 96 nats. ind- 1. Only 19. 5 % of the epiphytes occurred in all altitudes. Bromeliaceae had the greater structural importance along the slope. The most frequent species were Philodendron loefgrenii and Serpocaulon catharinae. Vriesea altodaserrae presented the greater structural importance in altitudes above 800 m. The most important species at 400 and 600 m a. s. l. were Aechmea organensis, Vriesea vagans and Vriesea philippocoburgii. It were recorded 158 species and 49 families of ground herbs. Dryopteridaceae included 11 species, followed by Araceae (10) and Orchidaceae (10). The Shannon index was 3. 74 nats. ind- 1. Only eight species (5. 1 %) were registered in all altitudes. Dryopteridaceae and Araceae presented highest importance along the slope. Lastreopsis amplissima, Anthurium acutum and Pleurostachys distichophylla had greater structural importance at 800 and 1, 100 m a. s. l [...] Below 600 m Philodendron propinquum, Stigmatopteris heterocarpa, Lomagramma guianensis and Dichorisandra thyrsiflora were the most important. For both synusiae it was observed the existence of two distinct floristic associations (submontane and montane), transitioning between 600 and 800 m, coincidently with the altitudinal limit between two types of climate, differentiated by the mean temperature of the warmest month (. 22 o C. Cfa;. 22 o C. Cfb). The structural composition of the epiphytic community was very similar at 400 and 600 m a. s. l., with richness and dominance values statistically greater (Duncan Multiple Range Test, p > 0, 05) than the other altitudes. The steep topography of the higher altitudes generated a greater heterogeneity in the epiphytic structure due to its influence on the size and architecture of the phorophytes, resulting in structural differences between the 800 and 1, 000 m. The structure of the herbaceous community also presented relationship with the topography. The altitudes 700, 800 and 1, 100 m, all showing declivities higher than 60 %, presented coverage and richness values statistically equal (Duncan Multiple Range Test, p > 0, 05) among them, and different from the values observed at the 500 m, were the mean declivity is 32 %. Therefore, the temperature seems to affect directly the floristic and sociologic composition of the studied synusiae, while the topographic characteristics show greater relationships with the structural variation along the slope...|$|E
