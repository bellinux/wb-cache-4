5|$|There {{have been}} few {{accidents}} at Waterloo compared to other London terminal stations. On 21 August 1896, an engine leaving the locomotive yard overran its clearance point, colliding with a departing passenger train. Five passengers were injured. On 5 May 1904, a linesman accidentally stepped on a <b>signal</b> <b>wire.</b> This gave a false clear signal to a goods van, which collided with a passenger train, killing one, while on 25 October 1913, a collision between two passenger trains at Waterloo Junction killed three people.|$|E
25|$|The Führungsstelle or Kommandoturm ("command tower") was {{a shorter}} and rarer type of tower {{that served as}} the command centre of a border sector. It {{contained}} monitoring and control equipment to open border gates remotely, turn on and off fence lighting and alert lights, rotate searchlights and so on. Disturbances of the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> and detonations of SM-70 booby-trap mines would be detected by the command tower. The towers were topped with long-range radio antennae to communicate via R-105 radio to other units. A distinctive feature of this type of tower was the prominent air intake box at ground level.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment and 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment {{began moving}} {{forward to the}} front line, in {{preparation}} of {{the launch of the}} attack. Tanks which were assigned to a secondary role in the attack, moved toward the front lines to move into support positions. Before 09:00, the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment opened up with close-in mortar concentrations and sustained machine gun fire to prevent the Japanese from seeking protection next to the Marine lines. Just before the attack commenced, Japanese artillery began a counterbarrage which blasted the Marine lines, pounding the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment positions and the assembly areas of the assault battalions, with the extremely accurate fire threatening to force a halt to the attack plans. The value of the forward observers on the ridge was utilized to discover the location of the Japanese battery and counterbattery fire was requested. Communications were lost but the break in the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> was found and repaired.|$|E

2500|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 20 November, a small, [...] high ridge was discovered that would provide observation of the entire Empress Augusta Bay area and dominated the East–West Trail and the Piva Forks area. A platoon—under the command of First Lieutenant Steve J. Cibik—was ordered to occupy the ridge with detachments of signals and a section of heavy machine guns. The trek began with a struggle up the steep ridge late in {{the afternoon}}, with <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> being reeled out as the platoon climbed the ridge. Reaching the summit just before sunset, they set about establishing defensive positions, with machine guns sited along likely avenues of attack.|$|E

2500|$|At 4.30 am on 8 September {{the attack}} came, {{initially}} frontal, then a flank attack of 5,000 men cut off Potts' Brigade HQ battalion {{from the rest}} of the force. At times the enemy were just [...] from the edge of Potts' perimeter. The <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> had been cut by now, and communications with the battalions were shaky. A message got through by wireless transmitter, that if as seemed likely the HQ was wiped out, Major Anthony Caro, commander of 2/16th was to take command of the Brigade and fall back to Menari. Potts and his HQ were saved by the fact that Horii did not concentrate forces on eliminating them, instead maintaining overall pressure to try to annihilate all three battalions. 2/14th and 2/16th charged the Japanese lines but failed to break through to HQ. However the damage inflicted on the enemy was crucial in slowing their pursuit, as Potts made his way to Menari. He left orders for the battalions to make their own way and rejoin him there. As the Japanese controlled the main trail, all three battalions had to take rough secondary tracks or go cross country.|$|E

Each junction forms a switch and the junction has a functional dimension in nanometers. The <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> selectively {{has at least}} two different voltage states, ranging from a 0 state to a 1 state, wherein there is an asymmetry {{with respect to the}} direction of current flow from the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> through one junction compared to another junction such that current flowing through one junction into (out of) the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> can open (close) while current flowing through the other junction out of (into) the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> can close (open) the switch, and wherein there is a voltage threshold for switching between an open switch and a closed switch. Further, methods are provided for latching logic values onto nanowiresin a logic array, for inverting a logic value, and for restoring a voltage value of a signal in a nano-scale wire.

50|$|The {{output of}} most {{microphones}} is balanced {{to reduce the}} pickup of electrical noise, and therefore requires two <b>signal</b> <b>wires</b> and an earth per channel.

50|$|Another {{source of}} ground noise is also caused by unequal induced current. If a {{positive}} <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> and negative <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> travel different physical paths to the amplifier input then {{the differences in}} induced currents will arrive at the amplifier input terminals as differences which will be amplified. Thus {{it is imperative that}} the positive and negative signal wires are dressed out {{in such a way as}} to ensure that they both experience equal induction from outside sources. Two popular methods include using coaxial wire (both conductors have the same axis of rotation everywhere they exist, and thus have similar inductive experiences), and twisted pair where the two conductors have the same axis of rotation (but don't always exist in the same path).|$|E

50|$|A {{drawback}} to older electric action organs was {{the large amount}} of wiring required for operation.

5000|$|Twin lead is used {{to connect}} FM radios and {{television}} receivers with their antennas, {{although it has been}} largely replaced in the latter application by coaxial cable, and as a feedline for low power transmitters such as amateur radio transmitters. It consists of two wire conductors running parallel to each other with a precisely constant spacing, molded in polyethylene insulating material in a flat ribbon-like cable. The distance between the two wires is small relative to the wavelength of the RF signal carried on the wire. Furthermore, the RF current in one wire is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the RF current on the other wire (it is inverted). Thus, if both wires radiate energy equally, the radiated energies will cancel each other out and there will be near zero radiation at any distance from the wire. Twin lead is also immune to external noise or RF energies. Any unwanted external noise or unwanted RF energy induced on the wire from external energy sources will be induced in both wires {{at the same time and}} equally in magnitude and direction. At the end of the transmission line the inverted <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> is restored to normal (non-inverted now) and added back to the original non-inverted <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> by the receiving circuitry. Any noise will now be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and cancel itself out.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} remove {{noise in the}} broken <b>wire</b> <b>signal</b> of <b>wire</b> rope, a new {{denoising}} algorithm based on the correlation of inter scales wavelet coefficient was proposed. Because the wavelet coefficient of signal has strong correlation and the wavelet coefficient of noise does not has obvious correlation, {{in the process of}} calculating threshold, an inter scales correlation factor was constructed considering the part specialty of next scale on the same position after wavelet transform. The proposed factor can adaptively adjust threshold on the position of signal and noise, thereby otaining good denoising effect and holding the break information in original signal. The actual processing effect of simulation and damage <b>signal</b> of <b>wire</b> rope shows that the proposed method, compared with the classical threshold, not only effectively removes noise in original signal and improve the signal noise ratio(SNR),but also retains the break information of inspected damage <b>signal</b> of <b>wire</b> rope...|$|R
