5|$|In the 18th century Royal Navy, {{rank and}} {{position}} on board ship {{was defined by}} a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> between gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the delicate issue of high crime rates in a disadvantaged population, and explores {{the appropriateness of}} existing crime and violence prevention strategies. The paper reports on a collaborative research project carried out in a small Australian city in 2002 - 2003 by the local police service, Indigenous community members and a university. The project gathered information about the extent and nature of crime in the local Indigenous community, existing crime prevention initiatives and Indigenous community members&# 039; perceptions of these initiatives. The key points emerging from this project were: the persistence of <b>social</b> <b>divides</b> separating Indigenous populations and non-Indigenous {{institutions such as the}} police service; the impact of these divides on the effectiveness of crime prevention activities; and the importance of face-to-face relationship-building in overcoming these <b>social</b> <b>divides</b> and improving the effectiveness of crime and violence preventio...|$|R

Many of them working in menial jobs can earn more through tips than they can employed as professionals. Thus, there is an economic and <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> emerging in Cuba between those employed in the tourist industry and others.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway had a {{dramatic}} impact on Sandvika. First of all is spurred the centralization of many commercial activities in Sandvika, with the subsequent increase to population. Secondly the line cut through the town. This creased a <b>social</b> <b>divide,</b> with workers and craftsmen settling north of the station, and the bourgeois settling on the south side, along the fjord. The railway also brought some tourism with people on day trips from Oslo.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{employed}} a scorched earth policy in its {{fight in the}} north, driving thousands of peasants southwards towards Jerusalem. Between 67 and 68, these peasants, perhaps led by bandits, formed a new political party called the Zealots, which believed that an independent kingdom should be restored immediately through force of arms. It is unclear whether their leaders made messianic claims. The Zealots imprisoned members of the Herodian family, killed the former high priests Ananus ben Artanus and Joshua ben Gamaliel, and put on trial the wealthiest citizens. It is possible that they believed they were purging elements whom they believed would have surrendered to the Romans. But these purges also reveal the great <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> between Jewish peasants and aristocrats at this time. They formed part of a social revolution: although they ultimately lost to the Romans, elite groups like the Hasmoneans, Herodians, and Sadducees would never again have power in Roman Judea.|$|E

25|$|Anzac Day {{has been}} criticised {{by a number}} of Australians and New Zealanders. At its inception, Anzac Day faced {{criticism}} from the Australian labor movement, and in the country at large, there was opposition to political exploitation of what was seen as a day of mourning. One controversy occurred in 1960 with the publication of Alan Seymour's classic play, The One Day of the Year, which dramatised the growing <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> in Australia and the questioning of old values. In the play, Anzac Day is critiqued by the central character, Hughie, as a day of drunken debauchery by returned soldiers and as a day when questions {{of what it means to}} be loyal to a nation or Empire must be raised. The play was scheduled to be performed at the inaugural Adelaide Festival of Arts, but after complaints from the Returned Services League, the governors of the Festival refused permission for this to occur.|$|E
500|$|The Monster is an 1898 novella by American author Stephen Crane (1871–1900). [...] The story {{takes place}} in the small, fictional town of Whilomville, New York. [...] An African-American coachman named Henry Johnson, who is {{employed}} by the town's physician, Dr. Trescott, becomes horribly disfigured after he saves Trescott's son from a fire. [...] When Henry is branded a [...] "monster" [...] by the town's residents, Trescott vows to shelter and care for him, resulting in his family's exclusion from the community. The novella reflects upon the 19th-century <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> and ethnic tensions in America.|$|E
500|$|The {{degree of}} {{involvement}} between Native {{women and the}} stampeders varied. Many Tlingit women worked as packers for the prospectors, for example, carrying supplies and equipment, sometimes also transporting their babies as well. Hän women had relatively little contact with the white immigrants, however, {{and there was a}} significant <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> between local Hän women and white women. Although before 1897 there had been a number of Native women who married western men, including Kate Carmack, the Tagish wife of one of the discoverers, this practice did not survive into the stampede. Very few stampeders married Hän women, and very few Hän women worked as prostitutes. [...] "Respectable" [...] white women would avoid associating with Native women or prostitutes: those that did could cause scandal.|$|E

However, all the problems of <b>social</b> <b>divides</b> are still prevalent.|$|R
500|$|Diem, {{who had a}} {{reputation}} for heavily favouring Catholics, granted his new constituents a disproportionately high number of government and military posts on religious grounds rather than merit. The disproportionate number of northerners who occupied leadership posts also raised tensions among some regional-minded southerners who regarded them as intruders. He continued the French practice of defining Catholicism as a [...] "religion" [...] and Buddhism as an [...] "association", which restricted their activities. This fostered a <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> between the new arrivals and their compatriots. While on a visit to Saigon in 1955, the British journalist and novelist Graham Greene reported that Diem's religious favouritism [...] "may well leave his tolerant country a legacy of anti-Catholicism". In 1963, simmering discontent over Diem's religious bias exploded into mass civil unrest during the Buddhist crisis. After the Buddhist flag was prohibited from public display for the Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha, Diem's forces opened fire and killed nine protesters. As demonstrations continued through the summer, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces ransacked pagodas across the country, killing hundreds and jailing thousands of Buddhists. The tension culminated in Diem being overthrown and assassinated in a November coup.|$|E
2500|$|A gradual {{economic}} shift {{occurred during}} the Muradid era (c.1630s–1702), as corsair raiding decreased due to pressure from Europe, and commercial trading based on agricultural products (chiefly grains) increased due to an integration of the rural population into regional networks. Mediterranean trade, however, continued to be carried by European shipping companies. The Beys, in order to derive the maximum advantage from the export trade, instituted government monopolies which mediated between the local producers and foreign merchants. As a result, the rulers and their business partners (drawn from foreign-dominated elites well-connected to the Turkish-speaking ruling caste) took {{a disproportionate share of}} Tunisia's trading profits. This precluded the development of local business interests, whether rural landowners or a wealthy merchant strata. The <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> persisted, with the important families in Tunisia identified as a [...] "Turkish" [...] ruling caste.|$|E
2500|$|Society's {{treatment}} of victims {{has the potential}} to exacerbate their trauma. People who have been raped or sexually assaulted are sometimes blamed and considered responsible for the crime. This refers to the just world fallacy and rape myth acceptance that certain victim behaviors (such as being intoxicated, flirting or wearing sexually provocative clothing) may encourage rape. In many cases, victims are said to have [...] "asked for it" [...] because of not resisting their assault or violating female gender expectations. A global survey of attitudes toward sexual violence by the Global Forum for Health Research shows that victim-blaming concepts are at least partially accepted in many countries. Women who have been raped are sometimes deemed to have behaved improperly. Usually, these are cultures where there is a significant <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women.|$|E
50|$|Some {{women who}} bridge <b>social</b> <b>divides,</b> {{publicly}} engage other communities, or adopt {{some of the}} customs or the religion of an outside group may be attacked.

40|$|Social mix was {{a common}} feature of many New Labour neighbourhood-based policies. Within this vision young people are {{socially}} constructed as catalysts for social mixing. It was imagined that both their presence and use of local amenities would ensure interaction across pre-existing <b>social</b> <b>divides.</b> Using an innovative mixed methods approach, the research investigated whether young people in a mixed tenure neighbourhood fulfilled this vision. The thesis argues {{that a number of}} limitations exist to this vision for young people in the social mix agenda. Young people’s access to amenities such as public space and schools, key sites in this vision, are limited and controlled thereby reducing opportunities for social mixing. Furthermore, processes operating beyond the mixed tenure neighbourhood work to undermine social mix aspirations. Most notably, young people, especially those perceived to be from disadvantaged backgrounds, are socially constructed as ‘other’ and to be avoided, in direct conflict to social mix constructions. Rather than pre-existing <b>social</b> <b>divides</b> being abolished, the thesis proposes that those with the most power ensure that such divides are maintained and even strengthened...|$|R

2500|$|In this system, [...] "hair {{functions}} as a key 'ethnic signifier' because, compared with bodily shape or facial features, it can be changed more easily by cultural practices such as straightening." [...] Racism originally [...] "'politicized' [...] hair by burdening it {{with a range of}} negative social and psychological 'meanings'" [...] — categorizing it as a problem. Ethnic difference that could be easily manipulated, like hair, was altered in order for ethnic minorities to assimilate into a dominant, Eurocentric society. Natural hairstyles, such as the Afro and dreadlocks, [...] "counter-politicized the signifier of ethnic devalorization, redefining Blackness as a positive attribute". By wearing their hair as it naturally grows, individuals with afro-textured hair were taking back agency in deciding the value and politics of their own hair. Wearing one's hair naturally also opens up a new debate: Are those who decide to still wear their hair straightened, for example, less 'Black' or 'proud' of their heritage, than those who decide to wear their hair naturally? This debate is an often-ongoing topic of discussion within the community. The issue is highly debated and disputed, creating almost a <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> within the community — between those who decide to be natural and those who do not.|$|E
2500|$|Western Sydney Wanderers local rivals are Sydney FC. The rivalry, {{regarded}} as the biggest in the A-League, is largely based upon the historical, cultural and geographical [...] "East" [...] versus [...] "West" [...] mentality that takes place throughout sport and life in Sydney. Though the rivalry between the two clubs also stems from the establishment {{and development of the}} A-League, which mirrored the pre-existing cultural and <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> of the city. The two clubs first met in Wanderers inaugural season during {{the first round of the}} league on 20 October 2012, with Wanderers losing the match 1–0 after a penalty scored by Alessandro Del Piero. On 15 December 2012, in the following derby, Wanderers defeated Sydney FC 2–0 away from home with goals by Youssouf Hersi and Michael Beauchamp. During their third encounter on 23 March 2012, the two teams went on to draw 1–1 at Wanderers' home ground. The match saw much drama with nine yellows and two red cards shown on the night. In recent years, the derby has been played in front of sold-out crowds, and the support in which both clubs receive has produced an [...] "unrivalled atmosphere and sense of occasion for a club match" [...] in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{mention of}} cricket is {{in a court}} case on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date) in which John Derrick, a Queen's Coroner for the county of Surrey, and therefore a gentleman, bore written testimony as to a parcel of land in Guildford. Derrick, then aged 59, stated {{that when he was}} a schoolboy he and his friends had played cricket on the land (i.e., c.1550). Records from {{the early years of the}} 17th century show that cricket, having apparently been a children's game, was increasingly taken up by adults and the first clear indication that the gentry were involved (notwithstanding Derrick's own status) is in the record of an ecclesiastical court held in 1629. In this, Henry Cuffin, a curate at Ruckinge in Kent, was prosecuted by an Archdeacon's Court for playing cricket on a Sunday evening after prayers. He claimed that several of his fellow players were [...] "persons of repute and fashion". For the next two centuries, the gentry saw cricket as a gambling sport akin to prizefighting and horse racing. The earliest mention of cricket-related gambling is in a 1646 court case that concerned non-payment of a wager. In 1652, another court case accused a gentleman called John Rabson, Esq. and other defendants who were all working class, revealing that cricket had crossed the <b>social</b> <b>divide.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{aim of the}} adversaries, however, was not {{primarily}} to extend their influence over Macedonia but merely to prevent Macedonia succumbing {{to the influence of}} the other. This often violent attempt to persuade the people that they belonged to one ethnic group or another pushed some people to reject both. The severe pressure on the peaceful peasants of Macedonia worked against the plans of the Serbians and Bulgarians to make them adopt their ethnic idea and eventually a <b>social</b> <b>divide</b> became apparent. The British Ambassador in Belgrade in 1927 said: [...] "At present the unfortunate Macedonian peasant is between the hammer and the anvil. One day 'comitadjis' come to his house and demand under threat lodging, food and money and the next day the gendarm hales him off to prison for having given them; the Macedonian is really a peaceable, fairly industrious agriculturist and if the (Serbian) government give him adequate protection, education, freedom from malaria and decent communications, there seems no reason why he should not become just as Serbian in sentiment as he was Bulgarian 10 years ago". As a result of this game of tug-of-war, the development of a distinct Macedonian national identity was impeded and delayed. Moreover, when the imperialistic plans of the surrounding states made possible the division of Macedonia, some Macedonian intellectuals such as Misirkov mentioned the necessity of creating a Macedonian national identity which would distinguish the Macedonian Slavs from Bulgarians, Serbians or Greeks.|$|E
