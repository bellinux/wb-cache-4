40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether glycemic control is different between subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for Celiac Disease (CD) compared to subjects who screened positive for CD among subjects with autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes. Also, this study investigated if the presence of specific beta cell autoantibodies, GAD 65, Islet cell antibodies or both, could predict the risk for positive CD screening. METHODS/PROCEDURES: A retrospective cohort study of an existing clinical care data was obtained from the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) in Boston Medical Center (BMC) for the period between January 2000 and November 2015. The exposed cohort included those who screened positive for CD, while the non-exposed cohort included subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for CD. The following data was collected and included in the analysis: demographic variables, A 1 C levels, Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) events, diabetes-associated antibodies, CD screening tests, and CD biopsy results. Longitudinal data for each subject was obtained from the CDW. RESULTS: The prevalence of potential CD in this study was 8. 8 %, while the prevalence of biopsy confirmed CD was 4. 4 %. Mean A 1 C level for subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for TTG was 8. 9 % (CI 8. 3 - 9. 6), while mean A 1 C levels for subjects who screened positive for TTG was 7. 9 % (CI 6. 8 - 9. 0) after adjusting for confounders using the mixed-effect model. This difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, diabetes-associated antibodies did not predict the risk for positive TTG screening. CONCLUSION: The glycemic control for subjects who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for CD was found to be similar to subjects who screened positive for CD. However, further studies with higher power and larger sample size are needed to confirm the findings of this study. 2017 - 11 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} The ODHIN trial found that training and support and financial reimbursement increased {{the proportion of}} patients that were screened and given advice for their heavy drinking in primary health care. However, {{the impact of these}} strategies on professional accuracy in delivering screening and brief advice is under-researched and is the focus of this paper. Method From 120 primary health-care units (24 in each jurisdiction: Catalonia, England, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden), 746 providers participated in the baseline and the 12 -week implementation periods. Accuracy was measured in two ways: correctness in completing and scoring the screening instrument, AUDIT-C; the proportion of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> patients given advice, and the proportion of screen positive patients not given advice. Odds ratios of accuracy were calculated for type of profession, and for intervention group: training & support; financial reimbursement; and, internet-based counselling. Results. 32 of 36, 711 questionnaires were incorrectly completed, and 65 of 29, 641 <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> patients were falsely classified. At baseline, 27 % of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> patients were given advice, and 22. 5 % screen positive patients were not given advice. These proportions halved during the 12 -week implementation period, unaffected by training. Financial reimbursement reduced the proportion of screen positive patients not given advice (OR = 0. 56, 95 % CI= 0. 31 to 0. 99, p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Although the use of AUDIT-C as a screening tool was accurate, a considerable proportion of risky drinkers did not receive advice, which was reduced with financial incentives...|$|R
40|$|The Objective of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that presenting risk information using numbers rather than words is a more effective way of communicating the residual risk inherent in a <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> test result. We used a randomised controlled trial in a large UK teaching hospital. Two hundred and twenty pregnant women who received negative results on serum screening for Down syndrome participated. Presentation of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> test results were given either as a numerical probability (e. g. you have a 1 : 650 chance of having a baby with Down syndrome) or as a verbal probability (your chance of having a baby with Down syndrome is low). In both interventions the verbal anchor 'it is unlikely that your baby has Down syndrome' was used. Our aims were to measure the understanding of the residual risk in a <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> result, and anxiety. Immediately after receipt of the results, 97 % of those receiving their results in the form of a numerical probability and 91 % of those receiving their results in the form of a verbal probability correctly understood that their baby probably did not have Down syndrome (95 % CI for difference: 0 % to 12 %; p= 0. 04). All those who were incorrect believed that their baby definitely did not have Down syndrome. Subgroup analysis showed that this effect was confined to those with lower levels of education (i. e. those without a university degree), amongst whom understanding was poorer. There was no difference between intervention groups in understanding the results at four months. There were no differences between intervention groups in the levels of anxiety at one week or four months after receiving their results. In conclusion, communicating residual risks using numbers rather than words has a small beneficial effect of increasing awareness of residual risks without raising anxiety. Further work is needed to estimate the size of this effect in less well-informed and less highly educated populations. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Background: Psychometrically sound {{screening}} tools {{available to}} aid in the identification of lifetime history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are limited. As such, the Traumatic Brain Injury- 4 (TBI- 4) was developed and implemented in a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mental health clinic. To provide information regarding both the predictive validity and clinical utility of the TBI- 4, the relationship between screening results and future suicide attempts was evaluated. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether a positive screen on the TBI- 4 was associated with increased risk for suicide attempt within one year post screening. Methods: The TBI- 4 was administered to 1, 097 Veterans at the time of mental health intake. Follow-up data regarding suicide attempts for the year post-mental health intake were obtained from Suicide Behavior Reports (SBRs) in Veteran electronic medical records (EMRs).

Interval breast cancer rates are particularly affected. Objective: to test whether variations in definition of interval cancer rates (ICR) affect comparisons of international ICR, specific to a comparison of ICR in Norway and North Carolina (NC). Methods: An interval cancer (IC) {{was defined as a}} cancer diagnosed following a <b>negative</b> <b>screening</b> mammogram in a defined follow-up period. ICR was calculated for women ages 50 - 69, at subsequent screening in Norway and NC, during the time period 1996 - 2002. ICR was defined using three different denominators (<b>negative</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>negative</b> final assessments and all screens) and three different numerators (DCIS, invasive cancer and all cancers). ICR was then calculated with two methods: 1) number of ICs divided by the number of screens, and ICs divided by the number of women-years at risk for IC. Results: There were no differences in ICR depending on the definition used. In the 1 - 12 month follow up period ICR (based on number of screens) were: 0. 53, 0. 54, and 0. 54 for Norway; and 1. 20, 1. 25 and 1. 17 for NC, for <b>negative</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>negative</b> final assessment and all screens, respectively: The same trend was seen for 13 - 24 and 1 - 24 months follow-up.

40|$|Background: Psychological {{disorders}} {{may affect}} the pain experience of women with vulvodynia, but evidence remains limited. The present study aimed to describe {{the magnitude of the}} association of depression and posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD) with the presence of vulvodynia in a nonclinical population from southeastern Michigan. Methods: Baseline data from 1, 795 women participating in the Woman to Woman Health Study, a multiethnic population-based study, was used for this analysis. Validated screening questionnaires were conducted to assess vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD. Modified Poisson regression models with a robust variance estimation were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association between vulvodynia status and two mental health conditions, depression and PTSD. Results: In the adjusted models, women who screened positive for depression had a 53 % higher prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR= 1. 53; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 2. 10) compared with women who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for depression.

Nonetheless, lack of ADHD (adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) data from South Africa is alarming {{which could be}} due to either the unawareness of ADHD symptoms or underutilization of available screening measures. Undiagnosed ADHD may influence family- and working lives unpleasantly. Parenting a child with ADHD may intensify parental stress through functional impairment notwithstanding the diagnosis of ADHD. Methods: Eighty-one biological parents of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder were screened using self-reporting measurements. ADHD self-report scale (ASRS-V 1. 1) identified either positive or negative subgroups; the Weiss functional impairment rating scale (WFIR-S) for functional impairment and the Jerome driving questionnaire (JDQ) for risk-taking behaviour specifically driving. Results: Of the 39 (48 %) parents who experienced impairment in all seven areas of functioning, 23 (59 %) <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for ADHD, while 16 (41 %) screened positive.

Conclusions: A negative test result at diabetes screening does not seem to promote false reassurance, whether this is expressed as lower perceived risk, lower intentions for health related behavioural change, or higher self rated health. Implementing a widespread programme of primary care based stepwise screening for type 2 diabetes is unlikely to cause an adverse shift in the population distribution of plasma glucose and cardiovascular risk resulting from an increase in unhealthy behaviours arising from false reassurance among people who screen negative.

Objectives: To 1) evaluate the yield of repeat annual alcohol screening {{for patients who}} initially <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> on 1 - 4 prior <b>negative</b> alcohol <b>screens</b> in {{the population as a}} whole and in subgroups of patients; and 2) estimate the prevalence of BI with alcohol misuse before, during, and after implementation of a national performance measure (PM) and dissemination of an electronic clinical reminder (CR) for BI. Methods: 1) Using VA electronic medical record data for more than 360, 000 outpatients (2004 - 2008) the probability of a positive final screen after 1 - 4 prior <b>negative</b> <b>screens</b> was estimated using adjusted logistic transition regression models that included prior <b>negative</b> <b>screen</b> scores as explicit predictors. Results are also presented as the number needed to screen (NNS) for one patient to screen positive on the final screen. 2) Among 6, 788 VA outpatients whose medical records were reviewed for quality improvement (7 / 06 - 9 / 08) the adjusted prevalence of documented BI (advice and feedback) across the 4 phases of BI implementation was estimated using a generalized log-linear regression. Results: Age, gender and prior <b>negative</b> <b>screen</b> scores were the strongest predictors of a positive final screen. As the number of prior <b>negative</b> <b>screens</b> increased from 1 - 4, the probability of a positive final screen decreased and those who consistently reported no drinking the past year had the lowest probabilities. Depending on prior <b>negative</b> <b>screen</b> scores, age, and gender, the NNS ranged from 3 - 159. Among patients with alcohol misuse, the prevalence of BI increased significantly over successive phases of BI implementation, from 5. 5 % during the baseline year to 29. 0 % after CR dissemination. Conclusions: Extending the screening interval beyond a year may be appropriate for some patient groups with a low likelihood of a positive screen in settings that lack the resources to screen and follow-up on all patients annually. The VA's strategy of implementing BIs with a PM and CR meaningfully increased documentation over a 1 -year period...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the component structure of the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) under five different models. The evaluated models comprised the full NSI (NSI- 22) and the NSI- 20 (NSI minus two orphan items). A civilian nonclinical sample was used. The 575 volunteers were predominantly university students who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for mild TBI. The study design was cross-sectional, with questionnaires administered online. The main measure was the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory. Subscale, total and embedded validity scores were derived (the Validity- 10, the LOW 6, and the NIM 5). In both models, the principal components analysis yielded two intercorrelated components (psychological and somatic/sensory) with acceptable internal consistency (alphas[*]>[*] 0. 80). In this civilian nonclinical sample, the NSI had two underlying components. These components represent psychological and somatic/sensory neurobehavioral symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Considering the {{importance}} of {{quality of life in}} med-ical students we have conducted a cross sectional & descriptive study on screening of mental illness of 60 medical students of prefinal year and comparing it with 60 students of third year of Science and Art College. Students were selected via random sampling. GHQ- 12 was used as a screening tool and after ob-taining scores students were graded in 3 categories- individu-als screened positive for psychological morbidity were of Grades 2 and 3 and individuals <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> for psycholo-gical morbidity were of Grade 1 and they were compared ac-cording to college, gender & residence. Students screened pos-itive for psychological morbidity as per GHQ- 12 were found higher in medical college (87 %) as compared to Science and Art College (45 %) and a statistically significant association was found between psychological morbidity and medical students...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{consensus}} {{on the importance of}} early detection and treatment of high blood pressure. Dental care is one of few medical services to which a considerable proportion of the general population comes for regular check-ups. We tested the effects of blood pressure screening in dental care centres with subsequent work-up of subjects screening positive in primary health care (PHCC). Methods Altogether 1, 149 subjects 40 - 65 years old or 20 - 39 years old with body mass index > 25, and with no previously known hypertension, who came for a dental examination had their blood pressure measured with an Omron M 4 ® automatic blood pressure reading device. Subjects with systolic blood pressure readings above 160 mmHg or diastolic above 90 mmHg were referred to their PHCC for a check up. Outcome data were obtained by scrutiny of PHCC and hospital patient records for hypertension diagnoses during the three years following screening. Results 237 (20. 6 %) subjects screened positive. Of these, 230 (97. 1 %) came to their PHCC within the 3 -year follow-up period, as compared with 695 (76. 2 %) of those who <b>screened</b> <b>negative</b> (p < 0. 0001). Of those who screened positive, 76 (32. 1 %) received a diagnosis of hypertension, as compared with 26 (2. 9 %) of those who <b>screened</b> <b>negative.</b> Sensitivity was 79. 1 %, specificity 84. 8 % and positive predictive value 30. 1 %. The number of subjects needed to screen to find one case of hypertension was 18. Conclusions Co-operation between dental and primary care for blood pressure screening and work-up appears to be an effective way of detecting previously unknown hypertension. © 2011 Engström et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{instruments}} validated for screening of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in general populations and primary care settings. The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) has previously been shown to have good screening properties in clinical settings. We used the ASSQ to screen a total population of 7 - 9 year-olds (N = 9430) for ASD in the Bergen Child Study. Parents and teachers filled in the ASSQ, and high-scorers were invited for clinical assessment, along with a large group of <b>screen</b> <b>negative</b> children. We found that the ASSQ was well suited as a general population screen. Combining parent and teacher ASSQ and using cut-off score of a parts per thousand yen 17 provided the most efficient screen with sensitivity of 0. 91 and specificity of 0. 86...|$|R
