However, the process requires appropriate human resources with the right academic attributes to guide the process along, most especially in the upcoming conceptual age where people will no longer live in the <b>sequential,</b> <b>logical</b> and analytical <b>order</b> of information age but rather a nonlinear, intuitive and holistic world. Therefore, this paper seeks the knowledge regarding the type of brain require in conceptual age, illuminates on the attributes of best academicians required in creative education.

At times, reversibility and decentration occur at the same time. [...] When students think about the steps to complete a task without using a particular <b>logical,</b> <b>sequential</b> <b>order,</b> they are using reversibility. Decentration allows him to concentrate on multiple components of a problematic task at a time. Students use both reversibility and decentration [...] to function throughout the school day, follow directions, and complete assignments.|$|R

Any available semantic information that can improve the interface should be used. Application actions or action parameters may be related in ways that affect placement of their associated controls in dialogue boxes. Two relationships considered here are grouping and ordering. Grouped objects should appear together, possibly visually separated from other controls, and controls which have a <b>logical</b> <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering</b> should appear in that order. We present an algorithm for creating an ordering of controls which correctly satisfies these constraints...|$|R
40|$|Confronted with media-rich {{information}} spaces involves interfaces {{that are}} usually designed to facilitate personal exploration to locate information of interest. Navigating such media-rich information spaces, where information structures can be complex, may result in disorientation and demotivation. The need of suited approaches able to support the exploration of such media-rich archives has motivated the development of several types of guided tours. The aims of these guided tours are to support information retrieval, like locating objects of interest in a <b>logical</b> <b>sequential</b> <b>order,</b> and analysis, like learning how to interact with real-life objects or detecting relationship structures, in a dense information environment. This paper, discusses the application and realization of these guided tours in digital dossiers {{in the domain of}} Cultural heritage. Based on the results, we discuss the implications on future development of media-rich environments with regard to information exploration and guidance...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{research}} has focused on what constitutes good route directions, identifying qualities such as the <b>logical</b> <b>sequential</b> <b>ordering,</b> the inclusion of landmarks, and ergonomic ways of referring to turns as critical to delivering cognitively adequate instructions. In many cases, however, people are not actually provided with route directions adhering to these qualities. Yet, often people are still able to successfully navigate to the planned destinations, despite poor or even erroneous direction giving. In this paper, we introduce the concept of defensive wayfinding as the particular type of problem solving people undertake when presented with route directions incongruent with their experience of the environment. We present a systematic investigation of the incompatibilities that may occur between route descriptions and the environment. We note that the content of route directions is produced by the direction giver based on observations of the environment. We develop a classification of the impacts of uncertainty in these observations based on the theory of measurement scales of Stevens [33]. We then relate uncertainty to its impact on route following and the ability of the wayfinder to detect problems during wayfinding. We conclude with a discussion of the impacts of common-sense expectations on the need to engage in defensive wayfinding...|$|R

30|$|An {{interview}} {{protocol was}} developed, {{based on the}} results of the large-scale survey, to ensure that all issues required were addressed. The interview questions were organised in a <b>logical</b> <b>sequential</b> <b>order,</b> with wording that was not too direct and too leading, resulting in clear and precise questions to ensure that the interview questions were effective [51]. Appendix 2 elaborates on the development of the interview questions. In relation to sub-question 1 (see Sect.  1), the interview questions asked participants to describe BPM and its practices, how BPM has helped to improve organisational performance, relationship difficulties and the solutions for dealing with challenges. In relation to our second research sub-question (see Sect.  1), the interview questions asked how BPM has helped collaborative activities, whether the firms had experienced relationship difficulties and what solutions have been implemented to address such challenges. In relation to our third research sub-question, the interview questions focused on relationship characteristics (i.e. the closeness of the relationship, the reasons for engaging the company in collaboration, relationship difficulties, solutions to the challenges and relationship length), as well as benefits that the company has achieved from working collaboratively with its SC partner, challenges to achieving collaborative advantage and solutions implemented to address such challenges. Additionally, questions covered how collaborative advantage has helped to improve organisational performance and what would happen if a company operated without a collaborative relationship. After careful development, the interview protocol was translated into Thai. Then, the interview protocol was pilot-tested to assess whether it was workable and to identify any problems that might occur during the subsequent interview process.|$|R
