5|$|Trafford is {{the home}} of several major sports teams, {{including}} Manchester United Football Club and Lancashire County Cricket Club (LCCC). Manchester United began as Newton Heath L F.C. in 1878. The team plays at Old Trafford football ground, which is sometimes used as a stadium for international matches. Manchester United have won the FA Cup 12 times and been the Premier League champions 13 times (since the league was formed 20 <b>seasons</b> <b>ago)</b> and were Football League champions seven times in the years prior to that.

The team has won the county championship eight times outright (with one shared) and were the county champions in 2011 - the county's first outright triumph since 1934, but were then relegated to the second division in 2012.|$|E
5|$|As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in {{the first}} round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media {{attention}} as Vince Carter, a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two <b>seasons</b> <b>ago,</b> was now back at the ACC as a Net. In the opening game, while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an offensive threat, Toronto's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65–78 going into the fourth quarter. A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not enough as they eventually lost 91–96. The Raptors won game 2 89–83 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5. In that game, the Raptors set two post-season franchise records: most number of points going into halftime and biggest lead for a half. The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game. In game 6, however, New Jersey won 98–97, sealing the series 4–2 and sending Toronto out of the first round.|$|E

25|$|Basel's clear {{aim for the}} 2015–16 Swiss Cup is {{to regain}} the title that they last won four <b>seasons</b> <b>ago.</b> In the {{previous}} three seasons they had ended the cup competitions as runners-up, in 2013 against Grasshopper Club Zürich, in 2014 against Zürich and the previous season 2015 against Sion. In {{the first round of}} this season's competition, which was played on 15 August 2015, Basel are drawn away against Meyrin FC, winning 4–0. In the second round, Basel were drawn away against YF Juventus, which was played on 20 September. Because of safety reasons, however, the game was not played at YF Juventus' home ground, the Utogrund, but instead at St. Jakob-Park. Then in the third round, played on 28 October, Basel were drawn away against SV Muttenz, marking the first time that these two teams played against each other. The game was played at the Sportplatz Margelacker with a stadium record crowd of 5,800. The match was a 5–1 win for Basel.

25|$|Under Snella, Saint-Étienne {{achieved}} {{its first}} honour {{after winning the}} Coupe Charles Drago in 1955. Two seasons later, the club won its first domestic league title. Led by goalkeeper Claude Abbes, defender Robert Herbin, as well as midfielders René Ferrier and Kees Rijvers and striker Georges Peyroche, Saint-Étienne won the league by four points over Lens. In 1958, Saint-Étienne won the Coupe Drago for the second time. After the following season, in which the club finished sixth, Snella departed the club. He was replaced by René Vernier. In the team's first season under Vernier, Saint-Étienne finished 12th, the club's worst finish since finishing 11th eight <b>seasons</b> <b>ago.</b> In the following season, François Wicart joined the coaching staff. In 1961, Roger Rocher {{became president of the}} club and quickly became one of the club's chief investors. After two seasons under Wicart, Saint-Étienne were relegated after finishing 17th in the 1961–62 season. However, Wicart did lead the club to its first Coupe de France title in 1962, alongside co-manager Henri Guérin with the team defeating FC Nancy 1–0 in the final. He also led the club back to Division 1 after one season in the second division, but after the season, Wicart was replaced by Snella, who returned as manager after a successful stint in Switzerland with Servette.|$|E

[...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman.

500|$|After the match, {{figures from}} each team were {{critical}} of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying [...] "It was a pathetic attitude. You never win anything like that." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: [...] "It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed {{to be concerned with}} keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at us much – apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and {{it was a case of}} breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish." [...] Meanwhile, Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel was {{critical of the}} quality of the Liverpool team: [...] "Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two <b>seasons</b> <b>ago.</b> I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players." ...|$|E

500|$|Benfica {{played their}} first {{competitive}} {{game of the}} season against Lazio in Rome and lost 3–1. This reduced their hopes of reaching the group stage of the Champions League, as Camacho said: [...] "Lazio were supposed to do more tonight to win this game. Benfica helped them by committing some mistakes, mainly due to our lack of experience. We have complicated our lives in view of the second-leg match.". The third goal from Lazio, scored by Mihajlović, came from a Roger's foul after touching the ball with his hands; Camacho openly criticized Roger for the incident. On the 17th, Benfica began their league campaign away to Boavista. Their last win there was on 30 March 1996, eight <b>seasons</b> <b>ago.</b> The game ended as a goalless draw, with Camacho criticizing the referee for the excessive number of interruptions. On the following Saturday, Benfica defeated Vitória de Guimarães at home, in a 2–0 win, which Camacho admitted to be flattering in comparison with the team performance. Two days later, the club announced they were postponing their third match day from 31 August to 29 October, because of Académica's desire to play that game at the newly renovated Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. On the 27th, Benfica lost one-nil to Lazio, and were knocked out of the Champions League. Because of the financial loss from the elimination, the club was unable to invest further in squad; the team closed the transfer window with only Alex and Luisão as new signings.|$|E
500|$|As {{it turned}} out, a {{blockbuster}} trade was agreed in principle before the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers {{in exchange for}} Ford (who had become expendable {{with the emergence of}} Calderón), Rasho Nesterović, Maceo Baston, and Roy Hibbert, the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft, giving the Raptors a potential boost in the frontcourt. Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to the earlier purple design that was dropped a few <b>seasons</b> <b>ago.</b> It had a maple leaf featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors as [...] "Canada's team". Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors were too inconsistent. Following an 8–9 start to the season, Mitchell was fired and replaced by long-time assistant Jay Triano. Triano tweaked the starting line-up to no avail as the Raptors fell to 21–34 prior to the All-Star break. O'Neal and Moon were then traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks, but with the losses mounting, the Raptors soon fell out of the playoffs picture and were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining. The Raptors eventually finished with a 33–49 record and headed into the next season with a potential overhaul of the core: Marion could become a free agent; Bosh could become one after 2009–10; Parker would soon turn 35; and Bargnani had his breakthrough season. On May 12, 2009, Triano was given a three-year term for the position of head coach.|$|E
