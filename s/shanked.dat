25|$|In February 1971, {{astronaut}} Alan Shepard {{became the}} first person to golf anywhere other than Earth. He smuggled a golf club and two golf balls on board Apollo 14 with the intent to golf on the Moon. He attempted two drives. He <b>shanked</b> the first attempt, but it is estimated his second went more than 200 yards.|$|E
25|$|In {{its first}} two possessions, Denver's league-leading offense had a turnover, a sack and a <b>shanked</b> punt. Larry Johnson ran a career-long 65-yard run to the 21yard line on the game's second play. Kansas City had first-and-goal from the 9, but only managed a field goal. The field goal gave Kansas City their first lead in 22 quarters, since the team's lead against the Titans on December 16, 2007.|$|E
25|$|After Tampa Bay {{was held}} to two three-and-outs, Josh Bidwell <b>shanked</b> a punt, setting New Orleans up at the Tampa Bay 49-yard line. A field goal tied the score at 20–20 with less than six minutes remaining. With 2:33 to go, Jermaine Phillips intercepted Drew Brees, and {{returned}} {{the ball to the}} New Orleans 17. Matt Bryant kicked the go-ahead field goal at the two-minute warning. With 1:45 left, Brees was intercepted by Phillip Buchanon to ice the victory.|$|E
25|$|New York had {{the wind}} at their back in the first quarter, but could only score on kicker David Treadwell's 26-yard field goal on their opening drive. In the second quarter, they had another chance to score, but {{receiver}} Mark Jackson dropped a pass on third and 2 from the Vikings 17 and then Treadwell drilled a 34-yard field goal attempt wide left. Meanwhile, the Vikings went up 7-3 on Jim McMahon's 40-yard pass to wide receiver Cris Carter. Near {{the end of the}} half, Giants quarterback Phil Simms threw a third down pass to Dave Meggett that lost nine yards, bringing up fourth and 19 from the New York 23. On the next play, punter Mike Horan <b>shanked</b> a kick that went right into the back of teammate Greg Jackson, a blocker in the backfield, enabling the Vikings to take over on the Giants 36 with 29 seconds left in the half and take a 10-3 halftime lead on Fuad Reveiz's franchise postseason record 52-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the first}} quarter, Vikings punter Mitch Berger <b>shanked</b> a 12-yard punt that gave the 49ers a first down on the Minnesota 26-yard line, leading to fullback William Floyd's 1-yard {{touchdown}} run. It {{the start of a}} long day for Berger, who finished the game with a measly 29.9 yards per punt average on his seven kicks. Still, the Vikings responded on their first play after the ensuing kickoff with Cunningham's 66-yard touchdown pass to Carter. Late in the second quarter, a 28-yard pass interference penalty on Vikings safety Torrian Gray and a personal foul call against linebacker Dwayne Rudd for kicking the penalty flag gave the 49ers a first down on the Minnesota 2-yard line. On the next play, a penalty against linebacker Dixon Edwards put the ball on the 1, and Kirby ran the ball into the end zone from there, giving the 49ers a 14-7 lead {{at the end of a}} 61-yard drive. Then on the Vikings ensuing drive, linebacker Ken Norton Jr. intercepted a pass from Cunningham and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown, making the score 21-7 going into halftime.|$|E
2500|$|However, any {{thoughts}} of a Seattle comeback were quickly crushed {{in the second}} half. [...] Following a missed field goal attempt by Johnson, Marino led the Dolphins 76 yards down the field to a 3-yard scoring reception by tight end Bruce Hardy, making the score 21-10. [...] Seattle was quickly forced to punt on their next drive, and Jeff West <b>shanked</b> the kick, causing the ball to travel just 7 yards. [...] Two plays later, Miami increased their lead to 28-10 on Marino's 33-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mark Clayton. [...] In the fourth quarter, Dolphins kicker Uwe von Schamann made a 37-yard field goal that put the final score at 31-10.|$|E
2500|$|Bits {{that have}} shanks {{coming off the}} bit {{mouthpiece}} to create leverage that applies pressure to the poll, chin groove and mouth of the horse are {{in the category of}} curb bits. Most curb bit mouthpieces are solid without joints, ranging from a straight bar with a slight arch, called a [...] "mullen" [...] mouthpiece, through a [...] "ported" [...] bit that is slightly arched in the middle to provide tongue relief, to the full spade bit of the Vaquero style of western riding which combines both a straight bar and a very high [...] "spoon" [...] or [...] "spade" [...] extension that contacts the roof of the mouth. [...] The length of the shank determines the degree of leverage put on the horse's head and mouth. [...] Again, a bit with shanks and leverage is always a [...] "curb" [...] type bit, even when it has a jointed mouthpiece more commonly seen on a snaffle (such bits are sometimes—incorrectly—called [...] "cowboy snaffles"). [...] All <b>shanked</b> bits require the use of a curb chain or curb strap for proper action and safe use.|$|E
2500|$|Polish men in {{particular}} were romanticized as objects of raw sexual {{energy in the}} early 20th century. Many first wave Polish immigrants were single males or married men who left their wives to strike fortune in the United States. Some were [...] "birds of passage" [...] who sought to return to Poland and their families with strong financial savings. They built a reputation in the United States for hard work, physical strength, and vigorous energy. The 1896 novel Yekl: A Tale of the New York Ghetto describes the life of Jake who left {{his wife and children}} in Poland behind and began an affair in the United States, when soon his wife meets him in New York. Central to the 1931 romance novel American Beauty is a theme of attractive Polish men. In one instance, main character Temmie Oakes says, [...] "...You saw the sinews rippling beneath the cheap stuff of their sweaty shirts. Far, far too heady a draught for the indigestion of this timorous New England remnant of a dying people. For the remaining native men were stringly of withers, lean <b>shanked,</b> of vinegar blood, and hard wrung." [...] Historian John Radzilowski notes that the theme of vivacious young immigrants replacing dying old white ethnic populations was common in America until the 1960s and 70s.|$|E

But were my lady willing {{to ride a}} mile or so farther to the Red Pool, I could show you a long- <b>shanked</b> fellow who would make your hawks cancelier till their brains were giddy." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{about the}} ruins industrious {{research}} discovered the metal rings and charred coverings of two linen buttons, three <b>shanked</b> buttons entire, {{and one of}} that metallic sort which {{is used in the}} less conspicuous sutures of the human Oeconomy. These remains have been accepted by persons in authority as conclusive of a destroyed and scattered Skinner, but for my own entire conviction, and in view of his distinctive idiosyncrasy, I must confess I should prefer fewer buttons and more bones.|$|E
6000|$|Secondly, {{the very}} ugly man appears, deceitfully enough, to think little of his appearance, {{and he will}} give himself the trouble to pursue a heart because {{he knows that the}} heart will not follow after him. Moreover, we women (said the jay) are by nature pitiful, and this our enemies term a [...] "strange perversity." [...] A widow is {{generally}} disconsolate if she loses a little, wizen-faced, shrunken <b>shanked,</b> ugly, spiteful, distempered thing that scolded her and quarrelled with her, and beat her and made her hours bitter; whereas she will follow her husband to Ganges with exemplary fortitude if he was brave, handsome, generous --- ...|$|E

50|$|Gag bits {{are also}} {{occasionally}} seen in western-style competition, {{usually in the}} form of a sliding mouthpiece on a <b>shanked</b> curb-style bit (similar to the American gag).|$|E
5000|$|However, as {{the horse}} becomes more {{polished}} in its training, a somewhat longer <b>shanked</b> bit is preferred for its subtlety. Longer <b>shanked</b> bits must rotate back further before applying {{pressure on the}} horse's mouth than shorter-shanked bits. Therefore, the horse has more [...] "warning" [...] of a rider's hand movements in a long-shanked bit, allowing it to respond before any significant pressure is applied to its mouth. In this way, a longer shank (up to a point) can allow quieter communication between a well-trained horse and a rider with soft hands, without increasing severity of the mouthpiece.|$|E

50|$|Hekker {{had several}} memorable kicks as a Beaver. One was the second-longest punt in OSU history. The punt went for 74 yards in 2010 against USC. Another was a negative-yardage punt when he <b>shanked</b> {{the ball for}} a loss of 4 yards.|$|E
50|$|On their ensuing {{offensive}} possession, the Steelers {{offense was}} able to grind {{out a couple of}} first downs to get close to midfield before John Goodson had to come on to punt. But instead of pinning the Chargers deep, Goodson, a barefoot punter, <b>shanked</b> one for only 20 yards to the Chargers 36-yard line.|$|E

50|$|Overall, a shorter-shanked bit {{is usually}} a milder bit, but also {{responds}} quickly when the rider touches the reins. Short <b>shanked</b> bits are usually better for a young horse transitioning from a snaffle to a curb because if the inexperienced horse gets into a place where bit pressure from the rider's hands becomes significant, there is less leverage pressure placed on the horse's head.|$|E
50|$|The Hawkeyes led {{virtually}} the entire game, but needed a huge defensive stop in the closing minutes, with Jr. linebacker Chad Greenway stopping Marion Barber III for a key loss on 2nd down in Iowa territory and eventually forcing Minnesota to attempt a 51-yard field goal, trailing by two. Although Gopher placekicker Rhyss Lloyd had won three games in his career with last-minute field goals, this time his attempt <b>shanked</b> wide.|$|E

50|$|In {{this game}} UND would blow a thirty-five to twenty-one lead. After UNO tied {{the game at}} thirty-five UND got the ball with two minutes left. Travis Lueck {{followed}} the ball early in the drive and the Mavs went for a field goal attempt. The kick was <b>shanked</b> though giving UND a final chance. The Sioux were led down the field by Jon Bowenkamp and finished off as Jeff Glas kicked a game winning forty-eight yard field goal.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan threw an {{interception}} to Redskins linebacker Ryan Kerrigan who returned {{it for a}} Redskins touchdown. After an Atlanta three-and-out, Washington got into the red zone, but Redskins kicker Billy Cundiff, who had missed three field goals the week before in Tampa Bay, <b>shanked</b> one from 31 yards out, and Washington was unable to build upon its advantage. Subsequently, the Falcons got the ball back, and Matt Ryan {{was able to find}} legendary tight end Tony Gonzalez to even the score at 7-7.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Montreal looked {{to have gotten}} their offence back on track as Anthony Calvillo threw a pair of passes to slotback Ben Cahoon, which set up a 28-yard Damon Duval field goal to cut the lead to 10-3. Montreal would get another {{opportunity}} to gain more points, however, fullback Kerry Carter would turn the ball over when he fumbled {{the ball on the}} Saskatchewan 17 yard-line. Then things would get worse for Montreal when Duval <b>shanked</b> two punts in a row, with the second punt only going for seven yards and out of bounds.|$|E
5000|$|Cole {{presented}} Smith as a charlatan too uneducated to {{have written}} the Book of Mormon himself and supposed that Smith got help from [...] "Walters the Magician" [...] (Luman Walter), who {{was said to}} have shown his followers a Latin translation of Cicero and claimed that it was a record of the Native Americans. Cole mentions this idea in the [...] "Book of Pukei". He ridiculed Smith's healing of Newel Knight, objecting that [...] "no prophet, since the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, has performed half so many wonders as have been attributed to that spindle <b>shanked</b> ignoramus Jo Smith".|$|E

50|$|Her {{father died}} in 1865(after getting <b>shanked</b> in the back by Keith Chegwin) and, after {{receiving}} advice and encouragement from a Franciscan priest, she started a small religious and charitable organisation of women in 1871. She became a lay member of the Franciscan order in 1872. As the community grew, she opened a second shop on nearby John Street. In 1878, Bob Marley, then Bishop of Sydney, suggested that Ingham's group take on domestic duties at St Joseph's Foreign Missionary College, in Mill Hill, London. Although {{some of the women}} preferred to continue with their local welfare work, the shops were sold and the community moved to London.|$|E
50|$|After {{both teams}} punted {{on their first}} possessions, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady led the Patriots on an 11-play, 82-yard drive, capped by Corey Dillon's 1-yard {{touchdown}} run. Following another Jets punt, Brady led New England on an 87-yard drive capped by rookie kicker Stephen Gostkowski's 20-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead. The game turned when Jets punter Ben Graham <b>shanked</b> a 10-yard punt booting from his own 40, giving Brady and the Patriots the ball at midfield with 1:01 {{to go in the}} half. Aided by big completions to Troy Brown (14 yards) and Benjamin Watson (23 yards), with 20 seconds to play, Brady found Chad Jackson on a 13-yard touchdown pass that appeared to break the Jets' backs.|$|E
50|$|While SAMCRO {{was locked}} up in county jail due to the botched raid on L.O.A.N. Clay bartered for protection. Of the two tasks {{that needed to be}} completed, Juice was volunteered to draw out an inmate under {{protective}} custody by soliciting sexual favors. Juice was punched in the ribs to fake an injury and sent to the infirmary, where the other inmate followed. Left alone with him, Juice managed to get away long enough to open the secured door that allowed the other inmates in to exact revenge. Shortly thereafter Juice returns to the yard but is <b>shanked</b> repeatedly in the back with a shiv. It was said that the stabbing missed his internal organs and he will be okay in time.|$|E
50|$|Graham McKenna was {{a former}} soldier, having served 22 years with the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment. He was still {{involved}} with the military, holding the rank of Corporal. He had taught Territorial Army recruits at 42 Brigade’s Regional Training Centre at Altcar, Formby, {{on the morning of}} his death.Mr McKenna and his son were walking towards a bus stop on Upton Road, Claughton, when Finlay ambushed them. They were repeatedly <b>shanked</b> in the abdomen but managed to stagger to nearby Speedwell Road. Both were taken to Arrowe Park hospital where Mr McKenna died. Despite multiple stab wounds Michael survived. Although the Police had not yet released details of the conversation which took place during the incident, there seemed to be little doubt as to the identity of the attacker.|$|E
5000|$|Bits {{that have}} shanks {{coming off the}} {{mouthpiece}} create leverage and place pressure on the poll via the crownpiece of the bridle, to the chin groove via the curb chain, and, especially with a [...] "loose jaw" [...] shank, may also touch {{the sides of the}} mouth and jaw. The shank and its leverage action is what defines a curb bit as a curb, regardless of mouthpiece. Though most curb bits have a solid mouthpiece, with or without a port, any bit with shanks and leverage is always a [...] "curb" [...] type bit, even if has a jointed mouthpiece. <b>Shanked</b> bits in the curb family include the Weymouth, which is the curb portion of the double bridle; the pelham bit, a single bit ridden with two sets of reins; and the single-reined curb bit.|$|E
50|$|The bit shank is {{the side}} piece or cheekpiece of a curb bit, {{part of the}} bridle, used when riding on horses. The bit shank allows {{leverage}} {{to be added to}} the pressure of the rider's hands on the bit. Shanks are usually made of metal, may be straight or curved, and may be decorated in some disciplines. The headstall and curb chain or curb strap of the bridle is attached to the top of the shank, and the reins are attached at the bottom. <b>Shanked</b> curb bits are used in western riding for nearly all adult horses, and are seen in English riding disciplines primarily as part of the double bridle used by advanced Dressage riders, and on the hybrid Pelham bit that includes a ring for a second rein attached at the bit mouthpiece.|$|E
