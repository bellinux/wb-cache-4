5000|$|Serratus ventralis: {{includes}} the serratus cervicus, which originates {{from the final}} 4-5 cervical vertebrae and inserts into the scapula, and the <b>serratus</b> <b>thoracis,</b> which originates on the lateral side of the first 8-9 ribs and inserts into the scapula. The two muscles are antagonists to each other, with the serratus cervicus pulling the scapula towards the neck, and the <b>serratus</b> <b>thoracis</b> pulling the scapula away from the neck. They help move the forelimb forward and back.|$|E
40|$|Muscles {{have two}} major roles in locomotion: to {{generate}} force and to absorb/generate power (do work). Economical force generation {{is achieved by}} short-fibred pennate muscle while the maximum power output of a muscle is architecture independent. In this study we tested the hypothesis {{that there is an}} anatomical and structural separation between the force-generating anti-gravity muscles and the propulsive (limb/trunk moving) muscles of the equine forelimb. Muscle mass and fascicle length measurements were made on the thoracic limb extrinsic muscles of six fresh horse cadavers. Physiological cross-sectional area and maximum isometric force were then estimated. Maximum power was estimated from muscle volume and published contraction velocity data. The majority of extrinsic forelimb muscles were large with long fascicles arranged in parallel to the long axis of the muscle. Muscles arranged in this way are optimised for doing work. The architecture of <b>serratus</b> ventralis <b>thoracis</b> (SVT) was unique. It had short (48  ±  17  mm) fascicles, arranged at about 45 ° to the long axis of the muscle, which would suggest a force-generating, anti-gravity role. The muscle belly of SVT was sandwiched between two broad, thick sheets of aponeurosis. Hence, SVT could make a significant contribution to the overall elastic properties of the thoracic limb...|$|R
40|$|The {{innervation}} of the capybara {{thoracic limb}} was characterized. The following nerves were observed constituting {{the right and}} left brachial plexus: n. dorsalis scapulae (C 4 and C 5; C 4, C 5 and C 6) which innervates the m. serratus ventralis cervicis and m. rhomboideus; n. suprascapularis (C 4, C 5 and C 6; C 5, C 6 and C 7) supplying the m. supraspinatus and the m. infraspinatus; cranial and caudal nn. subscapulares (C 5 and C 6; C 5, C 6 and C 7) innervating the m. subscapularis; n. axillaris (C 5 and C 6; C 6, C 7 and C 8) which supplies the m. triceps brachii (caput mediale); n. radialis (C 6, C 7, C 8 and T 1; C 6, C 7 and C 8) which innervates the m. triceps brachii (caput longum and caput mediale) and the m. extensor carpi radialis, m. extensor digitorum communis, m. extensor digitorum lateralis; n. medianus joined to the n. musculocutaneus (C 6, C 7, C 8 and T 1; C 6, C 7 and C 8) supplying the m. biceps brachii, m. flexor carpi radialis and m. coracobrachialis; n. ulnaris (C 6, C 7, C 8 and T 1; C 6, C 7 and C 8) leading to the m. flexor carpi radialis, the m. flexor carpi ulnaris and the m. flexor digitorum superficialis; n. thoracodorsalis (C 6, C 7, C 8 and T 1; C 6, C 7 and C 8) supplying the m. latissimus dorsi; n. thoracicus lateralis (C 8, T 1; C 7, C 8, T 1) which innervates m. pectoralis profundus (caudal portion); n. thoracicus longus (C 6, C 7; C 7, C 8) which is distributed to the m. <b>serratus</b> ventralis <b>thoracis.</b> A communication between the n. radialis and n. ulnaris was observed at the left brachial plexus...|$|R
