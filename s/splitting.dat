5|$|The first {{detection}} of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of hydroxyl megamasers. The Zeeman effect is the <b>splitting</b> of a spectral line {{due to the}} presence of a magnetic field, {{and the size of the}} <b>splitting</b> is linearly proportional to the line-of-sight magnetic field strength. Zeeman <b>splitting</b> has been detected in five hydroxyl megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic hydroxyl masers.|$|E

40|$|Stock <b>splits</b> are a {{relatively}} new phenomenon in the Indian context. This paper examines the market effect of stock <b>splits</b> on stock price, return, volatility, and trading volume around the <b>split</b> ex-dates for a sample of stock <b>splits</b> undertaken in the Indian stock market over the period 1999 – 2005. The traditional view of stock <b>splits</b> as cosmetic transactions that simply divide the same pie into more slices is inconsistent with the significant wealth effect associated with the announcement of a stock <b>split.</b> However, the empirical evidence confirms {{a negative effect on}} price and return of stock <b>splits.</b> The overall cumulative abnormal returns after the <b>split</b> are negative. These results suggest that stock <b>splits</b> have induced the market to revise its optimistic valuation about future firm performance, rejecting signaling hypothesis to which <b>splits</b> convey positive information to markets. Hence, stock <b>splits</b> have reduced the wealth of the shareholders. The results also show that presence of a positive effect on volatility and trading volume following the <b>split</b> events, thus suggesting that <b>split</b> events enhance liquidity.

50|$|Two <b>splits</b> {{are said}} to cross if each side of one <b>split</b> has a {{non-empty}} intersection with {{each side of the}} other <b>split.</b> A <b>split</b> is called strong when it is not crossed by any other <b>split.</b> As a special case, every trivial <b>split</b> is strong.

5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. <b>Splitting</b> aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. <b>Splitting</b> aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As a general rule, a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for blackjack, the rules for resplitting, the rules for doubling, the rules for multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E
