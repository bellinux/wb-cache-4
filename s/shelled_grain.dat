40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{influence}} of variety, plant population, and planting date on corn silage production was studied at Hyslop Agronomy Farm, Corvallis, Oregon. The corn plants were grown under irrigation with 300 pounds per acre of 16 - 20 - 0 (N-P₂ 0 ₅-K₂ 0) and 240 pounds of urea, providing a total nitrogen application of 158 pounds per acre. The yield of total dry matter, <b>shelled</b> <b>grain,</b> silage and the chemical constituents of silage (feeding quality), date of maturity and plant height were studied. The medium season varieties gave more yield of dry matter, <b>shelled</b> <b>grain</b> and silage than the early varieties. Yields of silage and <b>shelled</b> <b>grain</b> were reduced when the varieties were planted in late May {{compared with the}} same varieties planted in late April. The yield of all varieties used in the late planting test, including Sudangrass, showed no statistically significant differences.

Row spacing had a large influence o. n yield of dry matter, particularly at high population rate. The 36 -inch rows treatments gave a higher yield than 24 -inch rows for every variety studied. The variation in plant spacing within the row (one vs. two plants per hill) had very little effect o. n yield if any. The feeding value, on the basis of analysis for feed constituents, was not influenced by increased population rate.

40|$|Effective {{protection}} against the Greater Grain Borer can be obtained for about eight months by mixing <b>shelled</b> <b>grain</b> with permethrin dust before storing it in sacks. But storing maize on the cob and dusting it does not give protection. Unfortunately, this is precisely how most small farmers prefer to store maize, which suits the Greater Grain Borer best of all. This {{is one of the}} reasons why the pest has spread so rapidly through East Africa in recent years. The Tropical Development and Research Institute has been examining ways of combating the pest. Trials are being conducted to see if protection can be provided by leaving the sheath on the cob and dusting it with permethrin The greater grain borer is also a pest on cassava, especially when this is dried and stored. Once the pest has burrowed inside, it can remain for some time, eating out the centre. Dusting the outside is of little use once the beetle is inside.

However, knowledge of the impact of rodents in on-farm maize storage systems in Kenya is limited. A survey was conducted in 2014 to assess magnitudes of postharvest losses in on-farm maize storage systems in Kenya, and the contribution of rodents to the losses. A total of 630 farmers spread across six maize growing agro-ecological zones (AEZs) were interviewed. Insects, rodents and moulds were the main storage problems reported by farmers. Storage losses were highest in the moist transitional and moist mid-altitude zones, and lowest in the dry-transitional zone. Overall, rodents represented the second most important cause of storage losses after insects, and were ranked as the main storage problem in the lowland tropical zone, while insects were the main storage problem in the other AEZs. Where maize was stored on cobs, total farmer perceived (farmer estimation) storage weight losses were 11. 1 ± 0. 7 %, with rodents causing up to 43 % of these losses. Contrastingly, where maize was stored as <b>shelled</b> <b>grain,</b> the losses were 15. 5 ± 0. 6 % with rodents accounting for up to 30 %. Regression analysis showed that rodents contributed significantly to total storage losses (p < 0. 0001), and identified rodent trapping as the main storage practice that significantly (p = 0. 001) lowered the losses. Together with insecticides, rodent traps were found to significantly decrease total losses. Improved awareness and application of these practices could mitigate losses in on farm-stored maize...|$|E

40|$|Following its {{accidental}} introduction into Africa in {{the early}} 1980 s, the Larger Grain Borer (LGB), Prostephanus truncatus, has spread rapidly and widely, becoming a serious pest of stored maize and dried cassava and a very real threat to food security (see Spore 34 page 5). Consequently {{it has become the}} most intensively studied storage e pest. The initial spread of LGB in East Africa was rapid and loss levels in cob-stored maize in cribs in some places were as high as 34 % after only six months' storage. Losses in dried cassava were also exceptionally high. While indigenous storage pests such as grain weevils (Sitopholus sip), grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella) and lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), were a nuisance, they never reached the levels of damage caused by Prostephanus which, as an introduced species, had no natural enemies. In an effort to control this new pest, farmers were encouraged to change their storage practices and improve their store hygiene: to store maize shelled instead of on the cob, and to treat grain with a mix of insecticides. Large scale stored maize was fumigated with bromide or phosphine. These changes might have proved effective but severe drought affecting parts of Africa, necessitated large-scale inter regional movement of grain, often from infested to uninfested regions. So despite these and other safeguards LGB continued to spread, albeit at a slower rate. This control strategy, which was followed for a number of years, resulted in the apparent stabilization of the spread of LGB and some of the major maize producing countries such as Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa remained unaffected. In the early ' 90 s there was increasing evidence to show that LGB was established in the bush and and forest regions outside the storage environment. The question now was whether LGB evolved as a wood-boring insect and only later moved into maize and cassava, which subsequently became preferred hosts. If this proves to be the case, as researchers now strongly suspect, the spread of LGB into the rest of Africa is inevitable, by dispersal through the natural environment. Alternative control methods The fact that LGB will undoubtedly spread into those areas of Africa currently unaffected is not the unmitigated disaster that it might appear. Much has been learned since its initial arrival in Tanzania and, for the most part, losses have been brought down to manageable levels. Whilst LGB is not the only storage pest that farmers have to deal with, its occurence has encouraged people to review and renew many aspects of pre- and postharvest handling of crops, leading to improvement of storage as a whole. Unfortunately, the changes in storage practice such as the shelling of maize and its treatment with chemicals, which had proved effective control measures in East and Central Africa, were not really an option in West Africa, particularly in the humid zones. Due to the much higher humidity, <b>shelled</b> <b>grain</b> treated with chemicals became more prone to mould development. Moreover, in some countries in the region, chemicals were in such short supply that the need for alternatives became imperative and {{in the early}} ' 90 s several research groups in West and East Africa began investigating integrated control of harvest pests in general and the LGB in particular. A search to find a natural enemy to LGB which began in the mid-' 80 s proved fruitful when researchers from GTZ (the German Technical Agency) and the UK's Natural Resources Institute (NRI) found a predatory beetle, the histerid Teretriosoma nigrescens in Central America, the original home of LGB. This was reared and released in Togo at the beginning of 1991 and subsequently spread to neighbouring areas of Benin where its movements have been assessed by pheromone trap monitoring. The results have been encouraging: in the coastal zones of both Benin and Togo, pheromone traps and rural stores have shown an increase in the numbers of 7. nigrescens and a drop in LGB numbers. Further releases are planned and, following impact assessments, there will be releases by IITA in Guinea Conakry and probably Zambia later in the year. Simultaneously, researchers at the International Institute of Biological Control (IIBC), part of CAB International, and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) also imported, screened and mass reared T. nigrescens for releases in Kenya beginning in May 1992. Again, continuous monitoring has shown encouraging levels of establishment and spread by the predatory beetle and a subsequent sharp fall in numbers of LGB monitored in pheromone traps. Information exchange Since the first outbreaks of LGB in the ' 80 s there have been regular meetings to assess the impact and discuss new methods of control and containment of the pest. Last year a joint IITA/GTZ/ODA workshop was held for West Africa. As a follow-up, and to look more specifically at the problems of East and Central Africa, a Workshop on Storage Pest Management was held at Naivasha, Kenya in April of this year. This workshop was jointly organized and hosted by CAB International's Africa Regional Office and KARI. Leading crop storage specialists from the region and from FAO, GTZ, IIBC, IITA and NRI reviewed progress and discussed what steps still need to be taken in research, extension and the trade in stored products. The recommendations included the need to implement biological control of LGB in all affected countries in East Africa as a matter of urgency, and to develop and implement I PM strategies for storage pests using biological control of LGB as a base. Another strong recommandation was the farmer participatory research and extension should be adopted in future. There is also a need for regional coordination for training, information exchange and the coordination of research and extension methodologies. A warning was given that the use of phosphine as a fumigant should be controlled to avoid misuse and the risk of resistance developing. It is clear that LGB can be controlled, but that determined and regionally concerted action will be essential. The basis for such regional action is already available {{in the form of an}} agreed set of recommendations on future directions and a detailed list of research activities prepared by the Workshop. Structured in the form of a project planning matrix, these can now be used for project development and practical implementation by national programmes.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of abrasive sandpaper made from two locally sourced and easily available materials, periwinkle and palm kernel shells {{was carried out}} to evaluate their viability as replacements for foreign imported abrasives sandpaper. Composites of crushed shells with polyester resin bond were developed separately for the periwinkle and palm kernel shell samples using mould compression, and the sandpaper prototype was produced using hand-spray method. A study on the physico-mechanical properties of the produced composite carried out was found that at 12 wt. % content of resin, periwinkle shell (PWS) /resin composites had higher physico-mechanical properties such as density with 77. 74 % difference, hardness with 17. 13 % difference and compressive strength with 182. 42 % difference over the palm kernel shell-resin composites.

In addition to the abrasion platform formed by a small rock on the east half of Xianjiao islet, most of the island is a white sand beach composed of sand <b>grains,</b> <b>shell</b> and coral fragments. The name warns passing-by boats to beware of the waters here.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{there was}} a commotion in the crowd. The wall of the great granary had been breached, {{by some of the}} lyddite <b>shells,</b> and the <b>grain</b> had poured out into the street. The natives near ran up to gather it; and, finding that they were not molested by the British, the news spread rapidly. The crowds in the streets melted away; and the inhabitants, for the most part half starved, made a mad rush to the spot, where in a short time many {{thousands}} of men, women, and children were hard at work, gathering and carrying off the grain.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} survey of ‘live’ (stained) and dead monothalamous (single-chambered, mainly spherical) and pseudochambered (chain-like) foraminifera {{associated}} with planktonic foraminiferal <b>shells</b> and mineral <b>grains,</b> based on two samples from one abyssal plain site (F 2, 4, 880 m water depth) and one abyssal hill site (H 4, 4, 330 m water depth) on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP), northeast Atlantic. Our study {{is the first to}} focus on this poorly known component of abyssal foraminiferal faunas and highlight their abundances and diversity at the PAP. In both samples these monothalamids and pseudochambered forms represented 27 – 35...|$|R
40|$|Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrene {{sulfonic}} acid (PEDOT:PSS), an optically transparent organic semi-conductor, constitutes a suspension of conducting PEDOT:PSS <b>grains,</b> <b>shelled</b> by an insulating layer of PSS. While a percolation network enhances dc conductivity, structural and electrical inhomogenity hinters electric charge flow {{giving rise to}} capacitance effects. In the present work, two distinct relaxation mechanisms are detected by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS). Double polarization mechamisms are predicted by bi-phase suspension dielectric theory. Within the frame of interfacial polarization, we propose a methodology to have an insight into the local conductivity of the interior of mesoscopic conducting phase. Comment: 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Dal Chodha was {{contributing}} editor to the book, Patternity: A New Way of Seeing. The book teaches us {{to look beyond the}} mundane forms that we see every day to find inspiration in the hidden patterns that often pass us by. From fashion, art and design to the natural world and science, the book is a unique collection of photography and writing aimed to inspire readers to view the world in an entirely different way. From the microscopic spiraling <b>shells</b> in a <b>grain</b> of sand to the swirling constellations of an entire galaxy, patterns have the power to unite us all...|$|R
40|$|Two slotted {{two-dimensional}} spouted bed {{units with}} flexible bed dimensions were designed and fabricated. Static vertical pressure of <b>grains</b> (<b>shelled</b> corn, soybean, and wheat) {{on the air}} entry slots in the pilot scale unit indicated that the silo theories are not applicable to predict this pressure accurately without including the bed to air inlet aspect ratio, slant angle, and sphericity of grains. A grain quantitative factor accounting for emptying angle of repose and sphericity of particles was proposed and included with the collected data to develop an empirical regression model. Aerodynamics of <b>grains</b> (<b>shelled</b> corn, soybean, and wheat) {{were found to be}} affected by slant angle, spout width, separation distance, length of bed and the bed geometrical similarity. Mathematical models for the design parameters of the spouted beds were developed following the principles of dimensional analysis and similitude. Model predictions agree closely with the data. The drying rate of shelled corn in the geometrically similar two-dimensional spouted beds with draft plates was found to depend on the bed geometry and operating parameters. The drying characteristics of corn in the investigated spouted beds was found to be of the thin layer type. The performance of dryers was modeled {{in the form of the}} Page's equation. Expressions for the model parameters accounting for bed geometry, grain moisture content, and drying conditions were developed. The developed model predictions agree well with the data from both beds...|$|R
50|$|An ooid {{forms as}} a series of {{concentric}} layers around a nucleus. The layers contain crystals arranged radially, tangentially or randomly. The nucleus can be a <b>shell</b> fragment, quartz <b>grain</b> or any other small fragment. Most modern ooids are aragonite, a polymorph of calcium carbonate; some are composed of high-magnesium calcite, and some are bimineralic (layers of calcite and aragonite). Ancient ooids can be calcitic, either originally precipitated as calcite (as in calcite seas), or formed by alteration (neomorphic replacement) of aragonitic ooids (or the aragonite layers in originally bimineralic ooids). Moldic ooids (or molds later filled in by calcite cement) occur in both young and ancient rocks, indicating the removal of a soluble polymorph (usually aragonite).|$|R
5000|$|Puffed rice {{is formed}} by the {{reaction}} of both starch and moisture when heated within the <b>shell</b> of the <b>grain.</b> Unlike popcorn, rice kernels are naturally lacking in moisture and must first be conditioned with steam. Puffed rice can be created by heating the steam-conditioned kernels either with oil or in an oven. Rice puffed {{in this way is}} crisp, and known as [...] "crisped rice". Oven-crisped rice is used to produce the Rice Krispies breakfast cereal as well as the crisped rice used in Lion Bars, Nestlé Crunch, Krackel, and similar chocolate bars. [...] Though not as dramatic a change when compared to popcorn, the process and end result are the same.|$|R
