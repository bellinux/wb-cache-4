At age two, his parents bought him a <b>swing</b> <b>set.</b> [...] Before Troffer had even {{finished}} assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault.

Wallenda's first public performance, dressed as a clown, was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. [...] He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. As a child, he would play on his parent's practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet (0.6 m) off the ground. [...] Wallenda's parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun, to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. [...] He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. [...] However, Wallenda says there was never any family pressure to become a circus performer.|$|E
