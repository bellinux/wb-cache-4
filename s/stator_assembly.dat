Hot gas from the gas generator was routed to the turbine inlet manifold which distributed the gas to the inlet nozzles where it was expanded and directed at a high velocity into the first stage turbine wheel. After passing through the first stage turbine wheel, the gas was redirected through a ring of stator blades and enters the second stage turbine wheel. The gas left the turbine through the exhaust ducting. Three dynamic seals in series prevented the pump fluid and turbine gas from mixing.

5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed <b>stator</b> <b>assembly.</b> The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy ...|$|E

This stator complex is anchored to an appropriate place around the rotor through a putative peptidoglycan-binding (PGB) domain in the periplasmic region of PomB (PomBC). To investigate {{the function of}} PomBC, a series of N-terminally-truncated and in-frame mutants with deletions between the transmembrane (TM) segment and the PGB domain of PomB was constructed. A PomBC fragment consisting of residues 135 to 315 (PomBC 5) formed a stable homodimer and significantly inhibited the motility of wild-type cells when overexpressed in the periplasm. A fragment with an in-frame deletion (PomBΔL) of up to 80 residues retained function, and its overexpression with PomA impaired cell growth. This inhibitory effect was suppressed by a mutation at the functionally critical Asp (D 24 N) in the TM segment of PomB, suggesting that {{a high level of}} Na+ influx through the mutant stator causes the growth impairment. The overproduction of functional PomA/PomBΔL stators also reduced the motile fractions of the cells.

Formed as rings, it avoids the resistance of contactangle hysteresis sliding over droplets, and hence dramatically reducing the static friction. Furthermore, surface tension facilitates the self-alignment of the rotor to the substrate and <b>stator</b> during the <b>assembly</b> and provides the stability against drift and shock during operation.

One of the first problems associated with deep space travel is electrical power production for systems on the spacecraft. Conventional methods such as solar power are not practical because efficiency decreases substantially as the craft moves away from the Sun. The criterion for power generation during deep space missions are very specific, the main points requiring high reliability, low mass, minimal vibration and a long lifespan. A Stirling generator, although fairly old in concept, {{is considered to be a}} potential solution for electrical power generation for deep space flight. A Stirling generator works on the same electromagnetic principles of a standard generator, using the linear motion of the alternator through the stationary stator which produces electric induction. The motion of the alternator, however, is produced by the heating and cooling dynamics of pressurized gases. Essentially heating one end and cooling another of a contained gas will cause a periodic expansion and compression of the gas from one side to the other, which a displacer translates into linear mechanical motion. NASA needs to confirm that the materials used in the generator will be able to withstand the rigors of space and the life expectancy of the mission. I am working on the verification of the epoxy adhesives used to bond magnets to the steel lamination stack to complete the stator; in terms of in-service performance and durability under various space environments.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} improving on-time delivery performance of stators in the high mix valve manufacturing cell at the Milford facility of Waters Corporation {{with a focus on}} efficient line design without exceeding the average WIP levels observed in the current system. A detailed study of the current process was done and it was concluded that the poor on-time delivery performance of <b>stators</b> to the <b>assembly</b> department could be attributed to the unacceptably long fabrication lead times-due to the long waiting induced by the fabrication of a high mix of 28 different types of stators- and the lack of an efficient inventory management policy that makes the system susceptible to extreme situations of either stock-outs or inventory explosion. Therefore, a pull-type production system with a responsive fabrication line establishing WIP control and an end of line standardized finished goods inventory management was designed and implemented. An efficient line design was developed by dedicating lines for high volume and high mix parts and by placing in-process buffers to implement a Kanban based pull-type production process that in turn limits the amount of WIP as well. An overall lead time reduction from 21 days to 3 days was achieved through the implementation of this line design and a 40 % reduction in WIP levels was observed simultaneously. For standardizing the finished goods inventory management in order to maintain high service levels while eliminating the possibility of WIP explosion, a mixed inventory review policy or the (s,S) policy-that uses a re-order point to trigger production at appropriate times and a base stock level that maintains an upper control limit on the inventory levels- is suggested for implementation. With this policy, a calculated service level of at least 96 % is expected even for high demand periods alongside a 50 % reduction in average finished goods inventory levels. by Snegdha Gupta.

40|$|Rotating {{machines}} serves {{an important}} role in many different applications. Extensive research has been made, manly during the last century, in order to develop these systems and understand the dynamics. The theory of rotordynamics differs in many fundamental aspects from structural dynamics and is therefore usually treated as an own research area. In rotordynamical applications there exist several qualitatively different concepts. For example super- and subcritical machines supported on different types of bearings like ball-, roller- or journal bearings etc. At the early stage of the product development, the problem is often to find a general tool which can be used for dynamical evaluation of these concepts. Many concepts also contain significant nonlinearities which need to be studied separately. One such nonlinearity is a clearance which arises between a fixed support and an axially movable bearing assembly. Another nonlinear effect is the loss of contact which can occur in preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings. The aim is hence to present a method to dynamically evaluate different rotordynamical concepts, describe nonlinear effects due to these contact problems and suggest suitable design parameters. For the concept evaluation a linear model which captured the gyroscopic effect is proposed, while the contact problems are handled with nonlinear models (usually piecewise linear). The governing equations of motion are solved analytically in the linear case but needs to be simulated in the nonlinear cases. However, in some special cases it is possible to find steady state solutions even for the contact problems. Simulations of design spaces, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, contact forces etc. have been used to study the systems. In order to evaluate different concept, design spaces spanned by a requirement variable and three design parameters are plotted. These are four dimensional plots where the variations of the requirement variables are visualised by colours. This is done both for the unbalance response and an impact in order to include both the homogenous and particular solution. In the clearance problem bifurcation diagrams and Poincaré maps indicates that multi-, quasi- or chaotic motions are possible which in many cases include impacts. When stabilising rods are applied the unstable areas (positive maximum Lyapunov exponent) are reduced. In the case with the spherical roller thrust bearings nonperiodic motions are found. The stability shows strong dependency on the amount of preload. A method to dynamically evaluate rotordynamical concepts is suggested. Some especially interesting ranges of the design parameters which give low vibrations are presented. It has further been shown that strong nonlinear dynamics which may lead to failure can be expected in systems with clearance between the <b>stator</b> and bearing <b>assembly.</b> One {{way to get rid of}} such unwanted vibrations is to apply stabilising rods. It is than important to choose the right parameters since otherwise worse conditions may occur. In systems supported by preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings it is important that the preloading is high enough. Otherwise jump phenomenon and nonperiodic motions can arise. An expression of the limit preload of going in or out of full contact has been derived which can be used to choose a suitable preloading. Godkänd; 2003; 20070215 (ysko...|$|R

The flagellar motor of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica is powered by an inward-directed electrochemical potential difference of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. The flagellar motor consists of a rotor made of FliF, FliG, FliM and FliN and a dozen stators consisting of MotA and MotB. FliG, FliM and FliN also act as a molecular switch, enabling the motor to spin in both counterclockwise and clockwise directions. Each stator is anchored to the peptidoglycan layer through the C-terminal periplasmic domain of MotB and acts as a proton channel to couple the proton flow through the channel with torque generation. Highly conserved charged residues at the rotor–stator interface are required not only for torque generation but also for <b>stator</b> <b>assembly</b> around the rotor. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding of the structure and function of the proton-driven bacterial flagellar motor...|$|E
40|$|Rotation of the sodium-driven polar {{flagellum}} of Vibrio alginolyticus requires four motor proteins: PomA, PomB, MotX, and MotY. PomA and PomB form a sodium-ion {{channel in}} the cytoplasmic membrane that {{functions as a}} stator complex to couple sodium-ion flux with torque generation. MotX and MotY are components of the T-ring, which is located beneath the P-ring of the polar flagellar basal body and is involved in incorporation of the PomA/PomB complex into the motor. Here, we describe {{the determination of the}} crystal structure of MotY at 2. 9 Å resolution. The structure shows two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (MotY-N) and a C-terminal domain (MotY-C). MotY-N has a unique structure. MotY-C contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding motif that is remarkably similar to those of peptidoglycan-binding proteins, such as Pal and RmpM, but this region is disordered in MotY. Motility assay of cells producing either of the MotY-N and MotY-C fragments and subsequent biochemical analyses indicate that MotY-N is essential for association of the stator units around the rotor, whereas MotY-C stabilizes the association by binding to the peptidoglycan layer. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the mechanism of <b>stator</b> <b>assembly</b> around the rotor...|$|E
40|$|The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center has {{developed}} a revolutionary 32 in. diameter Levitated Ducted Fan (LDF) conceptual design. The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} viable non-contact propulsion system utilizing Halbach arrays for all-electric flight, and many other applications. This concept will help to reduce harmful emissions, reduce the Nation s dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate many of the concerns and limitations encountered in conventional aircraft propulsors. The physical layout consists of a ducted fan drum rotor with blades attached at the outer diameter and supported by a stress tuner ring at the inner diameter. The rotor is contained within a stator. This concept exploits the unique physical dimensions and large available surface area to optimize a custom, integrated, electromagnetic system that provides both the levitation and propulsion functions. The rotor is driven by modulated electromagnetic fields between the rotor and the stator. When set in motion, the time varying magnetic fields interact with passive coils in the <b>stator</b> <b>assembly</b> to produce repulsive forces between the stator and the rotor providing magnetic suspension. LDF can provide significant improvements in aviation efficiency, reliability, and safety, and has potential application in ultra-efficient motors, computers, and space power systems...|$|E
40|$|MotA and MotB are {{integral}} membrane proteins {{that form the}} stator complex of the proton-driven bacterial flagellar motor. The stator complex functions as a proton channel and couples proton flow with torque generation. The stator must be anchored to an appropriate place on the motor, and this is believed to occur through a putative peptidoglycan-binding (PGB) motif within the C-terminal periplasmic domain of MotB. In this study, we constructed and characterized an N-terminally truncated variant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium MotB consisting of residues 78 through 309 (MotBC). MotBC significantly inhibited the motility of wild-type cells when exported into the periplasm. Some point mutations in the PGB motif enhanced the motility inhibition, while an in-frame deletion variant, MotBC(Δ 197 - 210), showed a significantly reduced inhibitory effect. Wild-type MotBC and its point mutant variants formed a stable homodimer, while the deletion variant was monomeric. A small amount of MotB was coisolated only with the secreted form of MotBC-His 6 by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, suggesting that the motility inhibition results from MotB-MotBC heterodimer formation in the periplasm. However, the monomeric mutant variant MotBC(Δ 197 - 210) did not bind to MotB, suggesting that MotBC is directly involved in <b>stator</b> <b>assembly.</b> We propose that the MotBC dimer domain {{plays an important role}} in targeting and stable anchoring of the MotA/MotB complex to putative stator-binding sites of the motor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} an advanced turbomachinery forced prediction model to two representative turbomachinery cases: an HP turbine and a rig fan. The approach {{is based on an}} integrated non-linear multi-passage analysis that includes both the stator and the rotor bladerows. The numerical model has advanced features such as non-linear friction damping for turbine blades, tip gap flows and blade vibratory motion. A series of inviscid and viscous computations were performed for an HP turbine with 36 stator and 92 rotor blades. The peak-to-peak maximum displacements were predicted with and without root friction dampers and the findings were compared against available experimental data. Good agreement was observed in most cases. It was found that most of the unsteady forcing was due to the potential effects. In a second phase of the turbine work, the response to low engine-order excitation was predicted using a multi-row whole-annulus model. The <b>stator</b> <b>assembly</b> was assumed to have blades with varying throat widths and the magnitude of the unsteady aerodynamic forcing was found to increase with increasing scatter in throat width variation. A second forced response study was conducted for a rig fan with 15 variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) and 20 rotor blades. For a 30 VIGV opening, a good match was observed between the predicted and measured wake profiles. Similarly, the measured and predicted rotor blade vibration levels were also found to be in good agreement. It is concluded that the proposed methodology can be applied, with reasonable confidence, to the study of industrial cases...|$|E
