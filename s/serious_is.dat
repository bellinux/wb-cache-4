5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less <b>serious</b> <b>is</b> the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E

25|$|Cobb {{angle is}} a common measure to {{classify}} scoliosis. The greater the angle, the more <b>serious</b> <b>is</b> the disease but the smaller {{is the number of}} patients.

25|$|<b>Serious</b> <b>is</b> an {{observational}} {{documentary series}} {{made by the}} BBC and broadcast {{as part of their}} children's programming.

Reviews for So <b>Serious</b> <b>were</b> more positive than for Art Contest, with some reviewers sharply contrasting the two. Tim Sendra of Allmusic wrote that [...] "Art Contest was a slab of formulaic punk-pop bereft of inspiration and hooks...So Serious makes no radical changes but is about 100 percent better and less cute, more real." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{actus reus}} is the wound or infliction of {{grievous bodily harm}} (GBH). A [...] "wound" [...] is {{something}} that breaks all layers of the skin, and must have an external component [...] internal bleeding, however <b>serious,</b> <b>is</b> not a wound. Serious wounds would also fall under grievous bodily harm, but some qualifying wounds (a pin prick, for example) are very minor. Some wounds would therefore not qualify as grievous bodily harm.|$|E

Girma expressed sympathy and condolence (through Indian President Pratibha Patil) to the victims and their families and reiterated his belief that the Indian government and its people would overcome the situation. Prime Minister Meles reiterated to Manmohan Singh that “We (the world) is witnessing how <b>serious</b> <b>is</b> the danger we all are facing from those who care little for the innocent and who are prepared to resort to the worst form of barbarity to promote their objective. We condemn these barbaric acts and extend sympathy to the people of India”. Similarly, Seyoum Mesfin expressed sorrow over the death of innocent civilians and damage to property. He also expressed (through his Indian counterpart) sympathy to the Indian people and bereaved families.|$|E

Species in danger of {{extinction}} include the jaguar, puma, the black bear, the green parrot, the Veracruz partridge, and the Humboldt butterfly, mostly due to human activities. Endangered plant species include the biznaga gigante (Echinocactus platyacanthus), the chapote (Diospyros riojae), the guayamé (Abies guatemalensis), the magnolia (Magnolia dealbata) and the peyote (Lophophora diffusa). monarch butterflies {{can be found in the}} area as well, as they pass through to their wintering grounds on the State of Mexico-Michoacán border [...] There have been plagues in the forests of the area due to the recent drought conditions. The most <b>serious</b> <b>is</b> a bark beetle (Dendroctonus adjunctus) and mistletoe (Arceuthobium sp.). The drought conditions have been blamed on global climate change. Areas in Querétaro and Guanajuato have been declared as biosphere reserves. The Sierra Gorda in Hidalgo has not, but it still contains a large number of important ecosystems.|$|E
2500|$|HipHopDX wrote [...] "Lyrically, Atlanta-bred T.I. (TIP to {{kids around}} the way) isn't far behind {{a lot of}} other gifted young cats tryin' {{to make it in the}} rap game. But rather than doing {{stand-up}} on the mic or seeing how many words he can rhyme with Versaci, this 20-year-old tells wonderfully-detailed stories on I'm Serious about coming up when all the elements try to keep you down. But T.I.'s at his best when he uses his head and not his, well, head. Similarly, I'm Serious gets it done by talking about familiar hip hop topics (gats, girls and makin' green), but doing it in a way that somehow comes off as fresh and original." [...] Rhapsody writer Sam Chennault wrote [...] "The opening salvo from one of Southern hip-hop's most charismatic emcees, I'm <b>Serious</b> <b>is</b> more introspective and less bombastic than T.I.'s subsequent work. [...] "Still Ain't Forgave Myself" [...] and [...] "What Happened" [...] are surprisingly tender, though [...] "Dope Boyz" [...] and the Neptunes-produced [...] "What's Your Name" [...] set the stage for the emergence of T.I.'s playa/pusha persona." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 Wells wrote Icons of Evolution, {{in which}} he claims, [...] "What the {{textbooks}} don't explain, however, is that biologists have known since the 1980s that the classical story has some serious flaws. The most <b>serious</b> <b>is</b> that peppered moths in the wild don't even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it turns out, have been staged." [...] The arguments were dismissed by Majerus, Cook and Bruce Grant who describes Wells as distorting the picture by selectively omitting or scrambling references {{in a way that}} is dishonest. Professional photography to illustrate textbooks uses dead insects because of the considerable difficulty in getting good images of both forms of moth in the same shot. The scientific studies actually consisted of observational data rather than using such photographs. The photographs in Majerus's Melanism: Evolution in Action are unstaged pictures of live moths in the wild, and the photographs of moths on tree-trunks, apart from some slight blurring, look little different from the [...] "staged" [...] photographs. While an experiment did involve the gluing of dead moths to trees, this practice was just one of many different ways used to study different individual elements of the overall hypothesis. This particular experiment was not meant to exactly reproduce natural conditions but instead was used to assess how the numbers of moths available (their density) affected the foraging practices of birds.|$|E
