The simple gillnets used were made of monofilament nylon of 30 to 140 mm mesh size an of different heights. The relative abundance of the S. nasutus caught was analysed monthly and a positive relationship was found between catches per unit effort in number and biomass. The relative catches were more abundant for the nets of 40 and 50 mm, mesh size. Catches were characterized by clear temporal variations and a predominance of medium size fish throughout the study period. The <b>selectivity</b> <b>curve</b> of gillnets for S. nasutus in this ecosystem was obtained. The catch obtained was compared with the available catch for each mesh size, and the available catch for a certain length of fish was calculated starting from the theoretical <b>selectivity</b> <b>curve.</b> The 50 mm mesh size gillnet showed the best fit between real and available captures and was considered the most suitable, because a smaller mesh size resulted in a catch of predominantly immature specimens.

40|$|Lake Tana’s 15 large Barbus species {{form the}} only known intact endemic cyprinid species flock left in the world. The barbs {{contribute}} around {{one third of the}} total annual catch of the motorised commercial gillnet fishery which was introduced in 1986. A dramatic reduction of the adult Barbus stocks and the even lower proportion of recruits {{at the end of the}} 1990 s, show the necessity for the development, implementation and control of fisheries legislation in Lake Tana. The reproductive biology of the Barbus species, essential for fishery management, is poorly known. This paper presents results on size at maturity, size at harvest and gillnet <b>selectivity</b> <b>curves,</b> which can be used to provide a scientific base for management proposals. Size at maturity varied widely among the Barbus species, ranging from 18. 8 cm in Barbus brevicephalus to 44. 3 cm in Barbus crassibarbis. Males matured at smaller size and reached smaller maximum length than females. Estimated <b>selectivity</b> <b>curves</b> fitted closely or were slightly larger than the observed length-frequency distribution of the commercial catch. The vast majority (85 %) of barbs landed by the commercial gillnet fishery were mature. Fishing pressure on juvenile, immature fish is unlikely to be the cause of the observed decrease in Barbus stocks. Size control regulations like mesh sizerestrictions, intended to protect the immature part of fish populations are expected to have little positive effects on the Barbus stocks and are therefore not recommended. The drastic reduction in barbs during the 1990 s is most like due to recruitment overfishing, that is, poorly regulated high fishing effort by the commercial gillnet fishery on the spawning aggregations of adult barbs during their annual breeding migration in river mouths and surrounding floodplains. Only effort control regulations limiting the gillnet fishery in the spawning season and/or areas will prevent a total collapse of the Barbus stocks as has happened to other cyprinids in African lakes. Such measures have to be implemented urgently to guarantee the conservation of Lake Tana’s unique biodiversity as a sustainable source of cheap protein and as a natural laboratory to study the evolutionary processes underlying speciation in freshwater fish...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Fisheries often target {{individuals}} {{based on}} size. Size-selective fishing can create selection differentials on life-history traits and, when those traits have a genetic basis, may cause evolution. The evolution of life history traits affects potential yield and sustainability of fishing, {{and it is}} therefore an issue for fishery management. Yet fishery managers usually disregard the possibility of evolution, because little guidance is available to predict evolutionary consequences of management strategies. We attempt to provide some generic guidance. We develop an individual-based model of a population with overlapping generations and continuous reproduction. We simulate model populations under size-selective fishing to generate and quantify selection differentials on growth. The analysis comprises a variety of common life-history and fishery characteristics: variability in growth, correlation between von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K and L∞), maturity rate, natural mortality rate (M), M/K ratio, duration of spawning season, fishing mortality rate (F), maximum size limit, slope of <b>selectivity</b> <b>curve,</b> age at 50...|$|E

The dynamic applications of the model {{as well as its}} applications in Computational Neuroscience are demonstrated and a learning algorithm based on postsynaptic delays is proposed. The TNLI incorporates temporal dynamics at the neuron level by modelling both the temporal summation of dendritic postsynaptic currents which have controlled delay and duration and the decay of the somatic potential due to its membrane leak. Moreover, the TNLI models the stochastic neurotransmitter release by real neuron synapses (with probabilistic RAMs at each input) and the firing times including the refractory period and action potential repolarisation. The temporal features of the TNLI make it suitable for use in dynamic time-dependent tasks like its application as a motion and velocity detector system presented in this paper. This is done by modelling the experimental velocity <b>selectivity</b> <b>curve</b> of the motion sensitive H 1 neuron of the visual system of the fly. This application of the TNLI indicates its potential applications in artificial vision systems for robots. It is also demonstrated that Hebbian-based learning can be applied in the TNLI for postsynapti...|$|E
40|$|In the Tasmanian rock lobster {{assessment}} model, as in {{many other}} assessment models, selectivity is treated as a fixed effect. The actual size composition in the population is estimated by dividing the survey catch in each size class by the size-specific selectivity. Recently, it has been found that larger lobsters tend to inhibit smaller lobsters from entering traps. We suggest that, as larger lobsters are removed from the population by harvesting, the number of smaller lobsters in the catch increases because they become more catchable. To determine the effect of a change in selectivity pattern on our perception of population composition, we applied <b>selectivity</b> <b>curves</b> that accounted for the effects of a change in size composition to sampling data from a population of lobsters that had seen a substantial decline in large legal-sized lobsters due to harvesting over the last 35 years. The results suggest that recent recruitment is lower than the recruitment that occurred in the 1960 s, but this is masked in the unadjusted sampling data by changes in selectivity. This could contribute to masking of a stock–recruitment relationship. If this is a common phenomenon in crustacean trap fisheries, the assessment approaches now in use may be more risk prone than previously realised...|$|R

40|$|Enforcing {{a minimum}} legal fish size is a {{possible}} policy rule for managingrecreationalfisheries. However, success of such rules highly depends on an effective reduction of a mortality of released under-sized individuals. A very high post-release mortality is currently observed for certain species, which cancels any benefit of fish size limitation. Here we explore the effectiveness of limiting both gear characteristics and fish size. This management approach is aimed at biasing catches toward legal-sized individuals and minimizing the catches of under-sized fish. Specifically, size selection of fishes induced by hooksize was evaluated for the near-shore boat recreationalfishery from the BalearicIslands (NWMediterranean). First, we evaluated the effects of different hooksizes on catch (number of individuals and species composition) and yield (biomass). Results showed how the number of captures was significantly reduced when using large hooks but bigger specimens and more valued species were caught. Moreover, the total yield remained unchanged, and the incidence of under-sized fish was significantly reduced. Second, the comparison of <b>selectivity</b> <b>curves</b> (i. e., logistic curves relating fish size and probability of being fished) corresponding to different hooksizes showed differences between two groups of species: those with small-mouth area, such as Coris julis or Diplodus annularis and those with larger mouth areas like Serranus scriba. Small-mouth species tend to display larger selectivity: the curves for each hooksize are steeper, {{and there is more}} of a split between the curves. The results presented here motivated the authority in charge of managing the recreationalfishery at the BalearicIsland to stipulate a minimum legal hooksize. The trade-offs of this rule between angler interest and conservation goals are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
