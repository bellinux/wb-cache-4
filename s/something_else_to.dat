500|$|Wichita was a {{railroad}} terminal and {{a destination for}} cattle drives from Texas. Like other frontier railroad terminals, when the cowboys accompanying the cattle drives arrived, the town was filled with drunken, armed cowboys celebrating {{the end of their}} long journey. Lawmen were kept busy. When the cattle drives ended and the cowboys left, Earp searched for <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do. A newspaper story in October 1874 reported that he earned some money helping an off-duty police officer find thieves who had stolen a man's wagon. Earp officially joined the Wichita marshal's office on April 21, 1875, after the election of Mike Meagher as city marshal (or police chief), making $100 per month. He also dealt faro at the Long Branch Saloon. In late 1875, the Wichita Beacon newspaper published this story: ...|$|E

500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do afterwards; or {{he had just been}} somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The Funny Little Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E
500|$|Already on {{the second}} day of the {{convention}} it was speculated that the [...] "band of four", four libertarian-leaning members of Parliament, considered leaving the party. The four were Oscar D. Hillgaar, Roy Wetterstad, Ellen Christine Christiansen and Stephen Bråthen. The alternative to leaving the party was to mark themselves as dissenting party members. On the third day, news surfaced that the four had talked together. In the news program Dagsrevyen on 17 April, the band of four stated a desire to follow the 1993 party platform and not later resolutions. They were met by a demand from Carl I. Hagen that they continue on the [...] "terms laid down by the national convention or find <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do". He later added that if the band of four left the parliamentary group, they should [...] "scram". To sum up, he said that the libertarians, which were known to be a minority, had gained too much influence, and was set back by the national convention. Øystein Hedstrøm demanded that the four leave the party. Because of the fierce personal antagonism at the convention, it was dubbed as the [...] "national convention at Dolkesjø"—derived from dolk, the Norwegian word for dagger.|$|E
500|$|... "Father's Day" [...] was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Piper stated that this was her favourite episode of the first series, and the most emotionally taxing for her to perform. SFX praised the way the concept of time was explored {{as well as the}} accurate representation of the '80s, and stated that Dingwall gave [...] "one of the series' best performances" [...] as Pete Tyler. However, the reviewer thought that the Reapers were the let-down of the episode, finding that [...] "the episode doesn't feel as much like horror as it should". Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode an A for the emotional impact and the acting. Blumburg did note, however, that there were [...] "enormous logical gaps" [...] involving [...] "glowing TARDIS keys and under-explained paradoxes". In 2013, Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton described it as [...] "a time-travel tale with immense heart" [...] and highlighted the shift of identification from the Doctor to Rose and the acting of Piper and Dingwall. Braxton, on the other hand, felt that the Reapers were redundant and the episode would have done [...] "equally well if you scythed the Reapers from the script". Reviewing [...] "Father's Day" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins gave it a grade of [...] "A", finding the story powerful. In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith praised the emotion and the dilemma, which he felt was not heavy-handed. He was also positive about the direction and Dingwall's performance, though he felt that removing the Doctor from the plot suggested that he would have done <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> resolve it, and he was not a fan of the scene where the Doctor tells two ordinary people how important their lives are, because it was [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "disconnected" [...] {{from the rest of the}} story. Coauthor Graeme Burk was also positive, writing that it may be [...] "the best story this season". He called the direction [...] "wonderful" [...] and the script [...] "sublime", and noted how the story was more about family than time travel.|$|E

500|$|Reid's ideas, however, [...] "were prosaic in the extreme". [...] His {{promotions}} included printing {{the sports}} section on green newsprint and a pocket-sized magazine for television listings that initially stopped the Sunday paper's circulation skid, but proved an empty product. [...] The Tribune turned a profit in 1956, but the Times was rapidly outpacing it in news content, circulation, and ad revenue. [...] The promotions largely failed {{to hold on to}} the Tribunes new audiences; the Sunday edition began to slide again and the paper fell into the red in 1957. Through the decade, the Tribune was the only newspaper in the city to see its share of ad lineage drop, and longtime veterans of the paper, including Bigart, began departing. The Reids, who had by now turned their mortgage into stock, began seeking buyers to infuse the Tribune with cash, turning to John Hay [...] "Jock" [...] Whitney, whose family had a long association with the Reids. [...] Whitney, recently named ambassador to Great Britain, had chaired Dwight Eisenhower's fundraising campaigns in 1952 and 1956 and was looking for <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> engage him beyond his largely ceremonial role in Great Britain. [...] Whitney, who [...] "did not want the Tribune to die", gave the newspaper $1.2 million over the objections of his investment advisors, who had doubts about the newspaper's viability. The loan came with the option to take controlling interest of the newspaper if he made a second loan of $1.3 million. [...] Brown Reid expected the $1.2 million to cover a deficit that would last through the end of 1958, but by that year the newspaper's loss was projected at $3 million, and Whitney and his advisors decided to exercise their option. The Reids, claiming to have put $20 million into the newspaper since the 1924 merger [...] initially attempted to keep editorial control of the paper, but Whitney made it clear he would not invest additional money in the Tribune if the Reids remained at the helm. [...] The family yielded, and Helen, Whitie and Brown Reid announced Whitney's takeover of the newspaper on August 28, 1958. The Reids retained a substantial stake in the Tribune until its demise, but Whitney and his advisors controlled the paper.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{some words}} of his own, they were not {{contented}} with this variety of argument, but attempted to have him assassinated. During this period, Ronsard began writing the epic poem the Franciade (1572), a work that was never finished and is generally considered a failure due to its versification—a decasyllabic meter of rimes plates that corresponds poorly with the genre of epic poetry—as well as the poem's proposition that Charles IX (and the French nation) was a descendent of [...] "Francus," [...] a supposedly hitherto unknown son of Prince Hector of Troy who was constructed entirely from Ronsard's imagination. The metre (the decasyllable) could not but contrast unfavourably with the magnificent alexandrines that Du Bartas and Agrippa d'Aubigné were shortly to produce; the general plan is feebly classical, and the very language has little or nothing of that racy mixture of scholarliness and love of natural beauty which distinguishes the best work of the Pléiade. The poem could never have had an abiding success, but at its appearance it had the singular bad luck almost {{to coincide with the}} massacre of St Bartholomew, which had occurred about a fortnight before its publication.

She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. But at least she remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum is just <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E
