The final was a contest between her and Maria Sharapova, whose passage to the final included three three-set matches each lasting over three hours. She, however, handily defeated Li in just over 90 minutes, increasing her clay-court winning streak to 16 and avenging her Australian Open semifinal loss to Li earlier in the year.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{was drafted}} first {{overall in the}} 2016 WNBA Draft by the Seattle Storm. She would play {{alongside}} superstar veteran point guard Sue Bird. Stewart immediately made an impact in the league as she scored 23 points in her debut game against the Los Angeles Sparks. As the season progressed, Stewart continued to dominate offensively as she scored a career-high 38 points in a win against the Atlanta Dream, which {{is the second most}} points scored in a game in franchise history, behind Lauren Jackson's 47 points.

2500|$|Eventually, Vigilance got {{underway}} and maneuvered {{inside the}} confused harbor before finally dropping anchor {{for the night}} to ride out the storm as it blew itself out. The dawn revealed three LST's aground and a YMS on her side on the rocks. After recovering her anchor and chain, Vigilance resumed minesweeping operations in the Japanese home waters. <b>She</b> <b>swept</b> off Honshū {{for the remainder of}} the month of September, anchoring upon occasion at Wakanoura Wan, and chalked up 16 more mines swept. Accompanying LCI's or PGM's sank by gunfire those mines which the sweeper cut loose. On the 24th, Vigilance herself destroyed a mine with 20-millimeter and [...]30-caliber rifle fire.|$|E

[...] On 23 September, {{the day of the}} unopposed landings, <b>she</b> <b>swept</b> 21 mines before a contact mine fouled her gear and forced her to retire to the disposal area to rid herself of both her port sweeping gear and the otherwise inextricable, offending mine. Tumult departed Ulithi on 25 September with a convoy of transports bound for Dutch New Guinea.|$|E

2500|$|Tumult {{immediately}} began sweeping the anchorage and, {{in the following}} days, helped to remove minefields at the harbor entrance. [...] During most of September, <b>she</b> <b>swept</b> off the eastern coast of Honshū, clearing Sagami Wan and Ishinomaki Wan. [...] While the minesweeper was anchored in Tokyo harbor on the 27th, a motor whale-boat capsized nearby in heavy seas. [...] Tumult launched her own whaleboat and rescued 20 survivors from the stormy waters of the bay. [...] Early in October, the minesweeper sat out a typhoon in Tokyo Bay; then got underway for Sasebo where she stopped before departing Japan for sweeps in area [...] "Klondike" [...] in the Yellow Sea.|$|E
2500|$|Vigilance {{remained}} alongside USS Briareus for 17 {{days before}} returning to Okinawa {{at the end of}} August. By that time, the war in the Pacific was over. She remained at Buckner Bay from 1 to 7 September and got underway at noon on the 8th, bound for Wakayama, Japan, to support the occupation of the erstwhile enemy's home islands. At 0430 on the llth, Vigilance arrived at the southern entrance to Kii Suido and soon formed up in echelon formation to commence sweeping a channel — to a [...] depth — through Kii Suido to Wakayama. That evening she anchored at Wakayama Ko but resumed her labors early the following day and continued the routine for the next few days. <b>She</b> <b>swept</b> one mine on the 15th.|$|E
2500|$|... "I had {{resolved}} on {{a voyage}} around the world, {{and as the}} wind {{on the morning of}} April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the Spray had been moored snugly all winter. The twelve o'clock whistles were blowing just as the sloop shot ahead under full sail. A short board was made up the harbor on the port tack, then coming about she stood to seaward, with her boom well off to port, and swung past the ferries with lively heels. A photographer on the outer pier of East Boston got a picture of her as <b>she</b> <b>swept</b> by, her flag at the peak throwing her folds clear. A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harder and Hake {{remained}} off Dasol Bay, {{searching for}} new targets. [...] Before dawn 24 August they identified {{what they thought}} was a Japanese minesweeper and the three-stack Siamese destroyer Phra Ruang. It was later found out to be Kaibokan CD-22 and PB-102 (ex-). [...] As Hake closed to attack, the destroyer turned away toward Dasol Bay. Hake broke off her approach, turned northward, and sighted Harders periscope about [...] dead ahead. Swinging southward, Hake then sighted the CD-22 about [...] off her port quarter swinging toward them. To escape the charging escort, Hake started deep and rigged for silent running. At 07:28 she heard 15 rapid depth charges explode in the distance astern. She continued evasive action that morning, then returned to the general area of the attack shortly after noon. <b>She</b> <b>swept</b> the area at periscope depth but found only a ring of marker buoys covering a radius of one-half mile.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} sixties and early seventies, when Charles, Prince of Wales played for the Cambridge side, polo at Oxford enjoyed a winning streak with eight wins in a row. Ironically, {{one of the strongest}} teams ever entered saw this streak ending. In 1974, Shahid Ali and A. Goetz were both on three goals, with the {{remaining}} players one-goalers. Cambridge could only form a team with a total handicap of minus one but were nonetheless victorious. Many of the players from this period are now well-known figures in the polo world. General Sir Redmond Watt played off a two-goal handicap while at university and subsequently became one of the highest rated Old Blue after the war when he peaked at five-goals. [...] Claire Tomlinson (née Lucas), who was rated at nought-goals at university, became one of polo’s few true masters of the number one position and the first woman in the world to rise to five goals. <b>She</b> <b>swept</b> away the rule forbidding women in British high-goal and became the first to compete on equal terms with men at the top tier. Her participation in the Varsity Match 1964 as the very first female player was a milestone {{in the history of the}} match. In 1966, she became the very first female captain of OUPC. It was also through the coaching of her father Arthur Lucas and his Easter Vacation Training Camps at Woolmer's Park, at the home of the Lucas family, that many young riders got encouraged to start playing polo at university.|$|E
2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, said last night that he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since <b>she</b> <b>swept</b> the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E
