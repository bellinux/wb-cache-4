One such tool is the Gene Ontology (GO), a classification designed {{to act as}} a universal index for gene products from any species. The Gene Ontology is used extensively in annotating gene products and analysing gene expression data, yet very little research exists from a library and information science perspective exploring the design principles, philosophy and social role of ontologies in biology. Aim: To explore how molecular biologists, in creating the Gene Ontology, devised guidelines and rules for determining which scientific concepts are included in the ontology, and the criteria for how these concepts are represented. Methods: A domain analysis approach was used to devise a mixed methodology to study the design of the Gene Ontology. Concept analysis of a GO term and a critical discourse analysis of GO developer mailing list texts were used to test whether ontological realism is a tenable basis for constructing objective ontologies. A comparison of the current GO vocabulary construction guidelines and a study of the reasons why GO terms are removed from the ontology further explored the justifications for the design of the Gene Ontology. Finally, a content analysis of published GO papers examined how authors use and cite GO data and terminology. Results: Gene Ontology terms can be presented according to different epistemologies for concepts, indicating that ontological realism {{is not the only way}} objective ontologies can be designed. Social roles and the exercise of power were found to play an important role in determining ontology content, and poor <b>synonym</b> <b>control,</b> a lack of clear warrant for deciding terminology and arbitrary decisions to delete and invent new terms undermine the objectivity and universal applicability of the Gene Ontology. Authors exhibited poor compliance with GO data citation policies, and in re-wording and misquoting GO terminology, risk exacerbating the semantic problems this controlled vocabulary was designed to solve. Conclusions: The failure of the Gene Ontology to define what is meant by a molecular function, the exercise of power by GO developers in clearing contentious concepts from the ontology, and the strict adherence to ontological realism, which marginalises social and subjective ways of classifying scientific concepts, limits the utility of the ontology as a tool to unify {{the molecular}} biology domain. These limitations to the Gene Ontology design could be overcome with the development of lighter, pluralistic, user-controlled ‘open ontologies’ for gene products that can work alongside more traditional, ‘top-down’ developed vocabularies...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we problematise {{the notion of}} {{authority}} as it appears in discourse relating to school discipline. The account of authority that dominates is narrow and restricted, and the term is sometimes used as a <b>synonym</b> for <b>control.</b> This prohibits full consideration {{of the range of}} relationships in which authority manifests itself. We draw on sociological and philosophical literature, and argue that a multi-dimensional concept of authority may offer a more nuanced framework for theorising student-teacher relationships in schools. We consider how each of the forms of authority outlined by Wrong (200266. Wrong, D. H. 2002. Power: its forms bases and uses, 3 rd edn., London : Transaction Publishers. View all references) -coercive, legitimate, competent, personal and authority by inducement-may have some application to the classroom setting. In particular we explore the concept of 'personal authority' and its potential to enhance understanding of the contested and under-theorised concept of authority. We begin by exploring ways in which the current policy context presents challenges to particular forms of authority...|$|R

Results, gained in this way, is sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to explain in qualitative way and {{to draw the}} general conclusions. There-fore analytical approach using simple basic models may submit more insight into basic features of tested device behavior in an electric power system (EPS) than numerical calculations at real-like system model. The paper presents such an approach for Unified Power-Flow Controller (UPFC), which may be considered a <b>synonym</b> for multi-parameter <b>controlled</b> FACTS device. The basic goal is to acquire impact of an UPFC on voltage stability enhancement and voltage control respectively. Therefore it is positioned into the standard model, widely used for voltage stability representation purposes. In the paper the mathematical solution {{of the problem is}} explained and the impact of the UPFC on voltage stability is shown...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} lies in {{analysis}} of modern approaches to understanding of {{the essence of the}} state audit and presentation of definition of its essence. On the basis of systematisation and generalisation of scientific works, analysis of the international practice in the sphere of control of state finances the article justifies the authors’ own understanding of the role and content of the state audit. In the result of the study the article reveals origin and essence of the control and audit terms and proves that they cannot be used as <b>synonyms.</b> Audit and <b>control</b> in the sphere of state finances were compared on the basis of comparison of goals, tasks, organisation of work, responsibility, forms and results of their conduct. Prospect of further studies is the legislative definition and differentiation of the “state control”, “state audit”, “state financial control” and “state internal financial control” notions. Further development of scientifically justified terminology in this sphere would become a basis for development of the concept of creation of the system of control of state finances, which would correspond with high world standards...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} or complex medical or {{psychiatric}} conditions are treated by many practioners, including general practitioners (GPs). Formal liaison between primary and specialist is often assumed to offer benefits to patients. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the efficacy of formal liaison of GPs with specialist service providers on patient health outcomes, by conducting a systematic review of the published literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases using the following search terms: 'family physician': synonyms of 'patient care planning', 'patient discharge' and 'patient care team'; and <b>synonyms</b> of 'randomised <b>controlled</b> trials'. Seven studies were identified, involving 963 subjects and 899 controls. Most health outcomes were unchanged, although some physical and functional health outcomes were improved by formal liaison between GPs and specialist services, particularly among chronic mental illness patients. Some health outcomes worsened during the intervention. Patient retention rates within treatment programmes improved with GP involvement, as did patient satisfaction. Doctor (GP and specialist) behaviour changed with reports of more rational use of resources and diagnostic tests, improved clinical skills, more frequent use of appropriate treatment strategies, and more frequent clinical behaviours designed to detect disease complications. Cost effectiveness could not be determined. In conclusion, formal liaison between GPs and specialist services leaves most physical health outcomes unchanged, but improves functional outcomes in chronically mentally ill patients. It may confer modest long-term health benefits through improvements in patient concordance with treatment programmes and more effective clinical practice...|$|R

In view of global aging {{and the associated}} increasing burden of cardiovascular disease, older people form an important target population as well. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated whether Web-based interventions for cardiovascular risk factor management {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease in older people. Embase, Medline, Cochrane and CINAHL were systematically searched from January 1995 to November 2014. Search terms included cardiovascular risk factors and diseases (specified), Web-based interventions (and <b>synonyms)</b> and randomized <b>controlled</b> trial. Two authors independently performed study selection, data-extraction and risk of bias assessment. In a meta-analysis, outcomes regarding treatment effects on cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, smoking status, weight and physical inactivity) and incident cardiovascular disease were pooled with random effects models. A total of 57 studies (N= 19, 862) fulfilled eligibility criteria and 47 studies contributed to the meta-analysis. A significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean difference - 2. 66 mmHg, 95 % CI - 3. 81 to - 1. 52), diastolic blood pressure (mean difference - 1. 26 mmHg, 95 % CI - 1. 92 to - 0. 60), HbA 1 c level (mean difference - 0. 13 %, 95 % CI - 0. 22 to - 0. 05), LDL cholesterol level (mean difference - 2. 18 mg/dL, 95 % CI - 3. 96 to - 0. 41), weight (mean difference - 1. 34 kg, 95 % CI - 1. 91 to - 0. 77), and an increase of physical activity (standardized mean difference 0. 25, 95 % CI 0. 10 - 0. 39) in the Web-based intervention group was found. The observed effects were more pronounced in studies with short (< 12 months) follow-up and studies that combined the Internet application with human support (blended care). No difference in incident cardiovascular disease was found between groups (6 studies). Web-based interventions have the potential to improve the cardiovascular risk profile of older people, but the effects are modest and decline with time.

40|$|The {{empirical}} genesis {{for this}} novel inter-disciplinary dissertation was the devastating global financial crisis. A separate and simultaneous Irish crisis {{was located in}} the banking sector. The financial market domain, based in its own unique set of norms, and replete with shifting risk concerns and a criminogenic nature, exceeded the authorisations and boundaries of the regulatory control domain with disastrous results. These crises revealed market actor conduct control issues including: questionable risk management practices; fraudulent behaviour; breaches of trust; business culture concerns; governance, control system and regulatory failure; business disclosure and transparency inadequacies; ethical concerns including conflicts of interest; and, ineffectual sanctioning. They presented as both opportunity and motivational driver for the public financial regulatory reform agenda, a socially significant issue. The chosen research lens was the financial regulatory police pairing of criminal and administrative sanctioning, where the prime research issue was coordinated interplay strategy reform, targeted to improve market actor compliance. Three shifting paradigms, those of the financial markets and their two financial regulatory coercive control components, the criminal law and regulation, are the backdrop to the research interrogation. Each paradigm reflects a discrete normative system, and post-crisis each has not settled and is still shifting. Historically, they simultaneously developed and cross-fed. Hobbes and his contemporary Locke theorised contractarianism; the rule of law; and, political autonomy which the state took up from the market and re-branded as laissez faire. For modern democracy, Habermas has recognised that autonomy is the normative key with restriction secondary. Polanyi has argued that restriction was a societal countermovement which established control autonomies, which themselves required constraint. Within public regulation, restriction is regulation, a <b>synonym</b> for coercive <b>control,</b> policing, enforcement and ultimately sanction. Because sanction lies across both the criminal law and regulation their interplay is a vital concern. Within this public regulation, connections were sought between the two coercive policing components, the criminal law and regulation, so as to interrogate their interplay. Because it was ideally suited to a reform or change context the Kuhnian paradigm was engaged to accomplish this. This analysis entailed an instrumental approach based around the norms or assumptions underpinning the coercive control paradigms within the market paradigm context. Thus, a modern normative theoretical framework was developed to test the connections which were found. The framework drew upon both regulatory norms and rule of law values. It was based in Dicey’s rule of law values conceptualisation, drew upon Packer’s control and due process values complex continuum, and employed both Macrory’s accountability and transparency regulatory norms, and Braithwaite’s values-driven regulatory enforcement pyramid. Within the over-arching autonomy and restriction tension, the three exemplar connective tissues identified for specific interrogation between Teubner’s two black boxes of control, the criminal law and regulation were: (harm) risk management, the values complex, and the offence/sanction dependent axis. Washing the normative theoretical framework through these connections identified the viability of a new enforcement system contained within an expert to expert regulatory contract, which re-balanced the autonomy and restriction dyad. It encompassed improved sanction capability, and promised improved compliance consistent with regulatory norms and rule of law values. A fused reform sanction interplay strategy consisting of various integrated parts {{was found to be}} viable. Irish financial regulation which pre-crisis failed to maximise the enforcement interplay, presented as an ideal case study for these reform proposals. Post-crisis, it was concluded that many international best practice standards which emerged from the analysis, were not operationalised in Ireland, while, the new regulatory contract model, and the sit-under fused interplay strategy, were equally not mobilised...|$|R
