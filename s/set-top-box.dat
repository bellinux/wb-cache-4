Recording on such boxes, known as Personal Video Recorders or PVRs, is more convenient, as programmes may be easily selected for recording from an on-screen programme guide, with no need to specify explicit start and end times for recordings, and no need to program more than one piece of equipment.|$|E

500|$|During {{its peak}} years in early 2000, SpongeBob SquarePants {{received}} enormous ratings {{and number of}} viewers. By 2012, {{it was reported that}} the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the show might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger, directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.

40|$|Abstractâ€”On-demand video {{delivery}} with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) solely {{based on}} <b>set-top-boxes</b> {{has been introduced}} recently. This architecture combines the load balancing and fault tolerating features of peer-to-peer systems with stableness of a server based CDN by storing contents in <b>set-top-boxes.</b> Since the <b>set-top-boxes</b> usually have much longer online time than traditional PC based peers, they are ideal for On-demand video services. Currently, videos are separated into pieces and randomly stored in boxes. Requests from clients are redirected to the nearest boxes. However, random strategy may lead to some costly and inefficient allocations, for example, a video part could be placed much further than {{other parts of the}} same video, while two close boxes hosting the same part. This paper aims to reduce downloading cost by exploiting the network location of boxes when allocating the videos. We show that optimizing the allocation is NP-hard. Two locality-based online heuristics which support transient boxes are proposed. Simulations with realistic network settings demonstrate that our heuristics have comparable performance to an existing approximate algorithm and outperform the random allocation. I...|$|R
