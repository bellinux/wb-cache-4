40|$|I. Histologica! {{studies of}} calf skin In {{the case of}} tanning of leather and manufaeturing of gelatin, the skin always must be soaked in lime solution. Then the tissues and organs in the skin will {{make a lot of}} morphologically {{remarkable}} changes. Accordingly, in th first place the writer has observed minutely the tissues and organs of the backskin of the Holstein calf. The principal results obtained are as follows : 1. There was no great difference between the skin of the Holstein species and that of others. The former was composed of epidermis, corium and subcutaneous tissue that existed in animals skin in general. 2. The lucidum layer on that epidermis of the back skin, the appearance of which had not been reported, was discovered in this reserch. 3. The papillate layer of calf skin, occupying 45 ^ of all skin thickness, was comparatively thicker than that of the matured cattle skin, -while the reticular layer of calf skin was relatively thin. It was recognized distinctly that the sweat gland and the hair of calf skin were inferior in development to those of the matured cattle skin. 4. There was a little difference between the type of. collagen fibre in the papillate layer ani that in the reticular layer. The rcil form of the so-called grain layer was morphologically not yet clearly recognized. In the; collagen fibre, the kittsubstance was recognized. 5. In the case of the elastic fibre, it was picked up ani left alone for a long time, special striped figures similar to micula emerged {{in the center of the}} elastic fibre. From a distributing point of view, it was considered that there were twojtypes in the elastic fibre. II. On the change of the calf skin during the process of liming It was researched how the tissue of t'le skin suffered changes when it was soaked in the lime solution. The results are as follows : 1. When the raw skin was soaked in the saturate! <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> every cellular element of skin took various forms to be dissolved, and most of them vanished within 72 hours. The cells of sweat glands and arectorpili muscles were the earliest, and every call in epidermis the next and the cell, in the hair follicle the last to be solved. 2. The keratin substance which composed the epidermis was dissolved in the lime solution. But layers in the epidermis separated not individually from one another, but together from the part of the corium. In this case the internal part of the epidermis melted and became one membrane-like plate. 3. The kittsubstance amon 3 the tissues Wire dissolved early, and tissues came to be in isolated states. When this state was over the remaining tissues (collagen fibres) swelled and occupied the space which was produced by the separation. 4. The collagen fibres began to swvell immediately after soaking, an 1 increased the degree of expansion as time passed, but began to separate from one another after about 72 hours owing to the dissolution of kittsubstanca. At the same time the fine fibres also begin to swell ani continued to separate from one another for about 7 days. Afterwards the spaces were not recognized because of the swelling. ^The collagen fibres in papillate layers was earlier in separation and expansion than those in reticular layers. 5. The elastic fibres swelled little by little, and the changes in the form were not recognized so clearly. 6. Some of the cells of the sebaceous gland made little change by lime soaking, except the nuclear change by lims soaking, but the nucleus in those cells made a change of form or was dissolved. It was not possible for the cytoplasma of the cells in raw skin to be stained by acid fuchsin, but they -were stained when soaked in lime solution. 7. The medulla of hairs did not make so much of a chage as others did, but the cells surrounding to support the hairs ･were dissolved, and so the hairs were isolated from one another into a floating condition. Moreover, this floating condition was thought to be enlarged by the spaces of sweat glands. Nevertheless, the hair became fixed by the pressure of the swelled collagen fibre because of the long soaking in the lime solution. 8. According to the facts mentioned above, it was thought best to unhair, after the skin were soaked for 5 or 8 days in lime solution at 18 °C. In comparison with various former theories of unhairing, it was proved that the chief cause of unhairing was the change in the form, produced by collapse of the tissue. III, On the change of fixed calf skin during the process of liming 1. Every tissue and organ in the skin, when it was fixed with formalin, stood against the lime action, and the resistance made a great difference in degree according to the variety of the tissue. 2. It took a long time for the cellular substance of skin to make changes, and it took about 30 days from the day on which it began to show the beginning of change to the dissolution, and each of the processes of change was not equal to each other. It became hard from staining on the fifteenth day or so after being soaked in lime solution. 3. The state of separation of the collagen fibre, from between the epidermis and the corium and from the corium was unsettled and indefinite. Especially the collagen fibres in the reticular layer was indefinite in separation. 4. The kittsubstance in every tissue and organ of the fixed skin grew strong against the lime solution. The floating condition of the collagen fibre and the hair was extremely rarely seen. The suitable time for unhairing cannot be determined, and the complete dehairing does not take place. IV. On the change of skin digested by trypsin 1. Being digested with trypsin, the skin lost the elastic fibres chiefly. That is to say, the fine elastic fibre which was complicated around every tissue and organ in the papillate layer began to vanish at first, and then gradually the large bundles of the elastic fibre in the reticular layer and the telasubcutanea were broken. All the elastic fibres disappeared within 20 hours. * 2. Being digested with the trypsin for. 20 hours, the collagen fibre swelled a little, but remarkable changes were not seen in from. The tissue, composed of keratin, seemed to be denaturated, but no great change was recognized in form. V. Histochemical studies on the reaction in the skin treated by lime solution 1. The collagen fibre degenerated and presented reaction of acidity or neutrality by soaking the raw skin in lime solution. In the case of treating the collagen fibre with silver nitrate, there appeared little dots in stripes. 2. The elastic fibre presented the basic character. That is the elastic fibre combined with lime, formed the protein base, and therefore presented remarkable reactions to the special pigments and was stained better than in the case of raw skin. Silver grains were not recognized in the place Where the elastic fibre existed. 3. The epidermistic tissue (including epidermis) also presented basic character by liming. 4 - The contents of the sebum cutaneum in the sebaceous gland are very complicated, and the reaction by lime solution is not always equal. It was considered that the sebum cutaneum seldom saponifies. The effect of taking fat away by liming was considered to be chiefly in breaking the supporting tissue...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: The current project was undertaken to study the inhibitory activity <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> in artificial urine and in the real urine of South African black and white subjects and also to assess the effects on urinary risk {{factors in the}}se subjects after its ingestion. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Experiments commenced with the preparation of artificial urine (AU) in which the effects <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> <b>solutions</b> (0. 125 - 1. 00 mglml) were tested by carrying out various crystallization experiments. These included the determination of the calcium oxalate (CaOx) metastable limit (MSL); particle volume-size distribution (PSD), nucleation, aggregation and growth assays. Crystal deposition was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In vitro experiments were then conducted in 24 hour urine samples from healthy South African black (n = 5) and white males (n = 5). The above-mentioned crystallization experiments were repeated in these urines. In addition, free Ca²⁺ values and the Bonn risk index (BRI) of CaOx crystallization were determined. Thereafter, a trial study in which 5 black and 4 white subjects ingested <b>solutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> powder for 7 days was conducted. 24 hour urine samples were collected by subjects before and after the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Urines were analysed for pH, sodium, potassium, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid chloride, magnesium, phosphate, and creatinine. Urine composition values were used as input data for the calculation of relative supersaturation (RS) values for calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD), brushite and uric acid using the computer programme EQUIL and Tiselius Risk Index (TRI) was also determined. The above-mentioned CaOx crystallization experiments were also performed. Urine compositions, crystallization data and physicochemical risk indices were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: None <b>of</b> the <b>lime</b> <b>solutions</b> did affect the CaOx MSL of the AU or the real urine (in vitro). However CaOx crystal nucleation was promoted while CaOx crystal growth and aggregation were inhibited. In the trial study, after ingestion <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> <b>solutions,</b> significant increases in urinary magnesium (1. 80 vs 2. 75 mmol/ 24 h, p = 0. 0001) and phosphate (20. 9 vs 24. 6 mmol/ 24 h, p = 0. 023) were observed in black subjects. On the other hand, in white subjects, a significant decrease in urinary oxalate (0. 313 vs 0. 205 mmol/ 24 h, p = 0. 023) and TRI (304 vs 187, p = 0. 0102) were noted. However, lime did not increase citrate levels to a significant degree in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this dissertation have shown that lime may be regarded as a potential therapeutic agent for reducing the risk of CaOx kidney stones in the white group based on the trial study. The results also provide further evidence in support of the hypothesis that {{there is a difference between}} the black and white populations with respect to their handling of lithogenic and antilithogenic dietary challenges. However, rigorous controlled trials in healthy subjects and in kidney stone patients need to be conducted in future studies to explicitly confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{studied the}} effect of the process {{parameters}} (pH, concentration of Ca 2 +) on precipitation of humic acids contained in the filtrate of solid waste in the process of its decontamination using <b>lime.</b> The content <b>of</b> contaminants in the filtrate was monitored through the employment of well-known methodologies using methods of optical molecular and atomic spectroscopy; pH values were monitored through the employment of the potentiometric method. In some cases, chemical oxygen demand was measured to identify changes of the content of organic substances in the <b>solution.</b> Concentration <b>of</b> humic substances was identified by measuring the absorption spectra in the UV and in the visible range and by applying the calibration curve. Samples of humic and fulvic acids produced by Ecoanalitika Open Joint Stock Company were used for benchmarking purposes. The optimal amount <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> milk for the purpose of precipitation of humic substances in the filtrate is equal to 24 g/l. It is proven that any further increase <b>of</b> the <b>lime</b> milk flow is limited by the increase of the residual calcium concentration in the purified <b>solution.</b> Consumption <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> milk in the course of clarification of filtrates may be reduced by sharing it with calcium salts. By adding 10 % of calcium chloride to the lime milk content, lime milk consumption may be reduced by 50 %. Изложены результаты экспериментального изучения процесса осветления интенсивно окрашенного фильтрата ТБО при обезвреживании фильтрата известковым способом для оптимизации параметров осуществления этого процесса. Установлено оптимальное количество известкового молока для осаждения гуминовых веществ из фильтрата. Показано, что при дополнительном введении в процесс обезвреживания фильтрата ТБО солей кальция совместно с известковым молоком снижается расход извести, повышается степень очистки фильтрата и достигается более высокое его осветление...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare-associated {{infections are}} an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} among hospitalized patients worldwide. Transmission of health care associated pathogens generally occurs via the contaminated hands of health care workers. Hand hygiene has long been {{considered one of the most}} important infection control measures to prevent health care-associated infections. For generations, hand washing with soap and water has been considered a measure of personal hygiene. As early as 1822, a French pharmacist demonstrated that <b>solutions</b> containing chlorides <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> or soda could eradicate the foul odor associated with human corpses and that such solutions could be used as disinfectants and antiseptics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of data regarding hand washing and hand antisepsis in healthcare settings. In addition, it provides specific recommendations to uphold improved hand-hygiene practices and reduce transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to patients and personnel in healthcare settings. This article also makes recommendations and suggests the significance of hand health hygiene in infection control...|$|R
