5|$|Written by Phil Ford. This story {{idea was}} planned as fourth {{episode of the}} second series. It {{originated}} from a strange phone Russell T Davies recalled having where the line suddenly went dead followed another person’s voice speaking. The episode would have focused on Owen and have involved his medical background as <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phones causes a series of deadly suicides across Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|An American {{punk rock}} band from Long Island, New York named {{themselves}} after the film's alternative title, Horror Planet. Their eponymous theme song contained lyrical references to horrific {{aspects of the}} plot. The song was not released as a record but was circulated on cassette demonstration tapes prior to the only official release by the band. In 1985, Horror Planet released a professionally produced recording on an EP record with hand-painted fabric sleeves. The songs from the Horror Planet record were subsequently re-released in their entirety on the anthology CD compilation, <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Water: the Secret History of Long Island Punk, by Winged Disk Records.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{education}} and health education have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> purpose, {{both of which are}} to promote the physical and mental development of students. They also have <b>something</b> overlapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> content, for both are to teach students knowledge and skills of sports and health. College sports have flexible and diverse forms and can act as a good carrier for health education of college students. To better combine them, colleges and universities need to strengthen the training of sports teachers and improve curriculum design and curriculum evaluation...|$|R
5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip {{the washing machine}} but fail to do so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that something has indeed happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the skies}} over Iraq's border with Turkey, an Iraqi fighter pilot shoots down a UFO. Later, in Lexington, Tennessee, a truck driver named Ranheim shoots <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark as another UFO flies overhead. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the sighting the next day, but Ranheim is quickly let go by the uncooperative local authorities. In a seemingly inconsequential event, a woman briefly borrows Scully's pen before they leave Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of}} the Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E

5|$|In some instances, {{choices in}} {{dialogue}} will alter and affect the story through short or long-term consequences. For {{each one of}} <b>the</b> choices, <b>something</b> good <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short-term could turn out worse later.|$|R
25|$|Del Bascom — {{independent}} investigator {{who runs}} a large conventional detective agency in Manhattan. Wolfe sometimes subcontracts to Bascom when he {{needs a lot of}} men for <b>something</b> (as <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Silent Speaker).|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Arthur Dales, now living in a Florida trailer park, calls Mulder and Scully for help when a neighboring family disappears; and, with a hurricane approaching, Mulder and Scully find themselves trapped {{with a group of}} residents in a building where there is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying for gas {{and said he had}} to get <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trunk of his car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that day on a $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident almost an hour later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway waited in a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student debit card with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E
50|$|Artificial demand {{constitutes}} {{demand for}} <b>something</b> that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence {{of exposure to}} the vehicle of creating demand, would not exist. It has controversial applications in microeconomics (pump and dump strategy) and advertising.|$|R

25|$|Sibelius {{had done}} <b>something</b> similar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Symphony No.5's first movement, which {{combines}} {{elements of a}} standard symphonic first movement with a faster scherzo. However, the Seventh symphony contains much wider variety within one movement.|$|R
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E
5|$|Social insects, such as termites, ants {{and many}} bees and wasps, {{are the most}} {{familiar}} species of eusocial animal. They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms. It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates (and indeed {{one of the few}} non-human groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment. In this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown. Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees, bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors. Bombus terrestris, for example, exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar, yet rewarding flowers, when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

30|$|Although the {{two stories}} of {{activism}} are profoundly different, their possible contribution to urban politics to come {{has to do}} with their ability to mobilise citizens who feel that the activism under their scrutiny has <b>something</b> <b>in</b> common with <b>the</b> hardships of their everyday lives. This <b>something</b> is embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> activists’ narratives, as described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> above sections, and their being soaked with a sense that any tolerable threshold of the acceptance of injustice has been exceeded by {{what is going on in}} their home city.|$|R
