25|$|The ZR1 special engine {{package was}} a $1,221.00 option {{available}} exclusively with the LT-1 engine option. It included the solid-lifter small-block engine, heavy-duty four-speed transmission, power brakes, aluminum radiator, and a revised suspension with special springs, shocks, <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar,</b> and spindle-strut shafts. Since it was competition equipment, the ZR1 {{could not be}} ordered with power windows, power steering, air conditioning, a rear-window defogger, wheel covers, or a radio. Only 53 1970-1972 ZR1's were built (25 in 1970, including 8 convertibles, 8 in 1971, and 20 in 1972).|$|E

25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar.</b> The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|Drive train {{options for}} the model were either a 5-speed manual (W50) or an {{optional}} 4-speed automatic transmission (A40D). Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear.

The car also came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes and featured a four-link rear suspension with coil springs, lateral track bar, and <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar.</b> The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts and a <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, double wishbone front suspension and <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar,</b> and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod with coil springs and <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar.</b> The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses power-assisted four-piston front and two-piston rear ventilated disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to control wheels that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a locking differential without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal locking differential setups.|$|E

2500|$|The sports-oriented model, {{known as}} the [...] "SE" [...] in North America and [...] "Sportivo" [...] in Australasia, was {{developed}} by Toyota Australia. It features a black [...] "honeycomb" [...] grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels. To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers. Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in spring rate, thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a [...] "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only). Interior changes include charcoal-colored sports fabric and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel. In addition to the sports-oriented suspension setup, Toyota Australia's standard-grade suspension calibration has also been adopted by New Zealand, the Middle East and North America. The suspension geometry consists of independent MacPherson struts, L-arms, coil springs, gas dampers and a ball-jointed <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> at the front, with the rear setup comprising dual-link independent MacPherson struts with coil springs, gas dampers and ball-jointed <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 2003, for the 2004 model year, the GX 470's {{transmission}} was {{upgraded to}} a sealed unit with no dipstick. An optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) became {{available as a}} late-year addition. KDSS freed and adjusted the vehicle's <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> for greater articulation allowing the wheels to move with less restriction over uneven terrain, and used front and rear hydraulic pressure-sensing valves and larger <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> to reduce body roll during on-road conditions. Safety upgrades for 2004 included a roll-sensing feature for the side curtain airbags, a tire pressure monitoring system, and an optional rear backup camera system.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{for this}} year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types.

The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over [...] The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar.</b> Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
2500|$|SS396 sport coupes and {{convertibles}} {{used the}} same Malibu sport coupe and convertible bodies with reinforced frames and revised front suspension: higher-rate springs, recalibrated shocks, and thicker front <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar,</b> but with different exterior trim.

The FE7 Gymkhana [...] "off-road" [...] suspension included stiffer springs and a stiffer front <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> with no ordering restrictions. The new $7 FE7 suspension option was included with the Z07 package — The $400 package (also included H.D. power brakes) was available for L82 and LS4 cars with M21 transmission. 1974 was {{the end of an era}} for the Corvette with the last true dual exhaust systems, the last without a catalytic converter and the last use of the [...] big block engine.|$|E
50|$|The AE86 used {{ventilated}} disc brakes. The car {{was equipped with}} a MacPherson strut style independent suspension at the front and a four-link live axle with coil springs for the rear. <b>Stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> were present at both ends.|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the safety and {{road-holding}} capabilities of vehicles, manufacturers have begun a trend toward increasing vehicle body roll resistance by introducing stiffer roll-stabilizer bars. In this study vehicle suspension and road surface models are developed to investigate the effects of such <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> on ride quality. The purpose of the research {{is to determine the}} need for further studies in the area of active roll stabilizer systems. Two dynamic vehicle models are developed: the simplified front-car model and the full-vehicle-body three-degree-of-freedom model. The effects of the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> on ride quality are then studied through the use of asymmetric road surface profiles. Discrete, periodic, and random road surface models are used to excite the vehicle models. Emphasis is placed on random road models and predicting the vehicle response using spectral input/output techniques...|$|R

2500|$|Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader, {{published}} in 1965, is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features, and reluctant {{to spend money}} on improving safety. The subject for which the book is probably most widely known, the rear-engined GM Chevrolet Corvair, is covered in the first chapter. It relates to the first (1960–1964) models that had a swing-axle suspension design which was prone to [...] "tuck under" [...] in certain circumstances. In substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> (anti-roll bar), Corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15psi front, 26psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was a dangerous oversteer.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these features, Riviera {{sales for}} 1971 dropped to 33,810, the lowest to date.

For 1973, the [...] engine became standard, with [...] with the Stage One package, which {{also included a}} limited slip differential and a chrome-plated air cleaner. The [...] "Gran Sport" [...] package was still available as a separate option package consisting of a ride-and-handling package that included a rear <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar,</b> JR78-15 whitewall steel-belted radial tires, a specially tuned [...] "radial roadability" [...] suspension, additional sound insulation and special [...] "Gran Sport" [...] badging. Sluggish sales of the third generation Riviera led GM {{to believe that the}} boattail deck lid was too radical for most customers' tastes, so in 1973 it was blunted and made slightly shorter. The design change however only led to a marginal increase in sales, with 34,080 being produced for the model year.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car {{for that}} model year. [...] "Now it's beautiful," [...] said the {{brochure}} of Nova's all-new sheet metal, [...] "refined {{along the lines}} of elegant European sedans." [...] Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova's efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by an inch and a half, and the front <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the Camaro and Pontiac Firebird), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had fixed side windows (or optional flip-out windows) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had cut-pile carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater glass area. Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars. The base model carried the inline Six-cylinder , , three V8 engines ( [...] , a 1975-only option, a [...] and a [...] ) for 1976 only, were offered.

2500|$|... 1974 Chevelles {{featured}} new grilles, new taillights and [...] rear bumpers (in {{addition to}} the [...] front bumper added in '73). The Laguna name had debuted on the 1973 Chevelle as the top-line series in all body-styles, but the 1974 Laguna Type S-3 came only as a coupe, which combined Laguna luxury with the superior road manners of the SS which it replaced. Handling was further enhanced {{with the addition of}} new GR70-15 radial-ply tires. The new Laguna S-3 sported the urethane front end with a revised grill and new parking lamps, augmented at the rear by new taillights. A federally mandated [...] chrome rear bumper replaced the body-colored steel [...] version from '73. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with horizontal ribs for a few dollars extra; body side striping, Laguna S3 badging, rally wheels, 4 spoke steering wheel as well as firmer shocks/springs, a front <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar,</b> and fat HR70x15 tires on Rally wheels. Front occupants rode in swivel bucket seats, and the driver faced a six-dial instrument cluster. Production totaled 15,792 cars, with prices starting at $3,723 - but with plenty of options to send the bottom line past $5,000. Engine offerings included a standard 145 horsepower (108kW) 350 two-barrel V8, with optional powerplants including a 150-horsepower (110kW) 400 two-barrel V8, 180 horsepower (130kW) 400 four-barrel V8 and 230 horsepower (170kW) 454 four-barrel V8, except in California where a 155-horsepower (116kW) 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 400 and 454 engines were optional.
