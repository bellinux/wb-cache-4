For 38 severe typhoons attacking the Japanese Islands during the period from 1951 to 1970, the pressure fields are objectively analyzed, fitting to the Schloemer's equation, and the posi-tion of pressure center and the parameters of pressure field are estimated. The results are sum-merized and the new <b>Standard</b> <b>Project</b> Typhoon is synthesized. The method to obtain surfacewind distribution of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Project</b> Typhoon is also proposed and two examples of compari-sons of estimated friction free winds with the observed surface winds are described...|$|R

40|$|Building owners, {{construction}} managers, {{and contractors}} need a scheduling model that quickly and economically develops a construction schedule from the conceptual information. This dissertation examines {{the use of}} multiple linear regression and computer simulation as methods to produce construction schedules. ^ The methodology of this research consisted of polling 54 construction experts to rank project milestones and parameters by importance. Values of the highest-rated milestones and parameters from actual projects were collected. This data was then used to demonstrate how regression and simulation could be used to develop the models. ^ There are four conclusions warranted from this research. The first and second conclusions are that owners, designers, and large and small builders from all regions of the United States generally agree upon lists of both <b>standard</b> <b>project</b> milestones and <b>standard</b> <b>project</b> parameters. Third, the demonstrated results show that regression analysis is useful for describing the relationship between the parameters and the timing of the <b>standard</b> <b>project</b> milestones. And fourth, computer simulation is not as useful to describe this relationship. ...|$|R
