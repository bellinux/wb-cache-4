40|$|Segmented poly (urethane-urea) (SPUU) fibers such as spandex fibers {{are usually}} {{produced}} by dry spinning process. The processing conditions for dry spinning of SPUU can be optimized by computer simulation. In this work, a simulation model is {{proposed for the}} dry spinning process where the SPUU dope in the liquid state is first extruded from the nozzle {{in the shape of}} spinline, then the solvent in the spinline is removed by the blowing of hot gas while elongated, and finally a few spinlines come to a fiber in the solid state after they are twisted. The deformation behavior, solvent concentration, temperature of spinline and so on can be predicted with this model. Governing equations composed of the equations of continuity, motion, energy, rheology and deflection were derived under the assumption of Newtonian fluid. Simulations for dry spinning process were carried out with various diffusion coefficients previously reported for two kinds of solvents (dimethyl formamid (DMF), dimethyl acetamide (DMAc)) and three measurement methods of diffusion coefficients (Moiré pattern, Film and Dope methods), where Moiré pattern method gives the mutual diffusion coefficient for the liquid-liquid system, Film method gives the diffusion coefficient of solvent into the film which changes from the solid state to the semisolid state during measurement, and Dope method gives the diffusion coefficient of solvent from the dope which changes from the liquid state to the (semi-) solid state during measurement. The temperature distribution in the <b>spinning</b> <b>chamber</b> was linearly approximated in the distribution close to a practical plant. The simulation model can predict the residual solvent concentration, temperature, cross sectional area, spinning stress and deflection of spinline. The simulation results denoted that the change of solvent concentration is mainly determined in the hot gas zone even if the diffusion coefficients are different. Therefore, the deformation behavior of spinline is chiefly governed in the hot gas zone. And there is little change found in the interim zone and blowing zone...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} flow in simplex fuel atomizers using the arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian method is presented. It {{is well established}} that the geometry of an atomizer {{plays an important role}} in governing its performance. We have investigated the effect on atomizer performance of four geometric parameters, namely, inlet slot angle, <b>spin</b> <b>chamber</b> convergence angle, trumpet angle, and trumpet length. For a constant mass flow rate through the atomizer, the atomizer performance is monitored in terms of dimensionless film thickness, spray cone half-angle, and discharge coefficient. Results indicate that increase in inlet slot angle results in lower film thickness and discharge coefficient and higher spray cone angle. The <b>spin</b> <b>chamber</b> converge angle has an opposite effect on performance parameters, with film thickness and discharge coefficient increasing and the spray cone angle decreasing with increasing convergence angle. For a fixed trumpet length, the trumpet angle has very little influence on discharge coefficient. However, the film thickness decreases, and spray cone angle increases with increasing trumpet angle. For a fixed trumpet angle, the discharge coefficient is insensitive to trumpet length. Both the spray cone angle and the film thickness are found to decrease with trumpet length. Analytical solutions are developed to determine the atomizer performance considering inviscid flow through the atomizer. The qualitative trends in the variation of film thickness at the atomizer exit, spray cone angle, and discharge coefficient predicted by inviscid flow analysis are seen to agree well with computational results...|$|R

The geometry studied used a 0. 74 mm orifice and is typical of a commercial aircraft engine. MIL PRF- 7024 was employed as the working fluid and two mass flow rates were studied. Particle Image Velocimetry data on a small simplex atomizer was collected and methods are detailed including the machining of the optically clear <b>spin</b> <b>chamber,</b> which properly replicates atomizer geometry, and challenges associated with seeding MIL PRF- 7024.

Since both magnetometer cells are traversed by almost the same magnetic flux as the UCN chambers, the average value of frequency measurements ωHe=(ωt,He+ωb,He)/ 2 yields a best guess for the neutron spin precession frequency ωn=(γn/γHe)ωHe, while the frequency difference determines the magnetic field gradient ∂|B|/∂ z=(ωt,He−ωb,He)/(γHe·Δ z) to a high precision. Here, Δ z is {{the distance between the}} centers of gravity of the upper and lower magnetometer vessel, ωt,He and ωb,He are the free spin precession frequencies of the 3 He in the top and bottom magnetometer vessels, respectively, and γHe is the 3 He gyromagnetic ratio.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the refilled gas pressure on the glass forming behaviour {{of one of the}} best ternary glass forming alloys Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 was studied for the melt spinning process. The amorphicity of as-quenched ribbons was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The refilled chamber atmospheric pressure is crucial to the cooling rate of melt spinning. At high vacuum, at pressure less than 0. 0001 atm, fully crystalline fragments are obtained. Monolithic amorphous ribbons were only obtained at a gas pressure of 0. 1 atm or higher. The extended contact length between thecribbons and the copper wheel contributes to the high cooling rate of melt <b>spinning.</b> Higher <b>chamber</b> gas pressure leads to more turbulence of liquid metal beneath the nozzle; therefore, lower pressure is preferable at practical melt spinning processes once glass forming conditions are fulfilled...|$|R

Most municipalities required the air chambers, although the length and diameter could vary from place to place. Plumbers would fabricate the air chambers on site, and the labor-intensive installation processes that would include a copper cap, solder, torch and flux. The brothers theorized that a prefabricated test nipple or air chamber would be a labor and time saving device that plumbers would embrace. They were right.

40|$|In {{a series}} of recent papers both Joshua Knobe (2003 a; 2003 b; 2004) and I (2004 a; 2004 b; forthcoming) have {{published}} the results of some psychological experiments that show that moral considerations influence folk ascriptions of intentional action in both non-side effect and side effect cases. 1 More specifically, our data suggest that {{people are more likely}} to judge that a morally negative action or side effect was brought about intentionally than they are to judge that a structurally similar non-moral action or side effect was brought about intentionally. So, for instance, if two individuals A and B place a single bullet in a six shooter, <b>spin</b> the <b>chamber,</b> aim the gun, and pull the trigger, but A shoots a person and B shoots a target, {{people are more likely to}} say that A shot the person intentionally than they are to say that B shot the target intentionally— even though their respective chances of success (viz., one-in-six) and their control over the outcome are identical in both cases. And while Knobe and I agree that our research creates difficulties for any analysis of the folk concept of intentional action that ignores the biasing effect of moral considerations, we disagree about how best to explain this effect...|$|R

50|$|The grooves are {{the spaces}} that are cut out, and the {{resulting}} ridges are called lands. These lands and grooves can vary in number, depth, shape, direction of twist (right or left), and twist rate. The spin imparted by rifling significantly improves {{the stability of the}} projectile, improving both range and accuracy. Typically rifling is a constant rate down the barrel, usually measured by the length of travel required to produce a single turn. Occasionally firearms are encountered with a gain twist, where the rate of <b>spin</b> increases from <b>chamber</b> to muzzle. While intentional gain twists are rare, due to manufacturing variance, a slight gain twist is in fact fairly common. Since a reduction in twist rate is very detrimental to accuracy, gunsmiths who are machining a new barrel from a rifled blank will often measure the twist carefully so they may put the faster rate, no matter how minute the difference is, at the muzzle end.|$|R
40|$|The J 2 X Gas Generator engine {{design has}} a spin start line {{connected}} {{near to the}} turbine inlet vanes. This line provides helium during engine startup to begin turbomachinery operation. The spin start line also acts as an acoustic side branch which alters the chamber's acoustic modes. The side branch effectively creates 'split modes' in the chamber longitudinal modes, in particular below the first longitudinal mode and within the frequency range associated with the injection-coupled response of the Gas Generator. Interaction between the <b>spin</b> start-modified <b>chamber</b> acoustics and the injection-driven response can create a higher system response than without the spin start attached to the chamber. This work reviews the acoustic effects of the spin start line as seen throughout the workhorse gas generator test program. A simple impedance model of the spin start line is reviewed. Tests were run with no initial spin start gas existing in the line, {{as well as being}} initially filled with nitrogen gas. Tests were also run with varying spin start line lengths from 0 " to 40 ". Acoustic impedance changes due to different spin start gas constituents and line lengths are shown. Collected thermocouple and static pressure data in the spin start line was used to help estimate the fluid properties along the line length. The side branch impedance model was coupled to a chamber impedance model to show the effects on the overall chamber response. Predictions of the spin start acoustic behavior for helium operation are shown and compared against available data...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for {{spin coating}} surfaces with liquid polymer comprises a <b>spin</b> coating <b>chamber</b> having a rotatable chuck for supporting an object to be coated. A distributor introduces gases into the chamber. A solvent vapor and carrier gas supply provides a carrier gas having a controlled level of solvent vapor therein {{within the range}} of from 0 to saturation concentrations of solvent vapor. A solvent vapor sensor is positioned with respect to the coating chamber to produce signals which correspond to the concentration of solvent vapor in the coating chamber. A control means is connected to the solvent vapor concentration sensor and to the solvent vapor and carrier gas supply means for controlling the level of solvent concentration in the carrier gas supplied by the solvent vapor and carrier gas supply means. The solvent vapor level can be obtained by controlled mixing of solvent-bearing and solvent-free gas streams, or by injection of solvent into a gas stream by means of an atomizer, for example. The solvent vapor concentration sensor includes a component positioned for exposure to solvent vapor and which has a property which changes {{as a function of the}} solvent vapor concentration to which it is exposed. A preferred sensor can include a membrane, the vibrational frequency of which changes as a function of the solvent vapor concentration to which it is exposed; a surface, an electrical property of which changes as a function of the solvent vapor concentration to which it is exposed; a sensor which detects an acoustical property which changes as a function of the solvent vapor concentration to which it is exposed; or an optical detector which detects an optical property which changes as a function of the solvent vapor concentration to which it is exposed...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the {{concentration}} and variability of ice nucleating {{particles in the}} subtropical, maritime boundary layer are reported. Filter samples collected in Cape Verde over the period 2009 – 2013 are analyzed with a drop freezing experiment sensitive to detect the few, rare ice nuclei active at low supercooling. The data-set is augmented with continuous flow diffusion <b>chamber</b> (<b>SPIN)</b> measurements at temperatures below − 24  °C from a two month field campaign at Cape Verde in 2016. The data set is used to address the questions: What are typical concentrations of ice nucleating particles active at a certain temperature, what affects their concentration, what is their composition and where are their sources? To investigate what the most common ice nuclei are and to identify the sources, bulk chemical aerosol composition obtained from the utilized filter samples is tested for correlations with ice nuclei concentration. It is shown that no significant correlation between the rare ice nuclei and the bulk aerosol chemical composition, which could serve as tracer for a specific aerosol class e. g. of maritime origin, can be made. Concentration of ice nuclei is found to increase exponentially with decreasing temperature. It indicates that several groups of particles with different ice nucleation properties (size, composition) are contributing to the ice nuclei concentration at different temperatures. The concentration of ice nuclei active at a specific temperature varies over a wide range. The frequency with which a certain ice nuclei concentration is measured within this range is found to follow a log-normal distribution. The log-normal frequency distribution {{can be explained by}} random dilution associated with turbulent, long-distance transport. To investigate the geographic origin of ice nuclei, source attribution of air masses from dispersion modeling is used to classify the data into 7 typical situations. While no source could be attributed to the ice nuclei active at temperatures higher than − 12  °C, concentrations at lower temperatures tend to be elevated in air masses originating from the Saharan desert...|$|R
