The <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> from the Nanjing YinMao Lead-Zinc Mine were investigated by multiple miner-alogical techniques in this paper.

Several elements such as O, Mg, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ca, K, S, Si, Al, As and Na were detected in the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> by electron microprobe analysis. Although the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> contained heavy metals, their concentrations in the leaching solution of the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> by ICP were less than the identification standard for hazardous <b>waste.</b> Therefore, the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> from the Nanjing YinMao Lead-Zinc Mine are not hazardous...|$|R

Organic <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> (OSW) belongs to the organic fraction of municipal <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> (MSW) and they act as enormous potential substrate for alternative source {{of energy in the}} form of bio-fuels. Nevertheless, these substrates are not easily biodegradable and the degree of biodegradability is solely dependent on the composition & characteristic of organic <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> in municipal <b>solid</b> <b>wastes.</b> The component responsible for recalcitrance of organic <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> is lignin that occurs in variable amounts in different plant residues. In order to remove the recalcitrance from organic fraction municipal <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> and to make it more easily degradable by microbial consortia, certain pretreatment techniques have been adopted and they are applied either individually or in combined way for enhancement of bio-methanation i. e anaerobic digestion (AD) process. The goal of pretreatment method is to make the cellulose in micro-fibrils available for hydrolysis and improve the rate of hydrolysis. This paper reviews pretreatment techniques including physical, physico-chemical, chemical, biological methods respectively. The various effects of pretreatment on organic <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> are discussed separately and pretreatment methods have been compared on the basis of cost, efficiency and suitability to substrate...|$|R

Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E

For one thing, the <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> do not become a "part" of the land in that the wastes are neither intimately mixed nor homogenized into the land as are liquid and gaseous wastes into their respective media. The waste particles retain not only their chemical identity but also their visible (i. e., physical) characteristics.
