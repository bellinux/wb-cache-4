5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne <b>stomach</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the Bachelor Thesis is "Patients with Ulcerous <b>Stomach</b> <b>Disease</b> and Duodena and their Observance of the Regime Precautions". In the Czech Republic the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> occurs with 3 to 10 % of the {{population}} and it afflicts patients particularly in their active age. The theoretical part describes the disease history, its classification, aetiopathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnostics, compilation, treatment, regime precautions, patient´s education {{and the role of the}} nurse in the nursing process. The practical part deals with three aims which were set at the beginning of the research. The first aim was to find out if the patients with the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena observe the regime precautions. The second aim was focused on the role of the nurse in the education of patients suffering from the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena. The last aim supposed to use the research results and elaborate information material concerning the regime precautions for patients suffering from the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena. Four hypotheses were made. The first hypothesis presumed that patients suffering from the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena know the regime precautions. The second hypothesis claimed that patients suffering from the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena follow the regime precautions. The third hypothesis said that patients suffering from the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena are aware of the importance of following the regime precautions. The fourth hypothesis supposed that nurses play an important role in the educational process of patients suffering from the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena. There was used the quantitative method of the research inquiry. The chosen technique for data collecting was the anonymous questionnaire. The research set formed patients with the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena from the Internal Department of the Hospital in Písek, from a General Practitioner Surgery in Písek, from the Internal and Surgery Department of the Hospital in Strakonice, from the Gastroenterology Department of the Hospital in České Budějovice and from the Internal Outpatients´ Department of the Clinic in Milevsko. On the basis of the evaluation of the anonymous questionnaire the first, the second and the third hypothesis was not proved. On the other hand the fourth hypothesis was proved. On the basis of the research inquiry there was elaborated information material concerning the regime precautions of the patients suffering from the ulcerous <b>stomach</b> <b>disease</b> and duodena. This material can be an inspiration for the educational activity of nurses too...|$|R

500|$|Not My Life {{begins with}} a black screen on which the words [...] "Human {{trafficking}} is slavery" [...] appear in white. A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. Many of the children die {{as a result of}} the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from skin and <b>stomach</b> <b>diseases</b> because of their diet of spoiled food—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking [...] "are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth." ...|$|E

50|$|Interest in {{understanding}} the role of bacteria in <b>stomach</b> <b>diseases</b> was rekindled in the 1970s, with the visualization of bacteria in the stomachs of people with gastric ulcers. The bacteria had also been observed in 1979, by Robin Warren, who researched it further with Barry Marshall from 1981. After unsuccessful attempts at culturing the bacteria from the stomach, they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982, when they unintentionally left their Petri dishes incubating for five days over the Easter weekend. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by bacterial infection and not by stress or spicy food, as had been assumed before.|$|E

50|$|DEAD box proteins, {{characterized}} by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated {{in a number of}} cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, which is an antigen recognized by autoimmune antibodies from a patient with watermelon <b>stomach</b> <b>disease.</b> This protein unwinds double-stranded RNA, folds single-stranded RNA, and may play important roles in ribosomal RNA biogenesis, RNA editing, RNA transport, and general transcription.|$|R
