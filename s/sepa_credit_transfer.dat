40|$|The {{objective}} of the pan-European regulatory and self-regulatory work related {{to the creation of}} the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is to improve the efficiency of low-value payments (i. e. retail payments) by establishing a common legal framework and the application of standards. Among the elements of the SEPA project, our focus will be on schemes, in particular the <b>SEPA</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> Scheme (SCT) already essentially implemented in the EU and Hungary, which we will discuss in detail, stressing the fact that SEPA is not a concrete payments system, but rather a set of procedural and legal rules regulating payment methods, in addition to the entire infrastructure supporting the clearing and settlement of transactions. In the longer term, the broad implementation of the schemes can potentially lead to a substantial reduction in costs for banks, which may ultimately be passed on to customers. We will present the practical experience gained in connection with the Credit Transfer Scheme, in light of the information compiled in the course of the central bank’s informative meetings conducted at the affected Hungarian banks. Currently, 12 banks now apply the Credit Transfer Scheme in Hungary. Due to the lack of a domestic euro infrastructure, domestic euro payments are carried out through international channels. Consequently, a much larger portion of euro transfers made by Hungarian banks have already shifted to the new SEPA format than what has been characteristic of retail payments within the euro area thus far. This phenomenon stems from the fact that initially, the <b>SEPA</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> Scheme offered a competitive alternative most simply from the perspective of cross-border transaction fees.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of euro in 2002 {{led to the}} creation of a single “domestic ” market for cash retail payments in euro. In order to create a single market for cashless payments as well, the European banking community, ahead by European Council Payments, has launched the Single European Payments Area project (SEPA) in 2002. The project designed new payment schemes for credit transfer and direct debit, as well as a card payments framework. <b>SEPA</b> <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> scheme was officially launched on 28 January 2008. The whole project is expected to be implemented by the end of 2010. In this paper we refer to the necessity of {{introduction of}} this ambitious project, to the essential features of its components and to its overall economic impact.

40|$|SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) {{is a new}} step in {{the move}} towards {{financial}} integration in Europe. SEPA will harmonise the use of payment instruments (credit transfers, direct debits and card payments) throughout SEPA (the 27 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). All the economic actors {{will be able to}} make cross-border euro payments in the same way as domestic euro payments, with the same obligations and liabilities. The European Commission has created a harmonised legal framework for payment services and the European Payments Council (EPC), unifying the banking sector, directs the process under a self-regulating regime. The Eurosystem monitors progress and developments in its catalyst role. For each of the SEPA payment instruments, the EPC has developed standards : “Rulebooks” for the credit transfer and direct debit payment instruments and a more general framework for card payments. Ultimately, the same credit transfer and direct debit payment instruments will be available and accessible to all users. Any SEPA payment cards will be accepted at any terminal in SEPA. Infrastructures will have to be adapted to meet the new payment standards, and consolidation is likely. SEPA is being created in phases. The design phase is now finished and from January 2008 onwards banks will offer their customers the <b>SEPA</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> in parallel with the existing national credit transfer. The SEPA Direct Debit will be launched in November 2009. By the end of 2010, the use of the national payment instruments should cease. For cards, banks will need up to the end of 2010 to streamline all standards. From 2011 onwards, only SEPA cards will be issued. In Belgium, the SEPA project is organised on two different levels : from a banking perspective and on a more general level with all stakeholders in the economy. A migration plan has been published and is regularly updated. Thanks to its long tradition of interbank cooperation, the Belgian banking sector is one of the leading banking communities in the migration to SEPA in Europe.

40|$|Research {{objectives}} and methods This thesis studies {{the effects of}} SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) on Finnish companies. SEPA is a project of the 27 EU member countries and five other European countries. With SEPA all euro payments will be treated as domestic payments, and the current differentiation between national and cross-border payments will cease. SEPA will bring benefits to companies, {{but they also have}} to make some changes in order to become SEPA compliant. The research objective is to find out how companies are preparing for SEPA and if SEPA is an opportunity for companies to reengineer their payment processes. The thesis includes a literature review of business process reengineering (BPR) as well as an empirical research of SEPA in Finnish companies. Cases study research method is used for the research, in which five major Finnish companies and one SME are interviewed. Though the main scope of the research is major companies, one SME was also interviewed to be able to compare SEPA effects in small and large companies. Findings of the research The findings of the research were that the companies thought SEPA offered possibilities for gaining benefits through reengineering payment processes. Most of the companies interviewed had though already started to centralize their payments handling and therefore had no need for further BPR because of SEPA. In several interviewed companies payments were centralized to a shared service center. The interviewed major companies usually had had a SEPA project, in which the required SEPA changes to their ERPs were done. Those companies saw SEPA at the moment as an IT project, but also thought that in the future the benefits of SEPA (e. g. centralization of payments and cash collection, consolidating banking connections) could be realized. In the SME interviewed SEPA did not require great changes, and they thought SEPA was something that IT providers should take care of and not companies. <b>SEPA</b> <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> was the only SEPA payment instrument all interviewed companies were going to start using, as for example SEPA direct debit was only going to be used in one company...|$|E
