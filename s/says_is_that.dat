500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment". One reason for this, he <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{although}} [...] "we see... lovely, endearing transsexuals" [...] portrayed in the show, [...] "what I don’t see is anything {{that is going to}} make people think or feel any differently about what gender is or how it limits us all in one way or another." [...] He lamented that their expressions of nuance in gender identity and discussions of genderqueerness were absent from the broadcast edit of the show.|$|E
500|$|Dean has {{commented on}} the {{dramatic}} distortions that arise from {{the suppression of the}} dialogue; the effect, he <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the action moves forward [...] "in a series of jerks, rather instead of by smooth transition", and that most of the minor characters are substantially diminished. Only late in the 20th century did dialogue versions become common in opera houses outside France, but there is still no universally recognised full score. Fritz Oeser's 1964 edition is an attempt to fill this gap, but in Dean's view is unsatisfactory. Oeser reintroduces material removed by Bizet during the first rehearsals, and ignores many of the late changes and improvements that the composer made immediately before the first performance; he thus, according to Susan McClary, [...] "inadvertently preserves as definitive an early draft of the opera". In the early 21st century new editions were prepared by Robert Didion and Richard Langham-Smith, published by Schott and Peters respectively. Each departs significantly from Bizet's vocal score of March 1875, published during his lifetime after he had personally corrected the proofs; Dean believes that this vocal score should be the basis of any standard edition. Lesley Wright, a contemporary Bizet scholar, remarks that, unlike his compatriots Rameau and Debussy, Bizet has not been accorded a critical edition of his principal works; should this transpire, she says, [...] "we might expect yet another scholar to attempt to refine the details of this vibrant score which has so fascinated the public and performers for more than a century". Meanwhile, Carmens popularity endures; according to Macdonald: [...] "The memorability of Bizet's tunes will keep the music of Carmen alive in perpetuity", and its status as a popular classic is unchallenged by any other French opera.|$|E

[...] What Bernoulli's principle actually <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> within a flow of constant energy, when fluid flows through a region of lower pressure it speeds up and vice versa. Thus, Bernoulli's principle concerns itself with changes in speed and changes in pressure within a flow field. It cannot be used to compare different flow fields.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, Leonore Tiefer of NYU School of Medicine voiced {{concerns}} {{that the success of}} Viagra, in combination with feminist rhetoric, were being used as a means of fast-tracking public acceptance of pharmaceutical treatment of female sexual arousal disorder.

[...] The first of these, Harris <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Carter discounts well-established claims that Israel accepted and Arafat rejected a generous offer to create a Palestinian state." [...] The second [...] "manifest distortion," [...] according to Harris, is that [...] "Carter states that Israel plans to build a security fence 'along the Jordan River, which is now planned as the eastern leg of the encirclement of the Palestinians'"; whereas well-informed observers know that [...] "Israel has modified the projected route of the security fence on numerous occasions (the current route roughly tracks the parameters that Clinton advanced to the parties in negotiations) and that there is no plan to hem the Palestinians in on the eastern border." [...] In omitting [...] "these well-known developments," [...] Harris argues, Carter is [...] "leaving readers to think that a route that was once contemplated in proposed maps but never adopted or acted upon represents current reality." ...|$|E

6000|$|Second. By whom or {{by what is}} {{this fear}} wrought in the heart? To this I shall answer in brief. It is wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God, working there at first as a spirit of bondage, on purpose to put us in fear. This Paul insinuateth, saying, [...] "Ye have not {{received}} the spirit of bondage again to fear" [...] (Rom 8:15). He doth not say, Ye have not received the spirit of bondage; for that they had received, and that {{to put them in}} fear, which was at their first conversion, as by the instances made mention of before is manifest; all that he <b>says</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> they had not received it again, that is, after the Spirit, as a spirit of adoption, is come; for then, as a spirit of bondage, it cometh no more. It is then the Spirit of God, even the Holy Ghost, that convinceth us of sin, and so of our damnable state because of sin (John 16:8,9). For it cannot be that the Spirit of God should convince us of sin, but it must also show us our state to be damnable because of it, especially if it so convinceth us, before we believe, and that is the intent of our Lord in that place, [...] "of sin," [...] and so of their damnable state by sin, because they believe not on me. Therefore the Spirit of God, when he worketh in the heart as a spirit of bondage, he doth it by working in us by the law, [...] "for by the law is the knowledge of sin" [...] (Rom 3:20). And he, in this his working, is properly called a spirit of bondage.|$|E
6000|$|The {{subject of}} the hot dispute was simply this. Were Gentile {{converts}} bound to obey the Law or not? Paul answered in the negative; and, acting upon his opinion, had created at Antioch (and elsewhere) a specifically [...] "Christian" [...] community, the sole qualifications for admission into which were the confession of the belief that Jesus was the Messiah, and baptism upon that confession. In the epistle in question, Paul puts this--his [...] "gospel," [...] as he calls {434} it--in its most extreme form. Not only does he deny the necessity of conformity with the Law, but he declares such conformity to have a negative value. [...] "Behold, I, Paul, say unto you, that if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing" [...] (Galatians v. 2). He calls the legal observances [...] "beggarly rudiments," [...] and anathematises every one who preaches to the Galatians any other gospel than his own. That is to say, by direct consequence, he anathematises the Nazarenes of Jerusalem, whose zeal for the Law is testified by James in a passage of the Acts cited further on. In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, dealing {{with the question of}} eating meat offered to idols, it is clear that Paul himself thinks it a matter of indifference; but he advises that it should not be done, {{for the sake of the}} weaker brethren. On the other hand, the Nazarenes of Jerusalem most strenuously opposed Paul's [...] "gospel," [...] insisting on every convert becoming a regular Jewish proselyte, and consequently on his observance of the whole Law; and this party was led by James and Peter and John (Galatians ii. 9). Paul does not suggest that the question of principle was settled by the discussion referred to in Galatians. All he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it ended in the practical agreement that he and Barnabas should do as they had been doing, in respect to the Gentiles; while James and Peter and John should deal in their own fashion with Jewish converts. Afterwards, he complains bitterly of Peter, because, when on a visit to Antioch, he at first inclined to Paul's view, and ate with the Gentile converts; but when [...] "certain came from James," [...] {435} [...] "drew back, and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation" [...] (Galatians ii. 12-13).|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a general}} shout of {{laughter}} and applause at this apparition, and Jackman's Gulch gathered round the barrel approvingly, {{under the impression that}} this was some ornate joke, and that they were about to be treated to some mock sermon or parody of the chapter read. When, however, the reader, having finished the chapter, placidly commenced another, and having finished that rippled on into another one, the revellers {{came to the conclusion that}} the joke was somewhat too long-winded. The commencement of yet another chapter confirmed this opinion, and an angry chorus of shouts and cries, with suggestions as to gagging the reader or knocking him off the barrel, rose from every side. In spite of roars and hoots, however, Elias B. Hopkins plodded away at the Apocalypse with the same serene countenance, looking as ineffably contented as though the babel around him were the most gratifying applause. Before long an occasional boot pattered against the barrel or whistled past our parson's head; but here some of the more orderly of the inhabitants interfered in favour of peace and order, aided curiously enough by the afore-mentioned Maule and Phillips, who warmly espoused the cause of the little Scripture reader. [...] "The little cus has got grit in him," [...] the latter explained, rearing his bulky red-shirted form between the crowd and the object of its anger. [...] "His ways ain't our ways, and we're all welcome to our opinions, and to sling them round from barrels or otherwise if so minded. What I says and Bill <b>says</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> when it comes to slingin' boots instead o' words it's too steep by half, an' if this man's wronged we'll chip in an' see him righted." [...] This oratorical effort had the effect of checking the more active signs of disapproval, and the party of disorder attempted to settle down once more to their carouse, and to ignore the shower of Scripture which was poured upon them. The attempt was hopeless. The drunken portion fell asleep under the drowsy refrain, and the others, with many a sullen glance at the imperturbable reader, slouched off to their huts, leaving him still perched upon the barrel. Finding himself alone with the more orderly of the spectators, the little man rose, closed his book, after methodically marking with a lead pencil the exact spot at which he stopped, and descended from his perch. [...] "To-morrow night, boys," [...] he remarked in his quiet voice, [...] "the reading will commence at the 9th verse of the 15th chapter of the Apocalypse," [...] with which piece of information, disregarding our congratulations, he walked away with the air of a man who has performed an obvious duty.|$|E
