5|$|Cardiff's {{first ground}} was at Sophia Gardens {{recreational}} park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910 when, {{due to the}} lack of facilities at the ground and the increasing amount of support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on <b>Sloper</b> Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed. The ground was originally to be known as <b>Sloper</b> Park but was instead named after Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who was a large force in helping the club get the ground built, and became Ninian Park. The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, with the kick-off being performed by Lord Crichton-Stuart.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine <b>Sloper</b> is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E

25|$|Both Theophilus and Susannah Maria {{were members}} of the Drury Lane theatre company managed by Cibber. From 1735, Cibber began drawing his wife's {{earnings}} from the theatre personally, ignoring the marriage settlement, and by 1737 he was even selling her clothes and personal effects to make money. In 1738, the couple were involved in a notorious lawsuit which drew public attention to Cibber's connivance in his wife's adultery. The Cibbers had established a ménage à trois with John <b>Sloper,</b> a country squire, from whom Theophilus accepted money. The three of them set up house together in Kensington, for which <b>Sloper</b> paid the rent and maintenance, until Cibber slipped away to France to escape his creditors. To his dismay, Susannah Maria wrote him a letter to say that she was leaving him for <b>Sloper.</b>|$|E

25|$|At {{a summit}} on comics history convened by the 1989 Lucca Comics Festival in Italy, Gifford {{was invited to}} be one of the eleven 'international specialists' to sign a {{declaration}} that The Yellow Kid was the first comic character having been first published in 1895. Gifford signed, but pointedly did so in the name of Ally <b>Sloper,</b> first published in 1867.|$|E
25|$|However, Gifford's {{concerns}} {{were limited to}} comics intended for children and adolescents, and he {{was well aware of}} a development of the medium for an adult audience. He collected and was able to appreciate the content of underground and Modern Age comics, offering sophisticated and sometimes sympathetic analysis. Gifford's own Ally <b>Sloper</b> comic (1976) offered a combination of vintage and alternative strips for an adult audience, although the nostalgic strips were his primary interest.|$|E
50|$|The first weekly comic {{to feature}} a regular {{character}} was Ally <b>Sloper's</b> Half Holiday, which debuted in the British humour magazine Judy in 1867 and {{was created by}} C. H. Ross and illustrated by his French wife Emilie de Tessier. In 1884 the then highly popular character was spun off into his own comic, Ally <b>Sloper's</b> Half Holiday published by Dalziel Brothers, eight pages long and printed {{in black and white}} at tabloid size. The magazine was extremely popular with the working class and may have had a circulation as high as 350,000. In 1890, two more comic magazines debuted to the British public, Comic Cuts and Illustrated Chips, establishing the tradition of the British comic as an anthology periodical containing comic strips.|$|R

500|$|A short {{part that}} Chastain had filmed {{opposite}} Ben Affleck in Terrence Malick's To the Wonder (2012) was edited {{out of the}} final film, and due to scheduling conflicts, she {{dropped out of the}} action films Oblivion and Iron Man 3 (both 2013). She instead made her Broadway debut in a revival of the 1947 play The Heiress, playing the role of Catherine <b>Sloper,</b> a naive young girl who transforms into a powerful woman. Chastain was initially reluctant to accept the role fearing the high anxiety she had faced during her early stage performances. She ultimately agreed to the part after finding a connection to <b>Sloper,</b> saying: [...] "she’s painfully uncomfortable and I used to be that". The production was staged at the Walter Kerr Theatre from November 2012 to February 2013. Brantley was disappointed with Chastain's performance, saying that she was [...] "oversignaling the thoughts within" [...] and that her delivery of dialogue was sometimes flat.|$|E

500|$|Two of {{the bridge}} players, Frederic Seward and William <b>Sloper,</b> {{accompanied}} Gibson and her mother to the lifeboats. The group boarded lifeboat no. 7, {{the first to be}} launched. Around 27 other people were on board the boat when it was lowered at 12:40am, just over an hour after the collision. The lifeboat's plug could not be found, causing water to gush in until, as Gibson later put it, [...] "this was remedied by volunteer contributions from the lingerie of the women and the garments of men." [...] Around 1,500 people were still aboard Titanic when she sank, throwing them into freezing water where they soon died of hypothermia. As they struggled in the water, Gibson heard what she described as a [...] "terrible cry that rang out from people who were thrown into the sea and others who were afraid for their loved ones." [...] The sinking deeply affected her; according to <b>Sloper,</b> she became [...] "quite hysterical and kept repeating over and over so that people near us could hear her, 'I'll never ride in my little grey car again.'" [...] The occupants of the lifeboat were finally rescued at 6:15am by the RMS Carpathia and taken to New York.|$|E
