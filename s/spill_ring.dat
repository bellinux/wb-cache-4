40|$|Metamaterial {{structures}} fabricated using nanoimprint lithography, allow {{large areas}} to be patterned quickly through multiple {{use of a}} nanoimprint stamp. The fabrication process produces fishnet structures of various dimensions on a polymer layer with metal-dielectric-metal compressed rectangular pillars. Simulations show negative refractive index and good figures of merit. However both of these figures could be increased by removal from the underlying polymer structure. We also report {{on the use of}} asymmetric <b>spilt</b> <b>ring</b> resonators used to detect small quantities of hormone estradiol by tuning the plasmonic resonances near the molecular resonance of the C-H stretch at nominally 3. 31 microns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{complementary}} <b>spilt</b> <b>ring</b> resonator (CSRR) {{is applied}} to design harmonic suppression microstrip rat-race and branch-line coupler. As the CSRR cell is etched on the ground plane of the substrate, the frequency selective properties have a considerable relation with its geometry parameters, which has been analyzed detailedly. As demonstration, a rat-race and a branch-line coupler are designed and fabricated using conventional printed-circuit board fabrication process. The proposed couplers show the performance as good {{as that of the}} corresponding conventional structures, but deep harmonic suppression in addition. The design and simulation have been performed using full-wave EM TOOLS ADS Momentum. 1...|$|R

40|$|The turn ratio, {{coupling}} {{space between}} sections, and substrate permittivity effects on <b>spilt</b> <b>ring</b> resonator (SRR) are investigated. The {{analysis of the}} presented SRR {{with respect to the}} effects of substrate and number of gaps per ring to further characterize its peculiarities is experimented with miniaturized capability as our intent. Six different SRRs were designed with different turn ratios, and the sixth is rectangular microstrip patch centre-inserted. Different numbers and gap sizes are cut on the SRRs while the gap spacing between the conductors of the SRR was varied to determine their effects taking cognizance of the effects of different substrates. The designs were investigated numerically using 3 D finite integration technique commercial EM solver, and the resulting designs were prototyped and subsequently measured. Findings indicate that the reflection coefficient of the MSRR with centre-inserted patch antenna is better compared to MSRR without the patch antenna irrespective of the laminate substrate board, and so is its gain...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} novel method for {{modeling}} the resonant frequency response of infra-red light, {{in the range}} of 2 to 10 microns, reflected from metallic <b>spilt</b> <b>ring</b> resonators (SRRs) fabricated on a silicon substrate. The calculated positions of the TM and TE peaks are determined from the plasma frequency associated with the filling fraction of the metal array and the equivalent LC circuit defined by the SRR elements. The capacitance of the equivalent circuit is calculated using conformal mapping techniques to determine the co-planar capacitance associated with both the individual and the neighbouring elements. The inductance of the equivalent circuit is based on the self-inductance of the individual elements and the mutual inductance of the neighboring elements. The results obtained from the method are in good agreement with experimental results and simulation results obtained from a commercial FDTD simulation software package. The method allows the frequency response of a SRR to be readily calculated without complex computational methods and enables new designs to be optimised for a particular frequency response by tuning the LC circuit...|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} between John Cena and Kane. After a {{back and forth}} contest, the action would <b>spill</b> from the <b>ring,</b> and the match ended in a double count-out. After the match, Kane would continue his assault, hitting Cena with multiple chair shots before attacking an injured Zack Ryder, who was watching the event from a private office. Kane dragged Ryder to the ring and performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Ryder.|$|R
25|$|The second {{match of}} the event was a {{standard}} wrestling match between Ranger Ross and Butch Reed. The match {{went back and forth}} with Ross dominating the earlier part of the match. The action <b>spilled</b> outside the <b>ring</b> until Reed ran to the ring and Ross chased him. Reed attacked Ross on the apron and brought him inside the ring to perform a Suplex.

The following week on Impact Wrestling, Homicide was assigned by MVP to attack Kurt Angle, {{which led to a}} backstage brawl <b>spilling</b> into the <b>ring</b> which caused both The BDC and The Rising to get involved. Then Homicide suffered a shoulder injury. During his injury, The Beat Down Clan was dissolved on July 15, 2015. Homicide's profile on the Impactwrestling.com roster page was moved to the alumni section on July 24.|$|R
50|$|It was {{followed}} by a Street Fight match between Angle and McMahon. The match went back and forth as Angle dominated earlier part of the match until McMahon got control of the match. The action <b>spilled</b> outside the <b>ring</b> with both men using weapons and items of the arena on each other. A notable part of the match occurred when Angle failed to suplex McMahon through a plate glass window, which {{was a part of the}} set. It took multiple attempts to break the glass, with each failure resulting in McMahon landing on his head and neck. Angle hit an Angle Slam on McMahon from the top rope to win the match.|$|R
40|$|We {{know that}} the primes in Z (hereafter {{referred}} as rational primes) are irreducible in Z i. e they don’t have proper factorization. If R is any factorization domain such that Z is properly contained in R then are these rational primes also irreducible in R? The {{answer to this question}} in general is No. For example, 13 is prime in Z but 13 is not prime in Z[i] as we can write 13 as: 13 = (2 + 3 i) (2 – 3 i) where both 2 + 3 i & 2 – 3 i are irreducible (rather non units) in Z[i]. In this paper we will see how the rational primes <b>spilt</b> in the <b>ring</b> of algebraic integers...|$|R
50|$|After that, the New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and Road Dogg) {{defended the}} WWF Tag Team Championship against Mankind and Al Snow. Mankind and Gunn started exchanging blows until the action <b>spilled</b> outside the <b>ring.</b> Back in the ring, Gunn and Road Dogg quickly tagged {{in each other}} as they hurt Snow outside the ring. After being dominated, Snow {{performed}} a Clothesline on Road Dogg and tagged in Mankind, while Road Dogg tagged in Gunn. Mankind started dominating until Gunn hit with a Fame-asser. Road Dogg then attempted a Pumphandle Drop on Mankind but Snow hit him with a Snow Plow. Gunn then threw Al Snow into the steps and hit Mankind with a Texas Piledriver to win the match and retain championship.|$|R

Following a match in which Taylor defeated Shane Douglas due to interference by both Gilbert and Rick Steiner, Adams told referee Randy Anderson of the interference. As Adams pleaded his case with Anderson, Gilbert and Taylor attacked him, and Sting eventually evened the sides. The angle eventually <b>spilled</b> outside the <b>ring</b> into the stands, and near the concession area, featuring a huge brawl involving beer kegs, chairs, trash cans, tables, popcorn machines and other objects.

5000|$|The Los Angeles Times Judy Berman {{praised the}} {{direction}} of the episode, [...] ""Gossip Girl" [...] is finally fun to watch again. The writers pulled out all the stops this week: Glass shatters! Blood <b>spills!</b> Engagement <b>rings</b> gleam! Friends and near-strangers double-cross each other! A disastrously drunk Chuck Bass revives his catchphrase, [...] "Im Chuck Bass"! Even Nate earns his screen time." [...] Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic however, had mixed reviews regarding the episode, stating the overall narrative [...] "felt sorely lacking." [...] and that the plot lines [...] "became really twisted and confusing and the relationships too tangential." [...] Serenas actions throughout the episode were called out, followed by Chucks slow downward spiral that culminated in forcing himself on Blair. Marsi continued his review on Chuck, stating that his behavior [...] "leaves little room for redemption". The sudden absence of Dan and Blairs relationship was panned by Marsi, who disapproved of the lack of interaction between the two characters. New York Magazine hailed the return of Nate and Chucks [...] "bromance", praised the change of direction for the character of Charlie, and Blair dating prince but generally panned the episode for its shortcomings and the closing scene. Chris Rovar and Jessica Pressler hoped that the show [...] "could make it up in the coming weeks." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fourth}} match John Morrison faced Sheamus in a ladder match to {{determine}} the #1 contender for the WWE Championship. Not long after the bell, the match <b>spilled</b> outside the <b>ring,</b> where Sheamus bridging a ladder between the ring apron and a broadcast table. Sheamus backed Morrison into the corner using the erect ladder but Morrison leapfrogged over it and performed a corkscrew on Sheamus. Later, Sheamus trapped Morrison by causing him to hang upside down on the ladder by his knee and then tipped the ladder over. Sheamus continued to target Morrison's knee. Morrison attempted to climb the ladder but Sheamus executed a [...] "Brogue Kick" [...] to Morrison's knee. Sheamus tried to grab the contract but Morrison stopped him. After brawling, the pair eventually fell with Morrison falling to the outside whilst Sheamus fell through the bridged ladder, which broke in half. Morrison climbed the ladder and Sheamus tried to tip him off but Morrison delivered a kick to Sheamus and retrieved the contract win the match.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{match was}} a No Disqualification Submission Match between Bret Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin. UFC fighter Ken Shamrock was the special guest referee for this match. Austin {{attacked}} Hart, {{who was still}} in his entrance attire. The two first beat each other in the ring before the action <b>spilled</b> outside the <b>ring.</b> Hart tossed Austin into the steel ringpost while Austin drove him onto the steel barrier. The two men began fighting in the crowd, where both men hit each other with several foreign objects. They moved up the steps high into the crowd. Shamrock followed them and brought them back towards the ring where Austin used steel steps on Hart to humiliate him. As the action began in the ring, Hart focused on Austin's leg. He busted Austin open with the timekeeper's table and Austin's head began to bleed. Hart tried to use a steel chair on Austin's leg, but Austin choked Hart with a television cable. Hart hit Austin in the head with the ring bell. He applied a Sharpshooter on Austin who did not submit and tried to resist but passed out from the pain and loss of blood. Shamrock awarded the match to Hart, but Hart continued to attack Austin which led to a double-turn as the fans turned on Hart and began cheering for Austin. Shamrock suplexed Hart off of Austin and physically challenged him to a fight. Hart declined to fight Shamrock and left the ring to a chorus of boos. Austin, meanwhile, after regaining consciousness, hit a Stunner on a referee when he tried to help Austin out, then slowly limped away to backstage, while the crowd chanted his name.|$|R
