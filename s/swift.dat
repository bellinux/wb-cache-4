5|$|The longest-running {{series of}} books to feature Tom <b>Swift</b> is the first, which {{consists}} of forty volumes. Tom <b>Swift</b> (technically Tom <b>Swift,</b> Jr.) was also {{the name of the}} protagonist of the 33 volumes of the Tom <b>Swift,</b> Jr. Adventures, the 11 volumes of the third Tom <b>Swift</b> series, the 13 volumes of the fourth, and a half-dozen more for the most recent series, Tom <b>Swift,</b> Young Inventor, for a total of 103 volumes for all the series. In addition to publication in the United States, Tom <b>Swift</b> books have been published extensively in England, and translated into Norwegian, French, Icelandic, and Finnish.|$|E
5|$|A Tom <b>Swift</b> media project {{finally came}} to {{fruition}} in 1983 when Willie Aames appeared as Tom <b>Swift</b> along with Lori Loughlin as Linda Craig in a television special, The Tom <b>Swift</b> and Linda Craig Mystery Hour, which was broadcast on July 3. It was a ratings failure. In 2007, digital studio Worldwide Biggies acquired movie rights to Tom <b>Swift.</b> and announced plans to release a feature film and video game, followed by a television series. As of 2015, these plans had not come to fruition.|$|E
5|$|A third {{series was}} begun in 1981 and lasted until 1984. The {{rights to the}} Tom <b>Swift</b> character, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, were sold in 1984 to {{publishers}} Simon & Schuster. They hired New York City book packaging business Mega-Books to produce further series. Simon & Schuster produced two other Tom <b>Swift</b> series: one, published from 1991 to 1993, and the Tom <b>Swift,</b> Young Inventor series, begun in 2006.|$|E

50|$|The New South Wales <b>Swifts</b> {{finished}} the 2011 season as preliminary finalists. Before {{the start of}} the finals series, the <b>Swifts</b> conducted a coaching review and advertised their head coaching position. Incumbent coach Julie Fitzgerald, having spent 15 years coaching the Sydney <b>Swifts</b> in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy and the NSW <b>Swifts</b> in the ANZ Championship, did not reapply for the position; Fitzgerald was later appointed as assistant coach for the Australian national team and head of the AIS Netball Program. Also departing the <b>Swifts</b> were internationals Catherine Cox (West Coast Fever) and Rebecca Bulley (Adelaide Thunderbirds). The <b>Swifts</b> submitted their roster for the 2012 season on 1 November 2011, with five changes to the playing lineup. Lisa Beehag was also appointed as head coach of the NSW <b>Swifts</b> on a one-year deal.|$|R
50|$|In the ANZ Championship, {{many experts}} {{believed}} that the <b>Swifts</b> won't {{be able to reach}} the top 4 due to their poor performance last year. As a result, this was the <b>Swifts</b> year of redemption in hopes to return to the top (similar to the Melbourne Vixens in 2009). In round 1, the <b>Swifts</b> upset the Firebirds at Gold Coast by three goals and Cox was named player of the match. In round 2, the <b>Swifts</b> won against the Thunderbirds at their home ground. In round 3, the <b>Swifts</b> played against the Tactix, where the <b>Swifts</b> lost to them at Christchurch in 2008. After the end of regulation time, the game was a draw and extra time had to be played. Cox made a bold move to bench herself due to her poor performance on court for youngster Wild and the <b>Swifts</b> won the match 56-53. In round 4, during the first half, the last place Pulse led the <b>Swifts</b> as much as seven. After trailing by five goals after the first half, the <b>Swifts</b> scored the first ten goals in the second half and won the match 50-36. In round 5, despite conceding the first three goals against the Fever, the <b>Swifts</b> played their best performance after five rounds to win 55-43.|$|R
5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan <b>Swift</b> {{spent every}} fifth Sunday preaching from the pulpit. Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} that he should publish these sermons, <b>Swift</b> felt that he lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, <b>Swift</b> spent his time working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E
5|$|Drapier's Letters is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, Jonathan <b>Swift,</b> to arouse public opinion in Ireland against the imposition of a privately minted copper coinage that <b>Swift</b> believed to be of inferior quality. William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and <b>Swift</b> saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, <b>Swift</b> represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the Drapier's Letters. Since the subject was politically sensitive, <b>Swift</b> wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier, to hide from retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Faulkner's Dublin Journal, a {{newspaper}} established in 1725, featured many articles written by <b>Swift</b> or inspired by writings of <b>Swift.</b> Between 1727 and 1730, Faulkner published many works attributed to <b>Swift,</b> but many were actually written by others. After 1730, {{only one of}} those works printed by Faulkner under Swift's name {{turned out to be}} written by someone besides <b>Swift,</b> which suggests to some critics that <b>Swift</b> was working with Faulkner to ensure that only authentic works were printed under Swift's name. He was the first to publish The Answer to the Craftsman, Swift's final defense of the Irish economy from England's policies. Faulkner was also the first to publish the collected Drapier's Letters as Fraud Detected on 2 October 1725. Faulkner also helped edit An Epistle upon an Epistle around December 1729.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan <b>Swift,</b> as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{produced}} many sermons {{during his}} tenure from 1713 to 1745. Although <b>Swift</b> is better known today for his secular writings such as Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a Tub, or the Drapier's Letters, <b>Swift</b> was known in Dublin for his sermons that were delivered every fifth Sunday. Of these sermons, <b>Swift</b> wrote down 35, of which 12 have been preserved. In his sermons <b>Swift</b> attempted to impart traditional Church of Ireland values to his listeners in a plain manner.|$|E

50|$|In round 6, the <b>Swifts</b> had a bye {{after their}} five match winning streak. It {{was in this}} round that the <b>Swifts</b> were the only team {{not to have a}} loss when the Vixens had a {{surprise}} loss against the Firebirds. In round 7, the <b>Swifts</b> led by one goal at three quarter time, despite trailing by one goal after the first few minutes of the final quarter, the <b>Swifts</b> won the match by 14 goals. In round 8, the <b>Swifts</b> defeated the Thunderbirds and broke their four match winning streak. In round 9, the <b>Swifts</b> defeated the Firebirds and broke their four match winning streak as well. In round 10, the <b>Swifts</b> were comfortable winners against the Fever. In round 11, the <b>Swifts</b> defeated the Mystics and Maria Tutaia was sent off with about {{a minute and a half}} of play for persistent breaking on the centre pass. Before round 12, during training, Vanessa Ware suffered a serious knee injury that required reconstruction and not only did it end Ware's season, it also blew away any chance of possible selection into the Diamonds squad. In round 12, the <b>Swifts</b> defeated the Magic despite them having Jade Clarke and not having Vanessa Ware. In round 13, after the scores the tied at half time, the <b>Swifts</b> managed to win by 12 goals against the Vixens in Melbourne. Also during this match, not only was Catherine Cox awarded player of the match, Cox became the second player ever to play 200 games in the domestic league (the first was Sharelle McMahon) and received a bouquet of flowers from Sharelle McMahon. Also, the <b>Swifts</b> won back the Sargeant McKinnis Cup back from the Vixens. In round 14, the <b>Swifts</b> defeated the Steel. As a result, the <b>Swifts</b> were officially the first ever team to go undefeated in the regular season.|$|R
5|$|Many of Tom Swift's fictional inventions {{describe}} actual {{technological developments}} or predate technologies now considered commonplace. Tom <b>Swift</b> Among the Diamond Makers (1911) {{was based on}} Charles Parsons's attempts to synthesize diamonds using electric current. Tom <b>Swift</b> and His Photo Telephone was published in 1912. Sending photographs by telephone was not fully developed until 1925. Tom <b>Swift</b> and His Wizard Camera (1912) features a portable movie camera, not invented until 1923. Tom <b>Swift</b> and His Electric Locomotive (1922) was published {{two years before the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey began using the first diesel electric locomotive. The house on wheels that Tom invents for 1929's Tom <b>Swift</b> and His House on Wheels pre-dated the first house trailer by a year.Tom <b>Swift</b> and His Diving Seacopter (1952) features a flying submarine similar to one planned by the United States Department of Defense four years later in 1956,. Other inventions of Tom's have not happened, such as the device for silencing airplane engines that he invents in Tom <b>Swift</b> and His Magnetic Silencer (1941).|$|E
5|$|<b>Swift</b> also {{promoted}} the album by performing as an opening act for several country artists' concert tours. She opened for Rascal Flatts on several dates, from October 19 to November 3, 2006, {{included on the}} Me and My Gang Tour (2006â€“07), performing {{a total of five}} songs from the album. She also served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's 2007 United States tour, and selected dates for Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour (2007â€“08); <b>Swift</b> served as an opening act during all 2007 legs of the tour. During mid-2007, <b>Swift</b> engaged as the opening act on several dates for Tim McGraw's and Faith Hill's joint tour, Soul2Soul II Tour (2006â€“07). <b>Swift</b> again opened for Flatts for their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008. In addition, <b>Swift</b> performed six songs from Taylor <b>Swift</b> on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour (2009â€“10).|$|E
5|$|<b>Swift</b> {{relies on}} Gospel of Matthew in this sermon (<b>Swift</b> {{quotes from the}} Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 7:12) instead of the other Gospels; this is {{standard}} practice for <b>Swift,</b> because the Gospel features a simple, non-controversial history that complements Swift's religious views.|$|E

Her father, Scott Kingsley <b>Swift,</b> was a {{financial}} advisor, and her mother, Andrea Gardner <b>Swift</b> (nÃ©e Finlay), was a homemaker who worked previously as a mutual fund marketing executive. The singer has a younger brother named Austin. <b>Swift</b> spent {{the early years of}} her life on a Christmas tree farm.

Lyrics also touch on Swift's personal struggles in high school.|$|E

50|$|In the ANZ Championship, the <b>Swifts</b> {{won their}} first {{game against the}} Canterbury Tactix (the only team the <b>Swifts</b> didn't win in 2008) by {{seventeen}} goals and claimed the top spot in the ladder after round one. In round two, after a well fought game against the Adelaide Thunderbirds, the <b>Swifts</b> lost by one goal. In round three, the <b>Swifts</b> lost by 18 goals to the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic. During that game, the <b>Swifts</b> lost Bulley for falling on the ground head first, Cox after a bad landing on Tod's foot and nearly lost Pettitt after falling down heavily. Despite Cox missing one shot, Pettitt missing three shots and Bell missing two, it wasn't enough to beat van Dyk's perfect accuracy and Tutaia's one miss. In round four, the <b>Swifts</b> are against the Northern Mystics and despite Cox missing three shots in the final quarter and scoring no rebounds against Latu (who shot 38/40), Cookey and Rasmussen, the <b>Swifts</b> won 59-55 to maintain their winning streak at home. However, after that, the <b>Swifts</b> lost the last 9 {{games in a row}} and fell down to 9th place.|$|R
50|$|After {{missing out}} on a spot in last years grand final, the <b>Swifts</b> {{recruited}} Mo'onia Gerrard from the Adelaide Thunderbirds. In addition, the <b>Swifts</b> also recruited veteran Carla Dziwoki after making a great impact at both in state league and in the Australian National League as well as forming a great shooting combination with current <b>Swifts</b> player Amy Wild. The <b>Swifts</b> are {{one of only two}} teams not to have any new players in their team (the other is the Pulse). However, the <b>Swifts</b> have used players not in the main squad during pre-season matches against the Mystics including April Letton, FastNet Diamonds defender.|$|R
5|$|The video {{begins with}} <b>Swift,</b> barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. <b>Swift</b> looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. <b>Swift</b> walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. <b>Swift</b> sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, <b>Swift</b> plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. <b>Swift</b> approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between <b>Swift</b> singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where <b>Swift,</b> wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. <b>Swift</b> then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with <b>Swift,</b> clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where <b>Swift</b> stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees <b>Swift,</b> wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and <b>Swift</b> is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, <b>Swift</b> stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. <b>Swift</b> and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward <b>Swift</b> and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and <b>Swift</b> performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between <b>Swift</b> and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, {{on the day of}} filming, it rained heavily, {{something}} which <b>Swift</b> was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. <b>Swift</b> said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for <b>Swift</b> because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into thinking about what made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress <b>Swift</b> was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.|$|E
