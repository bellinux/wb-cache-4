When <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> are {{replicated}} {{at several}} {{sites in the}} network, the updates of a long transaction in a specific site should be propagated to the other sites for maintaining the consistency of replicated <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> If any two or more transactions at different sites concurrently update some <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> within a given region, two <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> having <b>spatial</b> relationships should be cooperatively updated {{even if there are}} no direct conflicts of locking for them. This paper deals with the problems of replication control of <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> We present the concepts of Region locking and Spatial Relationship-Bound Write locking for enhancing parallelism of updating the replicated <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> If there are no spatial relationships between the two objects that are concurrently being updated at different sites, parallel updates will be completely allowed. We argue that concurrent updates of two <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> having <b>spatial</b> relationships should be propagated and cooperated by using an extended twophase commit protocol, called Spatial Relationship-based 2 PC protocol. ...|$|R

For every rectangle in a node, {{it has to be}} decided if it overlaps the search rectangle or not. If yes, the corresponding child node has to be searched also. Searching is done like this in a recursive manner until all overlapping nodes have been traversed.

Another criticism of installing solar panels is their upfront cost. According to energyinfomative.org, the average cost for a residential solar system is somewhere between $15,000 and $40,000 (USD), and about $7 per watt. In the article, it says that at today's rates, it would take 10 years to pay off an average system. A solar panel living more than 20 years, in the end, it becomes a benefit.|$|E

50|$|The reconsolidation {{hypothesis}} has lingered {{since the}} 1960s; however, a 2000 study, entitled “Fear memories require protein synthesis in the amygdala for reconsolidation after retrieval”, examining fear conditioning in rats, {{has provided evidence}} in its favor. After receiving post-retrieval an intra-amygdalar infusion of a known amnesic agent, anisomycin, rats failed to recall a rapidly learned fear memory. Hippocampal lesions formed post-retrieval affected the rats' fear conditioning in a similar manner. The reconsolidation hypothesis does not suppose that subsequent and precedent consolidation phases are necessarily identical in duration or in the neural mechanisms involved. Nevertheless, the commonality that exists in every consolidation phase is a short-lived destabilization of a memory object and a susceptibility for said object to react to amnesic agents—principally protein synthesis inhibitors. Morris and colleagues’ experiment indicates that the reconsolidation hypothesis could apply to particular memory types such as allocentric spatial memory, which is either acquired slowly or rapidly. As implied by the authors, however, such an application is feasible only {{in the case of}} rapidly acquired spatial memory, the degree to which is influenced by how thoroughly a <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> is trained.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{information}} gained on the synaptic tagging hypothesis mainly resulted from experiments that apply stimulation to synapse, a similar {{model can be}} applied when considering {{the process of learning}} in a broader behavioral sense. [...] Fabricio Ballarini and colleagues created this behavioral tagging model by testing <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> recognition, contextual conditioning, and conditioned taste aversion in rats with weak training, which is a training that normal only creates a short term memory. However, they paired this weak training with a separate, arbitrary behavioral event that induces protein synthesis and found that so long as the two behavioral events were coupled within a certain time frame, the weak training was sufficient to produce long term memory of that learning task. The researchers believed that the weak learning established a [...] "learning tag" [...] to be used later when proteins arrived {{as a result of the}} other task, resulting in the formation of long-term memory for even the weak training. This behavioral learning model mirrors the synaptic tagging model, in which a weak stimulation establishes E-LTP that may be serve as the tag used in converting the weak potentiation to the stronger, more persistent L-LTP, once the high-frequency stimulation presents itself.|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Spatial and novel object {{recognition}} learning {{is different from}} learning that uses aversive or appetitive stimuli to shape acquisition because no overt contingencies are needed. While this type of learning occurs on a daily basis, {{little is known about}} how nicotine administration affects it. Objectives: To determine the effects of acute, chronic, and withdrawal from chronic nicotine on two related but distinct incidental learning tasks, novel and <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> recognition. Methods: In C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, the effects of acute (0. 045 - 0. 18 mg/kg), chronic (6. 3 mg/kg/day), and withdrawal from chronic nicotine on novel and <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> recognition were examined. Results: With a 48 -h delay between training and testing, acute nicotine enhanced spatial (difference score, saline?=? 3. 34 s, nicotine?=? 7. 71 s, p?=? 0. 029) but resulted in a deficit in novel {{object recognition}} (difference score, saline?=? 8. 76 s, nicotine?=? 4. 48 s, p?=? 0. 033). Chronic nicotine resulted in a strong trend towards a deficit in <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> recognition (difference score, saline?=? 4. 01 s, nicotine?=? 1. 81 s, p?=? 0. 059) but had no effect on novel object recognition, and withdrawal from chronic nicotine disrupted <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> recognition (difference score, saline?=? 3. 00 s, nicotine?=? 0. 17 s, p?=? 0. 004) but had no effect on novel object recognition. Conclusions: The effects of nicotine on <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> recognition shift from enhancement to deficit as administration changes from acute to chronic and withdrawal. These effects were specific for <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> recognition, which may be due to differing underlying neural substrates involved in these tasks. Understanding how nicotine alters learning has implications for understanding diseases associated with altered cholinergic function<br/...|$|E

Specifically, the visualization of the spatial data {{is very important for}} mobile devices that have limited display capacity. The visualization problems are mostly dealt with generalization algorithms such as displacement, simplification and aggregation in order to obtain appropriate cartographic design. In this paper, a new simplification method that allows an adapted visualization is proposed. According to the proposed model, instead of scaled polygonal spatial representation, symbolizations are used for the visualization. In theory, a <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> is replaced with a symbol in order to make user’s perception easier in the restricted screen of the mobile devices. Obtaining an appropriate icon size for a <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> is very complex case because of the various parameters of the determination of the symbolization. Besides, there is also a vagueness of the situation in the visualization. Solution, therefore, needs a fuzzy logic approach so as to obtain coherent results. Symbol dimensions are calculated automatically with fuzzy inference depending on both the display resolution and the covered area of the polygon. A technological architecture of the distributed GIS has been designed to realize cartographic generalization on the mobile phones. Finally, adaption has been provided for the each <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> separately according to the display resolution capacity of the mobile device {{and the size of the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>object.</b> 1...|$|E
