40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there are differences in <b>shy</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>shy</b> toddlers in different contexts (small circle, big circle, free play, offside). Method. The study was conducted among two groups of toddlers, all originating from the assistance plan PeuterPlus! (ToddlerPlus!). Toddlers with shy behaviour (N = 4) and toddlers without shy behaviour (N = 29) were observed in four different situations. The teachers were observed to see to what extent they supported the toddlers emotionally. It was then analyzed whether the degree of emotional support offered by teachers influenced the behaviour of the toddlers with end without shyness. Results. The results showed that, with a p value <b>of.</b> 05, <b>shy</b> toddlers showed significant difference in the degree <b>of</b> <b>shy</b> behaviour in different contexts. (Note: The group <b>of</b> <b>shy</b> toddlers was too small to look at the influence of emotional support from the teacher). The results also showed that in all situations there was a difference in the degree <b>of</b> <b>shy</b> behaviour between toddlers with and without shy behaviour. Besides this difference there were no other difference in the degree of embarrassment in various contexts of toddlers who are not <b>shy.</b> The degree <b>of</b> emotional support by the teacher did not affect the <b>shy</b> behaviour <b>of</b> these toddlers. Conclusion. The results are consistent with the expectation that there are differences in the degree <b>of</b> shyness <b>of</b> <b>shy</b> toddlers per context and also that there are differences between toddlers with and without shy behaviour in different contexts...|$|R
