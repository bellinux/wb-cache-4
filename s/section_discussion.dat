25|$|The Grothendieck group. In K-theory, {{the point}} of {{departure}} is to observe that the category of vector bundles on a topological space has a commutative monoid structure under direct sum. One may make an abelian group out of this monoid, the Grothendieck group, by formally adding an additive inverse for each bundle (or equivalence class). Alternatively one can observe that the functor that for each group takes the underlying monoid (ignoring inverses) has a left adjoint. This is a once-for-all construction, {{in line with the}} third <b>section</b> <b>discussion</b> above. That is, one can imitate the construction of negative numbers; but there is the other option of an existence theorem. For the case of finitary algebraic structures, the existence by itself can be referred to universal algebra, or model theory; naturally there is also a proof adapted to category theory, too.|$|E

40|$|Result and <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> play an {{important}} role in theses as one of the research reports. Writing result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> is often bothersome for some writers, it also holds true for the undergraduate students as novice writers. This study aimed to investigate the rhetorical moves of result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> of theses together with the lexical expressions that are written by the undergradu ate students. An understanding of rhetorical moves used by the undergraduate students in writing their result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> is hoped can give input for academic writing’s instructor to improve students’ writing ability in the future, particularly in writing the result and <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> of theses. The research method is descriptive qualitative study with discourse analysis method to identify the moves. Seven undergraduate theses of experimental studies were selected as subject of the research. The result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> then were analyzed based on the result model proposed by Paltridge & Starfield (2007) for result <b>section</b> and <b>discussion</b> model proposed by Dudley - Evans (1994) for <b>discussion</b> <b>section.</b> Some samples of proposition of result a nd <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> were also used to identify the lexical expressions in the result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section.</b> Then, the rhetorical moves were rated by the writer and two other raters for triangulation. The results showed that there are no linear rhetorica l moves emerging in the result section. At the same time, it was found that there is cyclical structure that mostly arises from the part or stages of investigation of experimental research. Whereas in the <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> there are also no linear rhetor ical moves found. Moreover, one unanticipated finding showed that not all <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> under study have cyclical structure. Only three <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> have cyclical structure and only one of them employed key cycle as mentioned by Dudley - Evans (1994). For the lexical expression, it was found that in the result sections the lexical expressions are more obvious in showing the function of the moves. Therefore the moves in result section are easily identified by its lexical expressions. While in the <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> the lexical expressions are less obvious therefore in order to identify the moves the researcher used comprehension of the text. In conclusion, the rhetorical moves of result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> of theses written by the English depar tment undergraduate students of UNESA, did not follow the model proposed by Paltdrige & Starfiled (2007) for result section and Dudley - Evans (1994) for <b>discussion</b> <b>section,</b> since the rhetorical moves were not ordered like the order of each model. Accordingl y, based on the present result, it is necessary for the academic writing instructors or teachers to provide clear instructional strategies and exercises to improve the undergraduate students ability in writing their result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the study of genre analysis, not only among applied linguists and language teachers for pedagogical reasons but also among research communities. Move analysis is one of the genre-based approaches used to analyse the structure of texts whereby the texts of the chosen corpus were analysed into ‘hierarchical schematic structures or Moves’. One of the genres that have received extensive attention from researchers in move analysis study is Research Article (RA). This is due to its importance in discussing and sharing academic knowledge (Peacock, 2002; Huang, 2014). Therefore, the aim of this work is to analyse the move structure in the <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> of research articles in the field of Pharmacy. The two objectives of the study is to investigate the extent which the <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> in Pharmacy articles can be used with reference to a framework of <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> in Applied Linguistics articles and to explore how the writers in Pharmacy construct arguments about the meaning and significance of results in commenting on result moves. In meeting the objectives, twenty <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> of Pharmacy research articles have been selected from an international journal and analysed using a schematic structure of Applied Linguistics. Overall, the schematic structure of Applied Linguistics <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> can be used to analyse the Pharmacy <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> with some modification of the existing framework. All the four moves in the Applied Linguistic framework also occurred in the Pharmacy <b>discussion</b> <b>sections.</b> There are also two additional moves that occurred in the Pharmacy <b>discussion</b> <b>sections.</b> Most of the <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> were dominated by Move 3 (Reporting a result) which occurred in 29...|$|R

It is demonstrated that in the linear model, non-covariant modifications to the initial covariant Lagrangian (similar to those modifications used in full gravity) are in fact unnecessary. The Hamiltonians and the constraints are different in these two formulations but the structure of the constraint algebra and the gauge invariance derived from it are the same. It is shown that these equivalent Hamiltonian formulations are related to each other by a canonical transformation which is explicitly given. The relevance of these results to the full theory of General Relativity is briefly discussed. Comment: <b>Section</b> <b>Discussion</b> is modified and references are added; 19 page...|$|E
