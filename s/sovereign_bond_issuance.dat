40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{countries}} which have borrowed in international capital markets by issuing <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds</b> has increased substantially. For these countries, capital market access meant a de facto acknowledgement of their policy successes and improvements in their creditworthiness that enabled them to graduate from the group of official financing recipients into a more advanced group of emerging market economies. The paper looks at the determinants of <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issuances</b> and derives the relationship between internal and external factors and market access using a simple macro model. The market access condition is then translated into a simple rule that requires an excess demand for the <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds</b> in question.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} new wave of <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issuances</b> in Africa. What determines the ability of {{developing}} countries to issue bonds in international capital and what explains the spreads on these bonds? This paper examines these questions using a dataset that includes 105 developing countries during the period 1995 – 2014. We find that a country is more likely to issue a bond when, in comparison with non-issuing peers, it is larger in economic size, has higher per capita GDP, a lower public debt, and a more effective government. Spreads on <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds</b> are lower for countries with strong external and fiscal positions, as well as robust economic growth and government effectiveness. We also find that primary spreads for the average Sub-Saharan African issuer are higher than in other regions. With regard to global factors, our results confirm the existing evidence that issuances are more likely during periods of global liquidity and high commodity prices, especially for Sub-Saharan African countries, and spreads are higher in periods of higher market volatility...|$|R

In particular, we find that countries either reaccess the markets in the first years after a default or have to wait a much longer time to do it.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{different aspects}} of the actions of borrowing and repaying debts by governments in both domestic and international financial markets. In Chapter 1, which is co-authored with Guido Sandleris and Alejandro Van der Ghote, we use a unique dataset on <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issuances</b> and syndicated bank loans to study the duration and determinants of the periods of exclusion from international credit markets that usually follow governments' defaults. Among other results, we find that countries either reaccess the markets in the first years after a default or have to wait much longer to do it, and that political stability significantly increases the chances of reaccessing the market. We present a political economy model of endogenous sovereign borrowing and market reaccess that matches these two features of the data. In Chapter 2, 1 study the relation between the domestic financial system's market structure, the allocation of government debt and the cost of credit for the government. The fact that governments are less likely to repudiate their debts when there are more domestic agents among their creditors creates an externality: when domestic investors demand government bonds, they reduce the probability of default and improve the situation of every other bondholder. The concentration of investment decisions in fewer financial institutions increases the degree of internalization of this effect, expands the demand for government bonds by domestic agents and reduces the cost of credit for the government. In Chapter 3, I propose a mechanism that can explain the observed positive correlation between public and private spreads, taking into account that domestic banks tend to be heavily exposed to sovereign debt. Firms have private information about the results of their projects, information that can be obtained by domestic banks, as long as they pay a verification cost, but not by foreign creditors. A sovereign default has a negative impact on domestic banks, reduces their verification capacity and increases the incentives for firms to declare themselves insolvent. Consequently, risks of sovereign and private defaults are positively correlated. by Mauro Alessandro. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Economics, 2011.

40|$|The IMF {{attempts}} to catalyze and stabilize private capital flows to emerging markets by providing public monitoring and emergency finance. In analyzing its role we contrast cases where banks and bondholders do the lending. Banks {{have a natural}} advantage in monitoring and creditor coordination, while bonds have superior risk sharing characteristics. Consistent with this assumption, banks reduce spreads as they obtain more information through repeat transactions with borrowers. By comparison, repeat borrowing has little influence in bond markets, where publicly available information dominates. But spreads on bonds are lower when they are issued in conjunction with IMF-supported programs, as if {{the existence of a}} program conveyed positive information to bondholders.

40|$|As {{developing}} economies become richer, {{they seek}} to contract with the global economy in increasingly complex ways. Dealing with that complexity often implies the need to renegotiate contracts. However, such recontracting is viewed with concern, particularly by market participants. At the same time, iron-clad commitments to abstain from recontracting are untenable. Sovereign debt experts have long dealt with this dilemma. This paper argues that the acute trade-off between commitment and flexibility {{is not unique to}} sovereign debt. Instead, it is the defining characteristic of an emerging market. Examples of World Bank guarantees on behalf of sovereign governments to private lenders, exchange rate regimes, and international bond contracts, highlight the evolution from commitment to flexibility. Early interaction with international markets typically benefits from strong transaction-specific commitment. However, the goal is to grow out of transactional commitments to achieve commitment through credible institutions. Institutional commitment allows the benefits of flexibility, with the country''s "word" acting as the necessary assurance to behave responsibly.

40|$|This paper empirically investigates firms using Islamic finance in Malaysia and Middle East countries. The {{comparative}} analysis of Islamic finance and non-Islamic finance users resulted in three major implications. First, Islamic bond issuers preferentially choose the Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> prior to bank borrowing and other external financing tools. Second, Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> {{is not related}} to the issuer’s internal funds, while Islamic bank borrowing is significantly influenced by the magnitude of a firm’s internal funds. These results suggest that Islamic bond issuers do not always choose to issue bonds based on information cost, but Islamic bank borrowers always do. Third, the Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> contributes to an increase in the issuer’s stock returns and total factor productivity. This empirical result suggests that Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> is preferred because of this unique benefit which standard external financing does not have. ...|$|R
40|$|The study aims to {{investigate}} the signaling effect of <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> in Malaysia and to determine the company characteristics that influence the effect. Findings of the study reveal positive cumulative average abnormal returns following <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> indicating that the market treat bond offers as favourable corporate news. On the other hand, the cross-sectional analysis found insignificant relation between company profitability, growth opportunities, asset tangibility, size and managerial ownership with cumulative abnormal returns of bond issuers. The results confirm the signaling effect of <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> but further reveal that the effect is not affected by company characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The paper takes {{stock of}} the impact of the global {{financial}} crisis that began in late 2007 on banking sectors of Asian low-income countries, by exploring bank-level data provided by Bankscope. The paper examines three key channels of possible crisis spillovers: exposures to (i) valuation changes of mark-to-market financial assets, (ii) a drop in crossborder funding, and (iii) rises in NPLs prompted by international real economic linkages. The paper finds that despite relatively low financial integration, the impact of the crisis on LIC banks, particularly the largest ones, were not insignificant. Impacts were most palpable through a loan-to-crossborder funding nexus.
