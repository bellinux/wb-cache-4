The study was aimed at investigating the differences in perception of stress among different health professionals in ABUTH. The descriptive survey design method was used. Questionnaires were distributed based on availability to the different dusters o f health professionals in the study group. A sample size of 107 was used comprising 45 nurses, 48 doctors, 5 pharmacists, 3 physiotherapists and 6 medical lab scientists. The findings showed {{that most of the}} respondents (36. 5 %) were within the age range of 31 - 40 years and very few of them were aged 55 years and above. More than fifty six percent(56. 7 %) o f the total respondents were males. Seventy five percent (75 %>) of the respondents stay long (7 - 1 0 hours) at work which could be a contributing factor to the development of occupational stress in them. Most of the respondents (90. 4 %) were identified <b>to</b> be <b>stressed</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> overload because the number of health professionals available to carry out a particular function is inadequate. Eighty percent (80 %) of respondents exhibit anger and irritability while twenty seven percent (27 %>) engaged in absenteeism when they are stressed up. A lot of respondents (78. 8 %) combat these signs and symptoms of stress by the use of physical exercise. The following measures were recommended to help prevent stress at work: respondents should ensure that the workload is in line with their capabilities and resources, jobs should be designed so that they provide meaning, there should be positive stimulation and opportunities for workers to use their skills, workers' roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined, communication within the work place should be dear and unambiguous, there should also be opportunities for career development and future employment prospects...|$|R

40|$|On October 5, 1979, the Lithium Processing Test Loop (LPTL) {{developed}} a lithium leak in the electromagnetic (EM) pump channel, which damaged the pump, its surrounding support structure, {{and the underlying}} floor pan. A thorough analysis of the causes and consequences of the pump failure was conducted by personnel from CEN and several other ANL divisions. Metallurgical analyses of the elliptical pump channel and adjacent piping revealed {{that there was a}} significant buildup of iron-rich crystallites and other solid material in the region of the current-carrying bus bars (region of high magnetic field), which may have resulted in a flow restriction that contributed to the deterioration of the channel walls. The location of the failure was in a region of high residual <b>stress</b> (<b>due</b> <b>to</b> cold <b>work</b> produced during channel fabrication); this failure is typical of other cold work/stress-related failures encountered in components operated in forced-circulation lithium loops. Another important result was the isolation of crystals of a compound characterized as Li/sub x/CrN/sub y/. Compounds of this type are believed to be responsible for much of the Fe, Cr, and Ni mass transfer encountered in lithium loops constructed of stainless steel.

40|$|Background &amp; Objective: Nursing and Midwifery {{students}} experience {{different and}} numerous sources of stress. Stress {{is a complex}} phenomenon that may be experienced by all. Nursing and midwifery students have multiple sources of <b>stress</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their <b>work</b> environment. In order to reduce their stress and prevent the complications, all sources of stress should be recognized. This study was carried out to compare sources of stress between midwifery and nursing students of Tehran universities of medical sciences. Methods &amp; Materials: This is a cross-sectional study. All senior midwifery and nursing students of Tehran and Shahid Beheshti Universities {{were invited to participate}} in the study (n= 380). Data were collected using a questionnaire including demographic section (15 questions) and sources of stress of educational environment, clinical environment, and social-personal problems (54 items). Data were analyzed using SPSS and tested with chi-square test. Results: 363 students participated in the study. Research findings showed that the followings are the most cited sources of stress among the students: ambiguous professional view, incompetent professional knowledge after graduation, caring for terminally ill patients, discordance between theory and clinical education, concerns about employment. Also results showed that there were significant differences between some sources of stress and the study programs. Conclusion: The nursing and midwifery students had numerous sources of stress in the educational, clinical, and social-personal domains of their life that can affect their physical and psychological health and cause learning problems.

It shows the need to develop adaptive coping strategies among nurses. The aim {{of the study was to}} find out stress coping mechanisms and burnout presence among nurses practicing in Latvia. The instruments which used for data collection: demographic questionnaire, R. S. Lazarus and S. Folkman's The Ways of Coping Scale and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The Ways of Coping Scale completed by 484 nurses working in healthcare institutions in different regions of Latvia in the age range from 21 to 66 years. The highest values have: planful problem-solving, self-controlling and positive reappraisal, accepting responsibility and seeking social support; while the lowest values can be seen in two scales – confrontive coping and escape/avoidance. The prevailing ways of coping stress in the sample are planful problem solving, self-controlling and positive reappraisal. Maslach burned out inventory which was completed by 587 practicing nurses.

40|$|Working {{conditions}} have greatly evolved {{in recent decades}} in developed countries. This evolution has been accompanied {{with the appearance of}} new forms of work organisation that may be sources of stress and health risk for older workers. As populations are ageing, these issues are particularly worrying in terms of the health, labour force participation and Social Security expenditure. This paper focuses on the links between quality of employment and the health of older workers, using the Share 2004 survey. Our research is based on two classical models: the Demand-Control model of Karasek and Theorell (1991) and the Effort-Reward Imbalance model of Siegrist (1996), which highlight three main dimensions: Demand that reflects perceived physical pressure and <b>stress</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a heavy <b>work</b> load; Control that refers to decision latitude at work and the possibilities to develop new skills; and Reward that corresponds to the feeling of receiving a correct salary relatively to efforts made, of having prospects for personal progress and receiving deserved recognition. These models also take into account the notion of support in difficult situations at work and the feeling of job security. Our estimations show that the health status of older workers is related to these factors. Fairly low demand levels and a good level of reward are associated with a good health status, for both men and women. Control onl...|$|R

Hot strip mills in finishing stands normally utilize cast duplex type work rolls in alloy indefinite chill double poured (ICDP) or high chrome iron grades and back up rolls of alloy cast or forged heat treated steels. Back up rolls (BUR) suffer from mechanical pressure cracks in contact <b>stress</b> zones <b>due</b> <b>to</b> excess <b>work</b> hardening. These cracks move downwards through cyclic loading, if not detected and removed by grinding, and cause roll spalls or catastrophic failures. Work rolls in hot mills are subjected to severe thermal fatigue causing fire cracks {{on the surface and}} other mill operational deviations and accidents inducing surface and sub surface damage in roll body. Surface cracks with a depth more than 0. 2 mm have to be detected and removed by grinding.

40|$|International audienceThe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis {{response}} to chronic stress {{is far from}} straight forward, particularly with regards to animal welfare. There are reports of no effect as well as both decreases and increases in cortisol after chronic stressors. Therefore, the first aim {{of the present study}} was to determine how measures of compromised welfare, such as chronic pain and haematological anomalies, related to cortisol levels in domestic horses (Equus caballus). Domestic horses are an informative model to investigate the impact of chronic <b>stress</b> (<b>due</b> <b>to</b> environment, pain, <b>work,</b> housing conditions…) on the HPA axis. The second aim was to determine whether levels of fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) may be used as an indicator of welfare measures. The present study used fifty-nine horses (44 geldings and 15 mares), from three riding centres in Brittany, France. The primary findings show that horses whose welfare was clearly compromised (as indicated by an unusual ears backward position, presence of vertebral problems or haematological anomalies, e. g. anaemia) also had lower levels of both FCM and plasma cortisol. This work extends our previous findings showing that withdrawn postures, indicators of depressive-like behavior in horses, are associated with lower plasma cortisol levels. We also found that evening plasma cortisol levels positively correlated with FCM levels in horses. Future research aims to determine the extent to which factors of influence on welfare, such as living conditions (e. g. single stalls versus group housing in pasture or paddocks), early life factors, and human interaction, act as mediators of cortisol levels in horses...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue life {{tests were}} {{performed}} in air on Type {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) to establish the effect of mean stress under both load control and strain control. An apparent reduction of up to 26 % in strain-amplitude occurred in the low and intermediate cycle regime (< 10 {sup 8 } cycles) for a mean stress of 138 Mpa. A quantitative description of mean stress effects using the Smith-Watson-Topper equivalent strain parameter was developed, which incorporates mean stress through the maximum stress. This description provided a tighter fit to the data, and allowed separation of mean stress and cold work effects. With this separation, the effect of mean stress was reduced to 12 % decrease in strain amplitude at 138 Mpa. The stress-life curve apparently increased with increasing mean <b>stress,</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the significant <b>work</b> hardening that occurred in tests with high mean stresses, especially under load control. Tests were performed on double-edge notched specimens of 304 SS in air and low oxygen water at 288 C. The elastically calculated increase in the notch tip stress accounted within 10 % for the fatigue life reductions for a K{sub t} = 4. 8 notch, but was 38 % conservative for a K{sub t} = 8. 8 notch. Fatigue crack initiation lives (defined as an 0. 127 mm crack) in low oxygen water at 288 C were reduced {{by a factor of}} four to eight on cycles over those in air. Crack growth occurred throughout most of the fatigue ''initiation'' life. The increase in crack growth rate of 304 SS in water appears to be large enough to explain the reduced ''initiation'' life in this environment...|$|R

A very large amount of studies have done on stress to create {{a deeper understanding of the}} causes, as well as the effects of stress. The purpose of this study therefore is to gain knowledge as to the nature and scope of stress experienced by members of the South African Police Service Dog unit in Durban. The South African Police Service have undergone 'n total change and this change, as any other, has not gone without problems. It is natural human nature to avoid change, and this has led to the fact that certain members have found the changes quite easy to adapt to, but others have not adapted to the new ways. Said changes have also taken place in the Dog unit in Durban. This specialized unit within the South African Police Service supply a service which is of cardinal importance and it is therefore necessary to take note of the stress experienced by members of this unit. The study not only focused on how the members experience stress, but also on the causes and effects of said experience. Furthermore, special attention was given to certain personality traits which members have displayed. The literature study preceding the results will help to understand and relate the results. The number of respondents experiencing high to very high levels of stress are greater than those experiencing normal levels of <b>stress.</b> This is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> related aspects such as job characteristics inherent to the job, remuneration, added benefits, and personnel policy as well as career opportunities. Furthermore, specific personality traits / characteristics were identified which identify respondents experiencing very high levels of stress.
