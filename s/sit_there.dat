5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E

25|$|Usually, {{a counter}} {{is placed in}} the 24-hour-opened main {{entrance}} and a pistol-armed police officer would <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> as the station duty officer, or watch commander, on a 2-or-4-hour watch. The watch commander is the main funnel between that station and civilians within its area of responsibility. He or she {{is in charge of the}} safety of the station, including the security of firearms and ammunition. The station duty officer must answer all personal or telephone complaints from civilians, delegate those reports to proper desk police officers, dispatch police officers on patrol to respond, or provide legal advice to common citizens. Also, the station duty officer would reply to all information requests concerning suspicious persons or vehicles over radio communication.|$|E

500|$|Woods overcame {{difficulties}} with stuttering as a boy. This {{was not known}} until {{he wrote a letter}} to a boy who contemplated suicide. Woods wrote, [...] "I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in.

I also took a class for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop." ...|$|E

500|$|Sire Records {{allowed the}} band between $25,000 and $30,000 to fully record and produce the album, {{which is a}} {{considerably}} larger budget compared to the band's previous albums. The band {{spent most of the}} money Sire had given them on the album's production value. The studio rent was $150 per hour, usually using the first take of a song as its final recording. Johnny explained that [...] "it's best to do it quickly... You do not wanna <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and bullshit. It's your money they're spending." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{was buried}} in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, {{including}} the hymns, {{was the work of}} the composer. After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: [...] "I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen." [...] Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. It was finally unveiled in 1939.|$|E

500|$|In Februaryâ€“March 1907, Andranik went to Vienna to {{participate}} in the fourth ARF Congress. The ARF, which had been associating with Turkish immigrant political groups in Europe since 1902, discussed and approved the negotiations with the Young Turkswho later perpetrated the Armenian Genocideto overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Andranik strongly denounced this cooperation and left the party. In 1908, the ARF asked Andranik to move to Constantinople and nominate his candidacy in the Ottoman parliament election, but he declined the offer, saying [...] "I don't want to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and do nothing". Andranik distanced himself from active political and military affairs for several years.|$|E
500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the jurors in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and stare at you and have that stupid grin on his face. He would make your skin crawl." ...|$|E

He and his father pilot Striker Eureka, [...] "the strongest and the fastest" [...] Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance's [...] "go-to team". Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, [...] "My immediate reaction was 'Holy crap, that's cool.' In the hands of somebody else, you might <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and go, 'Well, this might be terrible,' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, 'This {{is going to be}} amazing.'". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, [...] "The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|Stefani had an {{emotional}} breakdown from difficulties collaborating {{with many other}} artists and songwriters, so No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal invited her to his house. Kanal {{had been working on}} a track, which later became [...] "Crash", the sixth single from the album. However, the two were unable to write anything following that, because they had differing ideas of how the music should sound. Stefani commented that [...] "it was just frustrating and embarrassing to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and think we could write songs." [...] Six months later, the two returned to work and came up with the beginnings of a song while working in Kanal's bedroom. The two experimented with combining various melodies and including what Stefani referred to as [...] "this really kinda fast rappy part". This was the last song she and Kanal wrote together for the album.|$|E
500|$|The group {{subsequently}} enlisted Ryan Tedder, Paul Epworth, Declan Gaffney, and long-time collaborator Flood to {{help them}} complete the album, hoping their opposing perspectives from Burton would benefit the songs. Flood's time working on the record briefly overlapped with Burton's, and Gaffney served as U2's recording engineer for {{the entirety of the}} album sessions, but otherwise the group worked with each producer separately. Tedder initially critiqued in-progress songs and identified which ones were [...] "worth chasing because [...] had a limited amount of time". He compared himself to a music critic in the way he had [...] "to <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and tear their songs apart and give [...] honest opinion". Tedder alternated between working remotely and joining the band in the studio. One of the songs that he changed most was [...] "Every Breaking Wave", as he devised a new chorus melody and moved the old one to the song's bridge.|$|E

500|$|The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The {{following}} year he presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception. Unlike the First Symphony, it ends {{not in a}} blaze of orchestral splendour but quietly and contemplatively. Reed, who played at the premiere, later wrote that Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, [...] "but missed that unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as it was after the Violin Concerto or the First Symphony." [...] Elgar asked Reed, [...] "What is the matter with them, Billy? They <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> like a lot of stuffed pigs." [...] The work was, by normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international furore of the First Symphony.|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9â€“11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problemâ€”McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
