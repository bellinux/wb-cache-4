25|$|Binghamton {{has grown}} to include roughly 120 buildings, {{including}} recent additions from a $2.2 billion SUNY capital plan. New facilities include the $375 million East Campus Housing Complex featuring eight new residence halls; academic facilities including a new science building (Science 5); an indoor multipurpose Events Center to accommodate the University's commencement exercises, Bearcat athletic events and other activities; an addition and major renovations to the University Union; and additions to the partially completed Innovative Technologies Complex (ITC), which now includes three buildings: the Biotechnology Building, the $66 million Engineering and Science Building, and the $30 million Center of Excellence. A fourth building—the $70 million <b>Smart</b> <b>Energy</b> Research and Development Facility—is under construction at the ITC, scheduled for completion in 2017. Another significant addition is the $29 million University Downtown Center in downtown Binghamton, which opened in fall 2007 and houses the College of Community and Public Affairs. The 2007 soccer season saw the debut of a new outdoor soccer and lacrosse stadium.|$|E

40|$|The energy {{internet}} {{is one of}} the most promising future energy infrastructures that could both enhance energy efficiency and improve its operating flexibility. Analogous to the micro-grid, the micro energy internet emphasizes the distribution level and demand side. This paper proposes concepts and design principles of a <b>smart</b> micro <b>energy</b> internet for accommodating micro-grids, distributed poly-generation systems, energy storage facilities, and associated energy distribution infrastructures. Since the dispatch and control system of the <b>smart</b> micro <b>energy</b> {{internet is}} responsible for external disturbances, it should be able to approach a satisfactory operating point while supporting multiple criteria, such as safety, economy, and environmental protection. To realize the vision of a <b>smart</b> micro <b>energy</b> internet, an engineering game theory based energy management system with self-approaching-optimum capability is investigated. Based on the proposed concepts, design principles, and energy management system, this paper presents a prototype of China's first conceptual solar-based <b>smart</b> micro <b>energy</b> internet, established in Qinghai University.

40|$|Implementation of <b>smart</b> and {{sustainable}} <b>energy</b> projects {{in urban areas}} encounters different barriers. These barriers range from common financial shortage to specific constraints, which depend on local socio-economic, environmental and political characteristics of each city. In spite of various experiences of European cities in <b>smart</b> {{and sustainable}} <b>energy</b> projects, the transfer of lessons learnt on how to manage barriers in new projects is inefficient. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to apply a case-based learning methodology to predict barriers to a given <b>smart</b> and sustainable <b>energy</b> project. To achieve this aim, a learning methodology is proposed and applied to the case study of the city of Bolzano, within SINFONIA project. SINFONIA is a European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7) project for integration of <b>smart</b> and sustainable <b>energy</b> solutions at urban district level. The proposed methodology operates in two main steps: first, identifying and selecting the most similar European <b>smart</b> and sustainable <b>energy</b> cases to the target-case (Bolzano within SINFONIA); second, investigating barriers to implementation of selected cases. The results show that the barriers fragmented ownership of properties, limited access to capital and cost disincentives, and perception of interventions as complicated and expensive, with negative social or environmental impacts are highly probable to occur in Bolzano within SINFONIA. The proposed methodology is applicable and replicable for urban planners and decision-makers in different territorial levels to facilitate and accelerate the implementation of <b>smart</b> and sustainable <b>energy</b> projects...|$|R
