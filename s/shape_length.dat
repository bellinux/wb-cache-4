5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same <b>shape,</b> <b>length</b> and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E

Additionally, flies constructed for use in salt water are typically tied on corrosion-resistant hooks.|$|E
25|$|The Vitthala temple has a Garuda {{shrine in}} the form of a stone chariot in the courtyard; it is an often-pictured symbol of Hampi. Above the chariot is a tower, which was removed during the late 19th-century restorations. In the front of the stone chariot is a large, square, open-pillared, axial sabha mandapa, or {{community}} hall. The mandapa has four sections, two of which are aligned with the temple sanctum. The mandapa has 56 carved stone beams of different diameters, <b>shape,</b> <b>length</b> and surface finish that produces musical sounds when struck; according to local traditional belief, this hall was used for public celebrations of music and dancing.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, it was {{believed}} that in order to create dreadlocks, an individual had to refrain from brushing, combing or cutting. This lack of hair grooming results in what is called [...] "free form" [...] or [...] "neglect" [...] dreads, where the hair matts together slowly of its own accord. Such dreads tend to vary greatly in size, width, <b>shape,</b> <b>length,</b> and texture. If the wearer is interested in any uniformity of their dreads, they must pull the matted strands of hair apart to ensure large clumps don't form. In addition, if the wearer wishes for their dreads to be neat and tight, they must continue to separate the matted sections of hair and palm roll them regularly for a period of between [...] 6 to 12 months before their hair is well locked. Generally with this free form dread style, the dreads will remain loose and fluffy until the process of long term rolling has tightened them and they have reached a mature status. Until they reach this mature status, they are at risk of coming open especially with lots of water immersion (showers, swimming or washing). [...] Many people use products or wax to assist in the locking process. More over to help with the locking process people turn to using sea salt spray or natural sea salt to dry the hair and accelerate the matting process.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{cutting a}} tree, the builder had {{to assess the}} log, its <b>shape,</b> <b>length,</b> areas of damage {{and the extent of}} heart rot, as well as ways to work the bow and stern. [...] A major {{requirement}} while working with such an enormous log must have been to minimize the number of times the log had to be turned over. The first stage, therefore, would be to externally flatten the bottom and slightly upturn the bow and stern and shape the hull sides, as well as drilling holes for thickness gauges as required. [...] The log would then be rolled over and placed on some sort of timber framework so that access to the bottom was still possible. The next stage would be to work the upper section of the log to produce a sheerline and then work the inside until thickness gauges were reached. In this case, {{because of the presence of}} extensive rot, hollowing was probably done by tools rather than by fire. The thickness of the sides would be achieved by eye or by sound, simply by tapping the log. For the bottom, however, the holes left by the thickness gauges were later plugged by tightly fitted and dried oak tree-nails to ensure they were completely watertight upon expansion of the timber. The log would then be finished internally, with all the rebates for fitting bow timbers, transom, washstrakes, and holes along the sheerline cut. As the final step, bow and stern timbers, which were separate pieces from the hull log, would be caulked with moss and the whole structure made watertight.|$|E
60|$|Presently a {{porcupine}} waddled {{along some}} rods away, and unaware of my presence it passed by and climbed a spruce. I saw it climb high and finally {{lost sight of}} it. In searching up and down this spruce I grew alive to what a splendid and beautiful tree it was. Where so many trees grew it always seemed difficult to single out one and study it. This silver spruce was five feet through at the base, rugged, gray-seamed, thick {{all the way to}} its lofty height. Its branches were small, with a singular feature that they were uniform in <b>shape,</b> <b>length,</b> and droop. Most all spruce branches drooped toward the ground. That explained why they made such excellent shelters from rain. After a hard storm I had seen the ground dry under a thick-foliaged spruce. Many a time had I made a bed under one. Elk and deer stand under a spruce during a rain, unless there is thunder and lightning. In forests of high altitude, where lightning strikes many trees, I have never found or heard of elk and deer being killed. This particular spruce was a natural tent in the forest. The thick-spreading graceful silver plumes extended clear to the top, where they were bushiest, and rounded out, with all the largest branches there. Each dark gray branch was fringed and festooned with pale green moss, like the cypresses of the South.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the usage of the "time" {{variable}} as a convenient explanatory variable on the horizontal axis of the product life cycle graph has diverted attention from a thorough analysis of the factors which influence the <b>shape</b> and <b>length</b> of the PLC.

It contends that the explanation of the PLC <b>shape</b> and <b>length</b> is found not merely in analysing the four broad sets of factors, but perhaps more importantly in the various interactions between these sets of factors. In doing so, it refutes the notion of the PLC as being time dependent per se and reemphasises the strategic role of management in affecting changes over the life cycle...|$|R
