5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the <b>show</b> <b>or</b> broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology {{at the beginning of his}} next show, against the advice of his staff.|$|E
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon <b>show</b> <b>or</b> not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television <b>show,</b> <b>or</b> film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.|$|E

5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone new light on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. The story was criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, the story was worthy of any Batman film, TV <b>show</b> <b>or</b> comic book.|$|E
5|$|Early games {{involved}} varying {{numbers of}} players. Games {{could also be}} played with uneven numbers on each side either because some failed to <b>show</b> <b>or</b> one side offered a handicap. The first match between Sheffield and Hallam involved 16 players versus 20. Games predominantly involved larger numbers than used in the modern games. In October 1863, Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side matches. Despite this it continued to do so on occasions. By 1867 {{the vast majority of}} matches in Sheffield involved teams of between 11 and 14.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Wong's {{father died}} in Los Angeles {{at the age of}} 91. After a six-year absence, Wong {{returned}} to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called Impact. From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the DuMont Television Network series The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, in which she played the title role which used her birth name. Wong's character was a dealer in Chinese art whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue. The ten half-hour episodes aired during prime time, from 9:00 to 9:30p.m. Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the <b>show</b> <b>or</b> its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an internal hemorrhage, which her brother attributed to the onset of menopause, her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.|$|E

5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category <b>show</b> (<b>or</b> begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E
5|$|Rae is not {{included}} in Max Germaine's Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia, Caroline Ambrus's The Ladies' Picture <b>Show,</b> <b>or</b> Helen Topliss's Modernism and Feminism: Australian Women Artists 1900–1940. Nevertheless, the secondary market for Rae's works has been relatively strong, with one work selling in 2012 for 10,000 Euros, as against a pre-auction estimate of two-thirds that sum. Works by Rae are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Australian War Memorial. Outside Australia, her work is represented in the Musée du Touquet, just outside Étaples township.|$|E

Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't {{know any of the}} lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled his way through the show.

5|$|Tzara became {{involved}} {{in a number of}} Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or Paul Éluard. Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were Jean Cocteau, Paul Dermée and Raymond Radiguet. The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by hoaxes and false advertising, announcing that the Hollywood film star Charlie Chaplin was going to appear on stage at its <b>show,</b> <b>or</b> that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage. In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the Université populaire in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed. Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the working class.|$|E
5|$|Under federal law, private-party sellers are not {{required}} to perform background checks on buyers, whether at a gun <b>show</b> <b>or</b> other venue.

This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform background checks on almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E

5|$|With {{five months}} devoted to casting for the pilot, Gough and Miller cast {{ultimately}} hired eight actors {{to take on}} the role of series regulars for the first season. Since then, only two characters from the first season have remained regulars through to the eighth season, with seven new actors taking on lead roles from seasons two through eight. Four of those new actors began as recurring guests in their first seasonal appearance, but were given top billing the following season. As the series progresses, recurring guests appear at various times to help move the overall storyline of the <b>show</b> <b>or</b> just provide a side-story arc for one of the main characters, such as Brainiac or Adam Knight. Other recurring guests appear as background characters, showing up for only a few scenes, which includes characters like Sheriff Nancy Adams or Dr. Virgil Swann.|$|E
