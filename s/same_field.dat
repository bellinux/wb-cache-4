5|$|A nonempty subset W of a {{vector space}} V that is closed under {{addition}} and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the 0-vector of V) {{is called a}} linear subspace of V, or simply a subspace of V, when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space. Subspaces of V are vector spaces (over the <b>same</b> <b>field)</b> in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set S of vectors is called its span, {{and it is the}} smallest subspace of V containing the set S. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of S.|$|E

5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the <b>same</b> <b>field</b> as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting the {{tendency}} in the Third Reich to have several rival agencies {{operating in the}} <b>same</b> <b>field,</b> {{a number of new}} organizations emerged in the diplomatic field that competed with the Auswärtiges Amt. The most important of the rivals of the Auswärtiges Amt was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, which was the rival foreign office headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop that operated its own foreign policy in direct competition with the Auswärtiges Amt. Neurath favored a pro-Chinese policy whereas Ribbentrop favored a pro-Japanese policy. In the summer of 1935, Ribbentrop and his friend, the Japanese military attache to Germany General Hiroshi Ōshima, {{came up with a plan}} to square the circle between Germany having to choose between Japan or China, and bring China into the Japanese sphere of influence by devising a plan for anti-Communist alliance that would unite Germany, China and Japan together. This was the origin of what become the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Ribbentrop-Ōshima plan was vetoed in November 1935 jointly by the Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath and by the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , who told Hitler that the Chinese would never join this proposed alliance, and that on economic grounds China had much more to offer Germany than did Japan.|$|E

5|$|When the {{producers}} knew Macfadyen would leave, {{the producers}} decided to introduce new cast members, {{one of which}} was Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam Carter, the new protagonist. Early on in the creation of Adam, the producers had an interest in casting Penry-Jones for the role; however, it took the actor three auditions until the producers finally decided to cast him. Unlike Tom, Adam would have a different character dynamic; he has an MI6 background, and is married. A change from the girlfriend/boyfriend storyline for Tom and Ellie Simm in the first series, the producers noted it is common for secret service officers to be in a relationship with others in the <b>same</b> <b>field</b> of work. This led to the introduction of Fiona Carter, portrayed by Olga Sosnovska. Sosnovska was previously approached to appear in the second series, but was unavailable. She later auditioned for Fiona, and was later told she won the part when she was in New York City. The actress was only given a brief on her character—a ball breaker, ultimate professional, cold and calculated—which did not give her much to work with. Sosnovska initially found Fiona irritating in the fourth episode, but later opened up to the character after her return in the seventh.|$|E
