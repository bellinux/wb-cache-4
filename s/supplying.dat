Anthony's father was William Anthony (died 1535) a Fleming from Middelburg in Zeeland who migrated to England in 1503. William was a supplier of beer to the army, and Anthony followed in his father's footsteps. He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy. In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the Tower of London, a position he retained nominally until his death. He rose to the rank of overseer of the Ordnance Office, the government body responsible for <b>supplying</b> the armed forces with artillery, and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll. In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower, Calais, Boulogne, and elsewhere for life. He continued the work of <b>supplying</b> arms to English forces, and was active in the last month of his life <b>supplying</b> guns for an expedition against Le Havre.|$|E

40|$|The major task of <b>supply</b> chain {{planning}} â€“ as {{the tactical}} level of <b>supply</b> chain management â€“ is {{the determination of}} supply-chain-wide master plans on a medium-term basis. Both in literature and in commercial <b>supply</b> chain management systems, a centralised approach to <b>supply</b> chain planning is frequently proposed. Due to the incongruence between incentives of the firms involved in the <b>supply</b> chain and overall <b>supply</b> chain objectives, a centralised <b>supply</b> chain planning will either not be accepted or will not lead to system-wide effectiveness. For this reason, <b>supply</b> chain planning decisions are most commonly coordinated on a decentralised basis.

The costs of a mismatch between <b>supply</b> and demand are growing in many industries. Companies have tried various approaches, however these approaches, while useful, have failed to address a number of the drivers of supply-demand mismatch. The literature study starts with an overview of <b>supply</b> chain management. The study covers the various concepts of <b>supply</b> chain management, the importance of <b>supply</b> chain performance, the challenges of managing <b>supply</b> chains, demand management, <b>supply</b> management, as well as the relationship between <b>supply</b> and demand. The literature study continues to cover the various concepts related to the alignment of <b>supply</b> and demand within a <b>supply</b> chain. The study covers the effects of the misalignment between <b>supply</b> and demand within a <b>supply</b> chain, traditional approaches to align <b>supply</b> and demand and the transformation to a more responsive organisation. The various approaches to decrease the <b>supply</b> and demand lead time gap are also discussed. The literature study concludes with an overview of the <b>supply</b> chain of Kraft Foods South Africa, as well as the global Kraft Foods organisation. The review covers the challenges, the sustainable growth plan, the organisational set-up, sources and product range, geographical layout, people, functions and technology involved in Kraft’s <b>supply</b> chain. The review concludes with an overview of the current alignment between <b>supply</b> and demand within Kraft Foods South Africa’s <b>supply</b> chain. Chapter five discusses the details of the research design and methodology that was followed in conducting the research. Chapter six indicates the findings of the structured interviews with the key players in Kraft Foods South Africa’s <b>supply</b> chain. Chapter seven makes certain recommendations for the <b>supply</b> chain of Kraft Foods South Africa that will assist in improving the alignment between <b>supply</b> and demand.

Germany sent its first shipments of Panzer I light tanks to the Nationalist Front in September 1936. During the war, France and Poland provided the Popular Front with a number of additional FT light tanks. A considerable number of tanks delivered to the Popular Front were subsequently captured; many of these were put into service against their former owners.|$|E
