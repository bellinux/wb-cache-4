40|$|Classical {{experimental}} design methods have gained widespread acceptance in the simulation literature. The simulation {{experimental design}} literature concentrates {{almost exclusively on}} factorial, fractional factorial, and composite <b>simplex</b> <b>designs,</b> which can be significantly more efficient than random or ad-hoc methods. However, there are several substantial differences between the classical (statistical) and simulation contexts that have received little attention. Most importantly, the design literature concentrates on obtaining maximum information from a set number of experiments, while in simulation we often wish to obtain a given amount of information at minimum cost. Also, classical designs and design methods generally assume constant variance and constant cost-per-experiment, while this is generally {{not the case in}} simulation. Hence classical designs are often not suitable for the simulation context. In addition, there are few rules to guide the experimenter in choosing an appropriate design, leading to quite arbitrary selection procedures. Thus although computer simulation is the ideal environment for which to develop experimental design software, the limitations of classical design methods mean that such software would do little more than perform routine tasks. In this thesis we discuss the main differences between the classical and simulation contexts, and propose and develop an alternative design approach that is often more suitable for the simulation context. The design for our approach is found by solving an optimisation problem, and includes an element of sequentiality. In conjunction with a proposed solution heuristic, our approach is easily incorporated into experimental design software that requires little input from the experimenter. A number of examples and a Monte Carlo study are presented to illustrate the properties of our approach. We also discuss sequential experimental design, and list a number of research issues...|$|E

The effects of increasing the biodiversity of a sward mixture on dry matter yield and unsown species invasion were studied. Methods A field experiment involving four grassland species [two grasses ? perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) ? and two legumes ? red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens) ], grown in monocultures and mixtures in accordance with a <b>simplex</b> <b>design,</b> was carried out. The legumes were included either as single varieties or as one of two broad genetic-base composites. The experiment was harvested {{three times a year}} over three years; dry matter yield and yield of unsown species were determined at each harvest. Yields of individual species and interactions between all species present were estimated through a statistical modelling approach. Key Results Species diversity produced a strong positive yield effect that resulted in transgressive over-yielding {{in the second and third}} years. Using broad genetic-base composites of the legumes had a small impact on yield and species interactions. Invasion by unsown species was strongly reduced by species diversity, but species identity was also important. Cocksfoot and white clover (with the exception of one broad genetic-base composite) reduced invasion, while red clover was the most invaded species. Conclusions The results show that it is possible to increase, and stabilize, the yield of a grassland crop and reduce invasion by unsown species by increasing its species diversity.

At the end of this period the soil columns were divided into upper and lower halves and microbial biomass carbon and functional diversity assessed. Greater microbial biomass and activity was found in the upper layer of soil. Food supply was the major driver leading to increased microbial activity and biomass. Increased earthworm biomass had the opposite effect. In the lower soil layer, the presence of anecic worms had the greatest effect on microbial biomass and activity. This effect was enhanced with increased food supply. Overall, the relationship between earthworm functional diversity and microbial community level physiological profile appeared to be idiosyncratic and the effect of the earthworms varied with soil layer, initial biomass and food supply.

The influence of type and concentration of three disintegrants viz.,Ac-Di-Sol, Primojel and Polyplasdone XL on hardness, friability and disintegration time of tablet was studied. Response surface plot and the polynomial equations {{were used to}} evaluate influence of polymer on the tablet properties. Results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA, and a p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results reveal that fibrous integrity and optimal degree of substitution in Primojel and Ac-Di-Sol are mainly responsible for the hardness of the tablet. Use of Polyplasdone in higher percentage in tablet formulation may result in high friability. Increase in concentration of Ac-Di-Sol increases the disintegration time but increased concentration of Primojel in the tablet formulation decreases the disintegration time. This is also evident from model terms for disintegration time with a high 'F' value of 14. 69 and 'p' value of 0. 0031 (< 0. 05). The reason could be that Primojel has higher swelling properties and an optimum hydration capacity, which favors fast disintegration of a tablet.
