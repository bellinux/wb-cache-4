5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to <b>store</b> <b>cargo</b> efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E

This storage could only be reached through hatches on the deck, and men working in the hull to store or move cargo could not stand up, but had to work while hunched over or crawling through the hull space.|$|E

50|$|Dysart House, {{formerly}} {{the seat of}} the Earl of Rossyln, overlooks the harbour. The earliest section of the house is the south range built for General James St Clair between 1755 and 1756, for which it is believed that the Adam Brothers provided the chimney pieces and the design. The house was extended between 1808 and 1814 to include new rear wings. The three-storey harbourmaster's house in the grounds of the harbour dates from around 1840. Originally known as the shore house, this was used to <b>store</b> <b>cargo</b> from incoming ships, before being used by the harbourmaster. Today, the house is home to the headquarters of the Fife Countryside and Coast Trust and also has a bistro, shop and provides internet access.|$|E

40|$|A {{study by}} Rybkin et al. (see p. 527) {{substantially}} advances {{our understanding of}} regulated exocytois by specialized secretory cells, such as atrial myocytes. A second member of the Ras-related protein family, RRP 17, was identified and shown to participate in regulating the secretion of the cardiac-derived peptide hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide. In addition to the heart, RRP 17 was shown to be expressed in neuronal, pancreatic, and skeletal muscle cells, suggesting a widespread role in regulated secretion for this new protein. Comment Vesicle-bound cargo can be released from mammalian cells by constitutive or regulated exocytosis. All cells exhibit constitutive exocytosis; however, neuroendocrine cells also possess a specialized form of exocytosis that requires activation of the appropriate signal transduction pathways and is, therefore, referred to as regulated exocytosis (An and Zenisek, 2004; Silver and Pappas, 2005). Cardiac myocytes in the atrium are both contractile and endocrine cells capable of secreting several peptide hormones, including the blood pressure and volume lowering hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (Fig. 1). As in most peptide hormone-secreting cells, large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) <b>store</b> <b>cargo</b> that is bound for regulated exocytosis, while constitutive ex ocytosis involves smaller vesicles (Michael et al., 2006). Although the regulation of ANP synthesis has been well studied, the packaging of ANP into LDCVs and its trafficking and exocytosis are less well understood. In this issue, Rybkin et al. (2007) make progress in understanding these processes by identifying a new Ras-related protein involved in regulated secretion of ANP. In most cases, the signaling pathways required for regulated exocytosis culminate {{with an increase in}} cytosolic calcium (Oheim et al., 2006; Rutter et al., 2006), which is required for the priming, as well as the docking and the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (Stojilkovic, 2005).

50|$|In the 17th century, the bay {{was called}} Kaupunginlahti (Stadsviken).

40|$|Different from warehouse, crossdock is {{considered}} as a "JIT" technique in logistics and supply chain management (LSCM), which is usually {{a short period of}} time to <b>store</b> <b>cargos.</b> Since cargos transported to a crossdock by inbound trucks are immediately sorted out, repackaged, routed and loaded into outbound trucks and then delivered to customers within one day, one of the key issues to operate crossdock successfully is to develop an efficient truck-dock assignment module in the crossdock management system so that all the cargos can be delivered to customers on time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive tabu search (ATS) algorithm as an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to optimize the truck-dock assignment problem within a crossdock in a very efficient way, and computational experiments are conducted, showing that our approach dominates the CPLEX Solver in both effectiveness and efficiency. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote forms {{concentrate}} {{their major}} protease, cruzipain, {{in the same}} compartment where these parasites store macromolecules obtained from medium and for this ability these organelles were named as reservosomes. Intracellular digestion occurs mainly inside reservosomes {{and seems to be}} modulated by cruzipain and its natural inhibitor chagasin that also concentrates in reservosomes. T. cruzi mammalian forms, trypomastigotes and amastigotes, are unable to capture macromolecules by endocytosis, but also express cruzipain and chagasin, whose role in infectivity has been described. In this paper, we demonstrate that trypomastigotes and amastigotes also concentrate cruzipain, chagasin as well as serine carboxypeptidase in hydrolase-rich compartments of acidic nature. The presence of P-type proton ATPase indicates that this compartment is acidiWed by the same enzyme as epimastigote endocytic compartments. Electron microscopy analyzes showed that these organelles are placed at the posterior region of the parasite body, are single membrane bound and possess an electron-dense matrix with electronlucent inclusions. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that these compartments have diVerent size and shape in trypomastigotes and amastigotes. Based on these evidences, we suggest that all T. cruzi developmental stages present lysosome-related organelles that in epimastigotes have the additional and unique ability of <b>storing</b> <b>cargo...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{improper}} {{air circulation}} within the refrigerated truck chambers {{is the major}} cause of inadequate road transport of perishable products under controlled temperature. In this study, two methods were developed, one experimental and another computational, for modelling of non-isothermal turbulent flows in refrigerated chambers, both of natural convection and of forced convection. The computational model consists on a numerical procedure, which solves, in finite-difference form using a control volume technique, the three-dimensional time-averaged equations expressing the conversation of mass, momentum, energy and concentration of species. A two equation turbulence model was used to model the effect of turbulence. The experimental validation was accomplished through confrontation of the numerical predictions with measures obtained in a reduced-scale model. The good agreement obtained suggests a good accuracy for engineering purposes. A simple physical modelling technique, based on dimensional analysis, was used to derive the physical properties of the experimental (reduced) model. A non-steady state modelling strategy of refrigerated chambers with forced convention and {{the extension of the}} computational model to the <b>stored</b> <b>cargo</b> were was also presented and validated.
