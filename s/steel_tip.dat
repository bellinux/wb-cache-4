2500|$|While {{plans for}} the Empire State Building were being finalized, there was an intense {{competition}} in New York {{for the title of}} [...] "world's tallest building", and the 40 Wall Street (then the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building in Manhattan were both under construction when work began on the Empire State Building. The [...] "Race into the Sky", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities. The 40 Wall Street tower was revised from [...] to [...] in April 1929, making it the world's tallest. The Chrysler Building added its [...] <b>steel</b> <b>tip</b> to its roof in October 1929, bringing it to a height of [...] and greatly exceeding 40 Wall Street's height. The Chrysler Building's developer, Walter Chrysler, realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered his architect William Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. Raskob, wishing to have the Empire State Building be the world's tallest, reviewed the plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own; however, the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension. On November 18, 1929, Smith acquired a lot at 27–31 West 33rd Street, adding [...] to the width of the proposed office building's site. Two days later, Smith announced the updated {{plans for the}} skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.|$|E

The X-5 and substituted greater explosive power for descent speed, with a total weight approaching 2,250 kg.

None of the variants ever made it into large-scale production or operational use.|$|E
5000|$|Phacoemulsification (phaco) is {{the most}} common {{technique}} used in developed countries. It involves the use of a machine with an ultrasonic handpiece equipped with a titanium or <b>steel</b> <b>tip.</b> The tip vibrates at ultrasonic frequency (40,000 Hz) and the lens material is emulsified. A second fine instrument (sometimes called a [...] "cracker" [...] or [...] "chopper") may be used from a side port to facilitate cracking or chopping of the nucleus into smaller pieces. Fragmentation into smaller pieces makes emulsification easier, as well as the aspiration of cortical material (soft part of the lens around the nucleus). After phacoemulsification of the lens nucleus and cortical material is completed, a dual irrigation-aspiration (I-A) probe or a bimanual I-A system is used to aspirate out the remaining peripheral cortical material.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} is to analyse (with the help of scanning electron microscopes) {{the quality of the}} dental root surface and the appearance of dental cracks after performing apical preparations using two diffe- rent types of ultrasonic tips. Study design: We used 32 single-rooted teeth that underwent a root canal and apical resection. Afterwards, the teeth were divided into 4 groups of 8 teeth each, with preparations of the apical cavities in the following manner: Group 1 : stainless <b>steel</b> ultrasonic <b>tip</b> at 33 KHz. Group 2 : stainless <b>steel</b> ultrasonic <b>tip</b> at 30 KHz. Group 3 : diamond ultrasonic tip at 30 KHz. Group 4 : diamond ultrasonic tip at 33 KHz. The quality of the root surface and the presence of cracks were evaluated by one single observer using a scanning electron microscope. Results: All of the teeth in our study had cracks after the apical preparations. The mean number of cracks per tooth ranged between 6. 1 ± 1. 9 (group 1) and 3. 5 ± 2. 4 (group 4), with a significantly higher number found in the groups that used stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tips</b> (P=. 03). The types of cracks produced involved: 8 complete cracks (4. 5 %), 167 incomplete cracks (94. 4 %), and 2 intradentinal cracks (1. 1 %), with no significant differences observed between the different frequencies used for each group.

50|$|The {{camshaft}} is billet steel, {{made from}} 8620 carbon or S7 through-hardened tool steel or similar. It runs in five oil pressure lubricated bearing shells and {{is driven by}} gears {{in the front of}} the engine. Mechanical roller lifters (cam followers) ride atop the cam lobes and drive the steel push rods up into the steel rocker arms that actuate the valves. The rockers are of roller tip type on the intake and exhaust sides. Like the cam follower rollers, the <b>steel</b> <b>tip</b> roller rotates on a steel roller bearing and the steel rocker arms rotate on a pair of through-hardened tool steel shafts within bronze bushings. Intake and exhaust rockers are billet. The dual valve springs are of coaxial type and made out of titanium. Valve retainers are also made of titanium, as are the rocker covers.|$|E
50|$|For {{penetrating}} substances significantly {{harder than}} jacketed lead, the lead core is supplemented with or {{replaced with a}} harder material, such as hardened steel. Military armor-piercing small arms ammunition is made from a copper-jacketed steel core; the steel resists deformation better than the usual soft lead core leading to greater penetration. The current NATO 5.56mm SS109 (M855) bullet uses a steel-tipped lead core to improve penetration, the <b>steel</b> <b>tip</b> providing resistance to deformation for armor piercing, and the heavier lead core (25% heavier than the previous bullet, the M193) providing increased sectional density for better penetration in soft targets. For larger, higher-velocity calibers, such as tank guns, hardness is of secondary importance to density, and are normally sub-caliber projectiles made from tungsten carbide, tungsten hard alloy or depleted uranium fired in a light aluminum or magnesium alloy (or carbon fibre in some cases) sabot.|$|E

These new javelins flew further, but were also less likely to land neatly point first; {{as a response to the}} increasingly frequent flat or ambiguously flat landings, experiments with modified javelins started in the early 1980s. The resulting designs, which made flat landings much less common and reduced the distances thrown, became official for men starting in April 1986 and for women in April 1999, and the world records (then 104.80 m by Uwe Hohn, and 80.00 m by Petra Felke) were reset.

5000|$|On June 24, 2010, the United States Army {{announced}} it began shipping its new 5.56 mm cartridge, the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR), to active combat zones. During testing, the M855A1 performed better than M80 7.62×51mm NATO ball ammunition against {{certain types of}} targets (particularly hardened steel). However, {{this was due to}} the addition of the steel penetrator to the M855A1 projectile compared to the standard lead-alloy core of the M80 projectile and is not an accurate comparison between the two cartridges. The US Army Picatinny Arsenal stated that the new M855A1 offers improved hard target capability, more consistent performance at all distances, enhanced dependability, improved accuracy, reduced muzzle flash, and higher velocity compared to the SS109/M855 round. Further, the Army stated the new M855A1 ammunition is tailored for use in M4 carbines, but should also give enhanced performance in M16 rifles and M249 light machine guns. The new 62-grain (4 g) projectile used in the M855A1 round has a copper core with a 19-grain (1.2 g) steel [...] "stacked-cone" [...] penetrating tip. The M855A1 cartridge is sometimes referred to as [...] "green ammo" [...] because it fires a lead free projectile. It is not necessarily more lethal than the SS109/M855, but performs more consistently every time it hits a soft target and retains its performance at longer distances. The EPR can penetrate a 3/8 in thick mild steel barrier from an M4 at 350 m and from an M16 at 400 m. Compared to the SS109/M855 the M855A1 muzzle velocities are somewhat increased to 3150 ft/s (+37 ft/s) for the M16 and 2970 ft/s (+54 ft/s) for the M4 carbine. Ballistics for both rounds are similar and don't require weapons to be re-zeroed, but if they are the EPR can be slightly more accurate. The steel-tip penetrator of the M855A1 is noticeably separated from the jacket of the bullet and can spin, but {{this is part of the}} design and does not affect performance. The M855A1 costs only 5 cents more per round than the M855. The M855A1 bullet has a 1/8 in greater length than the SS109/M855. Because steel and copper are less dense than lead, the bullet is lengthened inside the case to achieve the same weight as its predecessor. The longer bullet and reverse-drawn jacket make it more stable and accurate in-flight. Its <b>steel</b> <b>tip</b> is exposed from the jacket and bronzed for corrosion resistance. The tip is serrated and larger than the M855's <b>steel</b> <b>tip.</b> The M855A1's bullet composition, better aerodynamics, and higher proof pressures give it an extended effective range for penetration and terminal performance. While effectiveness at different ranges is increased, the M855A1 does not increase the effective ranges at which weapons are expected to hit their targets. The Enhanced Performance Round was made to nearly match the trajectory of the M855 to aid in training consistency - the SS109/M855 ballistic coefficient (G7 BC) of 0.151 was improved to 0.152 for the M855A1 - but the ranges to get desired effects are greatly extended.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, NATO {{decided to}} {{standardize}} a second rifle caliber. Tests were conducted from 1977 to 1980 using U.S. XM777 5.56 mm, Belgian SS109 5.56 mm, British 4.85×49mm, and German 4.7×33mm caseless. No weapon could be agreed upon, as many were prototypes, but the SS109 {{was found to}} be the best round and standardized on October 28, 1980. The SS109 was developed in the 1970s for the FN FNC rifle and the FN Minimi machine gun. To increase the range of the Minimi, the round was created to penetrate 3.5 mm of steel at 600 meters. The SS109 had a <b>steel</b> <b>tip</b> and lead rear and was not required to penetrate body armor. Barrels required at least a 1:9 in rifle twist, but needed a 1:7 in rifle twist to fire tracer ammunition. The U.S. designated the SS109 cartridge the M855 and first used it in the M16A2 rifle. The 62-grain round was heavier than the previous 55-grain M193. While the M855 had better armor penetrating ability, it is less likely to fragment after hitting a soft target. This lessens kinetic energy transfer to the target and reduces wounding capability. The M855 is yaw dependent, meaning it depends on the angle upon which it hits the target. If at a good angle, the round turns as it enters soft tissue, breaking apart and transferring its energy to what it hits. If impacting at a bad angle, it could pass through and fail to transfer its full energy. The SS109 was made to pierce steel helmets at long range from the Minimi, not improve terminal performance on soft tissue from rifles or carbines. In Iraq, troops that engaged insurgents at less than 150 yards found that M855 rounds did not provide enough stopping power. In addition to not causing lethal effects with two or more rounds, they did not effectively penetrate vehicle windshields, even with many rounds fired at extremely close range. In Afghanistan, troops found that M855 rounds also suffered at long ranges. Although 5.56 mm rifles have an effective range of 450-600 meters, the M855 bullet's performance falls off sharply beyond 300 meters. The ranges are even shorter for short-barreled carbines. Half of small-arms attacks were launched from 300-900 meter ranges. An M855 fired from an M4 Carbine has severely degraded performance beyond 150 meters.|$|E

The DC micro-diaphragm pump is automatically controlled via a voltage driver interfaced with a computer in order to effectively and efficiently control suction force and pressure during microfluidic handling and droplet control in nano maufacturing. The new pneumatic end effector system with force sensing can significantly improve the success rate for handling/depositing micro/nano entities in the case of carbon nanotubes. The experimental results show the success rate of placing carbon nantubes between electrodes can reach close to 80 %. Ultimately, the technology will provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated manufacturing process for batch assembly of micro devices, manufacturing of nano devices, microfluidic droplet control, and drug delivery. © 2006 IEEE.
