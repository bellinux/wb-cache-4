5|$|The {{threat to}} humans in {{developed}} countries is rising {{as a result of}} social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and <b>salad</b> <b>vegetables</b> from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the microbiological quality of <b>vegetable</b> <b>salads</b> (ulam) from food stalls and markets in Jeli. Determination of aerobic plate count and total coliform was done to 30 selected <b>vegetable</b> <b>salads</b> sampled from 12 location. Standard methods {{were used to determine}} the aerobic plate count (CFU/ 100 g) and total coliform (MPN/g) by referring to Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM). Microbiological analysis of food samples showed that aerobic plate count and total coliform was detected more in leafy <b>vegetable</b> <b>salads</b> as compared to non-leafy <b>vegetable</b> <b>salads.</b> The results for aerobic plate count agar showed 2100 CFU/ 100 g for ulam raja and 11 CFU/ 100 g for cucumber while for total coliform, both showed > 1100 and 240 MPN/g at Café 2 from IBS.

50|$|The Hay System {{promoted}} eating {{three meals}} per day with meal one being what the diet {{considers to be}} alkaline foods only, meal two composed of what the diet considers to be protein foods with <b>salads,</b> <b>vegetables</b> and fruit, and meal three composed of what the diet considers to be starchy foods with <b>salads,</b> <b>vegetables</b> and sweet fruit; with an interval of 4.0 to 4.5 hours between each meal. The Hay diet was popular in the 1930s and many restaurants offered 'Hay-friendly' menus; followers of his dietary advice, included Henry Ford and Man Ray. In this period Hay was criticized in the Journal of the American Medical Society (JAMA) as a food-faddist and separately for advocating that a patient with type 1 diabetes on the Hay diet should stop taking insulin. In 1935, Stewart Baxter showed that the pancreas secretes digestion enzymes simultaneously {{regardless of whether the}} food eaten is carbohydrates or protein, contrary to one of the central propositions of the diet.|$|R

25|$|Usually {{the deep}} purple roots of {{beetroot}} are eaten boiled, roasted or raw, and either alone or combined with any <b>salad</b> <b>vegetable.</b> A {{large proportion of}} the commercial production is processed into boiled and sterilized beets or into pickles.

5000|$|The döner kebap as it {{was first}} served in Berlin {{contained}} only meat, onions {{and a bit of}} salad. Over time, it developed into a dish with abundant <b>salad,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and a selection of sauces to choose from. Even orders placed in the Turkish language in Berlin will ask for the hot sauce using the German word [...] "scharf", flagging the hybrid nature of the Berlin style of döner kebap. This variation served with pita bread has influenced the style of döner kebap in Germany and in other nations. A 2007 survey showed that many people consider the döner kebab to be the most characteristic food of Berlin.|$|E
50|$|He was {{apparently}} {{shocked by the}} English partiality for meat, lack of green vegetables and sugar-rich diet. Thus he set about writing The fruit, herbs & vegetables of Italy (1614). The manuscript, written in Italian, was circulated amongst supporters. He was, like many Italians, a keen gardener. At the time {{in which he was}} writing the British palate was only beginning to absorb culinary flavours from the continent. Aspects of French and Dutch cooking had assimilated into British cooking but eating habits were still centred on the consumption of large quantities of meat. Castelvetro's enthusiasm for a diverse diet preceded John Evelyn's treatise produced in 1699 which equally urged the English to eat more <b>salad</b> <b>vegetables.</b>|$|E
50|$|Modifying {{atmosphere}} {{is a way}} to preserve food by operating on the atmosphere around it. Salad crops that are notoriously difficult to preserve are now being packaged in sealed bags with an atmosphere modified to reduce the oxygen (O2) concentration and increase the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. There is concern that, although <b>salad</b> <b>vegetables</b> retain their appearance and texture in such conditions, this method of preservation may not retain nutrients, especially vitamins.There are two methods for preserving grains with carbon dioxide. One method is placing a block of dry ice in the bottom and filling the can with the grain. Another method is purging the container from the bottom by gaseous carbon dioxide from a cylinder or bulk supply vessel.|$|E

40|$|<b>Salad</b> <b>vegetables</b> are {{consumed}} without any heat treatment, sometimes without washing and peeling {{and therefore the}} possibility of food borne diseases is more.
