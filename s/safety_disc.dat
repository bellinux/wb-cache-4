40|$|Abstract: A {{butterfly}} valve {{is a type}} of flow control device, which is widely used to regulate a fluid flowing through a section of pipe. Currently, analyses and optimization are of special important in the design and usage of {{butterfly valve}}s. For the analysis, finite element method (FEM) is often used to predict the <b>safety</b> of valve <b>disc,</b> and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is commonly used to study the flow characteristics of valve. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate results for the optimization of butterfly valve due to the high non-linearities. For this reason, metamodels or surrogate model methods are extensively employed. This paper integrates metamodel with FEM and CFD analysis to optimize a traditional butterfly valve, where the weight of the valve disc is the design objective, and the strength <b>safety</b> of <b>disc</b> and the pressure loss coefficient of valve are constraints. Kriging model is employed as a surrogate model to formulate the objectives and constrains, and the orthogonal array is used as design of experiment to sample the computer analysis. The optimum results with the corresponding variable combinations for the valve disc are obtained easily by this method. Moreover, the structural and fluid analyses with the obtained optimum variable combinations are conducted again to verify the accuracy of the optimization method. The results demonstrate the capability and potential of this method, which integrates the Kriging model with FEM and CFD analysis, in solving the optimization of a butterfly valve...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are special}} high voltage probes which also form {{compensated}} attenuators with the oscilloscope input; the probe body is physically large, and some require partly filling a canister surrounding the series resistor with volatile liquid fluorocarbon to displace air. At the oscilloscope end is {{a box with}} several waveform-trimming adjustments. For <b>safety,</b> a barrier <b>disc</b> keeps one's fingers distant from the point being examined. Maximum voltage is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition, until the probe tip is in contact. Until then, a tiny arc charges the probe tip, and its capacitance holds the voltage (open circuit). As the voltage continues to climb, another tiny arc charges the tip further.) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the first update of the {{systematic}} reviews "Chemonukleolyse und intradiskale Elektrotherapie" and "Perkutane Nukleotomie und perkutane Laserdiskusdekompression" compiled in 2009. The review investigates the efficacy and safety of the procedures, with particular focus on chemonucleolysis. These minimally invasive surgical procedures are used {{for the treatment of}} back pain and provide a treatment alternative to surgery. Current evidence suggests a benefit in efficacy for O 2 -O 3 -nucleolysis when compared to steroid injections alone with no difference regarding safety. In addition it appears to be equal in efficacy and <b>safety</b> compared to <b>disc</b> surgery. To date, there are no placebo-controlled trials available however. For chemonucleolysis with chymopapain and condoliase no recommendations were made, since these substances were either withdrawn from sale or have no current regulatory approval. For all other three interventions no significant new controlled studies have been identified since the previous reports in 2009...|$|R

This burst disk protects the user against a situation where the pressure in the bottle would increase with exposure to heat during a fire. It prevents unwanted failures somewhere else in the bottle. It is set to release at 7200 psi, or 400 °F. It is [...] "tri-dimensional" [...] in that, if it is activated, it would disperse the air from the bottle in three directions so as not to throw the user off his or her balance. The high pressure male coupling, included in high pressure bottle connections, is set to met the Compressed Gas Association Standards #346 and #347.Also included in the assembly are the dual-sided pressure gauge (which reads the cylinder pressure directly from the cylinder), elastomeric bumper (a protective, rubber like stop), and hangar plate (for positive locking attachment of the assembly to the backframe).|$|R
40|$|Cell sheet-mediated tissue {{regeneration}} is {{a promising}} approach for corneal reconstruction. However, {{the fragility of}} bioengineered corneal endothelial cell (CEC) monolayers allows us {{to take advantage of}} cross-linked porous gelatin hydrogels as cell sheet carriers for intraocular delivery. The aim {{of this study was to}} further investigate the effects of biopolymer concentrations (5 - 15 wt%) on the characteristic and <b>safety</b> of hydrogel <b>discs</b> fabricated by a simple stirring process combined with freeze-drying method. Results of scanning electron microscopy, porosity measurements, and ninhydrin assays showed that, with increasing solid content, the pore size, porosity, and cross-linking index of carbodiimide treated samples significantly decreased from 508 ± 30 to 292 ± 42 µm, 59. 8 ± 1. 1 to 33. 2 ± 1. 9 %, and 56. 2 ± 1. 6 to 34. 3 ± 1. 8 %, respectively. The variation in biopolymer concentrations and degrees of cross-linking greatly affects the Young's modulus and swelling ratio of the gelatin carriers. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements and glucose permeation studies indicated that for the samples with a highest solid content, the highest pore wall thickness and the lowest fraction of mobile water may inhibit solute transport. When the biopolymer concentration is in the range of 5 - 10 wt%, the hydrogels have high freezable water content (0. 89 - 0. 93) and concentration of permeated glucose (591. 3 - 615. 5 µg/ml). These features are beneficial to the in vitro cultivation of CECs without limiting proliferation and changing expression of ion channel and pump genes such as ATP 1 A 1, VDAC 2, and AQP 1. In vivo studies by analyzing the rabbit CEC morphology and count also demonstrate that the implanted gelatin discs with the highest solid content may cause unfavorable tissue-material interactions. It is concluded that the characteristics of cross-linked porous gelatin hydrogel carriers and their triggered biological responses are in relation to biopolymer concentration effects...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of passivesafety and inherent features of subcritical nucleartransmutation systems - accelerator-driven systems. The generalobjective of this research has been to improve the safetyperformance and avoid elevated coolant temperatures inworst-case scenarios like unprotected loss-of-ow accidents,loss-of-heat-sink accidents, and a combination of both theseaccident initiators. The specific topics covered are emergencydecay heat removal by reactor vessel auxiliary cooling systems,beam shut-off by a melt-rupture <b>disc,</b> <b>safety</b> aspects fromlocating heat-exchangers in the riser of a pool-type reactorsystem, and reduction of pressure resistance in the primarycircuit by employing bypass routes. The initial part of the research was focused on reactorvessel auxiliary cooling systems. It was shown that an 80 MWthPb/Bi-cooled accelerator-driven system of 8 m height and 6 mdiameter vessel can be well cooled in the case of loss-of-owaccidents in which the accelerator proton beam is not switchedoff. After a loss-of-heat-sink accident the proton beam has tobe interrupted within 40 minutes in order to avoid fast creepof the vessel. If a melt-rupture disc is included in the wallof the beam pipe, which breaks at 150 K above the normal coreoutlet temperature, the grace period until the beam has to beshut off is increased to 6 hours. For the same vessel geometry,but an operating power of 250 MWth the structural materials canstill avoid fast creep in case the proton beam is shut offimmediately. If beam shut-off is delayed, additional coolingmethods are needed to increase the heat removal. Investigationswere made on the filling of the gap between the guard and thereactor vessel with liquid metal coolant and using water spraycooling on the guard vessel surface. The second part of the thesis presents examinationsregarding an accelerator-driven system also cooled with Pb/Bibut with heat-exchangers located in the risers of the reactorvessel. For a pool type design, this approach has advantages inthe case of heat-exchanger tube failures, particularly if wateris used as the secondary uid. This is because a leakage ofwater from the secondary circuit into the Pb/Bi-cooled primarycircuit leads to upward sweeping of steam bubbles, which wouldcollect in the gas plenum. In the case of heatexchangers in thedowncomer steam bubbles may be dragged into the ADS core andadd reactivity. Bypass routes are employed to increase the owspeed in loss-of-ow events for this design. It is shown thatthe 200 MWth accelerator-driven system with heat-exchangers inthe riser copes reasonably well with both a loss-of-ow accidentwith the beam on and an unprotected loss-of-heat-sink accident. For a total-loss-of-power (station blackout) and an immediatebeam-stop the core outlet temperature peaks at 680 K. After acombined loss-of-ow and loss-of-heat-sink accident the beamshould be shut off within 4 minutes to avoid exceeding the ASMElevel D of 977 K, and within 8 minutes to avoid fast creep. Assuming the same core inlet temperature, both the reactordesign with heat-exchanger in the risers and the downcomershave similar temperature evolutions after a total-loss-ofpoweraccident. A large accelerator-driven system of 800 MWth with a 17 mtall vessel may eventually become a standard size. For thishigher power ADS, the location of the heat-exchangers hasgreater impact on the natural convection capability. This isdue to that larger heatexchangers have more inuence on thedistance between the thermal centers during a lossof- owaccident. The design with heat-exchangers in the downcomers,the long-term vessel temperature peaks at 996 K during aloss-of-ow accident with the beam on. This does not pose athreat of creep rupture for the vessel. However, the locationof the heat-exchangers in the downcomers will probably requiresecondary coolant other than water, like for example oil (fortemperatures not higher than 673 K) or Pb/Bi coolant.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effectiveness and <b>safety</b> of total <b>disc</b> replacement surgery compared with spinal fusion in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc degeneration. Low back pain (LBP), a major health problem in Western countries, can be caused by a variety of pathologies, one of which is degenerative disc disease (DDD). When conservative treatment fails, surgery might be considered. For a long time, lumbar fusion has been the "gold standard" of surgical treatment for DDD. Total disc replacement (TDR) has increased in popularity as an alternative for lumbar fusion. A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed up to October 2008. Two reviewers independently checked all retrieved titles and abstracts, and relevant full text articles for inclusion. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted relevant data and outcomes. Three randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies were identified. In all three trials, the total disc replacement was compared with lumbar fusion techniques. The Charité trial (designed as a non-inferiority trail) was considered to have a low risk of bias for the 2 -year follow up, but a high risk of bias for the 5 -year follow up. The Charité artificial disc was non-inferior to the BAK® Interbody Fusion System on a composite outcome of "clinical success" (57. 1 vs. 46. 5 %, for the 2 -year follow up; 57. 8 vs. 51. 2 % for the 5 -year follow up). There were no statistically significant differences in mean pain and physical function scores. The Prodisc artificial disc (also designed as a non-inferiority trail) was found to be statistically significant more effective when compared with the lumbar circumferential fusion on the composite outcome of "clinical success" (53. 4 vs. 40. 8 %), but the risk of bias of this study was high. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in mean pain and physical function scores. The Flexicore trial, with a high risk of bias, found no clinical relevant differences on pain and physical function when compared with circumferential spinal fusion at 2 -year follow up. Because these are preliminary results, in addition to the high risk of bias, no conclusions can be drawn based on this study. In general, these results suggest that no clinical relevant differences between the total disc replacement and fusion techniques. The overall success rates in both treatment groups were small. Complications related to the surgical approach ranged from 2. 1 to 18. 7 %, prosthesis related complications from 2. 0 to 39. 3 %, treatment related complications from 1. 9 to 62. 0 % and general complications from 1. 0 to 14. 0 %. Reoperation at the index level was reported in 1. 0 to 28. 6 % of the patients. In the three trials published, overall complication rates ranged from 7. 3 to 29. 1 % in the TDR group and from 6. 3 to 50. 2 % in the fusion group. The overall reoperation rate at index-level ranged from 3. 7 to 11. 4 % in the TDR group and from 5. 4 to 26. 1 % in the fusion group. In conclusion, there is low quality evidence that the Charite is non-inferior to the BAK cage at the 2 -year follow up on the primary outcome measures. For the 5 -year follow up, the same conclusion is supported only by very low quality evidence. For the ProDisc, there is very low quality evidence for contradictory results on the primary outcome measures when compared with anterior lumbar circumferential fusion. High quality randomized controlled trials with relevant control group and long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TDR. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
