Two and a half years after arriving, the difference in UI receipt between EaP migrants and natives disappears and begins to reverse. In contrast, Rodríguez-Planas (2013) finds that it takes between 6 to 8  years in Spain for the difference to vanish when all immigrants (not just EaP) are compared to natives. Since EaP immigrants concentrate in the most vulnerable positions, they are the first to be hit by recession. Thus, they use unemployment benefits as a supplement of income once {{they have the right to}} do so. This is likely to be part of the explanation for the <b>sustained</b> <b>stock</b> of EaP immigrants even after the great recession.

To minimise costs we used laser ablation ICP-MS to analyse levels of a small suite of elements (Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr, Rb, Ba and Pb) at the margin (adult phase) and core (juvenile phase) of the same otoliths of adult C. rubescens, collected at ten locations in five management zones. The elemental composition of both otolith margins and cores differed significantly among management zones and in some cases among locations within zones. Similarity of the pattern of among-zone elemental composition in otolith margins and cores indicated that, when cores are laid down, individuals have already recruited to the zones they will occupy as adults and {{there is no evidence of}} discrete juvenile nurseries. Thus, movement of juvenile or adult C. rubescens is likely to occur at relatively small spatial scales.

40|$|Recently {{fisheries}} management in Australia {{has shifted to}} emphasise management of resources within the principles of ecologically sustainable development. This has resulted in management to <b>sustain</b> fish <b>stocks,</b> maximise economic efficiency when harvesting those stocks, and a trend towards granting property rights to the fishers. To achieve the goal of management to <b>sustain</b> fish <b>stocks,</b> {{a major focus of}} fisheries agencies has been to preserve the critical habitats upon which the long-term productivity of the fisheries depends. For penaeid prawns this has meant that seagrass (tiger prawns), and mangroves (banana prawns) have achieved special status to fishers, fisheries biologists, managers and legislators. Is this justified? Is this the appropriate management strategy to preserve critical fisheries habitat? We examine these questions using two case studies: cyclones, seagrasses and tiger prawns in the Gulf of Carpentaria and king prawns in the Peel-Harvey estuarine system in Western Australia. It is clear that a greater understanding of the key processes operating in the coastal zone is a critical requirement for {{fisheries management}}. It is not enough to just map, monitor and maintain subsets of these systems based on coarse distribution and abundance studies of prawn populations. With increasing pressure on the coastal zone from competing interest groups, fisheries managers need a greater understanding of the factors which determine the carrying capacity of nursery habitats for juvenile penaeid prawns, and the factors which limit the distribution of key fisheries habitats within coastal ecosystems.

40|$|Many {{fish stocks}} have been {{exhausted}} or are currently overexploited. Cooperative management of common fish pools {{may be necessary}} to <b>sustain</b> <b>stock</b> levels and future harvests. Even when countries have differing time preferences, and thus conflicting management objectives, it has been proven that cooperation can be set up such that it benefits every country involved. This, however, may require higher shares of the harvest for countries with lower discounting factors. A game theoretical approach is used to show that hiding time preferences may be a beneficial strategy for individual players. This is shown, however, to be detrimental for total welfare. The bioeconomic model proposed by Levhari & Mirman (1980), and extended by Breton & Keoula (2014), is used as a frame and optimal management strategies are determined. When cooperating, players are given a weight. These weights are then used to establish harvesting levels, by maximizing the sum of each players weighted utility. Three methods for establishing weights are proposed. This is done in order to capture real life situations. Reporting a lower discount factor is proven to be beneficial under several scenarios depending on actual time preferences, growth potential of the stock considered and how weights are set. A second-best policy is then set up so that a truthful player (the Principal) may induce the other player (the Agent) to report truthfully as well. This comes at a cost for the Principal in terms of information rent. The second-best arrangement is however often preferred over the outcomes associated with i) competition or ii) cooperation with a misreporting Agent. Finally, the case where both players are misreporting is examined. It is shown that both players may have incentives to report lower discount factors. This may potentially lead to a standard “prisoners’ dilemma” situation, where the parties involved {{would be better off if}} reporting truthfully...|$|R

In contrast, the influence of climate through its effects on plankton appears much less important at the present centre of the niche around Iceland. Recognising the potentially strong effect of climate on fish stocks, at a time of rapid global climate change, is probably an important prerequisite towards the synthesis of a cod management strategy...|$|R
40|$|Lake Roosevelt {{has been}} stocked with Lake Whatcom stock kokanee since 1989 {{with the primary}} {{objective}} of creating a self-sustaining recreational fishery. Due to low return numbers, it was hypothesized a stock of kokanee, native to the upper Columbia River, might perform better than the coastal Lake Whatcom strain. Kokanee from Meadow Creek, a tributary of Kootenay Lake, British Columbia were selected as an alternative stock. Matched pair releases of Lake Whatcom and Meadow Creek kokanee were made from Sherman Creek Hatchery in late June 2000 and repeated in 2001. Stock performance between Lake Whatcom and Meadow Creek kokanee was evaluated using three performance measures; (1) the number of returns to Sherman Creek, the primary egg collection facility, (2) the number of returns to other tributaries and (3) the number of returns to the creel. Kokanee were collected during five passes through the reservoir via electrofishing, which included 87 tributary mouths during the fall of 2000 and 2001.

Reservoir wide recoveries of age two kokanee had similar results in 2000 ({chi}{sup 2 } = 735. 3; d. f. = 1; P < 0. 01) and 2001 ({chi}{sup 2 } = 150. 1; d. f. = 1; P < 0. 01). Six Lake Whatcom and seven Meadow Creek three year olds were collected in 2001. The sample size of three year olds was too small for statistical analysis. No kokanee were collected during creel surveys in 2000, and two (age three kokanee) were collected in 2001.

Success has been limited by low recruitment to the fishery, low adult returns to hatcheries, and a skewed sex ratio. It was hypothesized that a stock native to the upper Columbia River might perform better than the coastal Lake Whatcom stock. Kokanee from Meadow Creek, a tributary of Kootenay Lake, British Columbia were selected as an alternative stock. Post smolts from each stock were released from Sherman Creek Hatchery in late June 2000 and repeated in 2001. Stock performance was evaluated using three measures; (1) number of returns to Sherman Creek, the primary egg collection facility, (2) the number of returns to 86 tributaries sampled and, (3) the number of returns to the creel. In two repeated experiments, neither Meadow Creek or Lake Whatcom kokanee appeared {{to be capable of}} providing a run of three-year old spawners to <b>sustain</b> <b>stocking</b> efforts.

Chi-square analysis indicated age two Meadow Creek kokanee returned to Sherman Creek and to other tributaries in significantly higher numbers when compared to the Lake Whatcom stock in both 2000 and 2001. However, preliminary data from the Spokane Tribe of Indians indicated {{that a large number of}} both stocks were precocial before they were stocked.

Supplemental creel data, including fishing derbies, test fisheries, and angler diaries, indicated anglers harvested two-year-old hatchery kokanee a month after release. The majority of the two-year old kokanee harvested were from a direct stock at the Fort Spokane boat launch. Only Lake Whatcom kokanee were stocked from the boat launch, therefore stock performance was not evaluated, however the high success of the stocking location will likely increase harvest of hatchery kokanee in the future.
