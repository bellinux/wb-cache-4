30|$|In {{the current}} studies, we wished to further {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} the NF-κB pathway in mediating the protective effects <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> in stretch-induced injury. Specifically, we hypothesized that (1) HCA would attenuate stretch-induced cell inflammation and injury and improve cell survival in both the bronchial and alveolar epithelium; (2) that the protective effects <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> seen in early stretch would persist in the setting of prolonged cyclic mechanical stretch; (3) that the effects <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> on stretch would be mediated via inhibition of the NF-κB pathway; and (4) the effect <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> would be mediated by a pH (i.e. acidosis) rather than a CO 2 effect per se.|$|R
30|$|IκBα is {{normally}} {{located in the}} cytoplasm, where it binds to and inactivates NF-κB. When the canonical NF-κB pathway is activated, the IKK-complex phosphorylates IκBα, which is then subsequently degraded. In these studies, HCA blocked the stretch-induced decrease of cytosolic concentrations of IκBα. In subsequent studies, the effect <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> was comparable to that seen with direct IκBα overexpression, while the combination of IκBα overexpression and HCA was also comparably effective. Overexpression of IκBα greatly reduced or entirely abrogated the effect <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> on stretch-induced inflammation, cell membrane dysfunction, or cell viability. This suggests that IκBα “occluded” the effect <b>of</b> <b>HCA,</b> suggesting that these effects <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> are mediated largely via inhibition of the canonical NF-κB pathway.|$|R

The <b>HCA</b> levels <b>of</b> some of these foods have not been previously analyzed.

Homocysteic acid (HCA), an endogenous agonist for glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, is predominantly localised in glial cells. We have previously demonstrated the release <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> from mouse astrocytes in culture following activation of beta-adrenergic receptors.

" To test this hypothesis further, we searched for specific, receptor-mediated stimuli that could induce release <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> from cultured astrocytes. For this reason we tested the effect of noradrenaline and vasoactive intestinal peptide, two transmitters known to interact with specific receptors on astrocytes, on the release <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> from these cells.

40|$|Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is {{the most}} common benign {{hepatocellular}} tumor, and its causes remain unclear. In Western countries, HCA is usually seen in the women of reproductive age who have a history of long-term use of oral contraceptives (OCs). In the latest 2010 WHO Histological Classification of Hepatobiliary Tumors, which is mainly based on the research results in European countries, it is proposed that HCA is classified into four molecular subtypes, i. e., type I: HNF 1 α-inactivated HCA; type II: β-catenin-activated HCA; type III: inflammatory HCA; type IV: unclassified HCA. The research progress in the molecular pathology <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> in foreign countries is reviewed. In addition, the main results of a recent study of 189 patients with HCA who underwent hepatectomy in our hospital are outlined. It was shown that 70 % <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> patients were middle-aged men, and 50 % were overweight or obese; even female patients seldom had a history of long-term use of OCs. The gene sequencing showed that the mutational hotspots and frequency of HNF 1 α in this group <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> patients were significantly different from those reported in European countries, and no β-catenin and gp 130 mutations were found. Therefore, based on the above results, it is considered that the population and pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> are different in China than in European countries. In light of the reports of malignant transformation <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> in literature, a feasibility study is conducted to assess the risk of malignant transformation <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> by detecting the microsatellite instability or loss of heterozygosity, which may provide a molecular pathological basis for developing individualized treatment strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) in {{pregnant}} women requires special considerations {{because of the}} risk of hormone induced growth and spontaneous rupture, which may threaten the life of both mother and child. Due to scarcity of cases there is no evidence-based algorithm for the evaluation and management <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> during pregnancy. Most experts advocate that women with HCA should not get pregnant or advise surgical resection before pregnancy. Whether it is justified to deny a young woman a pregnancy, as the biological behavior may be less threatening than presumed depends on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> growth and the subsequent clinical events during pregnancy. We aim to investigate the management and outcome <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> during pregnancy and labor based on a prospectively acquired online database in the Netherlands. Methods/design The Pregnancy And Liver adenoma Management (PALM) - study is a multicentre prospective study in three cohorts of pregnant patients. In total 50 pregnant patients, ≥ 18 [*]years of age with a radiologically and/or histologically proven diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> will be included in the study. Radiological diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> will be based on contrast enhanced MRI. Lesions at inclusion must not exceed 5 [*]cm. The study group will be compared to a healthy control group of 63 pregnant patients and a group of 63 pregnant patients with diabetes mellitus without HCA. During their pregnancy HCA patients will be closely monitored by means of repetitive ultrasound (US) at 14, 20, 26, 32 and 38 [*]weeks of gestation and 6 and 12 [*]weeks postpartum. Both control groups will undergo US of the liver at 14 [*]weeks of gestation to exclude HCA lesions in the liver. All groups will be asked to fill out quality of life related questionnaires.

40|$|The {{formation}} <b>of</b> heterocyclic amines (<b>HCAs)</b> was studied during frying of beefburgers {{with different}} fat contents (6. 7 %, 16. 1 % and 39 %). Beefburgers were fried from the frozen state for 60, 90, 120 s, {{and until the}} centre temperature had reached 72 °C (approximately 150 s) in a double-sided pan fryer. The beefburgers were analysed for HCAs with solid-phase extraction and LC/MS detection, and 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2 -amino- 3, 4, 8 -trimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (4, 8 -DiMeIQx), 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine (PhIP), 1 -methyl- 9 H-pyrido[3, 4 -b]indole (Harman) and 9 H-pyrido[3, 4 -b]indole (Norharman) were detected in all samples. The concentrations <b>of</b> <b>HCAs</b> ranged between 0 and 2. 3 ng g− 1. The HCAs concentrations were fitted to a first-order reaction model. The amounts <b>of</b> <b>HCAs</b> in beefburgers fried from the frozen state {{were in the same}} range as in beefburgers that have reached room temperature before frying. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} formation <b>of</b> <b>HCAs</b> is not only concentration-controlled but also mass transport-controlled and that kinetic models stated in earlier studies fit relatively well our analysed values on HCAs in fried beefburgers...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was the preparation of four formulations containing hydrocortisone acetate (HCA) for topical application, including two aqueous systems (hydrophilic microemulsion and aqueous gel) and two systems with dominant hydrophobicity (hydrophobic microemulsion and ointment). The formulations were tested for the release and permeation <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> across an animal membrane. The release <b>of</b> <b>HCA</b> was found comparable for the four systems. The two microemulsions promote permeation across an ex-vivo membrane, examined by means of a Franz cell. Hydrophobic microemulsion guarantees the highest solubility (2, 370 μg/ml) and flux (133 μg/cm 2. h) of the drug, since it contains almost 40 % Transcutol, a permeation enhancer. Gel and ointment provide lower solubility and flux, being the values, related to the ointment, the lowest ones (562 μg/ml and 0. 4 μg/ cm 2. h). Experimental results allow the conclusion that gel and ointment can be suitable when it is desirable to minimize absorption <b>of</b> topically applied <b>HCA</b> as to keep the drug restricted to the diseased area and prevent side effects of the systemic presence <b>of</b> <b>HCA.</b> KEY WORDS: gel and ointment; hydrocortisone acetate; microemulsions; transdermal permeability...|$|R
