5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E

Crabb said local authority employees, nurses and teachers <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pay rise.|$|E
25|$|From {{that time}} he dropped his first name and was always known as Stacy Waddy. After acting {{for a short period}} as curate to Bishop Stretch at Newcastle, New South Wales, he was given the {{difficult}} parish of Stockton, New South Wales {{on the other side of}} the harbour, then much overloaded with debt. Waddy tackled his task with enthusiasm, wrote his first book, a short one on confirmation, Come for Strength, published in London in 1904, and by the middle of the same year had succeeded in paying off the parish debts. His energy was boundless, as in this year he wrote various tracts, gave over 40 lantern lecture averaged over six services a Sunday in his own parish, travelling about 30 miles on his bicycle, became bishop's chaplain and secretary of the clerical society, and also managed to fit in some very successful cricket. In December 1903 at West Maitland against Plum Warner's English eleven which included such well-known bowlers as Hurst, Len Braund, Ted Arnold, Bernard Bosanquet and Fielder, he made 93 and 102. Had he accepted the suggestion that he <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> position in Sydney and play cricket, it is likely that he would have gained a place in the New South Wales eleven.|$|E

25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new fitting.|$|E
500|$|Album opener [...] "Bullshittin'" [...] was {{produced}} by Three 6 Mafia's Juicy J, and features a murky bassline with a calming vibe. The track is inspired {{by the sound of}} southern hip hop. [...] "Cookie Coma" [...] {{was produced}} by The Alchemist, and contains a jazzy beat, with lush horns and upright bass. The style of production is inspired by boom bap production, with prominent sounding drums. Hodgy ponders his own morality on the track, with self-reflective lines such as [...] "I’m too legit for life, I <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> grip and die, Fuckin’ take a trip and fly, and never come down".|$|E

[...] According to blogger Muhammad Saleem, Apple's aim to have 10 million iPhone users {{by the end}} of 2008 would require the logging of about 74,535 trees annually, assuming an average 100-page monthly bill.

He was also involved in a disagreement with Mayor Koch about whether the tower <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> tax exemption. In 1985, Trump {{was one of the}} plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the state in the New York State Court of Appeals concerning the payment of a 10% state tax in the event that a real estate property is transacted for $1 million or more. The exemption was worth between $15 million and $20 million. The tax on Trump Tower was upheld in a 4 to 1 decision.|$|E
500|$|Falk's {{enduring}} legacy {{can best}} be described as the NBA's new star-centered focus. [...] Falk's idea was that since most people bought Chicago Bulls tickets to see Michael Jordan, Jordan himself <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> large proportion of the benefit."Basketball is a hybrid between an individual and team sport", Falk is saying. [...] "Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves. In that environment, a Michael Jordan, Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans. Fans come to watch them play primarily. They create marketing opportunities, new stadiums, luxury boxes, and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money. The salary structure should be close to what it is in Hollywood, where Jim Carrey makes $16 million a film and the second star makes $2 million. That's what I believe as an economics major and as a neo-capitalist." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Lusitania in 1915 created a wave of anti-German sentiment, and Gruban worried that he would find it {{difficult}} to find government work because of his nationality and thick German accent. He again contacted Booth, who again claimed to be friends with David Lloyd George and his secretary, Christopher Addison, and said that if Gruban put Booth on the Board of Directors he could [...] "do with the Ministry of Munitions what I like". Gruban immediately made Booth the chairman of his company, and over 3 months took £400 on expenses. He then claimed that this was not enough money for the work he did, and he <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> secret payment of 10% of the value of a contract known as the [...] "Birmingham Contract". The contract was worth £6,000, and Booth wrote a memo saying that he should have £580 or £600. Gruban refused, and Booth threw the note in the wastepaper basket. From that point onwards Booth worked {{as hard as he could}} to undermine Gruban's position, while outwardly appearing to be his friend.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Sober" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with several declaring it an album highlight. Comparing its production to {{the works of}} Australian recording artist Sia, George Griffiths of Redbrick deemed it the best song of Gomez's career; praising its placement as the album's musical centerpiece. He elaborated that the themes of empowerment and vulnerability present throughout Revival coalesced into [...] "Sober" [...] "more clearly and coherently than you could ever have imagined". In her review, Concrete writer Melissa Haggar called [...] "Sober" [...] a key example of the personal and meaningful lyrics behind Revival, calling the track [...] "somber and satisfying". Haggar {{went on to say}} that the singer: [...] "reflects similar melancholy emotions in bonus tracks like the bittersweet ballad 'Nobody' and the sweeping 'Cologne', which display her more vulnerable side." [...] Idolator writer Mike Wass felt that the track was among the album's best tracks, and compared it to Alessia Cara's single [...] "Here" [...] from her debut album Know-It-All (2015) and Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine (2013), saying [...] "With the rise of relatable-pop, this bittersweet pop anthem <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> warm reception at radio.

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the third}} season of Ellen, {{producers}} were becoming frustrated by the series' lack of focus and the lack of interest that the character Ellen Morgan displayed toward the standard sitcom tropes of dating and relationships. Disney boss Michael Eisner suggested that since the character showed no inclination toward dating, she <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> puppy. [...] "It was an indication of just how lost the show was that network executives would be excited by Ellen buying a puppy", said executive producer Mark Driscoll. It was this suggestion that gave writer Jonathan Stark the idea to give that working title to the episode, and it stuck. In the summer of 1996 DeGeneres and the show's other writers opened negotiations with ABC and its parent company, Disney, to have Ellen Morgan come out during season four. Word of the secret negotiations leaked in September of that year, sparking a storm of speculation as to whether the character, the actress, or both would come out. The LGBT media watchdog group Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) launched a [...] "Let Ellen Out!" [...] campaign, including an [...] "Ellen Watch" [...] website. Disney rejected the first draft of the script, with Disney executive Dean Valentine stating that it did not go far enough. Director Junger reported that Valentine said [...] "'If we're going to do it, let's do it.' Once he said to go as far as we could, it became great fun to write." [...] Once final approval from Disney was secured, ABC announced on March 3, 1997, that Ellen Morgan would be coming out. [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] went into production on March 7. Guest stars sought to be a part of the project. According to writer/producer Driscoll, [...] "Suddenly all these talented actors were lining up to be in the episode. It had a buzz around it that it would be an historic episode. When Oprah came on—and she was so wonderful and open and giving—it suddenly had this great weight to it." ...|$|E

Ezekiel said that McCaughey's euthanasia claims were a [...] "willful distortion of my record". Jim Rutennberg said that Emanuel's critics oversimplified complex issues, such as who <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> kidney. Such rationing {{was said to be}} unavoidable because of scarcity, and because a scarce resource such as a liver is [...] "indivisible". Emanuel said that McCaughey took words out of context, omitting qualifiers such as [...] "Without overstating it (and without fully defending it) ... Clearly, {{more needs to be done}} ..." [...] Emanuel once compared the word [...] "rationing" [...] to George Carlin’s seven words you can't say on television.

His mother hoped her son would become a physician, but Jelinek dreamed of being a lawyer. He studied engineering in evening classes at the City College of New York and received stipends from the National Committee for a Free Europe that allowed him to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. About his choice of specialty, he said: [...] "Fortunately, to electrical engineering there belonged a discipline whose aim was not the construction of physical systems: the theory of information". He obtained his Ph.D. in 1962, with Robert Fano as his adviser.|$|E
2500|$|Employees have a {{right to}} {{reasonable}} notice before having their contracts terminated under s.86.

After 2 years, the minimum is 2 weeks' notice. [...] After 3 years, 3 weeks' notice, and so on, up to a maximum of twelve weeks' notice. Many employees will have higher notice periods in their contracts, or under the protection of collective agreements established by the workplace union. It {{is important to note that}} these minimum periods are reciprocal - there is a [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] - and so employees are also required to give such reasonable notice. However nothing prevents employers giving pay in lieu of notice if it is expressly provided for in the employee's contract of employment, staff handbook, or other relevant documents.
