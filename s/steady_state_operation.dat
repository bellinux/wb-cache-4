40|$|The novel {{concept of}} reverse flow {{operation}} with reactor side feeding is studied for selective oxidation of NH 3 to produce either N 2, N 2 O, or NO. During normal reverse flow operation, where the feeds are alternately introduced from {{either end of}} the reactor, the conversion is always lower when compared to <b>steady</b> <b>state,</b> once-through <b>operation</b> at the same residence time. The novel concept of reverse flow operation with reactor side feeding is therefore proposed to avoid the decrease of conversion. The production rate of the desired product can be kept at a high level, which may even exceed the production of normal reverse flow <b>operation</b> and <b>steady</b> <b>state,</b> once-through <b>operation.</b> The reactor behavior was simulated for three regimes (quasi <b>steady</b> <b>state,</b> dynamic, and relaxed <b>steady</b> <b>state)</b> with varying feed positions. The development of spatiotemporal patterns inside the reactor with side feeding shows completely different behavior compared to normal reverse flow <b>operation</b> and <b>steady</b> <b>state,</b> once-through <b>operation,</b> leading to the possibility of conversion and selectivity manipulations. In addition, the proposed concept also indicates better conversion for the dynamic and relaxed steady-state regimes. The influence of shifting the feed positions to the reactor center is most pronounced if the switching time is shorter. This concept also provides an opportunity to prevent the dead gas volume {{in the center of the}} reactor if suitable feed positions can be applied. The catalyst effectiveness in this novel concept is therefore much better than during normal reverse flow <b>operation</b> and <b>steady</b> <b>state,</b> once-through <b>operation,</b> particularly in the relaxed steady-state regime...|$|R

5000|$|In <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operation,</b> nuclear {{reactors}} operate at exact criticality. When {{at least one}} dollar of reactivity is added above the exact critical point (where the neutron production rate balances the rate of neutron losses, from both absorption and leakage) then the chain reaction does not rely on delayed neutrons. In such cases, the neutron population can rapidly increase exponentially, with a very small time constant, known as the prompt neutron lifetime. Thus {{there is a very}} large increase in neutron population over a very short time frame.

50|$|Xenon-135 in {{particular}} tremendously affects {{the operation of}} a nuclear reactor because it's the most powerful known neutron poison. The inability of a reactor to be restarted due to the buildup of xenon-135 (reaches a maximum after about 10 hours) is {{sometimes referred to as}} xenon precluded start-up. The period of time in which the reactor is unable to override the effects of xenon-135 is called the xenon dead time or poison outage. During periods of <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operation,</b> at a constant neutron flux level, the xenon-135 concentration builds up to its equilibrium value for that reactor power in about 40 to 50 hours. When the reactor power is increased, xenon-135 concentration initially decreases because the burn up is increased at the new, higher power level. Thus, the dynamics of xenon poisoning are important for the stability of the flux pattern and geometrical power distribution, especially in physically large reactors.|$|E
50|$|During {{periods of}} <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operation</b> at a {{constant}} neutron flux level, the 135Xe concentration builds up to its equilibrium value for that reactor power in about 40 to 50 hours. When the reactor power is increased, 135Xe concentration initially decreases because the burn up is increased at the new higher power level. Because 95% of the 135Xe production is from decay of iodine-135, which has a 6.57 hour half-life, the production of 135Xe remains constant; at this point, the 135Xe concentration reaches a minimum. The concentration then increases to the new equilibrium level for the new power level in roughly 40 to 50 hours. During the initial 4 to 6 hours following the power change, the magnitude {{and the rate of}} change of concentration is dependent upon the initial power level and on the amount of change in power level; the 135Xe concentration change is greater for a larger change in power level. When reactor power is decreased, the process is reversed.|$|E
50|$|If an {{ordinary}} switch {{is used to}} control the winding current, this can cause sparks at the terminals of the switch. This doesn't occur when the magnet is switched on, because the voltage {{is limited to the}} power supply voltage, but when it is switched off, the energy in the magnetic field is suddenly returned to the circuit, causing a large voltage spike and an arc across the switch contacts, which can damage them. With small electromagnets a capacitor is often used across the contacts, which reduces arcing by temporarily storing the current. More often a diode is used to prevent voltage spikes by providing a path for the current to recirculate through the winding until the energy is dissipated as heat. The diode is connected across the winding, oriented so it is reverse-biased during <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operation</b> and doesn't conduct. When the supply voltage is removed, the voltage spike forward-biases the diode and the reactive current continues to flow through the winding, through the diode and back into the winding. A diode used in this way is called a flyback diode.|$|E
