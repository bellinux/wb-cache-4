40|$|This FORTRAN IV program executes an {{essential}} editing procedure which determines whether a datafile contains {{an equal number}} of records (cards) per case which are also in the intended se-quential order. The program which requires very little background in computer programming is designed primarily for the user of packaged statistical procedures. EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 1975, 35, 729 - 731. IN the preparation of datafiles for analysis, various types of errors arise which violate the requirement of a <b>sequentially</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>file</b> with {{an equal number of}} records (cards) per case. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe a program that is designed to identify two common diffi-culties: (a) the existence of too few or too many records for a case and (b) the improper sequencing of cards. This program is especially useful for researchers who have relatively little background in computer languages and who rely primarily upon packaged statistical program...|$|E

40|$|Goal-level Independent {{and-parallelism}} (IAP) is {{exploited by}} scheduling for simultaneous execution {{two or more}} goals which will not interfere with each other at run time. This can be done safely even if such goals can produce múltiple answers. The most successful IAP implementations to date have used recomputation of answers and <b>sequentially</b> <b>ordered</b> backtracking. While in principie simplifying the implementation, recomputation can be very inefficient if the granularity of the parallel goals is large enough and they produce several answers, while <b>sequentially</b> <b>ordered</b> backtracking limits parallelism. And, despite the expected simplification, {{the implementation of the}} classic schemes has proved to involve complex engineering, with the consequent difficulty for system maintenance and extensión, while still frequently running into the well-known trapped goal and garbage slot problems. This work presents an alternative parallel backtracking model for IAP and its implementation. The model features parallel out-of-order (i. e., non-chronological) backtracking and relies on answer memoization to reuse and combine answers. We show that this approach can bring significant performance advantages. Also, it can bring some simplification to the important engineering task involved in implementing the backtracking mechanism of previous approaches...|$|R

This note gives a formal proof that this equivalence holds in Bayesian terms, as both formulations generate equivalent posterior distributions, but does not hold in Frequentist terms, as both formulations generate incompatible likelihood functions. Perhaps surprisingly, this shows that Bayesian re-parametrisation and Frequentist re-parametrisation are not identical concepts...|$|R

We then examine ordered queries in lists, a topic related to <b>ordered</b> <b>file</b> maintenance. Finally, we learn how to implement cache-oblivious priority queues. 2 <b>Ordered</b> <b>File</b> Maintenance The problem is posed as follows: maintain N elements in an array of size O(N) in a specified order, with at most O(1) gaps between two consecutive elements, subject to inserting and deleting in a specified place in the order. We show how to implement updates by moving a portion of the array of size O(lg 2 N), amortized. Since gaps are bounded, scanning k consecutive elements takes O(1 + k B) memory transfers, even cache-obliviously; inserting and deleting take O (lg 2 N B). Th...|$|R
