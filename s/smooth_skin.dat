The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp <b>smooth</b> <b>skin,</b> and usually moves by leaping.|$|E
5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936. After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests. Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified {{a problem with the}} aerodynamics of the radiators and nacelles. To solve this problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles and the rudder was enlarged and redesigned with a <b>smooth</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls. A block of sandstone, {{described}} in 2007 from the Early Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania, included impressions of the bodies of three temnospondyls.

Trackways referable to small temnospondyls have also been found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks. The trackways, called batrachichni, are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments, suggesting the animals had some ties to the water.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom <b>smooth</b> <b>skin</b> would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Judy Massare {{concluded}} that ichthyosaurs {{had been the}} fastest marine reptiles. Their length/depth ratio was between three and five, the optimal number to minimise water resistance or drag. Their <b>smooth</b> <b>skin</b> and streamlined bodies prevented excessive turbulence. Their hydrodynamic efficiency, {{the degree to which}} energy is converted into a forward movement, would approach that of dolphins and measure about 0.8. Ichthyosaurs would be a fifth faster than plesiosaurs, though half of the difference was explained by assuming a 30% higher metabolism for ichthyosaurs. Together, within Massare's model these effects resulted in a cruising speed of slightly less than five kilometres per hour. However, in 2002, Motani corrected certain mistakes in Massare's formulae and revised the estimated cruising speed to less than two kilometres per hour, somewhat below that of modern Cetacea. However, as the speeds estimated for plesiosaurs and mosasaurids were also revised downwards, ichthyosaurs maintained their relative position.|$|E
25|$|Like other archosaurs, {{crocodilians}} are diapsid, {{although their}} post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The {{walls of the}} braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues are not free, but {{held in place by}} a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues. Crocodiles have <b>smooth</b> <b>skin</b> on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.|$|E
25|$|The tail is whip-like and {{measures}} 11.5 {{times as long}} as the disc is wide. A long, serrated spine originates in the first third of the tail, and is followed by a low dorsal keel and a ventral fin fold. Young rays have <b>smooth</b> <b>skin,</b> while adults have a patch of small dermal denticles between and behind the eyes, and a row of thorns along the midline of the back. There are 16 tubercles in front of the tail spine, and numerous small denticles behind. This species is plain brown above, often with yellow or orange coloring before the eyes, behind the spiracles, around the disc margin, and laterally on the tail in front of the spine. The tail darkens to nearly black towards the tip and on the ventral fin fold. The underside is white with bright orange-red patches. The Mekong freshwater stingray (D. laosensis) is also characterized by orange ventral coloration and has some similar meristic counts to this species, but differs in disc shape, denticle coverage, and dorsal coloration.|$|E

25|$|The {{animal is}} said to be of a brownish-gray color with a <b>smooth</b> <b>skin,</b> its size is {{approximately}} that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It {{is said to}} have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; some say it is a horn. A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at sharp bends. It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet {{is said to be}} entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth.

At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path was fresh and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.|$|E

500|$|The whip-like tail {{generally}} measures {{up to one}} {{and half}} times {{the length of the}} disc, and bears one (more if replacements have grown in) long, slender, serrated spine on the upper surface, closer to the base than the tip.

The presence of the upper fin fold separates this species from the similar longtail stingray (D.longa), which shares most of its range. However, the tail is often damaged, in which case differentiating the two species in the field becomes all but impossible. Young rays have completely <b>smooth</b> <b>skin,</b> while adults develop a row of low tubercles along the midline of the back, flanked by two shorter rows on the [...] "shoulders".

500|$|The creature's corpse was {{recovered}} {{four days after}} the encounter, and a biopsy was performed by the National Environmental Authority of Panama (ANAM). The biopsy concluded that the corpse was in fact a male brown-throated sloth, a species common in the area. André Sena Maia, a veterinarian who works at Niterói Zoo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, explained that [...] "most people know how a dead animal looks like in a dry environment", and claimed that [...] "the body must have got stuck under the water, and the movement of the currents gave the false impression that it was alive." [...] A necropsy revealed that severe trauma had been inflicted on the body of the sloth, and Melquiades Ramos, a specialist from the ANAM Department of Protected Areas, estimated that the body had been in the water for [...] "about two days" [...] prior to discovery. The hairlessness was probably caused by the fact it was submerged in water, which can lead to acceleration of fur loss, resulting in <b>smooth</b> <b>skin.</b> A post-mortem bloating further contributed to the unusual appearance of the corpse. After the sloth was identified, its body was buried by ANAM staff.|$|E
