40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the leading}} cause of acute {{respiratory}} infections in children, yet no vaccine is available. The <b>sole</b> <b>licensed</b> preventive treatment against RSV is composed of a monoclonal neutralizing antibody (palivizumab), which targets a conformational epitope located on the fusion protein (F). Palivizumab reduces the burden of bronchiolitis but does not prevent infection. Thus, the development of RSV vaccines remains a priority. We previously evaluated nanorings formed by RSV nucleoprotein (N) as an RSV vaccine, as well as an immunostimulatory carrier for heterologous antigens. Here we linked the palivizumab-targeted epitope (called FsII) to N, to generate N-FsII-nanorings. Intranasal N-FsII immunization elicited anti-F antibodies in mice that were non-neutralizing in vitro. Nevertheless, RSV-challenged animals were better protected against virus replication than mice immunized with N-nanorings, especially in the upper airways. In conclusion, an N-FsII-focused vaccine is an attractive candidate combining N-specific cellular immunity and F-specific antibodies for protectio...|$|R

40|$|Corruption {{and poverty}} are {{pervasive}} in Afghanistan and opium production is rampant, {{especially in the}} country’s most insecure southern regions. Afghanistan’s opium production now accounts for {{the overwhelming majority of}} the world’s heroin supply. The International Council on Security and Development, a European think tank formerly known as the Senlis Council, is advocating a policy response that it refers to as “Poppy for Medicine. ” Under the Council’s proposal, poppy farmers in Afghanistan would gain access to the world’s legal pharmaceutical market through a two-tiered licensing program. This proposal may be attractive at first glance; however, a careful examination of India’s experience as the world’s <b>sole</b> <b>licensed</b> exporter of raw opium and of the world market for legal opiates casts serious doubt on a pharmaceutically-oriented solution. Medicinal production is an improbable solution for at least five reasons: first, illegal production will continue; second, diversion from the legal market to the illegal market is inevitable; third, diversion will involve further corruption; fourth, there may not be a market; fifth, Afghanistan lacks the institutional capacity to support a legal pharmaceutical industry. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Change {{management}} {{is now considered}} a core managerial competency. Under the fiscal and regulatory environment that currently applies, healthcare managers and professionals must be competent in initiating, guiding and managing change to drive efficient and effective delivery of care. This dissertation describes a successful journey through a planned change effort. An evidence-based approach to monitoring adverse effects of clozapine was implemented in a Community (Adult) Mental health Team. Clozapine has the <b>sole</b> <b>license</b> for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but {{has been associated with}} several potentially life-threatening adverse effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that not enough attention is paid to recognising and addressing these adverse effects, a finding replicated in an internal audit of practice within this service. Additional external regulatory imperatives provided further impetus for change. The change was implemented using the HSE change model as a guiding tool. A range of qualitative and quantitative tools that were used to evaluate the change revealed successful attainment of set objectives, and also identified early signs for long term sustenance and continuous quality improvements. On reflection, the challenges encountered during this project have had considerable formative impact on the learning and practice of the author. It is hoped that future service evaluations will confirm attainment of its intended long term impact, while also providing objective bases for further continuous quality improvement initiatives...|$|E
