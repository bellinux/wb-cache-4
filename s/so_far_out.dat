5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>out</b> to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E

500|$|Docter made Venezuela the film's setting after Ralph Eggleston {{gave him}} a video of the tepui {{mountains}} of Canaima National Park; and tepuis were already featured in a previous Disney film, Dinosaur. In 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane, jeep, and helicopter. They spent three nights there painting and sketching, and encountering ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes. They also flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls. Docter felt [...] "we couldn't use [...] Reality is <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>out,</b> if we {{put it in the}} movie you wouldn't believe it." [...] The film's creatures were also challenging to design because they had to fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis, but also be realistic because those mountains exist in real life. The filmmakers visited Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan monal for Kevin's animation. The animators designed Russell as an Asian-American, and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn, a Pixar storyboarder who voiced Emile in Ratatouille and directed the short Partly Cloudy, because of his energetic nature.|$|E

500|$|Cancellara was not {{considered}} to be a favorite for the Amstel Gold Race, though {{he was part of the}} strong squad that the Leopard Trek team brought to the race. Sporting director Kim Andersen stated the race was more of a goal for one of the Schleck brothers. Cancellara commented that he felt [...] "free as a bird" [...] in the Amstel, riding it for the first time since 2004, and that he was not under pressure to get a result. He identified Philippe Gilbert as the main favorite for the race, and promised not to ride against him as he felt his rivals had done to him in the cobbled classics. The race took place two days after Fränk Schleck's 30th birthday, further intensifying it as a goal for him. Cancellara and both Schleck brothers effectively stayed at the front of the race most of the day, but Cancellara and Fränk Schleck lost contact after crashing on the Gulperberg [...] from the finish. This left Andy Schleck alone to fend for victory, and his tactic was a solo attack launched from [...] out, on the Keutenberg. The tactic was nearly successful, as the younger Schleck brother occupied first position on the road with only [...] left to race, but a chase pack led by Gilbert overhauled him at that point. Visibly spent from his solo effort, Schleck had nothing left for the finale and finished 11th, 28 seconds down on race winner Gilbert. He stated after the race that he was satisfied with his effort, feeling that going for the win from <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>out</b> was his only play for victory without any teammates in the front group. He may have finished a few positions higher if he had stayed with the Gilbert group, but he almost certainly would have had no chance for victory against the fast finisher Gilbert; thus, the solo attack was the correct move in his eyes, since his only ambition was victory. Danish rider Jakob Fuglsang, however, managed to snatch a result for the team, as he finished in 4th place, 5 seconds down on Gilbert.|$|E
