40|$|Abstract—An {{electrical}} power system consists of three principle components that are generation station transmission line and distribution systems. A distribution system connects all the individual loads in a given to the transmission lines. All inductive loads require two kinds of power to operate with active power(kW) and reactive power (kVAR) in design and operation of alternating current electric power systems. A significant factor reactive power has been recognized. There is important interrelation between active and reactive power transmission. There are not purely sinusoidal wave forms, especially when it is compensated reactive power. The state controlled reactive power sources almost always produce harmonics. In a design of static compensators, harmonics should be considered individually. For a given distribution of power, the losses in the system can be reduced by minimizing the total flow of reactive power stability and voltage control in reactive control need about the use fixed shunt reactors, shunt capacitors, series capacitors, <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenses</b> and modern static compensator needed for reactive power control. Reactive power compensating mainly transmission system installed at substation is considered.

50|$|A <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> {{provides}} step-less automatic {{power factor}} correction {{with the ability to}} produce up to 150% additional vars. The system produces no switching transients and is not affected by system electrical harmonics (some harmonics can even be absorbed by synchronous condensers). They will not produce excessive voltage levels and are not susceptible to electrical resonances. Because of the rotating inertia of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser,</b> it can provide limited voltage support during very short power drops.|$|E
50|$|Unlike a {{capacitor}} bank, {{the amount of}} reactive power from a <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> can be continuously adjusted. Reactive power from {{a capacitor}} bank decreases when grid voltage decreases, while a <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> can increase reactive current as voltage decreases. However, synchronous machines have higher energy losses than static capacitor banks. Most synchronous condensers connected to electrical grids are rated between 20 MVAr (megavars) and 200 MVAr and many are hydrogen cooled. There is no explosion hazard {{as long as the}} hydrogen concentration is maintained above 70%, typically above 91%.|$|E

5000|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> (sometimes {{called a}} synchronous capacitor or synchronous compensator) is aDC-excited synchronous motor, whose shaft is {{not connected to}} anything but spins freely. [...] Its purpose is not to convert electric power to mechanical power or vice versa, but to adjust conditions on the electric power transmission grid. Its field is controlled by a voltage regulator to either generate or absorb reactive power as needed to adjust the grid's voltage, or to improve power factor. The condenser’s installation and operation are identical to large electric motors and generators.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{rotating}} synchronous condensers {{was common}} through the 1950s. They remain an alternative (or a supplement) to capacitors for {{power factor correction}} because of problems that have been experienced with harmonics causing capacitor overheating and catastrophic failures. Synchronous condensers are also useful for supporting voltage levels. The reactive power produced by a capacitor bank is {{in direct proportion to}} the square of its terminal voltage, and if the system voltage decreases, the capacitors produce less reactive power, when it is most needed, while if the system voltage increases the capacitors produce more reactive power, which exacerbates the problem. In contrast, with a constant field, a <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> naturally supplies more reactive power to a low voltage and absorbs more reactive power from a high voltage, plus the field can be controlled. This reactive power improves voltage regulation in situations such as when starting large motors, or where power must travel long distances from where it is generated to where it is used, {{as is the case with}} power wheeling, the transmission of electric power from one geographic region to another within a set of interconnected electric power systems.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Connecting Railroad was {{electrified}} around 1927 as {{an extension}} of the New Haven's system. The NYCR system encompassed 20 route miles (32 km) of track, and was electrified, like the New Haven, using overhead catenary at 11 kV, 25 Hz. The system received power from the New Haven Cos Cob Power Station and Consolidated Edison 201st generating station via the West Farms substation. Additional power was supplied from a 5 MW, 7 kVA, 11 kV, three-phase to single-phase converter installed at East New York. This unit was also operated in <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> mode for reactive power support. (See Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system.)Like the New Haven, the NYCR traction power was distributed using the 2 x 11 kV autotransformer topology. Two wires, the feeder and the catenary (often called the trolley wire), carried voltage of 11 kV to ground, but of opposite phase such that the feeder and catenary were 22 kV phase-to-phase. Six autotransformer stations, spaced an average of 3.8 miles apart along the line, converted power. Each station contained oil circuit breakers for both feeder and trolley buses, bus sectioning switches, and one [...] 3 MVA outdoor autotransformer.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} plant comprised three 750 rpm 25 Hz turbo-alternators from Willans & Robinson of Rugby and Dick, Kerr of Preston, England with {{a continuous}} rating of 8.7 MW and a two-hour rating of 10.5 MW. The first unit was tested in 1913, before the buildings that housed it were completed. The second set {{was installed in}} 1917. Delivery of the third Dick, Kerr unit was delayed, and it was initially installed at Ultimo Power Station upon arrival from England in 1914. Owing to the delay of the third Dick, Kerr unit, a single Curtis 7.5 MW turbo-alternator from General Electric of Schenectady, New York, USA was brought into temporary use in 1917 in the unit number four position. The third Dick, Kerr unit was transferred from Ultimo to White Bay as unit no. 3 in 1918, giving the station an initial capacity of 28.5 MW. Steam was supplied by 8 Babcock & Wilcox,WIF long drum, chain grate, boilers. They each produced 30,000 lb/hour at a pressure of 205 psi and a temperature of 588 °F. Unit no. 1 was decommissioned in 1944, but its alternator was reconfigured {{for use as a}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser,</b> for correction of power factor in the 25 cycle per second grid.

30|$|The <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> {{has been}} used as a {{conventional}} solution for reactive power regulation but they have been losing value due to growth in power electronics based reactive power compensation scheme. However, during the global trend towards renewable energies, <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> has been experiencing a renaissance since last 5 years as frequency regulation solution. High inertia synchronous condensers are estimated to cost in the order of $ 50 million for the addition of 1000  MWs of inertia [19]. Non-profitable or disengaged power plant conversion to synchronous condensers is presently perceived as the utmost cost-effective route. Synchronous condensers are synchronous machines integrated to the electricity network. The condenser when synchronized with the electricity network, will act as a motor, turned by the energy taken from the grid. Because of the nature of the synchronous machine, reactive power can be consumed and generated by controlling the excitation of the rotor. Generator of <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> with its rotating mass also always acts against a variation of network frequency, thereby acting as support for stable system frequency. According to KEMA report, only 1 %- 4 % of the nominal power rating is consumed during inertia provision of approximately 1 s. Synchronous condensers can respond immediately if on otherwise take less 15 min start up [20]. Francis turbines based hydro plant when operated in tail water depression mode can easily be operated as synchronous condensers. For Francis turbines, this is achieved by ‘dewatering’ using high pressure air to force the water level below the turbine so that it can spin freely and with minimal hydraulic resistance [12]. Operating Pelton turbines in <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> operation is generally easier, as the turbine is not submerged during normal operation. A <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> has the benefit of providing a synchronous inertia response to support ROCOF management capabilities and providing fault level and voltage support services beneficial to the power system.|$|E

It has a small footprint, is readily transportable, and is a viable economic option. This system is also inherently stable to close-in faults and can provide up to twice the nominal rating for about one minute (peak rating) during depressed voltage events. The machine also uses {{less than half of}} the energy of a conventional <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> because the HTS field winding has minimal losses. With its HTS field coils operating at a constant cryogenic temperature, this machine is highly reliable. In October 2004, the first HTS <b>synchronous</b> <b>condenser</b> prototype (8 MVAR, 13. 8 kV) was installed on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid serving an arc furnace, where it is being exposed to a large number of transients that provide an excellent accelerated age test of the device.
