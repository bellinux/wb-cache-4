In the trial, Antonio Meucci was accused of having produced records after Bell's invention and back-dated them. As proof, the prosecutor brought forward the fact that the Rider company was founded only in 1863. At trial, Meucci <b>said</b> <b>William</b> E. Rider himself, one of the owners, had given him a copy of the memorandum book in 1862; however, Meucci was not believed.|$|E

According to Rogan's longtime catcher Frank Duncan, [...] "If you {{had to choose between}} Rogan and Paige, you'd pick Rogan, because he could hit. The pitching, you'd as soon have Satchel as Rogan, understand? But Rogan's hitting was so terrific. Get my point?"

500|$|On 8 March 1758, {{the group}} {{executing}} Charles Viner's will reported to Convocation that Viner recommended creating a Chair of English Law, with a £200 salary. After much debate, this position was created, and on 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed {{as the first}} Vinerian Professor of English Law. On 24 October he gave his first lecture, to [...] "a crowded audience"; the text was soon printed and published as A Discourse on the Study of the Law. The lecture was tremendously popular, being described as a [...] "sensible, spirited and manly exhortation {{to the study of}} the law"; the initial print run sold out, necessitating the publication of another 1,000 copies, and it was used to preface later versions of the Analysis and the first volume of the Commentaries. Within the university, however, Blackstone was not as popular. As soon as the lecture series opened, an anonymously written open letter was published charging that Blackstone had [...] "violated the Statutes of the University, by arbitrarily changing the Day appointed for reading his solemn Lectures". Blackstone suffered a nervous breakdown soon after the first lecture, and on 24 November he launched a suit in the Chancellor's Court against [...] "William Jackson of the City of Oxford Printer" [...] for £500 damages, justified by Jackson [...] "printing and publishing a scandalous Libell notoriously reflecting on the Character of him the <b>said</b> <b>William</b> Blackstone". Jackson had refused to reveal who ordered the anonymous pamphlet, leading to the suit, but it evidently did not proceed further.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of the decision, states and municipalities are blocked from using a method of public financing that is simultaneously likely to attract candidates fearful they will be vastly outspent and sensitive to avoiding needless government expense. [...] "The government can still use taxpayer funds to subsidize political campaigns, but it can only do that in a manner that provides an alternative to private financing" [...] <b>said</b> <b>William</b> R. Maurer, a lawyer with Institute for Justice, which represented several challengers of the law. [...] "It cannot create disincentives." [...] The ruling meant the end of similar matching-fund programs in Connecticut, Maine and a few other places according to David Primo, {{a political science professor at}} University of Rochester who was an expert witness for the law's challengers.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from {{documents}} {{related to}} her marriage {{and the birth of}} her children, the only recorded reference to Hathaway in her lifetime is a curious bequest in the will of her father's shepherd, Thomas Whittington, who died in 1601. Whittington left 40 shillings to [...] "the poor of Stratford", adding that the money was [...] "in the hand of Anne Shakespeare wife unto Master William Shakespeare, and is due debt unto me, being paid to mine executor by the <b>said</b> <b>William</b> Shakespeare or his assigns according to the true meaning of this my will." [...] This passage has been interpreted in several different ways. One view is that Whittington may have lent Anne the money, presumably because she was short of cash while her husband was away. More likely, however, it may have been [...] "uncollected wages, or savings held in safekeeping", since the will also lists debts owed to him from her brothers in the same amount.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Nimoy took {{miscellaneous}} jobs {{to supplement}} his family's income, including selling newspapers and greeting cards, shining shoes, or setting up chairs in theaters, {{and when he}} got older, selling vacuum cleaners. He also began acting at the age of eight in a children's and neighborhood theater. His parents wanted him to attend college and pursue a stable career, or even learn to play the accordion, so he could always make a living, but his grandfather encouraged him to do what he then wanted to do most, to become an actor. Nimoy also realized he had an aptitude for singing, which he developed while a member of his synagogue's choir. His singing during his bar mitzvah at age 13 was so good that he was asked to repeat his performance the following week at another synagogue. [...] "He is still the only man I know whose voice was two bar mitzvahs good!," [...] <b>said</b> <b>William</b> Shatner.|$|E

2500|$|Richard I {{had merely}} crossed the English Channel to claim back his territories that John Lackland betrayed Philip II by murdering the {{garrison}} of Évreux and handing the town down to Richard I. [...] "He had first betrayed his father, then {{his brother and}} now our King" [...] <b>said</b> <b>William</b> the Breton. Sancho the Strong, the future King of Navarre, joined the conflict and attacked Aquitaine, capturing Angoulème and Tours. Richard himself {{was known to be}} a great military commander. The first part of this war was difficult for Richard who suffered several setbacks, as Philip II was, as described by John Gillingham, [...] "a shrewd politician and a competent soldier." [...] But by October the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VI, left the Capetian side and joined Richard's. He was followed by Baldwin IV of Flanders, the future Latin Emperor, as this one was contesting Artois to Philip II. In 1197, Henry VI died and was replaced by Otto IV, Richard I's own nephew. Renaud de Dammartin, the Count of Boulogne and a skilled commander, also deserted Philip II. Baldwin IV was invading Artois and captured Saint-Omer while Richard I was campaigning in Berry and inflicted a severe defeat on Philip II at Gisors, close to Paris. A truce was accepted, and Richard I had almost recovered all Normandy and now held more territories in Aquitaine than he had before. Richard I had to deal with a revolt once again, but this time from Limousin. He was struck by a bolt in April 1199 at Châlus-Chabrol and died of a subsequent infection. His body was buried at Fontevraud like his father.|$|E
2500|$|Tiana {{is notable}} for being Disney's first black princess. The studio's {{decision}} {{to create a}} black heroine was met with mixed reception. While some critics, such as Richard Watson, praised the film for offering a long-awaited [...] "break in tradition", others received it with much criticism and speculation. Rachel Bertsche of O, The Oprah Magazine called {{the arrival of a}} black Disney princess [...] "barrier-breaking" [...] and [...] "long overdue". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote, [...] "these avowedly black people spend an awful lot of the movie being adorable, unthreatening little green creatures. Disney may wish to reach out to people of colour – but the colour green wasn't what we had in mind." [...] Bidisha of The Observer was fairly mixed in her review, calling Tiana a [...] "one-dimensional" [...] but [...] "clever, strong woman", while criticizing the film's light-hearted plot and lack of emphasis on racial issues. Patricia Williams of The Guardian, who conceded harboring a general dislike of Disney animated films and the characters featured in them, including the princesses, accused Disney of being [...] "unforgivably late" [...] in their creation of a black heroine. Williams did, however, find Tiana to be [...] "spunkier than most princesses", comparing her to Princess Fiona of the Shrek franchise, and reacted positively to Tiana's portrayal as a tireless feminist restaurant tycoon. Writer Brooks Barnes from The New York Times highlights the two different issues for Princess Tiana, in her article [...] "Her Prince Has Come. Critics, Too" [...] that shows Disney with a good standing than with a negative standpoint, with the help of other writers expressing how, [...] "Disney should be ashamed", <b>said</b> <b>William</b> Blackburn, a former columnist at The Charlotte Observer. [...] "This princess story is set in New Orleans, the setting {{of one of the most}} devastating tragedies to beset a black community." [...] From a rumor that surfaced online giving off that Disney was originally going to call Maddy (short for Madeleine) giving the idea that it was too close to the racist word Mammy, giving the aspect for her being a slave to her friend Charlotte La Bouff. Harvard teacher Michael D. Baran, a cognitive psychologist and anthropologist, expressed how children learn about race, and [...] how Disney has a stereotyping history, [...] "Because of Disney’s history of stereotyping, people are really excited to see how Disney will handle her language, her culture, her physical attributes" [...] said Michael D. Baran.|$|E
