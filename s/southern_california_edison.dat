25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Californian cities {{as far south}} as Los Angeles were looking to new sources for {{electricity}} because of their rapidly growing populations and industries. Two visionaries, railroad baron Henry E. Huntington and engineer John S. Eastwood established a fledgling power company in 1902 today known as <b>Southern</b> <b>California</b> <b>Edison,</b> and acquired water rights to the upper San Joaquin River from the Miller and Lux Corporation. During that year, Huntington and Eastwood devised plans to utilize the water of the San Joaquin River and some of its headwaters tributaries in what would {{become one of the most}} extensive hydroelectric systems in the world, known as the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 <b>Southern</b> <b>California</b> <b>Edison</b> {{announced}} {{an agreement to}} purchase solar powered Stirling engines from Stirling Energy Systems over a twenty-year period and in quantities (20,000 units) sufficient to generate 500 megawatts of electricity. In January 2010, Stirling Energy Systems and Tessera Solar commissioned the first demonstration 1.5-megawatt power plant ("Maricopa Solar") using Stirling technology in Peoria, Arizona. At the beginning of 2011 Stirling Energy's development arm, Tessera Solar, sold off its two large projects, the 709MW Imperial project and the 850MW Calico project to AES Solar and K.Road, respectively. In 2012 the Maricopa plant was bought and dismantled by United Sun Systems. United Sun Systems released a new generation system, based on a V-shaped Stirling engine and a peak production of 33kW. The new CSP-Stirling technology brings down LCOE to USD 0.02 in utility scale.|$|E

This outage also caused 230 people to be without power in Malibu. The California Independent System Operator Corp declared an energy transmission emergency in southern California on October 23, due to wildfires affecting the lines. 500,000-, 230,000- and 138,000-volt lines were disabled in San Diego, and some lines in other areas were also disabled. 24,992 people lost power, {{due to the lack}} of power from the power grid.
