5|$|The event which devastated {{areas from}} Montgomery to Greene County caused $20,000,000 in damage and injured 20 people. While the Storm Prediction Center {{archives}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a single tornado, {{it was likely}} three or more tornadoes, each producing F3 to F4 damage. Only damage near Schoharie was at the F4 level, and some sources doubt it even reached that intensity at all.|$|E
5|$|Some {{references}} also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{derived from}} a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the Rajtarangini for a watch-station; or {{it is the same}} as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom. According to Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana. the region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.|$|E
5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E

5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil and they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the reason}} for {{establishing}} the small railroad is argued by historians, it is apparent to some {{that there was a}} need to provide some sort of public passenger service between the two communities.

I don’t know if that means I sound old or I sound intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E

25|$|According to tradition, when Muhammad {{was either}} nine or twelve years old, {{he went with}} his uncle Abu Talib on a {{business}} journey to Syria. There he met Bahira {{in the town of}} Bosra. When the caravan was passing by his cell, the monk invited the merchants to a feast. They accepted the invitation, leaving the boy to guard the camel. Bahira, however, insisted that everyone in the caravan should come to him. Then a miraculous occurrence indicated to the monk that Muhammad was to become a prophet. According to one version, those were the stigmata that Bahira found on young Muhammad. Other variants of the story <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a miraculous movement of a cloud or an unusual behavior of a branch that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's companion, warning him to preserve the child from the Jews (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the Byzantines (in al-Tabari's version).|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eastern}} part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 {{kilometers}} away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, it is safe to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes. The Japanese soldiers also planted several cotton trees on the area. Now, this place {{is considered one of the}} richest barangay in Dasmariñas. Many schools and colleges can be found here such as the Southern Luzon College, International English Center, Asian Trinity School, and many others. Adjacent to the place is the Emilio Aguinaldo College. Numerous subdivisions and villages are also located here.|$|E
50|$|The Laurentian was {{a society}} of Trinity College, Dublin, created during the {{academic}} year 1952-3.

500|$|In 1845, a {{religious}} revival {{took place in}} Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: [...] "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my savior." [...] She went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her [...] "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." [...] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly {{for only a few}} years.

500|$|In 2003, after {{a friend}} had {{received}} a script for The Principles of Lust, Guillory claims she [...] "read it and couldn't put it down, and begged to read for the part". She was impressed by director Penny Woolcock's unconventional style of shooting, without rehearsing the actors, using raw takes and improvisational performances. For the role of Juliette, Guillory performed nude in the film's sex scenes which were filmed {{during the first week}} of filming, making her somewhat nervous. She later went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of her favorite acting experiences. Afterwards, Guillory had a small role in the romantic comedy Love Actually before taking the starring role in the television miniseries Helen of Troy. The series was mostly based on Homer's epic poem Iliad and focuses on the mythological life of Helen. Helen of Troy was nominated for best miniseries at the Satellite Awards.|$|E
500|$|The series debuted to {{positive}} reviews, with critics praising both the storytelling and the artwork.

Club and IGN noted the Luna Brothers' skill at writing recognizably real people and capturing a character's humanity. Writing for Comics Alliance, Laura Hudson said that while lots of comics [...] "deal {{with the idea of}} superheroes as modern-day celebrities", none [...] "focus on the relentless commercialism and pitfalls of fame quite like Ultra".
