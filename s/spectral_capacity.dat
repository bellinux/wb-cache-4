50|$|OFDM enables {{reliable}} broadband communications by distributing {{user data}} across {{a number of}} closely spaced, narrowband subchannels. This arrangement {{makes it possible to}} eliminate the biggest obstacle to reliable broadband communications, intersymbol interference (ISI). ISI occurs when the overlap between consecutive symbols is large compared to the symbols’ duration. Normally, high data rates require shorter duration symbols, increasing the risk of ISI. By dividing a high-rate data stream into numerous low-rate data streams, OFDM enables longer duration symbols. A cyclic prefix (CP) may be inserted to create a (time) guard interval that prevents ISI entirely. If the guard interval is longer than the delay spread—the difference in delays experienced by symbols transmitted over the channel—then there will be no overlap between adjacent symbols and consequently no intersymbol interference. Though the CP slightly reduces <b>spectral</b> <b>capacity</b> by consuming {{a small percentage of the}} available bandwidth, the elimination of ISI makes it an exceedingly worthwhile tradeoff.|$|E

We isolate the primary factors which discrepantly affect these linear precoders, then capture their complex interactions in an analytical model. By combining our realworld capacity results with this analytical model, we find new insight in to the tradeoffs between conjugate and zeroforcing precoding. Our results suggest that conjugate will outperform zero-forcing when there are many simultaneous users, the users have high mobility, or the implementation employs less-capable hardware.

Moreover, frequency planning for a hierarchical cellular network, especially to cover indoor areas and hot-spots is a complicated and expensive task. Therefore, we study the ability of hierarchical cellular structures with inter-layer reuse to increase the capacity of a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) radio network by applying Total Frequency Hopping (T-FH) and Adaptive Frequency Allocation (AFA) as a strategy to reuse the macro- and microcell resources without frequency planning in indoor picocells.

This paper can be roughly divided into two parts. In the first part, we will prove a family of energy estimation inequalities which control the shifts of action functional in the Hamiltonian Floer theory. This directly implies an affirmative conclusion on continuity of spectral invariant and boundary depth in several important cases, for instance, the symplectic surface Σ_g > 1 or closed symplectic manifold M with _ K H^ 2 (M; K) = 1.

Higher time delays will generate call interruptions and forced terminations, particularly for time sensitive applications like real-time multimedia and data services. Currently in the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), the handover procedure is initiated and performed by the fixed part of the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). The mobile terminal is only capable of detecting candidate base stations suitable for the handover; it is the role of the network to interrogate a candidate base station for a free channel. Handover signalling is exchanged via the fixed network and the time delay required to perform the handover is greatly affected by the levels of teletraffic handled by the network. In this thesis, a new handover strategy is developed to reduce the total time delay for handovers in a microcellular system. The handover signalling is diverted from the fixed network to the air interface to prevent extra delays due to teletraffic congestion, and to allow the mobile terminal to exchange signalling directly with the candidate base station. The new strategy utilises Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) technique as a mechanism to transfer the control of the handover procedure from the fixed network to the mobile terminal.

The received data allows to assess the regulation mechanisms of such parameters as the highest volume and microvessels pulsation amplitude in different age groups. Moreover, it is possible to figure out the cardiac rhythm and arterial pressure regulation mechanisms considering a probability of the oscillation analysis of the most low-frequency range...|$|R
30|$|Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) [1 – 3] {{is one of}} the key {{technologies}} in 5 G, which can greatly boost the channel <b>capacity,</b> <b>spectral</b> efficiency, and connection density by utilizing a large number of antennas at the base station (BS). For a short coherence time, the same pilot sequences are usually assigned to users in different cells to save bandwidth, leading to the problem of pilot contamination [4]. When the number of BS antennas goes to infinity, the system capacity is largely limited by the inter-cell interference because of the pilot contamination [5]. Therefore, pilot pollution has become one of the main reasons for the performance loss in massive MIMO systems.|$|R
