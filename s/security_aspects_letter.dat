In this paper, we investigate the general aspect-oriented software security development process, and propose an Eclipse-based software <b>security</b> <b>aspect</b> development tool, AOSecBuilder, to support <b>security</b> <b>aspect</b> component development. This tool provides reusability of software <b>security</b> <b>aspects,</b> and improves <b>security</b> developer’s productivity. We also discuss the future efforts of AOSecBuilder...|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has become}} a significant and well-known term within {{a short period of}} time. Some parts of it might even be considered as unclear, including its vague definition. Cloud computing has rapidly and successfully come to perform an essential role within information technology and therefore in how organizations are managing their IT departments today. Its many advantages allure organizations to deploy a cloud solution. Despite the flourishing growth of cloud computing it still has its draw backs. One of its problems has come to be acknowledged as security issues, which has resulted in many companies deciding not to deploy a cloud solution and instead retain their traditional system. This qualitative study will come to investigate the perspective of organizations regarding security within cloud computing. The aim is to outline the <b>security</b> <b>aspects</b> conferred by Swedish organizations as there already is existing information concerning security issues. The empirical study is based on the gathered information from conducted semi-structured interviews. This study resulted in the findings of seven <b>security</b> <b>aspects</b> outlined by organizations, with the main reason concerning the uncertainty and towards the services of cloud computing. These <b>security</b> <b>aspects</b> are essential as they are set by organizations that have the potentiality to become cloud users, but for certain reasons decide not to. From the outlined <b>security</b> <b>aspects,</b> a close relationship can be identified to the already known security problems. These problems have strengthened the meaning of the <b>security</b> <b>aspects,</b> and that they are based on real concerns that can be connected to real problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Security is a {{major issue}} in {{developing}} software systems. It is widely recognized that <b>security</b> <b>aspects</b> must be considered in all the phases of the development process from the analysis of the organizational context to the final implementation of the software system. However, current approaches for designing secure systems only target particular <b>security</b> <b>aspects</b> at specific stages of the development process. A unified process combining these different approaches is still missing. This paper surveys several existing techniques and discuss the need of a general framework for integrating them into a single development process. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{standards}} for vehicle safety consider only accidental failures; {{they do not}} consider failures caused by malicious attackers. The standards implicitly assume that the sensors and Electronic Control Units (ECUs) of each vehicle compose a secure in-vehicle network because no external entity communicates with the nodes of the network. These standards assume that safety and <b>security</b> <b>aspects</b> are independent. Connecting vehicles to external entities, e. g., through Vehicle to Mobile (V 2 M), Vehicle to Vehicle (V 2 V), and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V 2 I), proved to be useful: it enables using Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications that improve our safety, efficiency, and comfort; but vulnerable to security threats. This paper {{provides an overview of}} AGORA framework: a framework generating secure and tested boilerplate code needed for ITS applications, demonstrates that safety and <b>security</b> <b>aspects</b> in motor vehicles are not independent, and proposes extending safety assurance by considering <b>security</b> <b>aspects.</b> It also discusses a set of research challenges related to extended safety assurance in connected vehicles...|$|R
