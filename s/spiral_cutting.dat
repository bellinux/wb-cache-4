40|$|AbstractMechanical {{machining}} of composites, {{especially the}} machining of holes for bolts or rivets, poses challenges {{due to the}} anisotropic material structure. Machining forces may damage the workpiece permanently. Chipping or delamination are severe damages, primarily occurring at the workpiece's surface layers.

This article presents detailed analyses of two such machining strategies with regard to the process force direction.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} a study of Proposition IX of Book I of Newton's Principia, the problem of {{determining}} the centripetal force for an equiangular spiral. In Newton's main proof of this proposition there is an error concerning his reason for the figure SPRQT being “given in kind,” and a very interesting technique of varying things {{in the neighborhood of}} a limit. This main proof utilized Newton's formula for the limit of SP 2 QT 2 QR given in Corollary I to Proposition VI of the Principia. Newton also gave an alternate proof which utilized his formula for SY 2 PV given in Corollary III to Proposition VI. The “given” of Proposition IX was “a <b>spiral</b> PQS, <b>cutting</b> all the radii SP, SQ, &c., in a given angle. ” Both the main proof and the alternate proof implicitly depend on the property of the equiangular spiral that the radius of curvature at any point is proportional to the pole distance SP.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Tool path {{generation}} {{is an important}} part of ultra-precision manufacturing, and spiral tool path is one typical driving path. For single point diamond turning (SPDT), two methods are commonly used to generate the driving points on the spiral tool path, which are equally spaced angles and equally spaced arcs for two adjacent cutting points. But these two methods both have the defects for machining radial sinusoidal surface with SPDT. In this paper, the theoretical analyses of the two different methods are conducted and compared respectively. Then, an optimal method of generating the <b>spiral</b> <b>cutting</b> tool path is proposed on the base of theoretical analyses, which can avoid disadvantages of two original methods. The proposed method can enhance the machining accuracy and fabricating efficiency for ultra-precision machining of the radial sinusoidal surface with SPDT...|$|E

40|$|Plug and {{abandonment}} (P&A) of subsea wells {{often involves}} removal of steel casing. In {{some parts of}} the well the casing is cemented in place making the operation of retrieving the casing more complex. The conventional methods for retrieving casing are unpredictable in terms of time consumption and consequently cost. This thesis has investigated the current guidelines and regulations that apply for P&A. Further, the conventional methods for removing cemented casing have been analyzed and compared to alternative approaches that have not yet been field proven. A case study on a Cut and Pull operation performed by Statoil was assessed to identify key operational issues. The case study suggested {{that there is a need}} for new approaches for freeing cemented casing. An alternative method for removal of cemented casing has been proposed, namely the Spiral Cut Approach (SCA). Laboratory testing of small scale spiral cut specimens were performed, and it was found that the spiral cut allows the cement to debond successively along the surface of the specimen exposed to torsional loading, thus freeing the casing. FE-analysis were performed to investigate the criticality of the spiral cut pitch and the required torque for a fullscale casing. The method is based on debonding one joint of casing from the cement before moving on to the next casing joint. After the spiral cut has been made between the casing couplings, each casing joint is exposed to sufficient torque to overcome the cement bond between each casing joint (approximately 12 m). Finally, a drillstring deployed pulling tool is connected to the upper section of the casing string and the casing is retrieved in one go. Operational steps and tools necessary to perform the SCA have been assessed. The laboratory testing, FE-analysis and operational assessment indicated that a significant higher number of casing joints can be pulled in one go using the SCA. A time comparison based on the case study and an assessment of the SCA, indicated that a total time saving of 2 days can be made by using the SCA to retrieve 100 m of cemented casing. However, more work will have to be carried out for more detailed verification of the SCA. This includes development of a effective tool for <b>spiral</b> <b>cutting</b> of casing, a combined tool for applying torque and pull for retrieval of cemented casing and lastly an assessment on the effects of using extended diameter couplings. </p...|$|E

50|$|As {{with other}} forms of stick candy, the {{earliest}} canes were manufactured by hand. Chicago confectioners the Bunte Brothers filed {{one of the earliest}} patents for candy cane making machines in the early 1920s.In 1919 in Albany, Georgia, Robert McCormack began making candy canes for local children and {{by the middle of the}} century, his company (originally the Famous Candy Company, then the Mills-McCormack Candy Company, and later Bobs Candies) had become one of the world's leading candy cane producers. Candy cane manufacturing initially required a fair bit of labor that limited production quantities; the canes had to be bent manually as they came off the assembly line to create their curved shape and breakage often ran over 20 percent. McCormack's brother-in-law, Gregory Harding Keller, was a seminary student in Rome who spent his summers working in the candy factory back home. In 1957, Keller, as an ordained Roman Catholic priest of the Diocese of Little Rock, patented his invention, the Keller Machine, which automated the process of twisting soft candy into <b>spiral</b> striping and <b>cutting</b> it into precise lengths as candy canes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of <b>spiral</b> bevel gear <b>cutting</b> is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of gear tooth surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of gear tooth surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with {{spiral bevel gear}} NC machining, and is applied to the self-developed spiral bevel gear NC milling machine to control the gear cutting.
