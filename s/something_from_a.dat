25|$|Goddard {{was able}} to flight-test many of his rockets, but many {{resulted}} in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because {{he felt that he}} always learned <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> test. Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test.|$|E
500|$|The extreme {{temperatures}} pose a serious health hazard. Frostbite is common, as is hypothermia. In the 1988 Yukon Quest, Jeff King suffered an entirely frozen hand because of nerve damage {{from an earlier}} injury which left him unable to feel the cold. King said his hand became [...] "like <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> frozen corpse". In 1989, King and his team drove through {{a break in the}} Yukon River in [...] temperatures. Frozen by the extreme cold, King managed to reach a cabin and thaw out. Other racers have suffered permanent damage from the cold: Lance Mackey suffered frostbitten feet during the 2008 Yukon Quest, and Hugh Neff lost the tips of several toes in the 2004 race.|$|E

5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars with its review by Arwulf stating: [...] "anyone else putting {{on such a}} show would {{run the risk of}} {{sounding}} foolish, Hibbler had so much class mingled with chutzpah that each performance feels like <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> impossible or imaginary jazz/lieder recital".|$|R
500|$|The Gentlemen, {{called the}} [...] "creepiest villains we've ever done" [...] by series writer Doug Petrie, were {{inspired}} by a nightmare Whedon had as a child, specifically {{one in which he}} was in bed and approached by a floating monster. Whedon fashioned The Gentlemen as <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Brothers Grimm fairy tale, intending them to be frightening to children — monsters who carve out people's hearts, smiling as they do so. Nosferatu, Pinhead from Hellraiser, and Mr. Burns from The Simpsons all served as physical models for The Gentlemen. Elegantly Victorian in costume and demeanor, Whedon found their politeness and grace especially unsettling. Their metallic teeth {{were inspired by}} the intersection of Victorian culture with the height of the Industrial age, an era that Whedon considers [...] "classically creepy". For Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox, The Gentlemen and their straitjacket-wearing minions, who clumsily flap, gyrate, and crouch as they move, are representative of class disparity and patriarchy: The Gentlemen, with their Victorian suits, move effortlessly to accomplish what they set out to do while their minions, whom Whedon called [...] "footmen", do the [...] "dirty work".|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E

[...] The building had deteriorated and was described as [...] "like <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> war-ravaged land." [...] At the time, resident Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink from Hogan's Heroes) said of the building: [...] "Welcome to Beirut West." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{third and}} final stunt was usually <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> extreme type of stunt seen in an action film. Like the first stunt, it usually {{involved}} heights, water, vehicles, {{or some combination of}} the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt was always competitive. The player with the best performance this round would win the grand prize (R$50,000 in season 1).|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that to digitize something {{is the same as}} digital preservation. To digitize something is to convert <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> analog into a digital format. [...] An example would be scanning a photograph and having a digital copy on a computer. This is essentially the first step in digital preservation. To digitally preserve something is to maintain it {{over a long period of}} time.|$|R

Something deep and unreasoning was on the boy's side; something that would not fit with common sense and the habits of civilized society; <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Arab's tent or a Highland glen. Then Tod came up behind and {{put his hands on}} his son's shoulders.|$|R
2500|$|In a poll {{performed}} by NME, readers ranked {{it as the}} tenth best song of the year. Maura Johnston of The Village Voice, however, called the song and the accompanying music video overproduced, while New York magazine contributor Amanda Dobbis commented that [...] "it's hard to totally separate Del Rey's looks from the criticism that's been bubbling around her." [...] In responses to this controversy, Pastes Luke Larson said, [...] "when 'Video Games' first hit the web, people weren’t freaking out about Lana Del Rey or fake lips or Lizzy Grant. People were freaking out because they had stumbled upon a fresh voice and a beautifully written song and ultimately, does the rest really matter?" [...] Krystina Nellis of Drowned in Sound said the single reminded her of <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> David Lynch movie.|$|E
2500|$|Gandalf and {{the entire}} company then go to Orthanc. [...] Théoden rejects Saruman's offer of peace despite the wizard's cunning words. [...] Gandalf then offers Saruman a chance to repent, but Saruman is too proud and refuses. [...] So Gandalf casts Saruman out of the Order of Wizards and the White Council and breaks his staff. Gríma throws <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> window at Gandalf but misses, and it is picked up by Pippin. [...] Gandalf quickly takes it from Pippin. This object {{turns out to be}} one of the palantíri (seeing-stones). Pippin, unable to resist the urge, looks into it and {{encounters}} the Eye of Sauron, but emerges unscathed from the ordeal. Gandalf then realizes at last the link between Isengard and Mordor and how Saruman fell at last into evil. [...] By looking into the palantír, Saruman became ensnared by the Dark Lord and made to do Sauron's bidding. [...] Gandalf then gives the palantír to Aragorn.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{was engaged}} {{for a time}} in the late 1950s to Henriette von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm. Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to {{interview}} Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson. Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be like <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were [...] "killing me with cream". Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry. Lee had met him some years before whilst filming Tales of Hans Anderson, where he received his blessing. However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement. He was concerned that his financial insecurity in his chosen profession meant that she [...] "deserved better" [...] than being [...] "pitched into the dishevelled world of an actor". She understood, and they called the wedding off.|$|E

60|$|The sbirro at once stepped {{towards the}} group, which {{consisted}} of two persons. One was an old, apparently dying, slave; {{the other was a}} strong middle-aged man, in a quaint blue gown, who knelt by his side, and poured <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> flask into his mouth.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{presently}} {{there was}} a revulsion of feeling as she was roused from her meditations by the coxswain's answer to her uncle, who had asked what was a smart, swift little smack, which after receiving <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> boat, began stretching her wings and making all sail for the Isle of Wight.|$|E
50|$|The story {{starts off}} in a theatre in a city only known as 'Grand Theater'. Valerian is {{performing}} a magic trick using Boy's talent to fit into small spaces. Boy is Valerian's slave (Valerian calls him his 'famulus'). He is treated cruelly by Valerian. Boy, after the show, is sent to a pub to collect <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> acquaintance of Valerian's. This something is a music box, which the increasingly distracted Valerian assures Boy that he needs.|$|R

60|$|The {{attendant}} {{glanced at}} the three men admiringly, for the speaker was plainly sober, and he knew how much money Black had paid him.

60|$|But {{the boys}} {{did not leave}} for a good quarter of an hour, and during that time, Dick and Dora somehow managed {{to walk to the}} end of the campus, where there were big clumps of rose bushes and lilac shrubbery.

60|$|However, he {{had made}} a mistake--as {{definite}} as a mistake in multiplication. It may be summarised thus: that the same inequality and insecurity that makes cheap labour may make bad labour, and at last no labour at all. It was as if a man who wanted <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> enemy, should at last reduce the enemy to come knocking at his door in the despair of winter, should keep him waiting in the snow to sharpen the bargain; and then come out to find the man dead upon the doorstep.|$|R

He was left out of the 2013 Lions squad, instead heading to the South African Quadrangular Tournament with Scotland. He kicked a last-minute conversion against Italy to salvage <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> underwhelming tournament, giving Scotland a 30-29 victory.

25|$|A notable {{amount of}} medieval {{literature}} is anonymous. This {{is not only}} {{due to the lack}} of documents <b>from</b> <b>a</b> period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> auctor instead. <b>From</b> this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.|$|R
