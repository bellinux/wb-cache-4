500|$|Anarky {{debuted in}} the first season's third episode, [...] "Tests", on July 27, 2013. The episode was written by Jim Krieg, with {{direction}} by Curt Geda, while the character was voiced by Wallace Langham. The episode made heavy use of chess as a symbol for the conflict between Batman and Anarky. This theme had been forecasted in pre-production interviews when Murakami described the relationship the characters were to have, and explained [...] "Batman is the black king and Anarky is the white king. So it's <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> psychological chess game."

It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E

[...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E

50|$|To {{make sure}} we respect {{the three types of}} dependencies, we {{construct}} a dependency graph, which is a directed graph where each vertex is an instruction and there is an edge from I1 to I2 if I1 must come before I2 due to a dependency. If loop-carried dependencies are left out, the dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph. Then, any topological <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> graph is a valid instruction schedule. The edges of the graph are usually labelled with the latency of the dependence. This is the number of clock cycles that needs to elapse before the pipeline can proceed with the target instruction without stalling.|$|E

Several of the finds, including the enigmatic Opabinia and Anomalocaris have some, though not all, features associated with arthropods, and are thus considered stem arthropods. The <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> the Burgess Shale fauna into various stem groups finally enabled phylogenetic <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> enigmatic assemblage and also allowed for identifying velvet worms as the closest living relatives of arthropods.|$|R

And at the end, it has the feminine and the masculine elements, whether that's taken literally or figuratively.
