The episode was written by Jim Krieg, with {{direction}} by Curt Geda, while the character was voiced by Wallace Langham. The episode made heavy use of chess as a symbol for the conflict between Batman and Anarky.

50|$|To {{make sure}} we respect {{the three types of}} dependencies, we {{construct}} a dependency graph, which is a directed graph where each vertex is an instruction and there is an edge from I1 to I2 if I1 must come before I2 due to a dependency. If loop-carried dependencies are left out, the dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph. Then, any topological <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> graph is a valid instruction schedule. The edges of the graph are usually labelled with the latency of the dependence. This is the number of clock cycles that needs to elapse before the pipeline can proceed with the target instruction without stalling.|$|E

Several of the finds, including the enigmatic Opabinia and Anomalocaris have some, though not all, features associated with arthropods, and are thus considered stem arthropods. The <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> the Burgess Shale fauna into various stem groups finally enabled phylogenetic <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> enigmatic assemblage and also allowed for identifying velvet worms as the closest living relatives of arthropods.|$|R
