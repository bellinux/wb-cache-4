50|$|On non-rocky coasts, {{coastal erosion}} results in {{dramatic}} (or non-dramatic) rock formations {{in areas where}} the coastline contains rock layers or fracture zones with varying resistance to erosion. Softer areas become eroded much faster than harder ones, which typically result in landforms such as tunnels, bridges, columns, and pillars. Over time the coast generally evens out. The softer areas fill up with sediment eroded from hard areas, and rock formations are eroded away. Also abrasion commonly happens {{in areas where the}}re are strong winds, loose sand, and soft rocks. The blowing of millions of <b>sharp</b> <b>sand</b> grains creates a sandblasting effect. This effect helps to erode, smooth and polish rocks. The definition of abrasion is grinding and wearing away of rock surfaces through the mechanical action of other rock or sand particles.|$|E

It can be grown indoors or outdoors (above freezing temperature) and is considered to be low maintenance.

Good soil drainage is essential to prevent root rot, so sandy soil is recommended (cactus mix or 3:1 potting soil to <b>sharp</b> <b>sand).</b> This plant can be easily propagated by cutting or pinching off 4 inches of healthy stem tip and lightly covering them with moist potting mix. The roots will quickly develop from where the leaves are attached to the stem.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to give an {{overview}} of three methods for treatment of <b>sharp</b> interfaces between <b>sands</b> with dierent capillarity properties. Results of the numerical methods are presented to indicate their domains of applicability and their ability to describe discontinuous satu-ration proles across the sharp interface. The most commonly used method based on the upwinding of the mobility coecients is shown to be unreliable in situations in which the mesh edges are aligned with subdomain interfaces. Therefore, we propose a modied upwind scheme, which can be applied on meshes with aligned edges as well as on general meshes that do not represent the subdomain interfaces. Results of this scheme are compared to results of the sharp-interface approach.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the wind laden with sand in modelling pebbles is believed by some authors to be only that of polishing the surface, by others of rounding off bits of stone that already possessed edges and corners, or again by others of wearing any fragment either rounded or angular into definite forms with ridges and facets, dependent on {{the shape of the}} basis (Alb. Heim). Experiments, fully confirming the last opinion, are described in this paper: no rounding off took place, while the models were slowly revolved in the sandblast, and vertical planes took on a backward slanting position, cutting eachother along <b>sharp</b> edges. Where <b>sand</b> corrosion is great, as in the desert, the windworn pebbles owe their shape to the laws formulated by Heim; many of the fossil windworn pebbles of Northern Europe have undergone but slight alteration from their original shape and size by the natural sandblast, others seem to have been entirely remodelled by the wind along the lines indicated above...|$|R
