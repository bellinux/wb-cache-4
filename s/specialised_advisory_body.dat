40|$|BACKGROUND: Civil and {{political}} participation {{lies at the}} core of citizenship. Increasingly, people with intellectual disability are members of disability <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies.</b> This study investigated the political orientations of <b>advisory</b> <b>body</b> members with intellectual disability, their participatory experiences, and the types of support they received. METHOD: The 9 people with intellectual disability who in 2005 were members of disability <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> at a state, national, and Victorian local government level were interviewed, together with 12 other members or secretariat staff of these bodies. Observations were also conducted of <b>advisory</b> <b>body</b> meetings. RESULTS: The political perspective of members with intellectual disability varied, but all had a background in self-advocacy. They found the work hard but rewarding and encountered both practical and intangible obstacles to participation. Members received varying types of practical support, but a supportive collegial milieu was characteristic among members who felt most confident about their participation. CONCLUSIONS: The milieu, structures, and processes of <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> must all be adjusted to accommodate people with intellectual disability if they are to participate meaningfully...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse (semi-) {{permanent}} <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> {{in the field}} of education in Europe. Education councils or <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> in general are often set up by government to increase policy legitimacy. To the extent that their members are strongly concerned and knowledgeable stakeholders, <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> are expected to contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of policy decisions, thereby strengthening the output legitimacy of the policy process. At the same time, <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> are supposed to contribute to democracy, in the first place by improving input legitimacy in providing stakeholders with a point of access to the policy arena, and secondly, by augmenting process legitimacy via an advisory process following certain norms, such as transparency, fairness, and deliberation. However, <b>advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> operate in a competitive policy environment where advice is coming from multiple sources and where different claims to legitimacy are being made. Therefore, they {{have to be able to}} gain and sustain access to the policy making process. Not only the advice needs to be of high quality and of high relevance, the <b>advisory</b> <b>body</b> itself also needs to establish and maintain a high status in order for its advice to be taken into account. <b>Advisory</b> <b>bodies</b> are hence challenged to function as boundary organisations, bridging the worlds of science, state and society, and tailoring to the needs of different actors. In this paper we analyse the role and functioning of education councils with regard to membership and their relationship with government, on the basis of recent comparative research of six European education councils (Greek, Spanish, Flemish, Portuguese, Dutch and Estonian council). status: publishe...|$|R
