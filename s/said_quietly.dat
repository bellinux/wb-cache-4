25|$|Pontifical High Mass: {{celebrated by}} a bishop {{accompanied}} by an assisting priest, deacon, subdeacon, thurifer, acolytes and other ministers, {{under the guidance of}} a priest acting as Master of Ceremonies. Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests. The parts that are said aloud are all chanted, except that the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, which before the reform of Pope Pius V were said in the sacristy, are <b>said</b> <b>quietly</b> by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sings the Introit. The main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary High Mass is that the bishop remains at his throne almost all the time until the offertory.|$|E

2500|$|On {{that same}} episode of Raw Is War, Foley then reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked {{shirt with a}} loose necktie and ended his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, the two competed in the second-ever Hell in a Cell match in June 1998 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were {{discussing}} the previous year's Hell in a Cell (which took place at Badd Blood in October) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming {{ideas about how to}} top that match when Funk said, laughing, [...] "Maybe you should let him throw you {{off the top of the}} cage", Foley replied: [...] "Yeah," [...] I shot back, [...] "then I could climb back up â€“ and he could throw me off again." [...] Man, that was a good one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage. After a while I got serious and <b>said</b> <b>quietly</b> to Terry, [...] "I think I can do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{do not believe in}} miracles," [...] <b>said</b> Decoud, <b>quietly.</b> Father Corbelan shrugged his high, broad shoulders doubtfully.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Come!' she <b>said</b> <b>quietly</b> to Siegmund, {{no longer}} resenting the {{completeness}} of his happiness, which left her unnecessary to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume, Mr. Hurd," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "that amongst your father's private papers {{you did not}} {{discover}} anything--unexpected?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>said</b> Rushbrook, <b>quietly</b> {{regarding}} the statue as if taking its measurement for a suitable apartment for it. [...] "Go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Earl made no pretence of ignorance. [...] "I remember," [...] <b>said</b> he, <b>quietly,</b> looking {{straight}} into the young man's thin white face.|$|R
6000|$|... "You may put it so," [...] <b>said</b> Ormond <b>quietly.</b> [...] "But Colonel Carrington is your {{acknowledged}} chief, and you owe him due respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|Joe {{remained}} silent while {{one might have}} counted ten, trying to restrain his anger, and then he <b>said,</b> <b>quietly,</b> but firmly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It would seem, Captain Dowsett, {{from your}} story, {{that you can}} manage very well without a supercargo?" [...] Cyril <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But, here Miss Bella repudiated, and <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> 'I {{can speak}} for myself; you know, ma. You needn't bring ME in, please.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Accompany you I will, father, {{and share}} your {{fortunes}} to the last. But marry Hernando Pereira I will not," [...] <b>said</b> Marie <b>quietly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are unfortunate {{enough to}} have such suspicions," [...] <b>said</b> Margaret <b>quietly,</b> [...] "I {{think it would be}} better to be silent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] <b>said</b> Dane <b>quietly.</b> [...] "They charge tolerably high, but I've {{seen what}} happens to the man who meddles with the mortgage-broker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush!' Harold <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> Then {{he said to}} Pearl, in {{a cheerful}} matter- of-fact way which carried {{conviction}} to the child's mind: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{perfectly}} right, Bannister," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "Everything {{you have}} said is quite true. And now would you mind going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Ruth," [...] Wingrave <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "I do not {{understand}} what has procured for me the pleasure of this unexpected visit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Mary, {{you will}} stay {{a little longer}} and take tea with us?" [...] <b>said</b> Fan <b>quietly,</b> but about {{forgiveness}} she said nothing.|$|R
60|$|These words I <b>said</b> quite <b>quietly</b> and in Dutch, so {{that our}} Kaffirs might {{understand}} them, though really I was boiling with wrath.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The first {{descriptive}} ballet seen in London, England,' <b>said</b> Henry, <b>quietly,</b> 'was [...] "The Tavern Bilkers", {{which was}} played at Drury Lane in--in seventeen--something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a long}} silence, {{and then}} the priest <b>said</b> <b>quietly</b> but abruptly: [...] "Am I right, then? Did Sir Claude kill himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Benjulia {{made his}} {{acknowledgments}} {{in his own}} remarkable way. [...] "No, thank you," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "I'd rather see the monkey." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Richard Jarman {{walked slowly}} {{to the door of}} his cabin, still holding her hand, and <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> {{pointing}} to his only chair:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's one and there's the other," [...] <b>said</b> M'liss <b>quietly,</b> {{indicating}} {{their respective}} localities by smartly tapping {{them with the}} palm of her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why should I?" [...] <b>said</b> Kate, <b>quietly</b> {{drawing her}} hand from him, [...] "for I have a devoted lover already--Master Martin Newcombe, of Barbadoes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Gale, I {{am going}} to ask you a rather curious thing. Will you do it, without asking why?" [...] Colonel Shepherd <b>said,</b> <b>quietly.</b>|$|E
