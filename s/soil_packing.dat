Sliding creep between particle contacts was incorporated in the DEM simulations, which displayed similar creep behavior found in experiments. The irregularly shaped pore geometry in the <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> was quantified with a best-fitting ellipse {{with the aid of}} the region-based method. It has been found that the initial density of soils and the deviatoric stress values under which creep starts determine unique evolution of pore space. In addition, the weak pore structures, elongated along the horizontal direction (or perpendicular to the axial loading), collapse first and ultimately only those stable pore structures, elongated along the vertical direction (or parallel to the axial loading direction), survive and then dominate the entire soil structures as creep proceeds. The pore characteristics at last become more uniform and homogenized throughout the sample, and a more stable particle arching elongated along the loading direction is gradually produced during creep. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

In the pure model sandy soil, the retained water curve measurements indicate that instead of a stable horizontal wetting front that grows downward uniformly, a narrow fingered flow forms under {{the top layer of}} water-saturated soil. This rain water channelization phenomenon not only further reduces the available rain water in the plant root zone, but also affects the efficiency of soil additives, such as superabsorbent hydrogel particles.

40|$|Three state {{variables}} namely, {{degree of}} saturation (Sw), capillary pressure (Pc) and specific air-water interfacial area (aaw) are indispensable for modelling coupled processes relevant to unsaturated soils mechanics, agriculture, and contaminant hydrology. They {{play a key role}} in simulating various phenomena and the determination of various parameters and physical characteristics such as the unsaturated soil shear strength, field capacity, wilting point, air and water diffusivity and the rate of dissolution of contaminants. The determination of soil water retention curve (Sw-Pc) as well as the specific interfacial area (aaw) using available experimental techniques is a challenging and time consuming task. Therefore, a numerical technique that employs basic soil properties to obtain these variables is of much value and high practical and theoretical importance. In the current study, the porous network extracted from a discrete element model (the so-called pore unit-assembly) has been used to directly model the drying and wetting processes inside a granular <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> and to obtain the values of Pc, Sw and aaw. The results of the simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data, which points to the efficacy and adequacy of the introduced algorithms and involved assumptions for this purpose...|$|E

The increasing policy imperative to implement successful soil monitoring programmes {{has resulted in the}} demand for reliable soil quality indicators (SQIs) for physical, biological and chemical soil properties. The selection of these indicators needs to ensure that they are sensitive and responsive to pressure and change, e. g. they change across space and time in relation to natural perturbations and land management practices. Using a logical sieve approach based on key policy-related soil functions, this research assessed whether physical soil properties can be used to indicate the quality of British soils in terms of their capacity to deliver ecosystem goods and services. The resultant prioritised list of physical SQIs was tested for robustness, spatial and temporal variability, and expected rate of change using statistical analysis and modelling. Seven SQIs were prioritised: <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> density, soil water retention characteristics, aggregate stability, rate of soil erosion, depth of soil, soil structure (assessed by visual soil evaluation) and soil sealing.

40|$|In {{this study}} on the surface charges and {{structural}} characterization of kaolinite clay, {{it is found that}} the highly pH dependent edge charges are important to the interparticle forces and associated fabric formations. When the pH is below the isoelectrical point of the edge surfaces, IEPedge, the Coulombian attraction between faces and edges dominates, which favors the formation of an opened edge-to-face (EF) association and a higher final sediment volume. At pH > IEPedge, the double-layer repulsion prevails at all surfaces to result in a deflocculated and dispersed fabric, which tends to form denser <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> in the sediment. Increasing the ionic strength (with NaCl as the electrolyte) leads to the opposite behavior in clay suspensions below and above the IEPedge: the degree of fabric flocculation and the final sediment volume decrease with an increased ionic strength at pH IEPedge. The measured pore-size distribution reveals a distinct dual-porosity characteristic in the pH 4 with salts (0. 15 mol/L NaCl) specimen: it consists of inter-aggregate spaces (similar to 1. 10 mu m) and intra-aggregate pores (similar to 0. 30 mu m).

However, the surfactants and remediation amendments have an unknown effect on indigenous subsurface microorganisms. Microbial populations are important factors to consider in remediation efforts due to their potential to alter soil geochemistry. This project focuses on measuring microbial metabolic responses to remediation amendments in batch and column studies using Deep Vadose Zone Sediments. Initial studies of the microbes from Hanford 200 area deep vadose zone sediment showed surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) and remediation amendment calcium polysulfide (CPS) had no affect on microbial growth using BiologTM Ecoplates. To move towards a more realistic field analog, soil columns were packed with Hanford 200 Area sediment. Once microbial growth in the column was verified by observing growth of the effluent solution on tryptic soy agar plates, remedial surfactants were injected into the columns, and the resulting metabolic diversity was measured. Results suggest surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) stimulates microbial growth.

Some of the best Mars analog mineral models of the soil have been prepared and justified according to known constraints of chemical composition, reflectance spectroscopy, and chemical reactivity. Detailed laboratory reflectance spectra in the ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared (. 30 to 2. 5 microns) and the infrared (2. 5 to 25 microns) regions have been obtained for the pure candidate minerals and some analog mixtures and compared to Mars reflectance spectra.

40|$|A {{substantial}} number of models predicting the soil moisture characteristic curve (SMC) from particle size distribution (PSD) data underestimate the dry range of the SMC especially in soils with high clay and organic matter contents.

The <b>soil</b> particle <b>packing</b> density was considered as a metric of soil structure and used to define a <b>soil</b> particle <b>packing</b> scaling factor.

In comparison to the original conceptual SMC model without scaling, the scaling approach improves the model estimations on average by 30 %. Improvements were particularly significant for the fine- and medium-textured soils.

40|$|Fluorescence {{macrophotography}} {{was used}} for the evaluation of colloidal transport and deposition in silica sand and sandy <b>soil</b> <b>packed</b> columns. With the fluorescence macrophotography technique, the number of microspheres and its macroscopic distribution on a column cross section is derived from an image of the fluorescence intensity of the surface. Column experiments with varying flow velocity and input concentration of microspheres lead to conditions with high deposition or high breakthrough of the colloids. In comparison with established microscopic fluorescent techniques the presented novel methodology was found to deliver similar estimates of particle concentrations and similar detection limits. Moreover, unlike with fluorescent microscopic method, the fluorescent macrophotography technique provides valuable information about the spatial distribution of microspheres. The Sulforhodamine-B, a frequently applied organic dye to label the microspheres, limits the applicability of fluorescence macrophotography technique due to self-quenching effects which occur at high particle concentration. At high proximity of the fluorescent microspheres self-quenching effects led to underestimation of microsphere concentration as well as incorrect depth profiles. Very recent developed microspheres, labelled with rare-earth-ion-chelate-complexes overcome this limitation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V [...] All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Behaviour of {{kaolinite}} clay is intimately {{related to the}} pore-fluid properties, such as the pH value, electrolyte concentration, ion type, and presence of organic compounds among others, because of its charged surfaces and associated interparticle electrical forces. The {{first part of this}} research focuses on the fabric formations and characterizations. The effects of pH and electrolyte concentrations on the interparticle forces and associated fabric formations were studied. Experimental results, including those from sedimentation tests, pore-size measurements, SEM images, and liquid limit tests reveal that the Coulombian attraction force dominates at low pH (pH below the isoelectric point of edge surfaces, IEPedge) and low electrolyte concentrations, which favors the formation of an opened face-to-edge fabric. At high pH (pH > IEPedge) and low electrolyte concentrations, the prevailing double layer repulsion leads to a deflocculated and dispersed fabric which tends to form a denser <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> with particles in parallel alignment after deposition or consolidation. At high electrolyte concentrations, van der Waals' attraction overwhelms the repulsion due to a shrunk double layer, and therefore soil aggregates and a relatively opened <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> are formed accordingly. The second part highlights the structure effects on the dynamic properties. The shear modulus and damping ratio of kaolinite with different structures, selected {{based on the results of}} fabric characterizations, were assessed by means of the Energy-Injecting Virtual Mass (EIVM) Resonant Column System. The experimental results demonstrated that the dynamic properties of kaolinite closely interrelate with interparticle forces and associated fabric arrangements. Stronger interparticle forces or higher degrees of flocculated structure lead to a greater shear modulus Gmax and lower damping ratio Dmin. The structure influence on the volumetric change and strain response under isotropic compression is apparent. Specimens with different structures have their individual consolidation lines and the merging trend is not readily seen as the isotropic confinement is up to 250 kPa. Moreover, the compressibility increases with increasing degree of flocculated structure. Anisotropic strain responses due to fabric effects can be found as well. The fabric effects on the critical-state and stress-strain behaviour are discussed in the last part based on the experimental observations of undrained shear tests. The soil structure has no apparent influence on the critical state friction angle (∅c'= 27. 5 °), which suggests the irrelevance between the critical-stress ratio and the interparticle forces. The undrained shear strength is seemly controlled by the initial packing density rather than the interparticle forces. Differences in the effective stress path are evident. Specimens with flocculated structure show a contractive tendency until reaching the critical state, while more complicate behaviour can be observed for the specimens with dispersed structure: showing a contractive tendency initially, passing a phase-transformation state afterwards, and performing dilative shearing towards the critical state in the end. Apart from the substantial influence on the isotropic normal compression line, the soil structure also has a noticeable effect on the volumetric behaviour at critical states for the specimens under confining pressure of 100 kPa...|$|E
40|$|We {{visualize}} {{the formation of}} fingered flow in dry model sandy soils under different rain conditions using a quasi- 2 D experimental setup and systematically determine {{the impact of the}} soil grain diameter and surface wetting properties on the water channeling phenomenon. The model sandy soils we use are random closely packed glass beads with varied diameters and surface treatments. For hydrophilic sandy soils, our experiments show that rain water infiltrates a shallow top layer of soil and creates a horizontal water wetting front that grows downward homogeneously until instabilities occur to form fingered flows. For hydrophobic sandy soils, in contrast, we observe that rain water ponds {{on the top of the}} soil surface until the hydraulic pressure is strong enough to overcome the capillary repellency of soil and create narrow water channels that penetrate the <b>soil</b> <b>packing.</b> Varying the raindrop impinging speed has little influence on water channel formation. However, varying the rain rate causes significant changes in the water infiltration depth, water channel width, and water channel separation. At a fixed rain condition, we combine the effects of the grain diameter and surface hydrophobicity into a single parameter and determine its influence on the water infiltration depth, water channel width, and water channel separation. We also demonstrate the efficiency of several soil water improvement methods that relate to the rain water channeling phenomenon, including prewetting sandy soils at different levels before rainfall, modifying soil surface flatness, and applying superabsorbent hydrogel particles as soil modifiers...|$|E

Evaporation is not only responsible for huge water shortage in the root zone, but also for soil salinization particularly in areas with shallow groundwater table. Unfortunately, the direct measurement of evaporation in large scales is difficult, costly, and usually impractical. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and verify a simple model for one-dimensional non-steady upward flow from shallow- falling groundwater table with the minimum input data. Consequently, an analytical solution was developed based on the Richards ’ equation with the initial and boundary conditions governing evaporation process. The solution was based upon the Brooks and Corey’s parametric equation for water retention curve. In this solution, the amount and instant of evaporation from the soil surface was estimated as function of water table drawdown, impermeable layer elevation, and soil physical properties. Nine large experimental soil columns consisting of three sandy loam, silly clay loam, and silly clay textures were conducted in lysimeters to verify the data obtained from the analytical solutions. The preliminary results indicate a reasonable agreement between the collected data and the derived theoretical model. However, the derived analytical model underestimated the evaporation and water table drawdown for a certain period of time.

Most importantly, because these systems can easily have their medium blown away by wind-driven rain or heavy winds, these should not be used in applications over 8 feet high. There are some systems in Asia that have solved the loose media erosion problem by use of shielding systems to hold the media within the green wall system even when soil liquefaction occurs under seismic load. In these systems, the plants can still up-root themselves in the liquified soil under seismic load, and therefore it is required that the plants be secured to the system to prevent them from falling from the wall. Loose-soil systems without physical media erosion systems are best suited for the home gardener where occasional replanting is desired from season to season or year to year.

This research was conducted to investigate the importance of surface connected and disconnected (buried) biopores on Escherichia coli (E. coli) transport when biopores are located near subsurface drains. A soil column (28 by 50 by 95 cm) was packed with loamy sand and sandy loam soils to bulk densities of 1. 6 and 1. 4 Mg m− 3, respectively, and containing an artificial biopore located directly above a subsurface drain. The sandy loam soil was packed using two different methods: moist soil sieved to 4. 0 mm and air-dried soil manually crushed and then sieved to 2. 8 mm. A 1 -cm constant head was induced on the soil surface in three flushes: (i) water, (ii) diluted liquid swine (Sus scrofa) manure 48 h later, and (iii) water 48 h after the manure. Escherichia coli transport to the drain was observed with either open surface connected or buried biopores. In surface connected biopores, E. coli transport was a function of the soil type and the layer thickness between the end of the biopore and drain.

Similarly, PM 2. 5 concentrations were also greater than the threshold limit (5000 µg m- 3) in these operations (respectively with 5888, 10560, 8470 µg m- 3).

For the first experiment, irrigation solutions simulating the Rio Grande water, city potable water, and two sources of reclaimed water (EC of 1. 4 and 2. 2 dS m- 1 and SAR of 6 and 11) were applied twice a week at 1. 7 cm per application {{for a total of}} 27 irrigation events using 46 cm of water. No significant effect of water quality was detected in Delnorte gravelly loam (Paleorthid) and a small effect on infiltration into Harkey silt loam (Torrifluvent).

In the second greenhouse experiment using a carefully crafted <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> and water application protocols, the impact of water quality on infiltration into two Torrifluvents, Harkey silt loam and Glendale silty clay loam appeared after water application of 40 to 50 cm (16 " - 20 ").

Mathematical equations were also derived to predict: The rate of the wetting front advance, prior to the occurrence of surface ponding, taking into account the effect of initial soil moisture content and rate of water application.

40|$|Even {{though for}} most {{hydraulic}} and geotechnical structures clear guidelines are available, those for flexible dolphins are still missing. Consequently, whether a design is safe is usually subject of debate. Economical dolphin piles are large diameter tubular piles, susceptible to local buckling. After installation the embedded {{part of these}} piles remains predominantly filled with soil. The aim {{of this research is}} to provide understanding of the effects concerning local buckling and therewith to contribute to the discussion whether a dolphin design is safe. The main research question is: Does the soil in dolphin piles contribute to the local buckling resistance and can this be used in the design of these piles? Gresnigt (1986) prescribes a strain based method to check a pile on local buckling. This method is incorporated in EN 1993 - 4 - 3 (2009). The resistance against local buckling depends on the slenderness ratio De/(tε 2). Also, ovalisation influences the resistance. The presence of a soil plug reduces the ovalisation, enhancing the local buckling resistance. An analytical method is proposed in which beam theory is used to determine the dolphin pile deformation and loads on the pile. Literature provides equations to calculate the ovalisation that can be applied in three distinct parts: above the bed level, between the bed level and plug level and below the plug level. The provided equations however, show inconsistencies at the transitions. It is proposed to apply beam theory on the pile wall, modelled as a linear beam with springs providing resistance against ovalisation. Above the plug level, the resistance is provided by the ring behaviour of the shell. Below the plug level, the stiffness is increased with the stiffness of the soil plug. The model overcomes the inconsistencies in ovalisation. The method assumes the stiffness of the plug in the pile can be approximated. However, it is concluded that the suggested stiffness in CUR 211 E (2013) is not able to determine the plug stiffness for semi-filled piles. Key parameters that affect the local buckling resistance are identified. These are the plug packing, plug level, slenderness ratio and the <b>soil</b> <b>packing.</b> The influence of these key parameters are studied with the finite element program Abaqus. The parametric study proves that the soil in dolphin piles contributes to the local buckling resistance. A denser packing of the plug improves the capacities of the bending moment and lateral load. Most of all, the dolphin can dissipate more energy. The plug level influences the level at which local buckling is observed, as well as whether an inward or outward buckle occur. The contribution of the inner soil on the local buckling resistance can be compensated by designing a more slender dolphin pile. A more slender cross-section reduces the capacities of the pile. The packing of the outer soil also influences the buckling level and shape. Furthermore, a looser <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> improves the energy capacity of the dolphin pile. To obtain a dolphin pile that optimises the improvements on the local buckling resistance by the inner and surrounding soil, an installation method is used that does not compact the soil and plug packing and after installation, the plug packing is compacted. With the Abaqus analyses the stiffness of the soil plug is studied. It reveals that the plug is stiffer at deeper levels. For a pile with a diameter comparable to 914 mm, when the predicted ovalisation for that pile without a soil plug is less than 8 mm, a plug stiffness of 30, 000 kN/m 2 can be assumed in the proposed analytical method, regardless of the plug packing. The stiffness is independent of the slenderness ratio. The Port of Rotterdam facilitated a full scale field test with eight piles. The Abaqus model shows reasonable comparison with the field test. The observed local buckling behaviour piles that were not modelled can well be explained with the results of the parametric study.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify which physical properties impact the thermal resistivity dry-out curve (TRDC) of natural sandy soils. The TRDC is a relationship between soil thermal resistivity and degree of wetness (e. g., volumetric water content, gravimetric water content, or degree of saturation). TRDCs of 13 sandy soils were investigated using modified hanging column tests. The tests were also used to investigate co-effects of the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC), which represents the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil. The physical properties evaluated in this research included: (1) degree of saturation, (2) soil particle size (D 10 and D 50), (3) fines content, (4) soil type, (5) soil density (?dmax, emax, and emin) and gradation (Cu), (6) quartz content, and (7) particle shape (sphericity and roundness). In the TRDCs, three analysis points?thermal resistivity (?) at the fully dried condition, critical degree of saturation, and fully saturated condition?were selected for analysis. Correlations between the three points of interest on the TRDC and the physical properties were supported with high-resolution images obtained by synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (CT) and statistical analysis, including, ANOVA and stepwise regression. Results included the significant effects of the measured soil physical parameters on the TRDC in addition to the well-recognized parameter of degree of saturation as reported in the literature. Impacts of degree of saturation on the TRDC were related to thermal resistivity of three phases of soil systems (?solid, ?liquid, and ?air). Due to high ?air, the highest ?soil was observed at the fully dried condition. As degree of saturation increases, thin films and liquid bridges among soil particles are formed, resulting in a rapid decrease in thermal resistivity. Near the critical degree of saturation of a TRDC, which is located near the knee point of the SWCC where moisture exists as adsorbed films (McQueen and Miller, 1977), changes in ?soil are more rapid. After liquid bridges form, ?soil decreases gradually as degree of saturation increases. The lowest ?soil was measured at the saturated condition. Soil thermal resistivity also decreased with increase in particle size as evaluated by D 10 and D 50. This was primarily related to size and thermal resistivity of the solid phase. In high-resolution images, for example, larger solid particles provide larger heat transfer paths, while smaller solid particles (e. g., silt-sized) consist of smaller heat transfer paths with a more tortuous void structure. Consequently, ?soil was affected by particle size as related to the thermal resistivity of the solid and void phases in addition to the tortuosity of the matrix. In contrast, ?soil increased with increasing fines content. Reasons for the effect of fines were similar to those of particle size. At a constant void ratio, soil that included higher fines content, such as SM soils, had relatively small solid particles with tortuous voids compared with SP or SW soils, which do not include significant fines content. Smaller solid particles and tortuous voids led to a decrease in ?soil. In the modified hanging column test and ANOVA, thermal resistivity values of the 13 sandy soils were unaffected by the type of sandy soil regardless of the point of comparison. Parallel with laboratory tests, statistical analyses indicate that slight differences among soil types are not statistically significant regardless of the point of interest evaluated. At the dried, critical, and saturated condition, statistical significance by soil types per ANOVA were 0. 061, 0. 174, and 0. 268. Therefore, a larger database of soil that represents the full spectrum of gravel, silt, and clay is required to fully investigate the effect of soil type on the TRDC. The effect of soil density on TRDC was analyzed using four density parameters: (a) maximum dry unit weight (?dmax), (b) minimum void ratio (emin), (c) maximum void ratio (emax), and (d) coefficient of uniformity (Cu). Soil thermal resistivity decreased as ?dmax and Cu increased, while soil thermal resistivity increased with increasing emin and emax. In other words, ?soil decreased as soil density increased because of closer particle contacts and a reduction of the volume of air. On the other hand, ?soil increased with increase in emin and emax, which represent a decrease in soil density, due to less particle contacts and greater air volume. Because quartz is amongst the best heat conducting minerals that is common in natural soils (Winterkorn, 1962), influence of quartz content on the TRDC was analyzed. Soil thermal resistivity at each of the points of comparison (dry, critical, and saturated) decreased as quartz content increased. Effect of particle shape on TRDC was analyzed based on sphericity and roundness of particles. Higher thermal resistivity was measured for prismoidal particle shapes as compared to spherical particle shapes. <b>Soil</b> <b>packing</b> with prismoidal particle shape included more voids than <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> with spherical particle shape. Roundness of the 13 specimens ranged between 1. 08 (well-rounded shape) and 1. 13 (rounded shape). Soil thermal resistivity increased slightly with increasing roundness because moisture adsorption is enhanced when particle shape changes from a well-rounded shape to a rounded shape (Likos and Jaafar, 2013). In stepwise regression, D 10 was the only significant factor in terms of ?sat, and D 50 was only significant factor in terms of ?dry. The regression model for ?sat and ?dry resulted in R 2 of 0. 245 (24. 5 %) and 0. 519 (51. 9 %), respectively. To investigate further statistical significance among the physical properties, a greater database of measurements for the TRDCs of sandy soils would be required. In comparing thermal resistivity with paramaters from the van Genuchten (VG) model, thermal resistivity increased slightly with the ? and n parameters, both of which are indicative of the shape of SWCC. However, one of the correlations?dry thermal resistivity to the ? parameter?decreased with the two SWCC parameters. Because of similar physical properties, however, increases in thermal resistivity were small. Therefore, additional tests with an expanded database of soils?including gravel, sand, silt, and clay?is recommended to more fully investigate the correlation between thermal resistivity and the VG parameters. Among the three points of analysis on the TRDC of the 13 sandy soils, ?soil at the fully dried condition was most affected by soil physical properties; to be specific, the dry thermal resistivity values ranged from about 150 ?C?cm/W to about 330 ?C?cm/W. Heat transfer in unsaturated soil systems directly depends on the matrix of solid particles and air voids, with large differences in resulting thermal resistivity. In contrast, thermal resistivity of the 13 specimens in terms of the physical properties changed only slightly at fully and partially saturated conditions (?soil ranged from about 40 ?C?cm/W to about 80 ?C?cm/W). These findings indicate that degree of saturation, particularly dry of the critical saturation, is the most significant factor for thermal resistivity of sandy soils with similar physical properties. A larger range of soil types with varying gravel content and percentage of coarse- and fine-sized sand is required to fully investigate the effect of soil physical properties on the TRDC at partially and fully saturated conditions...|$|E
40|$|Many farms of wind {{turbines}} are being installed worldwide {{as a response}} to clean energy targets. These farms are usually installed in offshore environments since limitations of space can be encountered or due to public pressure against the visual disruption that farms can cause in urban areas. These offshore {{wind turbines}} are commonly founded on monopiles, which have been traditionally installed in shallow waters. Nevertheless, current trends show preference towards turbines of greater capacity which are installed in deeper waters. This trend poses uncertainties and new challenges to the offshore industry since most of the gained experience lies on the installation of monopiles in shallow waters. The hydromechanical response of soil and soil-structure interaction during the installation is complex and far from being fully understood yet. Thus, research projects involving advanced physical and numerical modelling techniques could be proposed as a first step to gain a better insight in the impact pile driving technique and how different soil conditions can influence the installation procedure of such monopiles. The current study is part of a project lead by Royal IHC, which has been developed at Delft University of Technology. This numerical study aims to study the dynamic behaviour of saturated sand and pile response by means of numerical simulations of a series of centrifuge tests using the finite element method in the time domain. These experiments were going to be performed in open-ended piles using the centrifuge facility of Delft University of Technology as part of a separate research project. Special attention has been given to the prediction of boundary effects in the centrifuge experiments since limitations of space are present in the facility. Two types of drainage conditions have been considered, i. e. fully drained and fully undrained. Two relative densities have been chosen to cope with loose and dense sand response, i. e. RD = 30 % to 90 %, respectively. A hypoplastic model has been used to model the surrounding soil, while soil-structure interaction has been addressed using a zone of degraded material properties as a continuum. Numerical predictions have shown that boundary effects may be usually stronger in denser soil conditions. In addition, liquefaction has been predicted to take place in the surroundings of the pile when driven into loose sand. In this regard, the effects of an initial soil liquefaction triggering event have been predicted to not influence in a significant manner pile drivability. In general, boundary effects {{have been shown to be}} problem dependent, i. e. on the geometry, stress state and <b>soil</b> <b>packing</b> state. In addition, drainage conditions and the amount of degradation of strength and stiffness properties have shown to play a role on numerical predictions of impact pile driving response. In addition, a numerical validation has been performed by comparison with preliminary centrifuge test results on dry dense sand. Finally, it has been concluded that the use of lateral viscous boundaries may be a suitable strategy to mitigate boundary effects in impact pile driving centrifuge tests. A first estimation of the damping demand of these Soft Boundaries (SB) has been presented in this study. Future studies should aim in exploring different numerical techniques in the sake of improving the predicting capabilities, e. g. by considering particle based methods such as MPM to extend the current research findings within multiple-blow centrifuge tests and by incorporating more complexities within the simulation of the hammer impact.
