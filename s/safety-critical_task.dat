A review of these standards has taken place early this century prompted by antidiscrimination laws {{in the workplace and}} several transport accidents. The Australian and Canadian Railways have developed new lanterns to address their occupational medical requirements. The Civil Aviation Authority in the UK has adopted the Color Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test as the standard for assessing color vision for professional flight crews. The methodology employed using the CAD test ensures that color deficient pilot applicants able to complete the most <b>safety-critical</b> <b>task</b> with the same accuracy as normal trichromats can be accepted for pilot training.

40|$|The {{effect of}} recent {{experience}} on current behavior {{has been studied}} extensively in simple laboratory tasks. We explore the nature of sequential effects in the more naturalistic setting of automobile driving. Driving is a <b>safety-critical</b> <b>task</b> in which delayed response times may have severe consequences. Using a realistic driving simulator, we find significant sequential effects in pedal-press response times that depend {{on the history of}} recent stimuli and responses. Response times are slowed up to 100 ms in particular cases, a delay that has dangerous practical consequences. Further, we observe a significant number of history-related pedal misapplications, which have recently been noted as a cause for concern in the automotive safety community. By anticipating these consequences of sequential context, driver assistance systems could mitigate the effects of performance degradations and thus critically improve driver safety...|$|E

Green driving, whether motivated by financial or environmental savings, has the potential to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by a significant amount. This paper focusses on the interaction between the driver and their vehicle – what type of eco-driving information is easy to use and learn whilst not compromising safety. A simulator study evaluated both visual and haptic eco-driving feedback systems in the context of hill driving. The ability of drivers to accurately follow the advice, as well as their propensity to prioritise it over safe driving was investigated. We found that any type of eco-driving advice improved performance and whilst continuous real-time visual feedback proved to be the most effective, this modality obviously reduces attention to the forward view and increases subjective workload. On the other hand, the haptic force system had little effect on reported workload, but was less effective that the visual system. A compromise may be a hybrid system that adapts to drivers’ performance on an on-going basis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Better {{education}} of clinicians {{is expected to}} enhance patient safety. An important component of education is adherence to standard protocols, which are mainly available in written form. Believing in the potential power of videos, we hypothesized that the introduction of an educational video, based on an institutional standard protocol, would foster adherence to the protocol. METHODS We conducted a prospective intervention study of 425 anaesthesia procedures and teams (202 pre-video and 223 post-video) involving 1091 team members (516 pre-video and 575 post-video) in seven individual operating areas (with a total of 30 operating rooms) in a university hospital. Failure of adherence to <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks</b> during rapid sequence anaesthesia inductions was assessed during systematic on-site observations pre- and post-introduction of an educational video demonstrating evidence-based and best practice guidelines. RESULTS The odds for failure of adherence to <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks</b> between the pre- and post-intervention period were reduced, odds ratio 0. 34 (95 % confidence interval 0. 27 - 0. 42, P< 0. 001). The risk for failure of adherence was reduced significantly for eight of the 14 <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks</b> (all P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS This study provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of an educational video to enhance adherence to a standard protocol during complex medical procedures. The introduction of a video can reduce failure of adherence to <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks</b> and contribute to patient safety. We recommend the introduction of videos to improve protocol adherence...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in mixed-criticality embed-ded applications implemented on distributed architectures. Depending on their time-criticality, tasks can be hard or soft real-time and regarding safety-criticality, tasks can be fault-tolerant to transient faults, permanent faults, or have no dependability requirements. We use Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling for the hard tasks and the Constant Bandwidth Server (CBS) for the soft tasks. The CBS pa-rameters determine the quality of service (QoS) of soft tasks. Transient faults are tolerated using checkpointing with roll-back recovery. For tolerating permanent faults in proces-sors, we use task migration, i. e., restarting the <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks</b> on other processors. We propose a Greedy-based on-line heuristic for the migration of <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks,</b> in response to permanent faults, and the adjustment of CBS parameters on the target processors, such that the faults are tolerated, the deadlines for the hard real-time tasks are sat-isfied and the QoS for soft tasks is maximized.

40|$|Learning motion {{tasks in}} a real {{environment}} with deformable objects requires not only a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, but also a good motion characterization, a preferably compliant robot controller, and an agent giving feedback for the rewards/costs in the RL algorithm. In this paper, we unify all these parts in a simple but effective way to properly learn <b>safety-critical</b> robotic <b>tasks</b> such as wrapping a scarf around the neck (so far, of a mannequin). We found that a suitable compliant controller {{ought to have a}} good Inverse Dynamic Model (IDM) of the robot. However, most approaches to build such a model do not consider the possibility of having hystheresis on the friction, which is the case for robots such as the Barrett WAM. For this reason, in order to improve the available IDM, we derived an analytical model of friction in the seven robot joints, whose parameters can be automatically tuned for each particular robot. This permits compliantly tracking diverse trajectories in the whole workspace. By using such friction-aware controller, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) as motion characterization and visual/force feedback within the RL algorithm, experimental results demonstrate that the robot is consistently capable of learning such <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks.</b> Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

The proposed approach hardens a program against transient memory errors by introducing software redundancy: every computation is performed twice and results are compared, and control flow invariants are checked explicitly. By exploiting the tool's capabilities, several benchmark applications have been hardened against transient errors. Fault injection campaigns have been performed to evaluate the fault detection capability of the hardened applications.

As a basis for the framework a new Interruption Taxonomy is outlined to categorize a variety of traceable information needed to exhaustively describe the context space. An exploratory user study is underway to calibrate the kind of benefit gained with the formulated Interruption Model. The expressiveness of the proposed Interruption Model is demonstrated by concretizing the general approach using the particularities of the selected problem domain.

This paper illustrates how a model-based system design can be tightly integrated with safety case arguments, to demonstrate both how safety cases link safety-specific analysis techniques like FMEA or FTA to architectural elements to provide evidence for safety argumentation, as well as how safety cases can be directly applied to efficiently guide the construction of the system architecture w. r. t. the claims given in the safety case.

Nonetheless, platform-wide software verification (required for safety) is often expensive. Therefore, design methods that enable utilization of components such as real-time operating systems (RTOS), without requiring their correctness to guarantee safety, is necessary. In this paper, we propose a design approach to deploy safe-by-design embedded systems. To attain this goal, we rely on a small core of verified software to handle faults in applications and RTOS and recover from them while ensuring that timing constraints of <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks</b> are always satisfied. Faults are detected by monitoring the application timing and fault-recovery is achieved via full platform restart and software reload, enabled by the short restart time of embedded systems.

Classical hydrostatic transmissions used on board ships for critical tasks such as rudder and stabilizing fin steering gears fulfill both the requirements a), b) above, but recent proposals for substitution with full-electric drives (rotary motors coupled with multistage reduction gears) usually do not. Especially the requirement b) needs particular attention and increased complexity when dealing with geared drives. This paper proposes a linear permanent-magnet direct drive fulfilling both the requirements above, for (but not limited to) rudder/fin steering gears. The absence of gears grants the requirement b), whereas the full-modular structure satisfies a), with independently fed stator modules and multiple inverters.

The accident statistics in Norwegian maritime passenger transportation display a paradox: personal injuries have decreased while ship accidents have increased in the period during which safety management has been regulated (the International Safety Management Code was effectuated in the late 1990 s). We interview regulators, shipping company management, and crewmembers about their practices and opinions regarding safety management regulation and use these data to explore how this regulation influences safety management practices to prevent different types of accidents.

We critically reviewed 516 published case reports of mefloquine adverse effects, to clarify the phenomenology of the harms associated with mefloquine, and to make recommendations for safer prescribing. Presentation We postulate {{that many of the}} adverse effects of mefloquine are a post-hepatic syndrome caused by primary liver damage. In some users we believe that symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs, either independently or as a secondary consequence of the hepatocellular injury. The mefloquine syndrome presents {{in a variety of ways}} including headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness, fatigue, disorders of sleep, mood, memory and concentration, and occasionally frank psychosis. Previous liver or thyroid disease, and concurrent insults to the liver (such as from alcohol, dehydration, an oral contraceptive pill, recreational drugs, and other liver-damaging drugs) may be related to the development of severe or prolonged adverse reactions to mefloquine. Implications We believe that people with active liver or thyroid disease should not take mefloquine, whereas those with fully resolved neuropsychiatric illness may do so safely. Mefloquine users should avoid alcohol, recreational drugs, hormonal contraception and co-medications known to cause liver damage or thyroid damage. With these caveats, we believe that mefloquine may be safely prescribed in pregnancy, and also to occupational groups who carry out <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks.</b> Testing Mefloquine's adverse effects need to be investigated through a multicentre cohort study, with small controlled studies testing specific elements of the hypothesis. </p...|$|R

We also survey reports of field interventions aimed at minimizing interruptions and distractions with the intention of improving the safety of medication administration and other <b>safety-critical</b> healthcare <b>tasks.</b> To analyse the papers adopting each form of investigation, we use the three dimensions of fidelity, formal control exercised, and the potential generalizability to the field. We argue that studies of interruptions and distractions outside the healthcare clinical context, but intended to generalize to it, should become more formally representative of the cognitive context of healthcare work. Research would be improved if investigators undertook programs of studies that successively achieve fidelity, control, and potential generalizability, or if they strengthened the design of individual studies...|$|R

In this paper, the synergies attainable by the combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Micro-Electromechanical System based Inertial Measurement Unit (MEMS-IMU) and Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) sensors are explored. In case of VBN, an appearance-based navigation technique is adopted and feature extraction/optical flow methods are employed to estimate the navigation parameters during precision approach and landing phases. A key novelty of the proposed approach is the employment of Aircraft Dynamics Models (ADM) augmentation to compensate for the shortcomings of VBN and MEMS-IMU sensors in high-dynamics attitude determination tasks. To obtain the best estimates of Position, Velocity and Attitude (PVA), different sensor combinations are analysed and Boolean Decision Logics (BDL) are implemented for data selection before the centralised data fusion is accomplished. Various alternatives for data fusion are investigated including a traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a more advanced Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

The presented system architectures adopt state-of-the-art information fusion approach based on a number of low-cost sensors including; Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Vision Based Navigation (VBN) sensors. Additionally, an Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM), which is essentially a knowledge based module, is employed to compensate for the MEMS-IMU sensor shortcomings in high-dynamics attitude determination tasks. The ADM acts as a virtual sensor and its measurements are processed with non-linear estimation in order to increase the operational validity time. An improvement in the ADM navigation state vector (i. e., position, velocity and attitude) measurements is obtained, thanks to the accurate modeling of aircraft dynamics and advanced processing techniques. An innovative SR-UKF based VBN-IMU-GNSS-ADM (SR-U-VIGA) architecture design was implemented and compared with a typical UKF design (U-VIGA) in a small RPAS (AEROSONDE) integration arrangement exploring a representative cross-section of the operational flight envelope. The comparison of position and attitude data shows that the SR-U-VIGA and U-VIGA NGS fulfill the relevant RNP criteria, including precision approach tasks...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{foreseen}} {{expansion of}} the air transportation system {{within the next two}} decades and the opportunities offered by higher levels of automation, Single-Pilot Operations (SPO) are regarded as viable alternatives to conventional two-pilot operations for commercial transport aircraft. In comparison with current operations, SPO require higher cognitive efforts, which potentially result in increased human error rates. This article proposes a novel Cognitive Pilot-Aircraft Interface (CPAI) concept, which introduces adaptive knowledge-based system functionalities to assist single pilots in the accomplishment of mission-essential and <b>safety-critical</b> <b>tasks</b> in modern commercial transport aircraft. The proposed CPAI system implementation is based on real-time detection of the pilot&# 039;s physiological and cognitive states, allowing the avoidance of pilot errors and supporting enhanced synergies between the human and the avionics systems. These synergies yield significant improvements in the overall performance and safety levels. A CPAI working process consisting of sensing, estimation and reconfiguration steps is developed to support the assessment of physiological and external conditions, a dynamic allocation of tasks and adaptive alerting. Suitable mathematical models are introduced to estimate the mental demand associated to each piloting task and to assess the pilot cognitive states. Suitably implemented decision logics allow a continuous and optimal adjustment of the automation levels {{as a function of the}} estimated cognitive states. Representative numerical simulation test cases provide a preliminary validation of the CPAI concept. In particular, the continuous adaptation of the flight deck&# 039;s automation successfully maintains the pilot&# 039;s task load within an optimal range, mitigating the onset of hazardous fatigue levels...|$|R
40|$|Modern user {{interfaces}} grow {{more and more}} complex and cannot be possibly handled by the same software components {{in charge of the}} timely execution of <b>safety-critical</b> control <b>tasks.</b> Evidence Srl recently proposed a single-board dual-OS system aimed at combining the flexibility of the Linux general-purpose operating system, which is able to produce any complex user interface, and the reliability of the automotive-grade ERIKA Enterprise operating system, a small-footprint real-time OS suitable for <b>safety-critical</b> control <b>tasks</b> and able to execute commands triggered by Linux. The operating systems run on dedicated cores and, for efficiency reasons, they share memory with limited support for memory protection: although the system allows running two operating systems, from a safety certification point of view it suffers from the fact that safety-critical and non-safety-critical components should be isolated from each other. In this paper we present, as an improvement to the initial implementation, again a double-OS system running, on a dual-core platform, ERIKA Enterprise and a full-featured Linux OS, but using the Xen hypervisor to run the two operating systems in two isolated domains. In the proposed setup, each of the domains runs on a dedicated core, assigned statically by the hypervisor. Linux runs as the control domain, and is therefore able to execute any of the components of the Xen toolstack; it is also able to grant to the real-time operating system access to any I/O-memory range needed for control tasks. The described system also provides a simple, safe communication mechanism between the two operating systems, based on Xen's inter-domain event notification primitives and explicit sharing of a dedicated set of memory pages by the real-time operating system...|$|R
