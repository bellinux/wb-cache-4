2500|$|Regarding the {{importance}} of Ra'aya Meheimna, Rabbi Moshe Cordovero said, [...] "Know that this book, which is called Ra'aya Meheimna, which Rashbi made with the tzadikim who are in Gan Eden, was a repair of the Shekhinah, and an aid and support {{for it in the}} exile, for there is no aid or support for the Shekhinah besides the secrets of the Torah... And everything that he <b>says</b> <b>here</b> of the secrets and the concepts—it is all with the intention of unifying the Shekhinah and aiding it during the exile.|$|E
2500|$|NO DATE—W./D. [...] Mentions {{communication}} from Dall. [...] Sending [...] "new" [...] photographs {{that will help}} in [...] "determining {{the character of the}} specimen". [...] Mentions attempts to turn carcass [...] "a dozen men pulling at the ropes only partly raise it" [...] Mentions [...] "another scheme" [...] if funds are available to you is horses and a windless to bring the carcass further up the beach [...] mentions thickness of hide which at places may reach 3 1/2", and says that the hood is so tough [...] "that when it is exposed to the air an ax makes very little impression upon it". [...] Estimates weight at 6 or 7 tons. [...] <b>says</b> <b>here</b> [...] "hood" [...] measures 18 feet in length—later corrected to 21 feet.

6000|$|... "Because, he <b>says</b> <b>here,</b> Woodward did {{not treat}} him right. This Ferguson or Stumpy {{was a friend}} to Weaver, and the paper was gotten up to bring Woodward to terms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we are {{not there}} at the time when the {{diligence}} starts, we lose our money, uncle George," [...] said he. [...] "It <b>says</b> <b>here</b> that they won't pay it back again." ...|$|E

25|$|The current {{use of the}} Swedish word gjorde is {{much more}} closely related to did than the word made. Which is {{intended}} is impossible to <b>say</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Near a year ago. Some fool {{rich man}} has bought it and is comin' {{down here to}} spend his summer vacation, he <b>says.</b> <b>Here,</b> read his letters. They'll explain it better 'n I can." ...|$|E
60|$|Now these, as I said, are weaning considerations. No man, I do think, {{that knows}} himself, or {{the glory of}} a gospel ministration, can, if he understands what Paul <b>says</b> <b>here,</b> desire that such a ministration should be {{retained}} in the churches.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What! The story-book is soon forgotten!' {{said the}} Doctor, {{pinching}} her cheek. 'I thought the news would dry those tears. [...] Yes. [...] "Let it be a surprise," [...] he <b>says,</b> <b>here.</b> But I can't {{let it be}} a surprise. He must have a welcome.' ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{took the}} telegram; read it; and frowned. [...] "We have had all our trouble for nothing, ladies and gentlemen," [...] she said, with {{suppressed}} vexation.

6000|$|The {{party were}} {{surprised}} to see the bulky parcels brought in. One of the men handed a letter addressed to Sir Ralph. [...] "Go with my retainers, my good fellows," [...] the latter said, [...] "and remain until I see what your master <b>says.</b> <b>Here,</b> Albert, my scholarship is rusty; read what the Fleming says; it may tell us what are in those crates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does my son {{write to}} you more {{particularly}} than to me, Doctor Rochecliffe?" [...] said the knight.

60|$|I {{will not}} present {{you with the}} unmeaning {{compliments}} of the season, but I will send you my warmest wishes and most ardent prayers, that Fortune may never throw your subsistence to the mercy of a knave, or set your character on the judgment of a fool; but that, upright and erect, you may walk to an honest grave, where men of letters shall <b>say,</b> <b>here</b> lies {{a man who did}} honour to science, and men of worth shall <b>say,</b> <b>here</b> lies a man who did honour to human nature.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} {{letter of}} November 4 is apparently to Henry Pelham. If Charles was in Berlin, as Pickle <b>says</b> <b>here,</b> about August 1752, the Stuart Papers throw no {{light on the}} matter. What we know of Frederick's intrigues with the Jacobites will find {{its place in the}} record of the following year, 1753. Pickle here confesses that his knowledge of future intrigues is derived from Frederick's ambassador at Versailles, the Earl Marischal.|$|E
60|$|For {{whatsoever}} is made manifest is light. Our version says; 'Whatsoever makes manifest is light.' That is true, a noble truth; but I {{should not}} be honest, if I did not confess {{that that is not}} what St. Paul <b>says</b> <b>here.</b> He says, 'That which is made manifest is light.' On this the best commentators and scholars agree. Our old translators have made a mistake, though in grammar only, and have substituted one great truth for another equally great.|$|E
6000|$|I {{showed him}} the letter with Catriona's postcript. [...] "And here again!" [...] he cried. [...] "Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona, and sense forby! As for James More, the man's as boss as a drum; he's just a wame and a wheen words; though I'll can never deny that he fought {{reasonably}} well at Gladsmuir, and it's true what he <b>says</b> <b>here</b> about the five wounds. But the loss of him is that the man's boss." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "About his intentions, as they <b>say</b> <b>here.</b> He {{wrote me}} a very {{pleasant}} letter, telling me all about them. Should {{you like to see}} his letter?" [...] the old man obligingly asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "The future won't concern YO' much, co'nnle, if as yo' <b>say</b> <b>here</b> yo'r {{resignation}} is sent in, and yo'r successor appointed," [...] she replied, {{with more}} gravity {{than she had}} previously shown.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{sent the}} Austrian creatures packing across the Danube with a flea in their ear," [...] said Susan with a relish, as she {{settled down to}} examine a map of Eastern Europe, prodding each {{locality}} with the knitting needle to brand it on her memory. [...] "Cousin Sophia said awhile ago that Serbia was done for, but I told her there was still {{such a thing as}} an over-ruling Providence, doubt it who might. It <b>says</b> <b>here</b> that the slaughter was terrible. For all they were foreigners it is awful to think of so many men being killed, Mrs. Dr. dear--for they are scarce enough as it is." ...|$|E
60|$|FIRST, I {{will show}} you what he means by blood. They that believe are born to it, as an heir is to an inheritance--they are born of God, not of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God; not of blood, that is, not by generation, not born to {{the kingdom of heaven}} by the flesh, not because I am the son of a godly man or woman--that is meant by blood (Acts 17:26); He 'hath made of one blood all nations.' But when he <b>says</b> <b>here,</b> 'not of blood,' he rejects all carnal {{privileges}} they did boast of: they boasted they were Abraham's seed; no, no says he, it is not of blood; think not to say you have Abraham to your father; you must be born of God, {{if you go to the}} kingdom of heaven.|$|E
60|$|He follows {{this with}} {{something}} that is perfectly extraordinary: he desires, instead of doing his duty, which he declares {{it is impossible to}} do, that he may be invested with an arbitrary power. I refer your Lordships to pages 2827, 2828, and 2829 of the printed Minutes, where you will find the system of his government to be formed upon a resolution not to use any one legal means of punishing corruption, or for the prevention of corruption; all that he desires is, to have an absolute arbitrary power over the servants of the Company. There you will see that arbitrary power for corrupt purposes over the servants of the Company is the foundation of every part of his whole conduct. Remark what he <b>says</b> <b>here,</b> and then judge whether these inferences are to be eluded by any chicane.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} too long, I <b>say,</b> <b>here</b> to insert the discursive {{progress}} by which I inquir'd after the proprieties of the motion of Light, and therefore I shall only add the result.|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you," [...] said Mrs. Tristram, [...] "that I am very serious. To prove it, I {{will make}} you a proposal. Should you like me, as they <b>say</b> <b>here,</b> to marry you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a dodge," [...] cried {{one of the}} executioners with a sneer, [...] "but {{have your}} say out. It's the last you'll {{have a chance to}} <b>say</b> <b>here,</b> so look sharp about it." ...|$|R
