40|$|Strain {{relief in}} lattice {{mismatched}} heteroepitaxy is mediated by formation and/or propagation of dislocations. Due to their technological significance, {{the process of}} strain relief in materials with face-centred cubic (fcc) lattices has been analyzed by several researchers 1, 2 following the work by Matthews and co-workers in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s 3 - 6. In the Matthews model, {{it is assumed that}} the <b>strain</b> <b>relieved</b> by any misfit dislocation is equal to the edge component of the dislocation burgers vector in the interface plane. This assumption has been used in all subsequent analyses of strain relief in lattice mismatched heteroepitaxy [1, 2]. Based upon the known three-dimensional atomic structure of the dislocations in fcc lattices, we show that the assumption is not valid for the 60 degree dislocations that form/expand via the conservative glide process. For compressively (tensilely) strained films the assumption is valid only for the 90 degree dislocations that form/expand via aggregation of vacancies (interstitials).

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of strained layer threading dislocation filter structures in single crystal epitaxial layers is evaluated using numerical modeling for (001) face-centred cubic materials, such as GaAs or Si 1 − x Ge x, and (0001) hexagonal {{materials such as}} GaN. We find that threading dislocation densities decay exponentially {{as a function of}} the <b>strain</b> <b>relieved,</b> irrespective of the fraction of threading dislocations that are mobile. Reactions between threading dislocations tend to produce a population that is a balanced mixture of mobile and sessile in (001) cubic materials. In contrast, mobile threading dislocations tend to be lost very rapidly in (0001) GaN, often with little or no reduction in the immobile dislocation density. The capture radius for threading dislocation interactions is estimated to be approximately 40 [*]nm using cross section transmission electron microscopy of dislocation filtering structures in GaAs monolithically grown on Si. We find that the minimum threading dislocation density that can be obtained in any given structure is likely to be limited by kinetic effects to approximately 104 – 105 [*]cm− 2...|$|E
40|$|To {{protect the}} {{structure}} and restore a smooth riding surface, many airports repair deteriorating concrete pavements with an overlay of hot mix asphalt (HMA). Reflective cracking is a serious concern {{associated with the use}} of thin overlays but is not addressed in the current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular for asphalt concrete (AC) overlaid rigid pavements. This paper presents a comprehensive study to examine the crack initiation and propagation of a test HMA overlay with and without a <b>strain</b> <b>relieving</b> interlayer, and to evaluate the interlayer performance to retard thermally-induced reflection cracks. To achieve these objectives, three-dimensional finite element analyses (FEA) were first conducted to assess key structural parameters controlling the tension stresses at the overlay bottom. Next, laboratory tests were performed to characterized fatigue, fracture, and viscoelastic performance of the interlayer mixture. Finally, a test pavement was built, instrumented, and tested at the FAA National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF).

40|$|The domain {{configurations}} and piezoelectric {{coefficient of}} ferroelectric {{materials such as}} PZT and PMN-PT thin films can {{have a significant effect}} on the optimization of future electronic devices. Piezo Force Microscopy (PFM) is an ideal tool based on Atomic Force Microscopy that allows unique investigations of such nanoscale effects, and can further be implemented to monitor domain switching dynamics. Utilizing PFM, the domain orientations as well as switching dynamics can be tracked in-situ. As the lateral dimension plays an important role in ferroelectric properties since it influences in-plane strain, both normal and lateral domain orientations are uniquely mapped simultaneously. Leveraging a new method for fabricating ferroelectric mesas down to the nanoscale, coercive fields and switching kinetics have thereby been investigated for continuous strained films as well as geometrically strain-relieved samples. A piezoelectric enhancement at edges of engineered nano islands is directly observed, while switching activation energies have been calculated and related to the strain-relief behavior. Piezoelectric coefficients in the surface normal direction were precisely measured on 2 μm, 1 μm and 0. 75 μm wide PMN-PT microfabricated structures. These revealed piezoelectric enhancements up to 500 nm from feature edges for 2 μm or wider structures, and an increasing overall enhancement throughout smaller 1 μm and 0. 75 μm structures as the strain relief becomes more complete. These results are corroborated by X-RAY diffraction and dielectric measurements from collaborators. The enhancement of dielectric and piezoelectric properties for geometrically <b>strain</b> <b>relieved</b> structures should furthermore be applicable to in-plane piezoactuation. Accordingly, lateral piezoactuation for PMN-PT microstructures is recorded for 4 μm and 2 μm features revealing xiv direction-dependent edge enhancement as hypothesized. Such insights are crucial for ferroelectric strain engineering efforts, the development of new device mechanisms, and their ultimate performance...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{sudden failure}} of metal {{structures}} under load, {{which has been}} a design problem for many years, is characterized by a crack propagation rate which approaches the speed of sound in the material. These failures, which are often known as catastrophic fractures, may be divided into two types which depend on the particular material in question. Fractures which cause a very small amount of plastic deformation associated with low energy absorption are known as brittle fractures, whereas high energy absorption during fracture, due to large amounts of plastic deformation, is associated with ductile fracture. The Griffith theory for spontaneous fracture in brittle materials states that the strain energy released during fracture must be greater than the energy needed to form the new crack surface area. This theory, which has been verified experimentally for brittle materials, is not applicable to ductile materials since the energy of plastic deformation during crack propagation must be taken into account. The revised and simplified theory for ductile materials states that the strain energy must exceed the energy needed to cause plastic deformation ahead of the crack. The steps in the fracture of ductile materials are initiation, slow crack growth, and rapid or catastrophic crack propagation, and the variable plastic deformation involved in these steps causes the process to be complex in behavior and analysis. However, an understanding of the causes of slow and rapid crack growth can be obtained by studying the effects of plastic deformation at the tip of a propagating crack. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the factors which affect the tendency for a ductile crack to propagate catastrophically. This was accomplished through the use of two types of investigations. In the first investigation an attempt was made to obtain catastrophic failure in 18 x 32 inch uniaxially stressed sheets of commercial household aluminum foil by introducing a crack {{in the center of the}} sheet in such a manner that the crack was elongated outwards in each direction. The catastrophic failure which was observed, however, was due to the addition of extra energy to the system boundaries which was not accounted for in the theory. Slow crack propagation was also observed and led to the second investigation. The plastic deformation at the crack tip was studied by visual of the was done observation using a metallograph and by actual measurement amount of deformation occurring during crack growth. This with a Tukon microhardness tester in which indentations were placed on the foil specimens, which were later given a small crack at the center, and which were mounted in a drill press vise on the tester. The crack was then propagated by turning the screw on the vise and measurements of the deformation between the indentations were made. The photographs and measurements of the plastic deformation at the crack tip showed that deformation existed throughout the entire specimen and was not localized in a given area at the crack tip as has been assured in some theories. The existance of elastic strain in the material was shown by the occurrence of elastic recovery in the <b>strain</b> <b>relieved</b> areas of the cracked material although no differentiation could be made between the area of elastic and plastic deformation. The existance of a stable configuration of iso-strain contours surrounding the tip of the crack was also shown. Calculations of the strain energy needed to satisfy the plastic deformation energy requirements showed that a crack length of about 49 inches would be needed to cause catastrophic failure. This is much larger than the specimen size used and would explain the lack of rapid crack growth in the tests run under near theoretical conditions...|$|E

The working principle of the strain shunt with one shunt sheet bridging two <b>strain</b> <b>relieving</b> units is illustrated. The strain measured on the shunt sheet surface is proportionally lower than that on the target surface where the strain shunt is attached, and the ratio of strain level reduction is derived analytically from shunt structure dimension.

However, such Ge layer forms at later stages of growth only in the growth with Bi surfactant, while the growing Ge layer without surfactant remains rough. What makes the difference and the success of Bi surfactant mediated epitaxy is the lateral growth and coalescence of the seed islands that cover the entire surface within first 15 bilayers of Ge deposition.

The 4 × 6 DVL reconstruction is found to be thermodynamically stable with respect to the c(4 × 2) structure for wetting layers at least 2 ML thick.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} the microstructure of epitaxial (001) perovskite thin films, studied by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM), in particular high resolution TEM, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The perovskites exhibit interesting superconducting, dielectric, and magnetic properties. Crucial issues are the effect of substrate surface structure, interfacial lattice mismatch strain, and film processing parameters on thin film evolution {{and the effect of}} fine-scale microstructure on the local physical properties. Dielectric SrTiO 3 films, rf magnetron sputtered on LaAlO 3 substrates, have been characterised. The films exhibited a columnar subgrain morphology, which was induced by the lattice mismatch strain. The microstructure was improved by use of a <b>strain</b> <b>relieving</b> YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x buffer layer, with an 80 % reduction of the subgrain boundary area, 80 % decrease of the density of misfit dislocations, and a 30 % increase of the dielectric tunability. EELS was used to measure the local dielectric properties of the sputtered SrTiO 3 films. Improved stoichiometry and absence of strain caused the absolute value of the imaginary part of the high-frequency dielectric function to approach the single crystal bulk value, with improving low-frequency dielectric constant. YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x /SrTiO 3 multilayers on LaAlO 3 substrates have been studied. Multilayers provide the potential of changing the internal lattice mismatch strain and affecting the lattice parameters and properties of the multilayer constituents. Special attention was paid to the effect of changes in the individual layer thicknesses, on the strain situation within the multilayers. High temperature superconductors are closely related to colossal magnetoresistance materials in terms of structure. Lattice strain, oxygen annealing, and grain boundaries have been found to affect the magnetoresistance. In La 0. 70 Ba 0. 30 MnO 3 films, pulsed laser deposited on LaAlO 3 substrates, the present work showed that annealing reduced the lattice mismatch strain and decreased the density of subgrain boundaries. This illustrated the effect of interfacial strain on subgrain morphology. The use of a SrTiO 3 buffer layer had a superior <b>strain</b> <b>relieving</b> effect and further reduced the density of subgrain boundaries and misfit dislocations.

Addition of glutathione to both A. fumigatus Delta gliT <b>strains</b> <b>relieved</b> gliotoxin inhibition. Moreover, expression of gliT appears to be independently regulated compared to all other cluster components and is up-regulated by exogenous gliotoxin presence, at both the transcript and protein level.

GliT exhibits a gliotoxin reductase activity up to 9 microM gliotoxin and appears to prevent irreversible depletion of intracellular glutathione stores by reduction of the oxidized form of gliotoxin. Cross-species resistance to exogenous gliotoxin is acquired by A. nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, when transformed with gliT.
