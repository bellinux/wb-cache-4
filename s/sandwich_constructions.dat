40|$|Abstract In this paper, <b>sandwich</b> <b>construction</b> {{was made}} up of wood surface sheet and paper {{honeycomb}} core. Some cores were impregnated with phenolic resin. Compared to untreated honeycomb materials, impregnated honeycomb core greatly improved the mechanical properties of <b>sandwich</b> <b>construction</b> composites. The results of the study showed that, <b>sandwich</b> <b>construction</b> with phenolic resin treated honeycomb core had higher bonding strength than those bonded with isocianate resin. With the increasing of honeycomb core thickness, sandwich composite material decreased in flat pressure strength, side pressure strength, and flexural properties.

50|$|The {{committee}} reported:“The sandwich panels {{used for}} the roof construction meet the legal requirements {{for this type of}} building with regard to the flammability and/or fire development. However, they do bring a huge danger. When heated the polyurethane will produce gases and smoke which may lead to an unexpected and quick spread of fire.

These fumes include ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, and nitrous fumes. The nitrous fumes have a characteristic yellow-brown colour. Initially, these fumes are released at the edges of the panels, but they also build up inside the sandwich panels themselves.|$|E

40|$|Silver/glass mirrors have {{excellent}} optical properties but need {{a method of}} support {{in order to be}} used in concentrating solar thermal systems. In collaboration with the Cummins dish/Stirling development program, they started investigating <b>sandwich</b> <b>construction</b> as a way to integrate silver/glass mirrors into solar optical elements. In <b>sandwich</b> <b>construction,</b> membranes such as sheet metal or plastic are bonded to the front and back of a core (like a sandwich). For solar optical elements, a glass mirror is bonded to one of the membranes. This type of construction has the advantages of a high strength-to-weight ratio, and reasonable material and manufacturing cost. The inherent stiffness of <b>sandwich</b> <b>construction</b> mirror panels also facilitates large panels. This can have cost advantages for both the amount of hardware required as well as reduced installation and alignment costs. In addition, by incorporating the panels into the support structure reductions in the amount of structural support required are potentially possible...|$|R

40|$|Interest is {{expanding}} {{in the use}} of <b>sandwich</b> <b>constructions</b> for structural applications. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>constructions,</b> consisting of two thin, stiff faces separated by a thick lightweight core, are generally known for their great efficiency in providing stiffness at low weight. Core materials are traditionally cellular solids [...] honeycombs or foams. With the recent development of processes to manufacture foams from molten metals, metallic foams have been proposed as a candidate for sandwich cores. Metallic foams are attractive candidate core materials due to the ease with which they may be formed into complex shapes, as well as their qualities of impact resistance, acoustical damping, thermal insulation, and fire resistance. In this study, the failure behavior of metallic foam core sandwich beams is examined. Several different modes of failure are analyzed: face yielding, face wrinkling, core yielding, and indentation. For the latter two modes, a multiaxial stress state in the core must be considered. Consequently, a yield surface for metallic foams is necessary. Three yield criteria have been proposed. The first is derived from an analysis of the failure o...|$|E

40|$|Sandwich structures, {{especially}} those with honeycomb and grid structures as the core material, are very commonly employed in aircraft structures. There is an increasing use of closed-pore rigid syntactic foams as core materials in <b>sandwich</b> <b>constructions</b> because they possess a number of favourable properties. The syntactic foams, owing to their structure and formation, behave differently under compression compared to other traditionally used core materials. In the present study, therefore, syntactic foam core <b>sandwich</b> <b>constructions</b> are evaluated for their behaviour under compression in both edgewise and flatwise orientations. Further, the work characterises the relative performance of two sets of sandwich materials, one containing glass-epoxy and the other, glass/carbon hybrid-epoxy skins. As non-standard geometry test specimens were involved, only a comparative evaluation was contemplated in this approach. The experiments indicate {{that the nature of}} the reinforcement fabric in the skin has a bearing on the test results in edgewise orientation. Thus, the tendency towards initiation of vertical crack in the central plane of the core material, which is a typical fracture event in this kind of material, was found to occur after a delay for the specimens containing the glass fabric in the skin. Attempts are made to establish the correlation between observations made on the test specimen visually during the course of testing and the post-compression microscopic examinations of the fracture features...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the attempt to utilize composite materials as components in protective structures such as those employed by the Air Force to secure critical military assets. In such applications, where lightweight materials that exhibit large levels of energy absorption and high strength/stiffness characteristics are desirable, composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>constructions</b> offer an attractive solution. In an attempt to evaluate the suitability of certain sandwich structures for use in force protection applications, several <b>sandwich</b> <b>constructions</b> with somewhat novel core materials were identified. A group of thermoplastic core materials have been developed that possess features of both a dense elastic solid and a foam type material. This class of core materials incorporates sloping cell walls, rather than the traditional parallel cell wall structure present in, say, a regular aluminum honeycomb. This feature, along with the increased surface area connectivity present between cells (produced by the forming process used to create the core materials) integrates surrounding cells into what may be described as an enhanced hexagonal single unit cell structure. To develop a preliminary understanding of the response of these enhanced cellular materials to the various loading regimes that could be encountered in a protective structure, a series of static and dynamic tests were conducted at Tyndall Air Force Base. A complete description of the novel core materials, as well as the results of the static and dynamic tests, will be presented in this paper...|$|E
