40|$|Objective: The  purpose  of  our  study  was  to  {{review the}} clinical  profile,  etiology  and  optimal  surgical  management  of  patients  with  non  {{traumatic}}  ileal   perforation. Methods : The  study  is   an observative  study  carried  out  for the  period  of  4 years in  the  department  of  surgery. A  total  of  71   patients  admitted  through    accident  & emergency  department and patients from medical wards  admitted  and treated with fever and  diagnosed  with  peritonitis  were  included  in  the  study.   A written {{informed consent was}} obtained from each patient/ patient relative. Demographics, anthropometrics and clinical profiles were collected. Lab investigations, x-rays, ultrasound of  abdomen & pelvis, operative  findings,duration  of  hospital  <b>stay,</b> <b>post</b> operative  complications  and  mortality were recorded. Results: We have assessed and treated 71 cases of  non traumatic  ileal  perforation;  the  causes  for  perforation  were  enteric  fever [40 (56. 33 %) ],   non specific inflammation[23 (32. 39 %) ],  obstruction[7 (9. 85 %) ],  tuberculosis[1 (1. 04 %) ].

40|$|INTRODUCTION Hernia is {{a common}} problem. Although {{there are so many}} {{technique}} of inguinal hernia repair, no one technique is taken as the ideal technique till date, as there are advantages and disadvantage in each technique. Availability of resources is one of the important factor to choose the technique of inguinal hernia repair. OBJECTIVE To compare outcome between tailored plug and patch hernioplasty and Lichtenstein tension free hernioplasty in regards of post op pain, analgesic requirement, hospital <b>stay,</b> <b>post</b> op complications and recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS 120 inguinal hernia patients admitted for operation in the dept. of surgery, Mac Gann hospital Shivamogga were included in the study. 60 patients were operated by plug and patch and 60 patients were operated by Lichtenstein patch technique. Data was collected in terms of operating time, post of pain, hospital stay, and return to normal work and recurrences. Student t test was used for analyses. RESULTS For plug and patch patients, mean operating time was 43. 07 mins. For Lichtenstein patient it was 59. 43 mins. (p< 05). Mean hospital stay for plug and patch was 2. 90 days and for Lichtenstein patch repair it was 4. 90 days which was statistically significant. There was no difference in terms of return to normal activities. CONCLUSION Tailored plug and patch operation took less time and experienced less postoperative pain and less hospital stay, although return to normal activities is same for both the technique. ...|$|E

These reforms were implemented by the section of Orthopedics in winter 2006. We designed this study {{to determine if there}} is a difference in morbidity and mortality following Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) fixation for intertrochanteric fracture patients before and after implementation of work hour reforms. MethodsPatients who underwent DHS fixation for inter-trochanteric fracture from January 2005 to December 2008 were included. These patients were divided into two groups. Group A included those patients who underwent DHS fixation prior to the implementation of work hour reforms and Group B patients had their hip fracture surgery after the implementation of these reforms. ResultsThe mean operative time was 1. 6  ±  0. 6  h and 1. 3  ±  0  h for group A and B patients respectively (p <  0. 001). There was no change in the rates of wound infection, length of hospital <b>stay,</b> <b>post</b> operative ambulation status, inadequate fixation, repeat surgeries and mortality in the two groups. ConclusionResident work hour reform was associated with a significant decrease in the mean operative time for patients undergoing DHS fixation. However morbidity and mortality following DHS fixation for Intertrochanteric fractures has not decreased after implementation of these reforms. Further research evaluating patient outcomes in orthopedic surgery following work-hour restrictions are needed. Moreover, the impact of these reforms on the educational and research activities of the residents also needs to be determined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Colonic self-expanding {{metallic}} stents (SEMS) {{may provide}} prompt relief of acute malignant colorectal obstruction (AMCO) and are increasingly used either palliatively or {{as a bridge}} to surgery (BTS) in patients in whom a definitive surgical approach is unsuitable. We evaluated short-term outcomes of malignant colorectal obstructive patients who underwent SEMS insertion in our institution over a 3 -year period. Methods: A prospectively maintained database was reviewed to identify all patients who presented to our institution with AMCO between August 2010 and 2013 and who were treated with a SEMS either temporarily or permanently. Additional data was retrieved from chart reviews and operation notes. Results: Sixteen patients (12 males, 4 females) each had a single stent inserted during the study period, either palliatively (n =  11) or as a BTS (n =  5). The technical and clinical success rates were both 87. 5 % (14 / 16). The two unsuccessful stenting cases both had disseminated disease and required emergency surgery while five patients with curable disease proceeded to elective resections. There was no procedure-related mortality or stent-related perforations. The mean (standard deviation) length of <b>stay</b> <b>post</b> acute surgery was longer than elective surgery [45  ±  21. 2 vs. 15. 8  ±  4. 0, days]. All patients in the BTS group were stoma-free post-operatively, while both patients who had emergency surgery ended up with permanent stomas. Finally, the stent complication rate was 6. 2 % (1 / 16), secondary to migration. Conclusions: Although limited by a small sample size, the study shows that SEMS have favourable short-term outcomes. Further adequately powered trials are needed to confirm those findings...|$|E
40|$|Results and Implications The Medicare {{data used}} for the study comes from {{previous}} RAND studies and data from a sample community hospital for comparisons of average lengths of <b>stay,</b> <b>post</b> hospital utilization, characteristics of patients who have a propensity to use post hospital care by gender, age and diagnosis. The study examines how reimbursement has effected patient care management therefore changing the hospital discharge planners priorities. The activities where discharge planners spend {{the majority of their}} time were stressed the least during their collegiate preparation as rated by the discharge planners through a survey instrument. Patients are experiencing shorter hospital lengths of stay, increase use of post hospital care and discharge planners find themselves spending the majority of their time on DRG optimization/utilization management, communication, securing resources and quality care assessment which totaled 60 percent of their time in an average work week. These areas were less stressed during the discharge planners collegiate education. Only 25 percent to 63 percent of the respondents stated these activities were stressed to highly stressed during their professional education. Changes in the curriculum of registered nurses and social workers who wish to become discharge planners must occur in the areas of health care reimbursement, communication, and particularly in the area of measuring quality of care across a continuum of services. A review of university sample curriculums by title indicates that very little attention is given explicitly to proprietary content which will be driving how our health care system functions now and well into the future. One approach to educating existing staff would be to offer a standardized university curriculum and certification exam to demonstrate proficiency in the new proprietary climate. Education is regarded as a primary strategy for transitioning practitioners into the new roles created by changes occurring in how our health care services are funded...|$|E

However, electrotherapy in which hemorrhoidal tissue is not excised might not be associated with severe complications. ObjectiveOur aim was to compare the results of Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy with electrotherapy methods using 16 and 30 mA (milliampers) direct current (DC). MethodsFour hundred and eight patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids, grades 1, 2 and 3, were randomly assigned into 3 groups. Group A (136 patients) underwent Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy, group B 1 (136 patients) and group B 2 (136 patients) were subjected to electrotherapy using 16 and 30 mA, respectively. The groups were compared in terms of duration of procedures, duration of hospital <b>stay,</b> <b>post</b> op pain severity and post op complications including recurrence, infection and non-healing ulcers. ResultsAll patients in group A had severe pain for 7 – 14 days of post op. However, in group B 1, 88 (65 %) patients had mild pain during the treatment and 1 st post op day; 28 (21 %) of them could not tolerate the operation; 20 (15 %) of them had mild pain and 10 (7. 5 %) of them had moderate pain up to day 7. In group B 2, 47 (35 %) of patients had sever pain for 6 h and 20 (15 %) of them experienced mild pain for 2 – 7 days post op. The one day hospital stay in group A and group B 2 were 82 and 97 %, respectively, while patients in group B 1 were treated as out patients. Mean procedure time for one hemorrhoidectomy in group A was 23 min, in electrotherapy using 16 and 30 mA was 9. 7 and 6. 1 min, respectively. The overall success rate with the first application in group B 1 was 57 % and in group B 2 was 93 %. ConclusionElectrotherapy method using 30 mA DC could significantly decrease post op pain, operation time and hospital stay. This method had good success rate and very low post op complications compared to Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and using 16 mA method. Therefore, due to its effectiveness, less pain, rapidity and safeness, we recommend it...|$|E

40|$|Study objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} maternal fetal outcome of laparoscopic surgery {{in the management of}} ovarian mass in pregnant women and the usage of analgesia in postoperative period. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which was carried out at department of O&G, Putrajaya Hospital. A total of 120 cases of ovarian mass in pregnancy between Jan 2000 âDecember 2014 were evaluated. 115 patients had undergone laparoscopy cystectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy. Women's age, parity, gestational age, surgical technique, operative findings and time, estimated blood loss, postoperative hospital <b>stay,</b> <b>post</b> operative pain score, usage of analgesia, complications of surgery, outcome of the pregnancy and histopathology reports were evaluated. Measurement and main results: Outcome of the pregnancy and post operative pain score and usage of analgesic were evaluated. The mean gestational week at the time of surgery was 14 weeks 1 day (Â± 2 weeks 1 day). The duration of surgery was 87. 4 Â mins (Â± 34. 8 Â mins) with average blood loss of 110. 3 Â ml (Â± 32. 0). Median size of ovarian cyst was 6 Â cm (IQR 2 Â cm). 2 cases converted to laparotomy. Only 2 cases were reported with second trimester loss which was diagnosed after 4 weeks and 10 weeks respectively. 5 women received tocolytic agent post operatively, all of them delivered at term. The mean length of hospitalization was 1. 51 day (Â± 0. 597). The average gestational age of delivery was 37. 78 (Â± 3. 42) mean birth weight 2. 97 Â kg (Â± 0. 65 Â kg). There was one intrauterine growth restriction baby with birth weight of 1. 89 Â kgÂ at 35 weeks of gestation and another baby with bladder exstrophy with ambiguous genitalia which was not related to surgery. The mean of pain score was 1. 5 (Â± 1. 6) over 10. 87. 9 % of the women had mild pain which only 64. 6 % require paracetamol or no analgesia. Conclusion: Majority of women with ovarian masses in pregnancy can be treated with ensured safety and reduced morbidity using the endoscopic approach.

40|$|IntroductionThere are {{increasing}} numbers of patients who are referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to in stent thrombosis or other coronary complications. The intent here is to characterize the risk, if any, {{that is associated with}} a prior PCI experience. ObjectivesTo compare clinical outcomes between patients undergoing CABG with or without previous PCI. MethodsThis is a retrospective chart review study. Two hundred seventy eight patients underwent CABG at KING FAHAD MEDICAL CITY, KSA between January 2009 to December 2010, of whom, 60 patients had prior PCI and 218 without a previous PCI. Primary outcome measures included post CABG survival, hospital <b>stay,</b> <b>post</b> CABG inraaortic balloon, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization. Statistical analysis was pursed using the t-test /Wilcoxon and multiple linear regression analysis test for the continuous outcomes and the chi-square/Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis for dichotomous outcomes. SAS version 9. 3; Carey, NC, USA was used for statistical analysis. ResultsOverall there were 278 patients (60 in the CABG plus prior PCI group and 218 in the CABG alone group). All patients were followed up to 2 year post-CABG. All pre-CABG demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. Overall, mean age was 59. 3 years (median= 59 years); 54 (20 %) females and both age and gender distributions were similar between the two groups. Mortality in the CABG alone group occurred in 6 / 218 patients (2. 8 %) compared to 2 / 60 (3. 3 %) in the CABG with prior PCI group (p= 0. 8). Sixty six (30. 3 %) on the CABG alone group had recent MI vs. 29 / 60 (49. 2 %) in the CABG with prior PCI, p value= 0. 007. Mean+sd of hospital stay was 11. 8 + 12 days on the CABG alone group vs. 13. 7 + 11. 6 days on the CABG with prior PCI group, p-value= 0. 27. Postoperative need of inraaortic balloon occurred among 7 (11. 62 %) cases in the CABG alone group and among 3 cases (5. 5 %) in the CABG with prior PCI group, p value= 0. 33.
