40|$|Optical {{cleanliness}} {{is important}} to NIF because it results in beam obscuration and scatter losses which occur in the front-end (containing over 20, 000 small optics) and the large-aperture portions of the laser (containing 7, 300 optics in 192 beamlines). The level of particulate cleanliness necessary for NIF, {{is similar to the}} <b>scatter</b> <b>loss</b> due to surface roughness. That is, the <b>scatter</b> <b>loss</b> should not exceed 2. 5 x 10 {sup {minus} 5 } per surface. Establishing requirements for optical and structural surface cleanliness needs consideration of both particulate and organic thin-film cleanliness. Both forms of cleanliness may be specified using guidelines specified in Military Standard 1246 C and are referred to as cleanliness Levels. This Military Standard is described briefly and displayed in tables and charts. The presence of organic thin-films on structural surfaces is of particular concern if the contaminated surface is near solgel coated optics (solgel coatings provide an antireflection (AR) quality); or the optic is in a vacuum. In a vacuum, organic contaminant molecules have a much high probability of transporting from their source to a solgel-coated optic and thereby result in the rapid change in the transmission of the antireflection coating. Optical surface cleanliness can be rapidly degraded if a clean optic is exposed to any atmosphere containing an aerosol of small particles. The use of cleanrooms, as described in Federal Standard 209 C, minimizes the settling of particulate contaminants and is described using charts and tables. These charts assist in determining the obscuration and <b>scatter</b> <b>loss</b> that can be expected when a clean surface is exposed to various Classes of cleanrooms due to particulate settling...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure {{relative}} scatter levels in single-mode fibres {{is essential for}} minimising fibre losses in telecommunications fibres operating in the 2 nd and 3 rd window for optical communications. In this way fabrication processes can be optimised in response to small improvements in measured scatter levels. Surprisingly, there is no simple way in which {{this can be done}} with sufficient accuracy to suit current very-low fibre scatter losses. We therefore describe a new sensitive technique to separate the Rayleigh <b>scatter</b> <b>loss</b> from the total loss in a single mode fibre. In this, a reference fibre, the <b>scatter</b> <b>loss</b> of which may, if required, be determined by calorimetric techniques, is spliced to the fibre under investigation. The splice loss is then probed using OTDR. The backscattered light powers from each side of the splice are compared by using the test and reference fibres in turn as the launch fibre. The technique is particularly suited to determining very small changes in scatter from fibre to fibre and is therefore ideal for process control and optimisatio...|$|E

40|$|In every {{advanced}} optical system, {{light scattering}} {{caused by the}} imperfections of optical components sooner or later becomes an issue {{that needs to be}} addressed. Light scattering can be a critical factor for both the throughput and the imaging quality of optical systems.

In the last decades, a number of instruments have been developed worldwide for the measurement of TS and ARS. However, numerous pitfalls have to be avoided to obtain objective, reliable, and reproducible measurement results. This is, in particular, true for low scatter levels of high-end optical components. Standard procedures that have to be both concise and easy to implement are thus of crucial importance for the optics community.

40|$|Cavity optomechanics is {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} field operating {{at the intersection}} of solid-state physics and modern optics. The fundamental process {{at the heart of this}} interdisciplinary endeavor is the enhancement of radiation pressure within a high-finesse optical cavity. Isolating this weak interaction, i. e. the momentum transfer of photons onto the cavity boundaries, requires the development of mechanical resonators that simultaneously exhibit high reflectivity (requiring low absorption and <b>scatter</b> <b>loss)</b> and low mechanical dissipation. In a Fabry-Pérot implementation, this is realized by fabricating suspended micrometer-scale mechanical resonators directly from high-reflectivity multilayers. Thus, the properties of the mirror material—particularly the loss angle and optical absorption—drive the ultimate performance of the devices. Interestingly, similar requirements are found in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from gravitational wave interferometers to stabilized lasers for optical atomic clocks. This overlap leads to an intimate link between advances in the seemingly disparate areas of macroscopic interferometry (e. g. precision measurement and spectroscopy) and micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems. In this manuscript, I will outline the fascinating implications of cavity optomechanics and present proof-of-concept experiments including MHz-frequency resonators aimed at the demonstration of quantum states of mechanical systems, as well as low-frequency (< 1 kHz) devices for the observation of quantum radiation pressure noise. Additionally, I will discuss off-shoot technologies developed in the course of this work, such as a numerical solver for the determination of support-mediated losses in mechanical resonators, as well as a new strategy for the realization of ultra-high-stability optical reference cavities based on transferred crystalline multilayers...|$|E
