40|$|Usually {{multiple}} MEMS or IC {{devices are}} fabricated on a single silicon wafer. Manually separating the components from each other involves scribing and fracturing the silicon. This thesis presents a design for a tool to aid in controlling the fracturing process. An earlier prototype of this tool was examined and new functional requirements were described. One of the functional requirements is that the tool cannot touch {{the top of the}} wafer because the top might have delicate components. The wafer breaker was designed to hold the wafer on two plates, where one of them is hinged. The wafer is scribed above the hinge line, and the hinged plate is pushed down to fracture the wafer. Several methods of holding the wafer down with vacuum were investigated. Bench level prototypes were constructed to test the feasibility of the methods. The prototype with a grid of pockets and flow restrictors performed the best. Even when the wafer only partially covered the grid, the covered pockets maintained a high vacuum. A clamped flexure was used as the hinge for the tool. The instant center of the hinge was calculated for small deflections, and was aligned with a scribe guide. This forces the scribed notch to be directly above the hinge line. A prototype wafer breaker was constructed and tested. The prototype worked, but in many cases where the (111) silicon plane was not parallel or orthogonal to the <b>scribe</b> <b>line,</b> the crack line would leave the <b>scribe</b> <b>line</b> and follow the crystal plane. This problem would also be encountered by those manually breaking wafers. by Kabir James Mukaddam. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2005.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the face}} of {{increased}} process variations, at-speed manufacturing test is necessary to detect subtle delay defects. This procedure necessarily tests chips at a slightly higher speed than the target frequency required in the field. The additional performance required on the tester is called test margin. There are many good reasons for margin including voltage and tem-perature requirements, incomplete test coverage, aging effects, coupling effects and accounting for modeling inaccuracies. By taking advantage of statistical timing, this paper proposes an optimal method of test margin determination to maximize yield while staying within a prescribed Shipped Product Quality Loss (SPQL) limit. If process information is available from wafer testing of <b>scribe</b> <b>line</b> structures or on-chip process monitoring circuitry, this information can be leveraged to determine a per-chip test margin which can further improve yield.

40|$|Microdisplays are {{considered}} to be an enabling technology for ultra-high resolution displays. Pixels can indeed be made very small using CMOS technology. Nevertheless, in multimillion pixel microdisplays, the die size becomes a limiting issue, because the optical field size of present day lithographic steppers, and consequently the resulting chip size, is limited to about 20 x 20 mm 2. This paper shows how this limitation can be overcome using stitching techniques and discusses the resulting challenges in design as well as lithography. The partitioning of the schematics and the layout in stitchable modules is reviewed, as well as the definition of boundary conditions for these modules. The difficulties concerning design verification, and a virtual stitching procedure that can be helpful, are presented.

40|$|As {{the feature}} sizes {{continue}} {{to shrink in}} advanced VLSI technologies, the impact of process variations on yield losses has become significant. Moreover, the process variations in path delays are increasingly dependent on circuit context. Given this “neighborhood” dependence, characterization of path delays is best carried out using embedded techniques applied to actual product macros, as opposed to <b>scribe</b> <b>line</b> test structures or embedded ring oscillators (RO). In addition to characterizing performance, such delay measurement techniques {{can be used to}} improve model-to-hardware correlation. Furthermore, these techniques can also be used in several contexts including defect detection, post-silicon debug and hardware-security. In this dissertation, I propose a high-precision and low-overhead embedded test structure, called REBEL, for measuring path delays in the circuit context. REBEL is minimally invasive to the design, as it leverages the existing scan structures, and easy to integrate because it can be completely automated within the DFT synthesis flow. The proposed embedded test structure and two of it's applications, namely path delay variability characterization and hardware Trojan detection, are verified in silicon. REBEL architecture for both level sensitive scan design (LSSD) and MUX-D scan designs are proposed and verified in 90 nm ASICs and 130 nm FPGAs respectively. The LSSD-based REBEL structure is integrated into a 32 -bit pipelined floating point unit (FPU), implemented in IBM's 90 nm technology, and the path delay measurements from 62 copies of the chip are used to analyze die-to-die and within-die variations. The MUX- D-based REBEL is integrated into a pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) design and wrapped with random built-in self test (BIST) architecture. The system is then implemented in Xilinx Virtex 2 Pro FPGAs and the data collected from 30 copies of FPGA are used to analyze the variability in path delays. As a second application, REBEL's effectiveness for detecting delay anomalies introduced by Hardware Trojans is demonstrated. Trojan emulation circuits, designed to model internal wire loads introduced by a hardware Trojan, are inserted into the design at multiple places. The emulation cell incorporates an analog control pin to allow a variety of hardware Trojan loading scenarios to be investigated. Using the hardware data collected from 62 chips fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology, I demonstrate that REBEL can detect the small delay anomalies introduced by hardware Trojans. I evaluate the detection sensitivity of REBEL for detecting hardware Trojans using linear regression analysis, which deals with the chip-to-chip variation effectively and improves the detection sensitivity.

40|$|Both {{random and}} {{systematic}} within-die process variations (PV) are growing more severe with shrinking geometries and increasing die size. Escalation in {{the variations in}} delay and power with reductions in feature size places higher demands on the accuracy of variation models. Their availability {{can be used to}} improve yield, and the corresponding profitability and product quality of the fabricated integrated circuits (ICs). Sources of within-die variations include optical source limitations, and layout-based systematic effects (pitch, line-width variability, and microscopic etch loading). Unfortunately, accurate models of within-die PVs are becoming more difficult to derive because of their increasingly sensitivity to design-context. Embedded test structures (ETS) continue {{to play an important role}} in the development of models of PVs and as a mechanism to improve correlations between hardware and models. Variations in path delays are increasing with scaling, and are increasingly affected by “neighborhood” interactions. In order to fully characterize within-die variations, delays must be measured in the context of actual core-logic macros. Doing so requires the use of an embedded test structure, as opposed to traditional <b>scribe</b> <b>line</b> test structures such as ring oscillators (RO). Accurate measurements of within-die variations can be used, e. g., to better tune models to actual hardware (model-to-hardware correlations). 	In this research project, I propose an embedded test structure called REBEL (Regional dELay BEhavior) that is designed to measure path delays in a minimally invasive fashion; and its architecture measures the path delays more accurately. Design for manufacture-ability (DFM) analysis is done on the on 90 nm ASIC chips and 28 nm Zynq 7000 series FPGA boards. I present ASIC results on within-die path delay variations in a floating-point unit (FPU) fabricated in IBM’s 90 nm technology, with 5 pipeline stages, used as a test vehicle in chip experiments carried out at nine different temperature/voltage (TV) corners. Also experimental data has been analyzed for path delay variations in short vs long paths. FPGA results on within-die variation and die-to-die variations on Advanced Encryption System (AES) using single pipelined stage are also presented. Other analysis that have been performed on the calibrated path delays are Flip Flop propagation delays for both rising and falling edge (tpHL and tpLH), uncertainty analysis, path distribution analysis, short versus long path variations and mid-length path within-die variation. I also analyze the impact on delay when the chips are subjected to industrial-level temperature and voltage variations. From the experimental results, it has been established that the proposed REBEL provides capabilities similar to an off-chip logic analyzer, i. e., it is able to capture the temporal behavior of the signal over time, including any static and dynamic hazards that may occur on the tested path. The ASIC results further show that path delays are correlated to the launch-capture (LC) interval used to time them. Therefore, calibration as proposed in this work must be carried out in order to obtain an accurate analysis of within-die variations. Results on ASIC chips show that short paths can vary up to 35 % on average, while long paths vary up to 20 % at nominal temperature and voltage. A similar trend occurs for within-die variations of mid-length paths where magnitudes reduced to 20 % and 5 %, respectively. The magnitude of delay variations in both these analyses increase as temperature and voltage are changed to increase performance. The high level of within-die delay variations are undesirable from a design perspective, but they represent a rich source of entropy for applications that make use of “secrets” such as authentication, hardware metering and encryption. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are a class of primitives that leverage within-die-variations as a means of generating random bit strings for these types of applications, including hardware security and trust. 	Zynq FPGAs Die-to-Die and within-die variation study shows that on average there is 5 % of within-Die variation and the range of die-to-Die variation can go upto 3 ns. The die-to-Die variations can be explored in much further detail to study the variations spatial dependance. 	Additionally, I also carried out research in the area data mining to cater for big data by focusing the work on decision tree classification (DTC) to speed-up the classification step in hardware implementation. For this purpose, I devised a pipelined architecture for the implementation of axis parallel binary decision tree classification for meeting up with the requirements of execution time and minimal resource usage in terms of area. The motivation for this work is that analyzing larger data-sets have created abundant opportunities for algorithmic and architectural developments, and data-mining innovations, thus creating a great demand for faster execution of these algorithms, leading towards improving execution time and resource utilization. Decision trees (DT) have since been implemented in software programs. Though, the software implementation of DTC is highly accurate, the execution times and the resource utilization still require improvement to meet the computational demands in the ever growing industry. On the other hand, hardware implementation of DT has not been thoroughly investigated or reported in detail. Therefore, I propose a hardware acceleration of pipelined architecture that incorporates the parallel approach in acquiring the data by having parallel engines working on different partitions of data independently. Also, each engine is processing the data in a pipelined fashion to utilize the resources more efficiently and reduce the time for processing all the data records/tuples. Experimental results show that our proposed hardware acceleration of classification algorithms has increased throughput, by reducing the number of clock cycles required to process the data and generate the results, and it requires minimal resources hence it is area efficient. This architecture also enables algorithms to scale with increasingly large and complex data sets. We developed the DTC algorithm in detail and explored techniques for adapting it to a hardware implementation successfully. This system is 3. 5 times faster than the existing hardware implementation of classification. Electrical EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|The Genesis spacecraft, {{launched}} in 2001, traveled to a Lagrangian point between the Earth and Sun to collect particles from {{the solar wind}} and return them to Earth. However, during {{the return of the}} spacecraft in 2004, the parachute failed to open during descent, and the Genesis spacecraft crashed into the Utah desert. Many of the solar wind collectors were broken into smaller pieces, and the field team rapidly collected the capsule and collector pieces for later assessment. On each of the next few days, the team discovered that various collectors had survived intact, including three of four concentrator targets. Within a month, the team had imaged more than 10, 000 fragments and packed them for transport to the Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office within the ARES Directorate at JSC. Currently, the Genesis samples are curated along with the other extraterrestrial sample collections within ARES. Although they were broken and dirty, the Genesis solar wind collectors still offered the science community the opportunity to better understand our Sun and the solar system as a whole. One of the more highly prized concentrator collectors survived the crash almost completely intact. The Genesis Concentrator was designed to concentrate the solar wind by a factor of at least 20 so that solar oxygen and nitrogen isotopes could be measured. One of these materials was the Diamond-on-Silicon (DoS) concentrator target. Unfortunately, the DoS concentrator broke on impact. Nevertheless, the scientific value of the DoS concentrator target was high. The Genesis Allocation Committee received a request for approximately 1 cm(sup 2) of the DoS specimen taken near {{the focal point of the}} concentrator for the analysis of solar wind nitrogen isotopes. The largest fragment, Genesis sample 60000, was designated for this allocation and needed to be precisely cut. The requirement was to subdivide the designated sample in a manner that prevented contamination of the sample and minimized the risk of losing or breaking the precious requested sample fragment. The Genesis curator determined that the use of laser scribing techniques to "cut" a precise line and subsequently cleave the sample (in a controlled break of the sample along that line) was the best method for accomplishing the sample subdivision. However, there were risks, including excess heating of the sample, that could cause some of the implanted solar wind to be lost via thermal diffusion. Accidentally breaking the sample during the handling and cleaving process was an additional risk. Early in fiscal year 2013, to address this delicate, complicated task, the ARES Directorate assembled its top scientists to develop a cutting plan that would ensure success when applied to the actual concentrator target wafer; i. e., to produce an approximately 1 cm(sup 2) piece from the requested area of the wafer. The team, subsequently referred to as the JSC Genesis Tiger Team, spent months researching and testing parameters and techniques related to scribing, cleaving, transporting, handling, and holding (i. e., mounting) the specimen. The investigation required considerable "thinking outside the box," and many, many trials using nonflight wafer analogs. After all preliminary testing, the following method was adopted as the final cutting plan. It was used in two final end-to-end practice runs before being used on the actual flight target wafer. The wafer was oriented on the laser cutting stage with the 100 and 010 directions of the wafer parallel to the corresponding X and Y directions of the cutting stage. The laser was programed to scribe 31 lines of the appropriate length along the Y stage direction. The programed scribe lines were separated by 5 micron in the X direction. The laser parameters were set as follows: (1) The laser power was 0. 5 watts; (2) each line consisted of 50 passes, with the Z position being advanced 5 micron per pass; and (3) 30 s would elapse before the next line was scribed to allow for wafer cool down from any possible heating via the laser. The ablated material that "stuck" in the "scribe-cut" was removed from the "cut" using an ultrasonic micro-tool. After all the ablated silicon was removed from the wafer, the wafer was repositioned in exactly the same orientation on the laser stage. The laser was focused using the bottom of the wafer channel, and the 31 -line scribing pattern described above was reprogrammed using the Z position of the groove bottom as the starting Z value instead of the top wafer surface, which was used previously. Upon completion of the second set of scribes, the ultrasonic micro-tool was again used to clean out the cut. The wafer was remounted on the stage in exactly the same orientation as before. The laser was again focused on the bottom of the groove. This time, however, the laser was. programed to scribe only one line down the exact center of the channel. The final <b>scribe</b> <b>line</b> consisted of 100 passes with a Z advance of 5 micron per pass and with the laser power set at 0. 5 watts. As mentioned above, the final cutting plan was practiced in two end-to-end trials using non-flight, triangular-shaped silicon wafers similar in size and orientation to the actual DOS 60000 target sample. The actual scribing of the triangular-shaped wafers required scribing two lines and cleaving (i. e. scribe-cleave, then scribe-cleave) to obtain the piece requested for allocation. Early in December 2012, after many months of experiments and practicing and perfecting the techniques and procedures, the team successfully subdivided the Genesis DoS 60000 target sample, one of the most scientifically important samples from the Genesis mission (figure 2). On December 17, 2012, the allocated piece of concentrator target sample was delivered to the requesting principal investigator. The cutting plan developed for the subdivision of this sample will be used as the model for subdividing future requested Genesis flight wafers (appropriately modified for different wafer types) ...|$|E

The fractures occur during Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) absorber co-evaporation, as it is applied in CIGS thin-film module manufacturing and can effectively repair line interruptions of up to about 70 [*]μm. Additionally, we present that a thermal treatment after P 1 laser scribing and before CIGS co-evaporation can repair even interruptions of up to 1 [*]mm. The fractures which are required for insulation are only of approximately 4 [*]μm width which indicates the potential for further reduction of the interconnection width in CIGS modules and therefore improvement of the electrical module efficiency...|$|R
