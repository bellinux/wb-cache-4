The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis, partly because of her gender concerns, but also because she was opposed {{to the kind of}} war in which she found herself involved.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor's {{first major}} written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights. As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> swamped by the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E

5|$|Selena {{signed a}} record deal with EMI {{subsidiary}} SBK Records in November 1993, following her Grammy Award nomination for Live (1993). The {{news of the}} singer's record deal was front-page news in Billboard magazine. In a 1994 meeting, Selena expressed her guilt to Behar; Selena had told interviewers of her upcoming crossover album and told them the recording {{was expected to be}} release soon. At the time, Selena had not recorded a single song for her planned English-language debut. Behar subsequently told Koppelman that Selena and her band would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman to force the crossover album to begin; EMI relented and the recording sessions began. Selena <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> intimidated by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and only a few people had believed she would achieve success in the pop market.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her disappearance, {{according}} to her friends, Carol was feeling depressed. She had talked of tracing her biological parents, as she was adopted. On 17 July 1976, she went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip. However, Carol <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family. Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, {{and that there was no}} sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect.|$|E
25|$|Henin {{announced}} her immediate retirement from professional tennis on 14 May 2008, and requested the WTA {{to remove her}} name from the rankings immediately. Her announcement was a surprise because Henin was still ranked world No. 1 and was considered the favorite for the French Open, where {{she would have been}} the three-time defending champion. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> no sadness about her retirement because she believed it was a release from a game she had focused on for twenty years. She also said that in the future, she would be concentrating on charity and her tennis school.|$|E

Waring elaborated, saying that unlike Cindy and Tony, Darren and Cindy [...] "bring out the worst in each other". She felt that if Cindy was with Darren, Darren [...] "could be {{the love of her}} life", but felt Cindy would be sensible and choose the relationship best for her daughter's welfare.|$|E
500|$|Aki Ross's voice actor, Ming-Na Wen, was {{selected}} for a perceived fit between her personality and Aki's. Ming-Na, who found the role via her publicist, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> like she had given birth with her voice to the character. She gradually accustomed herself {{to the difficulty of}} working without the presence and spontaneity of real actors, and commented that the voice-acting work did not take much time, as she would just go into the studio [...] "once or twice a month for about four months" [...] with no need for make-up and costuming sessions. The workload was so light it did not interfere with her acting commitments in the television series ER.|$|E
500|$|Other Passions {{cast members}} {{had a more}} {{uncertain}} understanding of the character. Tracey Ross, who portrayed Eve Russell, responded negatively to Vincent's involvement in her character's storylines. While discussing the filming of the scenes in which Vincent gives birth to his father's child, Ross <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and could only complete them after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Vincent's manipulation of Eve to incorrectly reattach Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore, ("This {{has got to be}} the worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?"), who cited it as a reason for the show's cancellation. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who played Ivy Winthrop, said she was confused by Vincent's story arcs even though she was a fan of the series' supernatural elements.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the second}} episode were {{generally}} more positive than the pilot. Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode, and the series as a whole, as [...] "vampire mediocrity with a slight hint of potential". He compared the episode to the television series Angel, saying it was [...] "weaker on virtually every front". Jen Creer of TV Squad criticized the writing, but <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that Sophia Myles was doing a [...] "decent job of developing her character and embracing the material". Carl Cortez of iFMagazine.com said this episode improved [...] "leaps and bounds", and was a [...] "step in the right direction". He gave the episode a 'C' rating, saying the direction was [...] "lifeless" [...] and the acting was [...] "stilted". AOL TV placed the show in its list of TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures.|$|E
500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{introduced}} an ongoing storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian {{character in the}} Showtime series The L Word, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> the subplot was an excellent idea: [...] "A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I think everybody {{wanted to be the}} one who got to do it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, [...] "I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?" [...] Delany said she did not know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives.|$|E

[...] She linked to {{a section of the}} May 21, 2010, version of Wikipedia's article on WikiLeaks, which described the WikiLeaks release in March that year of a Department of Defense report on WikiLeaks itself. She added [...] "the one below that is mine too"; the section below in the same article referred to the leak of the Baghdad airstrike ("Collateral Murder") video. Manning <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> isolated and fragile, and was reaching out to someone she hoped might understand.|$|E

500|$|For the album, Cher {{collaborated with}} several musicians {{including}} Stargate, Chicane and previous collaborator Mark Taylor. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> lucky {{for having a}} chance to have [...] "great songs and great producers" [...] for the album. Cher said her favorite song slated for the album was a cover version of [...] "When the Money's Gone", written by Bruce Roberts, stating it was [...] "so perfect" [...] for her. [...] "It's about this person who's , 'If I lose all my money, will you still love me if we have to eat fast food out of a beat up car?'. It's so dance. It's so gay. It's so good", she said. The album cover, photographed by Michael Lavine, was revealed through Cher official website on October 8, 2001. It depicts Cher wearing a [...] "flowing" [...] blond wig in contrast to her all-black, medieval-like outfit. The Dallas Morning News commented that [...] "even with a pensive look on her exquisitely snipped and tucked face, she commands attention".|$|E
500|$|The backless {{evening gown}} that SÃ©vÃ©rine is wearing {{when she first}} meets Bond was created from black satin and {{decorated}} {{with a total of}} 60,000 Swarovski crystals. The crystals were applied to tulle in a tattoo design that was directly inspired by prints from Swarovski's Paris atelier; they appear on the [...] "arms, neckline, back and sides" [...] of the garment. The dress took six months to complete. Temime designed it based on Rita Hayworth's black dress from the 1946 film Gilda. Designer Stephen Webster created the jewelry for the outfit by looking to modern Gothic style for inspiration. Marlohe said that she had an influence on the final design of the dress. It took a long time for her to get into it with help from the film's crew; she was sewn into one part of it. Despite this, she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable in it. Six different versions of the body of the dress were created to accommodate the filming schedule; Marlohe changed twice a day during the production, and had to be sewn back into the dress each time.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Mexican actress Salma Hayek {{was chosen}} {{to play the role}} of Selena in a biopic film {{produced}} by the Quintanilla family and Warner Bros. Hayek turned the role down; she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was [...] "too early" [...] to base a movie on Selena and that it would be emotional because Selena's death was still being covered on U.S. television. Puerto Rican-American actress Jennifer Lopez replaced Hayek, which drew criticism because of Lopez' Puerto-Rican ancestry. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind (1939). Gregory Nava directed the film, which was released on March 21, 1997. After seeing Lopez' performance in it, fans changed their views on her. Selena opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest-grossing film debut that week. With a production budget of $20 million, the film grossed $35 million in the U.S. The film was a commercial and critical success and is often cited by critics as Lopez' breakthrough role. Lopez rose into pop culture, for which the film's success was credited.|$|E

Several pictures of BeyoncÃ© arriving on set were shared on social networks by fans. Williams debuted the clip for [...] "Say Yes" [...] on her appearance at Good Morning America on June 18, 2014. Regarding the filming of the video, she stated, [...] "Sometimes the director or production assistants had to say like, 'OK, girls, bring it back home. Bring it back together because when we were together, we go back to how we were when we were younger, just always laughing and talking about things. It's been a great moment." [...] The video was released on Williams' Vevo account the same day. A behind-the-scenes footage was also released featuring the trio on set and talking about the song and their reunion. In the clip, Williams <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> excited that she had her [...] "sisters" [...] with her spreading a positive message for the world.|$|E
500|$|According to Carey, writing [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{helped her}} get through rough {{emotional}} moments with her label's management, and even {{times when she}} felt overwhelmed by others. During {{the early stages of}} the album, Carey <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> pressured to complete the Rainbow album as quickly as possible, due to the fact that it was the last album under her contract with Columbia. During troubled times for the singer, as well as her divorce from record executive Tommy Mottola, she claimed writing and singing the song helped her get through troubled times and hoped her listeners would get the same message out of it. Carey thought it would become an anthem for fans and listeners who were going through difficult times in their life and could relate to the song. Additionally, during the taping of the Mariah Carey Homecoming Special, Carey told audience members that after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, she felt the song would help family members and friends of the victims during the tragedy, and hoped it would give them strength to get by the tragic event. For that reason, Carey included the song on the album, and campaigned for its radio release in mid-2000.|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal's {{break-out}} {{role was}} in the black comedy, Secretary (2002), a film about two people who embark on a mutually fulfilling BDSM lifestyle. The New York Times critic Stephen Holden noted: [...] "The role of Lee, which Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues with a restrained comic delicacy and sweetness, should make her a star." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Maggie Gyllenhaal, as the self-destructive secretary, is enigmatic and, at moments, sympathetic." [...] The film received generally favorable reviews, and Gyllenhaal's performance earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, her first Golden Globe nomination, and an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Secretary was Gyllenhaal's first film role which featured full frontal nudity. Although impressed with the script, she initially had some qualms about doing the film, which she believed could deliver an anti-feminist message. Yet after carefully discussing the script with the film's director, Steven Shainberg, she agreed to join the project. Although insisting Shainberg did not exploit her, Gyllenhaal has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "scared when filming began" [...] and that [...] "in the wrong hands... even in just slightly less intelligent hands, this movie could say something really weird." [...] Since then, she is guarded about discussing {{her role in the}} film, saying only that [...] "despite myself, sometimes the dynamic that you are exploring in your work spills over into your life." ...|$|E
