40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Service Management and the definitive published version is available at: [URL] – The {{purpose of this paper}} is to create a movement within the <b>service</b> <b>research</b> community that aspires to help the billions of impoverished people across the world achieve better service from each other, from their communities, from corporations, from their governments, and from nongovernmental organizations. The authors believe every human being is worthy of being served properly. To achieve this purpose, understanding and learning from this huge low-income segment of society known as the base of the pyramid (BoP) is essential. There are myths about the BoP that need to be dispelled and there is a fundamental lack of <b>service</b> <b>research</b> on this important problem. Design/methodology/approach – The existence of an extensive BoP literature combined with <b>service</b> <b>research</b> priorities has called attention to drafting <b>research</b> agendas. Human <b>service</b> systems are explored historically and systems theory provides a perspective for understanding and reducing poverty. Transformative <b>service</b> <b>research,</b> <b>service</b> design <b>research,</b> and community action research are presented to illustrate three research approaches that can contribute to understanding and then better serving the needs of the neglected billions of humanity. Findings – First, the authors present a practical and meaningful call to action by making the case for the <b>service</b> <b>research</b> community to contribute to poverty alleviation with the creation of fresh ideas and research agendas. Second, the authors describe the ample opportunity for conducting <b>service</b> <b>research</b> in and with the BoP and thereby expanding service knowledge about the BoP. Third, the authors suggest a number of approaches for service researchers to join this new movement and help improve the well-being of billions of impoverished people. Social implications – Most existing <b>service</b> <b>research</b> comes from highly developed Anglo-Saxon countries and concerns the service problems of customers in affluent societies. Therefore, there is a fundamental lack of <b>service</b> <b>research</b> at the BoP. The social implications are truly global. Poverty is a global service system problem that can be reduced. Effective poverty alleviation solutions in one part of the world can be adapted to other parts of the world. Originality/value – This paper is a new and very original call to action to the <b>service</b> <b>research</b> community. First, with the exception of a few previous manuscripts calling for research on the BoP, this is the first time a collaborative effort has been made to start systematically changing this knowledge gap.

40|$|Objective: In {{mental health}} <b>service</b> <b>research,</b> the {{investigated}} <b>services</b> and care systems {{as well as}} the research methodology should be described in a precise and transparent fashion so that findings can be clearly interpreted and used. Therefore, this study investigates what is reported in German language publications on mental health <b>service</b> <b>research.</b> Method: All original papers on mental health <b>service</b> <b>research,</b> that were published in the Psychiatrische Praxis between 1999 and 2002, were systematically reviewed and, using a structured classification system, subjected to content analysis. In particular, it was assessed what forms of care had been studied and what characteristics of care were reported. Results: 54 % (199) of all original publications reported mental health <b>service</b> <b>research</b> in a wide sense. Of these, 8 % were qualitative studies. 58 % of studies investigated in-patient treatment, 20 % comprehensive care systems, and 4 % services provided by psychiatrists or psychotherapists in private office practice. There were hardly any studies on innovative service models. In 51 % of studies, authors had conducted investigations within their own service or care system. In most articles characteristics of the patient sample were exactly described, whilst precise information on the <b>researched</b> <b>service</b> - such as funding, staffing and organisation - was usually missing. Discussion: There - still - is relatively little <b>research</b> on outpatient <b>services,</b> and mental health <b>service</b> <b>research</b> is not yet appropriately based in the community. Requirements for exact and comprehensive descriptions of the researched services' and care systems are rarely met. In general, the findings suggest that mental health <b>service</b> <b>research</b> in German speaking countries might benefit from studies with researchers who are independent from the investigated service, the evaluation of innovative service models, and - above all - a standardised description of the services and context in research studies...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} {{essential}} in policy and decision-making circles {{to think about}} the economic benefits (in addition to moral and scientific motivations) humans derive from well-functioning ecosystems.

In this paper we provide some simple economic analyses to discuss key concepts involved in formalizing ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>research.</b> These include the distinction between services and benefits, understanding the importance of marginal ecosystem changes, formalizing the idea of a safe minimum standard for ecosystem service provision, and discussing how to capture the public benefits of ecosystem services. We discuss how the integration of economic concepts and ecosystem services can provide policy and decision makers with a fuller spectrum of information for making conservation¿conversion trade-offs. We include the results from a survey of the literature and a questionnaire of researchers regarding how ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>research</b> can be integrated into the policy process.
