40|$|Excessive {{sediment}} {{pressure on}} aquatic habitats is of global concern. A unique dataset, comprising instantaneous measurements of deposited fine sediment in 230 agricultural streams across England and Wales, was analysed {{in relation to}} 20 potential explanatory catchment and channel variables. The most effective explanatory variable {{for the amount of}} deposited sediment was found to be stream power, calculated for bankfull flow and used to index the capacity of the stream to transport sediment. Both stream power and velocity category were highly significant (p<< 0. 001), explaining some 57 % variation in total fine sediment mass. Modelled sediment pressure, predominantly from agriculture, was marginally significant (p< 0. 05) and explained a further 1 % variation. The relationship was slightly stronger for erosional zones, providing 62 % explanation overall. In the case of the deposited surface drape, stream power was again found to be the most effective explanatory variable (p< 0. 001) but velocity category, baseflow index and modelled sediment pressure were all significant (p< 0. 01); each provided an additional 2 % explanation to an overall 50 %. It is suggested that, in general, the study sites were transport-limited and the majority of stream beds were saturated by fine sediment. For sites below saturation, the upper envelope of measured fine sediment mass increased with modelled sediment pressure. The practical implications of these findings are that (i) targets for fine sediment loads need {{to take into account the}} ability of streams to transport/retain fine sediment, and (ii) where agricultural mitigation measures are implemented to reduce delivery of sediment, river management to mobilise/remove fines may also be needed in order to effect an improvement in ecological status in cases where streams are already saturated with fines and unlikely to <b>self-cleanse...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} of Coldstream High Density Suburbs in Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe is increasing and the sewerage system {{shows signs of}} poor performance. The frequency of reported sewerage system blockages in the suburb increased from 43 per month to 65 per month between April 2012 and March 2013. The suburb has also been experiencing water shortages. An increasing population and low water supply versus overflowing sewage is a potential health risk. The main objective {{of this paper was}} to investigate the causes of the sewer system poor performance. This was achieved by assessing the sewer system infrastructure as well as the operation of the system. The impact of the behaviour of residents on the performance of the system was also discussed. The main components of the infrastructure (manholes and sewers) were physically checked for soundness. The operation of the system was assessed by a hydraulic analysis of discharge, depth of flow and velocity of flow in the sewers. Questionnaires were used to investigate the impact of the behaviour of residents on the performance of the sewer system. It was found that 4 % of the components of the sewer system infrastructure were below standard and the collector main sewer was the one mainly affected. 68 % of the sewers along the collector main had velocity of flow below 0. 6 m/s and all the sewers had depth of flow below 50 %. Of the residents interviewed, 90 % dumped solid wastes in the sewers and 43 % did so because they were unaware of the impact. It was concluded that the sewer system failed to meet standard because the sewer system fails to <b>self-cleanse</b> the solid waste dumped by residents in the sewers due to water shortages.

Our approach, called <b>Self-Cleansing</b> Intrusion Tolerance (SCIT), pushes the concept of highavailability computing one step further. In the SCIT approach, a web server is periodically assumed to have &quot;failed, &quot; namely, comprised by undetected intrusion/subversion. Consequently, the server is brought off-line for cleansing and the integrity checking of system files and web contents, while a backup takes over.

To overcome these problems this study investigated a new <b>self-cleansing</b> sewer overflow screening device. The device has a sewer overflow chamber, a rectangular tank and a slotted ogee weir to capture the gross pollutants. To design an efficient screening device a numerical computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was used. A plausibility check of the CFD model was done using a one-dimensional analytical model. Results showed that an inlet parallel to the weir ensured better <b>self-cleansing</b> than an inlet perpendicular to the weir.

40|$|This master thesis {{explores the}} {{performance}} of pressurized sewage systems {{and its effect on}} <b>self-cleansing</b> of distribution pipes. Pressure sewage systems are mostly applied in non-urban areas where these systems connect and distribute wastewater from household to the main sewage pipeline. The biggest concern for these distribution systems is the possible accumulation of sediments in the sewer pipes, although it is a common phenomenon. The main goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that pressurized sewage systems can achieve the <b>self-cleansing</b> process even with velocities that are lower than defined by standards. The test was conducted at Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in Ã…s, Norway.

This project was designed to reproduce the real setting as close as possible from the wastewater tank, which represents wastewater source in this case, to the gravitational sewer as a final recipient.

An economic design minimises maintenance requirements by aiming at <b>self-cleansing</b> pipes. However, providing the necessary slopes for <b>self-cleansing</b> sanitary sewer pipes often is unfeasible in flat regions, resulting in {{an increased risk of}} loss of hydraulic capacity or blocking.

Therefore, several aspects that require consideration when incorporating flushing devices into a sanitary sewer system are discussed. For instance, when flushing sanitary sewers the increase in discharge has to be explicitly considered. A Belgian case study is used to investigate the suitability of the developed methodology.

Designing sewer systems to be <b>self-cleansing</b> is however not always possible due to the prevailing conditions.

In the paper the effect of such devices to remove the settled particles from sewer pipes has been investigated. The research focuses on the hydraulic characteristics of the flushing tank and evaluates eroding capabilities of the generated flush waves utilizing the InfoWorks CS model (Wallingford Software, UK). Emphasis is given to simulation-based assessment of spatially distributed shear stresses throughout the sewer network and the specific effects on in-sewer sediment transport. Appropriate implementation of these flushing devices in various locations of a sewer network and their impact over sediment bed modifications is studied. The sediment characteristics influence the overall effect of flushes in the network.

40|$|The {{troposphere}} is a {{very large}} photochemical reactor, which transforms enormous quantities of trace gases and aerosols. Future increases of anthropogenic and natural emissions and aerosol formation will continue to change the status of the troposphere and the climate. Here the <b>self-cleansing</b> capability of the troposphere plays a decisive role. The tropospheric oxidation is initiated through a series of oxidants, especially, by the hydroxyl radical, OH, but also by ozone, O- 3, and the nitrate radical, NO 3. By their reaction with trace gas molecules, OH radicals are not consumed, but regenerated in catalytic cycles, where the concentration of nitrogen oxides plays c dominant role. This mechanism is general applicable to simple examples of the photochemical reaction system of the troposphere: most reactions of OH radicals with atmospheric trace gas molecules (e. g. methane, anthropogenic or biogenic emitted organic compounds) lead to chain reactions, which regenerate OH radicals. It clarifies that the degradation of trace gas species in a NO-containing atmosphere is irrevocably connected with the production of ozone.
