5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys.

In Quickturn Design Sys., Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp., the Delaware supreme court invalidated a no hand poison pill on grounds that a board of directors lacks authority to adopt such devices. In doing so, the court misinterpreted relevant Delaware law. It's unjustifiably called into question the validity of a host of corporate precominitment strategies. Finally, and perhaps most troublingly, it called into question the central tenet of Delaware corporate law; namely, the plenary authority of the board of directors. This article argues that the Delaware supreme court's decision was wrong both as a doctrinal and a policy matter. There simply is no firebreak between the sorts of board self disablement deemed invalid by Quickturn and the host of other precommitment strategies routinely used by corporate boards of directors. The Delaware supreme court's conclusion that the former are invalid for lack of statutory authority thus threatens to invalidate all of the latter. The article concludes by arguing that the Delaware supreme court should have analyzed the no hand pill under standard fiduciary d 4 ty principles rather than creating a new prophylactic ban on precommitment strategies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} issues {{regarding}} which regime style {{would be appropriate}} for China to adopt in the regulation of takeover defences, given {{that there are two}} distinct takeover regulatory systems in the world – that of the UK, and that of the US. China has already adopted a UK-style shareholder-friendly regulatory system. This thesis considers the reasons why China has chosen a shareholder-friendly takeover regulatory system rather than a US-style director-friendly regulatory system. In addition, combining analysis of the character of China’s market and its legal framework, it discusses whether the current regulatory system is appropriate for China or not. Furthermore, it considers specific features of individual takeover defensive tactics and the possibility of their use being legitimised in China. This thesis is relevant because of the likelihood of the freeing up of the Chinese takeover market in the future; as this happens, there will be more and more takeover activity, taking place in China’s market. Thus it is important to provide adequate legislation for market players. Though China adopted the UK’s shareholder regulatory system many years ago, when it first regulated its takeover market, the shareholding structure in China is totally different to the UK’s, and so it is important to discuss whether this regulatory system is still relevant for China or whether there should be a change to a regulatory system more like that of the US. As China issued the Administrative Measures of Preferred Shares Experimental Units in 2014, and the new leadership in China has continued China’s economic reform over recent years, it i could be said that China’s listed companies have become more attractive to investors and there could be more hostile raiders entering the market. Hence {{there is a need to}} consider whether China’s delegation of decision-making powers to the shareholders regarding defence against hostile raiders is appropriate. It is also important to establish which takeover defence measures might appropriately be legalised and which would be inappropriate for China. Chapter 1 introduces background information about the trend of mergers and acquisitions and hostile takeovers, China’s state-owned enterprises and briefly consider takeover defensive measures. Following this, it discusses shareholding structures, and problems in China’s market in comparison with the UK and US. Chapter 2 outlines both the UK’s and US’s distinctive takeover regulatory systems and evaluates their pros and cons, as well as the reasons why certain regulatory systems are suitable for each market. Chapter 3 explores the differences between China’s ownership structure, market, and legal framework, and those of the UK and US. It also summarises the weaknesses of the Chinese system(s) in seeking to transplant a western-style set of takeover regulations into China’s market. Primarily, these are that (a) China does not provide sufficient legislation relating to takeover defence measures and (b) Chinese market players and legal advisors do not have adequate experience of takeover defence measures. ii Chapter 4 discusses takeover defence measures related to stock trading – share repurchase, the ‘pac-man’ defence, the use of white knights and ESOP. The chapter concludes that the first two tactics may be too risky for target companies such that their adoption should be prohibited in China while the latter two tactics may be helpful and could be widely used by China’s listed companies. Chapter 5 considers takeover defence measures related to management, such as poison pills, <b>shark</b> <b>repellents,</b> the scorched earth policy, dual class recapitalization and three kinds of parachutes. Except for the scorched earth policy, which could be harmful to the long-term interests of target companies, the other tactics may work well in China’s market and help Chinese companies secure controlling power or raise the share premium. Chapter 6 looks into defensive measures relating to litigation, raising anti-trust issues with relevant authorities, inadequate information provision by bidders and other crimes. It summarizes how measures relating to litigation could help delay the hostile takeover process, but could also terminate it, even if the target company is only seeking a greater share premium. This process could also involve government intervention, and its effectiveness cannot be guaranteed. Even if this group of measures are the most frequently used tactics by target companies, this thesis does not recommend it over other options. Chapter 7 analyses and compares the legislative systems of the US and UK and concludes that the UK’s system is better for contemporary China. However, there is iii still the potential for China to legalise certain takeover defensive measures in the future as China’s market is continually being reformed. Chapter 8 concludes the thesis in proposing that China is justified in adopting the UK’s shareholder-friendly regulatory system. This is partly based on consideration of promoting takeover activities, and the existence of China’s SOEs, which may be reasons to prohibit certain defensive measures in China’s market. As the reform of China’s market continues, moderate defensive tactics like the white knight, parachute system and poison pill could work well. However, the decision-making power should remain in the hands of shareholders and the government should provide sufficient supervision over the market whilst following the principle of protecting shareholders’ interests. The importance of the thesis, and its contribution to existing knowledge, is the research for it has found that most other researchers are focused on the mandatory bid rule – adopted from the UK – in China, but that hardly any systematic research is being undertaken into defensive measures. Thus, this thesis fills a gap in the current literature on the takeover regulations area for China. It also discusses most of the major takeover defensive tactics, analysing in which markets certain defensive tactics work, and whether they would be appropriate for China. Newly-released regulations show the intention of Chinese legislators to turn to a more US style – which will make certain takeover defence measures possible in China, such as the poison pill; whether these are suitable for the Chinese market is debatable. In addition, it is found that iv Chinese companies, especially high-tech companies, quite frequently use several defensive measures when they list on the US market, and the function of these tactics in securing control over the target company can be seen. Thus, research into how to regulate those defensive measures and what problems might arise with their use in China is important for regulators, and will make this thesis meaningful in China...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{gustatory}} {{system in}} cartilaginous fishes has received almost no attention despite {{the importance of}} this sense in this vertebrate group of apex predators. Gustation determines the palatability of food prior to ingestion. For the first time, the morphology and distribution of taste buds and denticles in a range of elasmobranchs (selachians and batoids) is examined both during development and in adults. Representatives of the two major orders are analysed including two species from the family Rhinobatidae; Aptychotrema rostrata (Shaw, 1794), Trygonorrhina fasciata (Müller & Henle, 1841), three species from the family Dasyatidae; Dasyatis fluviorum (Ogilby, 1908), Neotrygon kuhlii (Müller & Henle, 1841), Taeniura lymma (Forsskål, 1755), and one species from the family Gymnuridae; Gymnura australis (Ramsay & Ogilby, 1886), which form the batoid clade. Included in the selachians are two species from the family Orectolobidae; Orectolobus maculatus (Bonnaterre, 1778), and Orectolobus ornatus (De Vis, 1883), two species from the family Hemiscylliidae; Chiloscyllium punctatum (Müller & Henle, 1838), Hemiscyllium ocellatum (Bonnaterre, 1788), and two species from the family Carcharhinidae; Carcharhinus melanopterus (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824), and Negaprion acutidens (Rüppell, 1837). Papillae of putative taste buds are located throughout the oropharyngeal epithelium of the six batoid species from three families and the six selachian species from three families. There appears to be two types of taste buds in the selachian oropharyngeal cavity. Those that are located on the oral valves protrude a greater distance above the surrounding epithelium and are comparable in structure and distribution to Type I taste buds of teleost fishes, whereas those papillae located in the oral cavity and pharynx protrude a lesser distance and are comparable to Type II taste buds of teleost fishes. The presence of Type III taste buds (previously identified in teleosts), found within epithelial pores, cannot be unequivocally confirmed although similar structures were identified in G. australis and C. melanopterus. D. fluviorum and N. kuhlii have two distinct size classes of papillae within the oropharyngeal cavity where up to five small papillae (56 - 62 μm in diameter) often surround large papillae (159 - 192 μm in diameter). Microvilli protruding from papillae in the batoid species resemble solitary chemosensory cells, occur in small groups all over the papilla surface and cover 0. 7 - 1. 6 % of the papilla surface area. Microvilli of the selachian papillae also protrude in multiple groups but from a more localised area on the apical tip of the papilla and cover 0. 4 - 1. 6 % of the papilla surface area. Papillae diameters range from approximately 150 μm in N. acutidens (TL 1, 209 mm) to 360 μm in O. maculatus (TL 1, 172 mm). Papillae size does not correlate with the total length of the animal i. e. larger specimens do not necessarily have larger papillae. Ontogenetic studies with C. punctatum, however, revealed that taste papillae increase in diameter as the animal grows, i. e. 72 ± 1 μm in embryos to 310 ± 7 μm in mature individuals. Putative taste papillae appear to concentrate in areas of food mastication. In selachians the highest concentrations are on the oral valves and anterior regions of the oral cavity, which suggests the biting and manipulation of prey with the jaws is also important for taste assessment. In batoids, papillae are concentrated on ridges within the oropharyngeal cavities and, in some species, also occur on the oral valves. Elasmobranchs appear to have relatively low densities of taste buds when compared with teleost fishes, which may have 800 + taste buds per cm 2. The lowest density recorded in this study was 4 taste buds per cm 2 in the oral cavity of O. maculatus, whereas the greatest density recorded was 159 taste buds per cm 2 in the pharynx of T. fasciata. It is suggested that the low densities recorded may be a result of the large size many of these species attain, as ontogenetic studies with C. punctatum revealed papillae densities are highest in embryos, with 420 - 941 taste buds per cm 2, compared to mature adults, with 8 - 29 taste buds per cm 2. Total numbers of papillae range from ~ 1, 350 - 2, 000 in benthic selachians to as high as ~ 9, 250 - 11, 900 in pelagic species. Ontogenetic studies on C. punctatum identified that the number or papillae remains constant throughout all stages of development, with ~ 1, 900 papillae present in embryos, hatchlings, immature and mature adults. Possessing more papillae, however, does not necessarily equate to a greater gustatory sensitivity as the percentage area of the oropharyngeal cavity covered by the papillae was lowest in N. acutidens (0. 900 %), which has the highest total number of papillae (11, 890 papillae). Previous studies on the denticles (placoid scales) in the external epidermis of elasmobranchs is abundant and their form {{has been used as a}} technical model to prevent hydrodynamic drag, which has been implemented in various ways including athletic swimwear (Speedo Fastskin®). The function of denticles within the oropharyngeal cavity of elasmobranchs, however, is still being debated. Of the batoids analysed, no denticles are found in the Gymnuridae or Dasyatidae families, however they are present in the Rhinobatidae. Oral denticles are present in all the selachians analysed, except in the Orectolobidae. In C. punctatum, they appear to first break through the epithelium in the anterior central region of the dorsal oral cavity around the time of hatching. The denticles of the carcharhinids have a grooved surface and a central spine, which is angled towards the posterior of the mouth. This structure is beneficial to reduce hydrodynamic drag which would be advantageous to these free swimming species that use ram ventilation. T. fasciata also has denticles with a ridged crown. Sometimes these ridges form circles around taste papillae and may therefore direct water flow over these organs as the animal swims, possibly helping to locate a food source. Alternatively, H. ocellatum and C. punctatum have broad bulbous denticles that often overlap. These denticles would provide a hard surface to protect the epithelium from abrasion during the consumption of hard bodied prey items. The number and distribution of oral denticles appears to compromise that of the taste papillae. For example, A. rostrata has no denticles over the gill arches, where there are numerous taste papillae. This thesis contains the first comparative analyses of elasmobranch taste bud morphology in which there seem to be many consistencies among species, at least externally. Some morphological features described suggest that elasmobranch taste buds may be an intermediate form between Schneider organs and teleost taste buds. The gustatory system is not easy to research, however elasmobranchs form the earliest group of jawed fishes and can help us to understand the evolution of this important sensory system. Research into the electrophysiology of elasmobranch taste, taste preferences would also help us to understand these apex predators and their behaviour and this knowledge could be further utilised when producing <b>shark</b> <b>repellents</b> to not only protect humans but also to protect fishing gear and other industrial apparatus within the oceans. There is still much to learn about the elasmobranch gustatory system. Unfortunately, difficulties may arise due to the apparent scarcity of these organs. The discovery of a genetic probe or immunohistochemical label for taste cells could help elucidate this inconsistency and clarify whether the taste cells are apoptotic or rare...|$|R
