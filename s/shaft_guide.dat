40|$|Mine {{hoisting}} is {{the most}} critical and potentially the most dangerous operation in underground mining. Many hazards are related to falls of miners and materials, ground instability, and malfunction or lack of safety devices. All {{have the potential to}} cause a catastrophic accident. A condition know as 'slack rope' is particularly dangerous, especially if it occurs without the operator's awareness. The most common occurrence of slack rope is in metal or nonmetal mines that have a history of ground control problems near the shaft. Studies of hoist safety features and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) accident statistics suggests a need to measure wire rope tension, conveyance speed and position, and <b>shaft</b> <b>guide</b> misalignment. The most accurate data are obtained directly from the conveyance. Such data could warn of potentially dangerous situations during hoisting operations, as well as during inspections, maintenance, and lowering of large equipment.

40|$|Steel {{structures}} for a conveyance guiding system {{are subjected to}} prolonged, intense corrosion during their operation leading to a considerable loss of material and structure capacity reduction. <b>Shaft</b> <b>guides</b> are made of closed profiles welded from hot-rolled channel sections. These profiles are categorized as class 1 cross-sections according to Eurocode 3, {{which means that they}} are resistant to local instability upon bending [1]. With an increase in the corrosion loss of the guides, the inertia moment of the cross-section is reduced. The resistance of profiles to local buckling is also reduced. However, calculations for local stability in guides upon bending are not required by the local Polish regulations on the operation of conveyance in shafts [2]. The question is whether this constitutes a shortcoming and risk for safe operation. Calculations according to steel construction standards [1] supported by numerical simulation were used to evaluate <b>shaft</b> steelwork <b>guides</b> resistance to buckling and their sensitivity to corrosion loss.

The incident trapping the miners occurred in the service shaft when a 15 meter section of compressed air pipe burst {{and fell to the}} shaft bottom, in the process damaging steel <b>shaft</b> <b>guides,</b> and electrical lines which cut off power to the hoist on the service cage. Because the service shaft became inoperable, miners were brought up using the production shaft, after changing out the skips for a cage. [...] The cages in the service shaft are of a 3 deck configuration with a capacity of about 150 personnel, and are capable of operating at speeds of 50 km per hour. The service cage {{would not be able to}} fit into the hoisting compartments in the production shaft due to different shaft sizes, and different compartment configurations. Due to this fact a smaller cage with a slower hoisting speed was used in the skip compartments. As a result evacution of the trapped miners took longer than had the miners been able to use the service shaft as an egress. Eventually all the miners were rescued unharmed from the mine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is good {{calibration}} {{practice to}} test thermocouples for homogeneity of the Seeback’s coefficient during calibration process. If change in homogeneity the coefficient, {{commonly known as}} inhomogeneity is not detected, thermometer although calibrated {{might not be able}} to measure temperature correctly. Several different testing techniques are developed, depending on type of the thermocouple and the equipment available. In order to automate process of thermocouple inhomogeneity testing for all applicable testing methods a Thermocouple Inhomogeneity Testing Device was developed in Laboratory for Process Measurement (LPM), University of Zagreb. The device is mostly used for the testing of thermocouple inhomogeneity in conjunction with heater moving along the thermocouple. The sled for mounting of the heater or the thermometer is translated by a threaded shaft and a step motor in horizontal axis, vertical axis or its sliding direction can be tilted in six steps between those two positions. Sled is mounted on <b>shafts</b> <b>guides</b> with precision linear ball bearing, which allow for smooth translation.

40|$|Background and Aims The {{flexible}} endoscope {{is used as}} a platform for minimally invasive interventions. However, control of the conventional endoscope and multiple instruments is difficult. Robotic assistance could provide a solution and better control for a single operator. A novel platform should also enable interventions in areas that are currently difficult to reach. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a robotic platform that guides a conventional endoscope through the large bowel. Methods In this feasibility study, adult patients scheduled for routine diagnostic colonoscopy were included. The endoscope was introduced using a robotic add-on to provide tip bending and air/water actuation. The endoscopist directly controlled the scope shaft. Upon cecal intubation, the add-on was detached and the procedure continued using conventional control. Primary evaluation parameters were the number of serious adverse events and the percentage of successful cecal intubations. Results The procedure was performed in 22 consecutive patients who all gave informed consent. There were no serious adverse events. Cecal intubation was successful in 15 patients (68 %) using the robotic add-on. Six cases were completed after conversion to conventional control: 3 cases were converted to pass sharp angulation in the flexures and 3 cases were converted after technical difficulties. One case was not successful with either technique due to severe diverticulosis. Conclusions The robotic add-on steering module allows safe endoscope intubation to reach intervention sites throughout the large bowel.

40|$|The firm {{adhesion}} of flavouring particles onto crisp surfaces during {{coating processes}} {{is a major}} concern in the snack production industry.

40|$|Flexible {{endoscopes}} (long, slender, flexible instruments with {{a camera}} and light at the distal end, having working channels to introduce flexible instruments) are used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions inside the human digestive system and inside the abdomen. Though used for their flexibility, the flexibility of these instruments causes several difficulties during insertion and use. During insertion, flexible endoscopes can buckle and loop, which may hamper full insertion into the patient’s body. During therapeutic interventions, the flexible endoscope fails to provide stability for surgical instruments that are introduced through the flexible endoscope. In this thesis, firstly, the fundamental mechanical causes of the difficulties that accompany the use of flexible endoscopes are analysed. Next, an extensive, categorizing review explores the available and potentially suitable solutions to causes of the flexibility-induced difficulties in flexible endoscopy. The review suggests that passive guiding of the flexible endoscope <b>shaft</b> using <b>guides</b> with rigidity control is the most feasible solution. Three potentially suitable rigidity control concepts are selected and further investigated to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the maximally achievable flexural rigidity of these rigidity control mechanisms. The first investigated rigidity control mechanism (“Vacu-SL” mechanism) utilizes the flexural rigidity increase that is achieved by vacuuming foil tubes filled with small particles. The thesis proceeds with experiments {{on the influence of}} particle hardness, size, and shape on the flexural rigidity of vacuumed foil tubes filled with these particles. The experiments showed that the flexural rigidity increases with the hardness and irregularity of the particles and that there may be an optimal particle size in the low particle diameter region. Next, a mechanism using friction between a rubber tube, stainless steel cables, and a stainless steel spring (“FORGUIDE mechanism”) is presented, as well as a mathematical model predicting the maximally achievable flexural rigidity of that mechanism. The results of that chapter suggest that there is great potential for improvement of the FORGUIDE mechanism and that this mechanism may very well provide sufficient support for flexible endoscopes. A chapter on the static friction between several kinds of rubber and several types of stainless steel cables aids to advise on how the flexural rigidity of the friction-based FORGUIDE mechanism can be increased by properly choosing the materials of the tube, cables, and spring. The third rigidity control mechanism (“PlastoLock” mechanism) changes rigidity by heating and cooling a lactide-based polymer through its glass-transition. A feasibility study shows the great potential of this concept in terms of achievable flexural rigidity, miniaturization, and simplicity. Finally, the thesis presents a force analysis and a number of functional design considerations that should guide the further design {{of a new generation of}} flexible endoscopes with passively <b>guided</b> <b>shafts.</b> The discussion of the thesis advises on what rigidity control mechanisms are most likely to provide a proper solution for what application areas, and on what steps should be taken next to finally obtain a good solution to the current flexibility-induced difficulties in flexible endoscopy. It is concluded that the FORGUIDE mechanism and the PlastoLock mechanism are most suitable for application in flexible endoscopes for the gastrointestinal tract. These mechanisms are simple, provide high flexural rigidity (especially when considering their size), and may be applied in a very broad range of applications. Many improvements in existing applications and a broadening of the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in gastrointestinal health care may be achieved by further developing the investigated rigidity control mechanisms into fully functional guided instruments.

Death, which had in our younger days walked the earth like [...] "a thief that comes in the night," [...] now, rising from his {{subterranean}} vault, girt with power, with dark banner floating, came a conqueror. Many saw, seated above his vice-regal throne, a supreme Providence, who directed his <b>shafts,</b> and <b>guided</b> his progress, and they bowed their heads in resignation, {{or at least in}} obedience. Others perceived only a passing casualty; they endeavoured to exchange terror for heedlessness, and plunged into licentiousness, to avoid the agonizing throes of worst apprehension. Thus, while the wise, the good, and the prudent were occupied by the labours of benevolence, the truce of winter produced other effects among the young, the thoughtless, and the vicious. During the colder months there was a general rush to London in search of amusement--the ties of public opinion were loosened; many were rich, heretofore poor--many had lost father and mother, the guardians of their morals, their mentors and restraints. It would have been useless to have opposed these impulses by barriers, which would only have driven those actuated by them to more pernicious indulgencies. The theatres were open and thronged; dance and midnight festival were frequented--in many of these decorum was violated, and the evils, which hitherto adhered to an advanced state of civilization, were doubled. The student left his books, the artist his study: the occupations of life were gone, but the amusements remained; enjoyment might be protracted to the verge of the grave. All factitious colouring disappeared--death rose like night, and, protected by its murky shadows the blush of modesty, the reserve of pride, the decorum of prudery were frequently thrown aside as useless veils. This was not universal. Among better natures, anguish and dread, the fear of eternal separation, and the awful wonder produced by unprecedented calamity, drew closer the ties of kindred and friendship. Philosophers opposed their principles, as barriers to the inundation of profligacy or despair, and the only ramparts to protect the invaded territory of human life; the religious, hoping now for their reward, clung fast to their creeds, as the rafts and planks which over the tempest-vexed sea of suffering, would bear them in safety to the harbour of the Unknown Continent. The loving heart, obliged to contract its view, bestowed its overflow of affection in triple portion on the few that remained. Yet, even among these, the present, as an unalienable possession, became all of time to which they dared commit the precious freight of their hopes.|$|R
40|$|Preparation of long bones {{such as the}} femur or tibia for {{placement}} of intramedullary devices {{for the treatment of}} fractures usually involves reaming with a series of central cutters driven by a drill-like device with a flexible <b>shaft</b> over a <b>guide</b> wire. The reamers sequentially enlarge the intramedullary canal into a tunnel of circular cross-section and a diameter appropriate for the procedure. The current technology is concentric, meaning that the system is self-centering within the original intramedullary canal and the expansion is symmetric with respect to the original centerline. A novel system for laterally deflecting the head of a 12 mm Stryker Bixcut reaming system has been designed in order to test the proof of concept for eccentrically reaming the intramedullary canal of a long bone. Reaming often precedes intramedullary nail placement following a long bone fracture or to induce ankle arthrodesis. Long bones do not always contain a regularly shaped intramedullary canal, thus creating a risk in navigating a reamer through the bone. Pockets of infected tissue and malformed fractures may also create obstacles for advancing a reamer through the canal. The newly developed reaming system is intended to allow the surgeon to be more selective in where the reamer head cuts while shaping the inner wall of the intramedullary canal to avoid or target certain areas of the canal. Development of the directional reaming system included two prototypes with three sets of experiments to quantify the success of the designs. The first experiment resulted in a prototype unable to achieve the specified 3 mm of lateral cutting depth. The second experiment also failed to achieve the 3 mm of lateral cutting depth, but did yield a proof of concept driving the design of the third iteration.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{water-bearing}} {{soft rock}} strata of West China, a field measurement {{is carried out}} on the shaft lining in bedrock section. The shaft lining is built with freezing method. From the measurement, some changes of regularity in construction, thawing and post thawing period are obtained, including the temperature, freezing pressure and the vertical and hoop strain of the shaft lining. Measurement studies have shown that: during the plastic stage of shaft construction period, {{with the release of}} hydration heat, the thermal expansion occurs in the concrete and the strain gauge, leading to tensile strain. In the earlier stage, the elastic modulus and strength of concrete increases rapidly. When the shaft lining temperature reaches its maximum, the cooling and growth in the freezing pressure make the hoop strain increase sharply. However, the hoop strain is at lower tensile or compressive value. In the early stage and mature stage, the strain change is mainly affected by temperature. In the thawing and post thawing period, the concrete strain is also primarily influenced by temperature change. During the measurement, when the maximum compressive strain is less than ultimate value, the shaft lining is in a safe state. To ensure the security of the shaft lining, the concrete strength growth and sidewall temperature should be controlled in the similar shaft condition. In addition, the reinforcement ratio should not be too small for the shaft lining in frozen bedrock. And further, the fiber reinforced concrete, shrinkage-compensating concrete and low hydration heat concrete technology can also be adopted to reduce the cracks as much as possible and to avoid penetrating cracks. For the soft aquifers in West China, the further field measurement is still needed to obtain the stress and deformation regularities of the shaft lining, which can not only provide a basis for security assessment of the <b>shaft,</b> but also <b>guide</b> its design and optimization to improve the design theory...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} a high-pressure-ratio, low-flow turbogenerator with 50 W electrical power output, designed to operate from a 5 -bar air supply. The research shows that a MEMS-based silicon turbine in combination with a micro-machined generator can meet the design objectives of the turbogenerator. The turbogenerator architecture comprises a single-stage radial inflow turbine and a direct coupled cylindrical permanent-magnet synchronous generator. To address its key design trade-offs and fundamental engineering challenges, the design space is first explored in terms of the key design variables: device diameter and rotor <b>shaft</b> speed. To <b>guide</b> the selection of the two variables, a simplified model for the scaling of turbine and generator power is developed. Next, the integrated turbine and generator design is analyzed and designed in detail. The minimum manufacturable turbine blade span is identified as the key challenge imposed by the low flow requirement. Furthermore, the small scale of the blades results in high rotational speeds. Since the turbine and generator are integrated, the high speed makes the generator design challenging because of manufacturing tolerances, material stress limitations and losses. Thus, the design trade-off is between generator complexity and turbine blade manufacturability. The analysis shows that the viable low-flow 50 W turbogenerator design space is narrowly constrained by the minimum blade span and the 5 -bar pressure supply, demanding MEMS fabrication for the short turbine blades. A single-stage MEMS radial turbine is designed in detail, and assessed for performance and manufacturability. The rotor speed at design conditions is 450, 000 rpm with a rotor radius of 5 mm, a rotor blade span of 200 um, and a blade tip clearance of 20 um. (cont.) Based on 3 D RANS simulations, the turbine is predicted to achieve 48 % total-to-static adiabatic efficiency and to produce 77 W of shaft power at a turbine mass flow of 1. 45 g/s. Assuming a generator efficiency of 80 % and a power electronics efficiency of 90 % yields a net electrical turbogenerator power output of 50 W. End-wall losses are dominant in the planar turbine and a diffuser is included to reduce the pressure losses in the right exit turn. The final high-speed, low flow design integrates a MEMS turbine and a meso-scale permanent-magnet synchronous generator combined with hybrid ball bearings. by Stevan Jovanovic. Thesis (S. M.)

6000|$|You {{leave your}} vehicle {{at one of}} the inns, which are very decent and tidy, and in which every one is very civil, as if in this latter respect the {{influence}} of the old regime pervaded the neighborhood, and you walk across the grass and the gravel to a small door, - a door infinitely subordinate and conferring no title of any kind on those who enter it. Here you ring a bell, which a highly respectable person answers (a per- son perceptibly affiliated, again, to the old regime), after which she ushers you across a vestibule into an inner court. Perhaps the strongest impression I got at Chambord came to me as I stood in this court. The woman who admitted me did not come with me; I was to find my guide somewhere else. The specialty of Chambord is its prodigious round towers. There are, I believe, no less than eight of them, placed at each angle of the inner and outer square of buildings; for the castle {{is in the form of}} a larger structure which encloses a smaller one. One of these towers stood before me in the court; it seemed to fling its shadow over the place; while above, as I looked up, the pinnacles and gables, the enormous chimneys, soared into the bright blue air. The place was empty and silent; shadows of gargoyles, of extra- ordinary projections, were thrown across the clear gray surfaces. One felt that the whole thing was monstrous. A cicerone appeared, a languid young man in a rather shabby livery, and led me about with a mixture of the impatient and the desultory, of con- descension and humility. I do not profess to under- stand the plan of Chambord, and I may add that I do not even desire to do so; for it is much more entertaining to think of it, as you can so easily, as an irresponsible, insoluble labyrinth. Within, it is a wilderness of empty chambers, a royal and romantic barrack. The exiled prince to whom it gives its title has not the means to keep up four hundred rooms; he contents himself with preserving the huge outside. The repairs of the prodigious roof alone must absorb a large part of his revenue.

40|$|BACKGROUND A mine shaft is the {{lifeline}} to underground mines. Mine operators {{depend on}} safe, uninterrupted, and efficient {{movement of workers}} and materials. The shaft and hoisting system provides access to the network of openings used to recover the underground resource, provides vertical transport of miners and materials, and serves as an escapeway {{in case of an}} emergency. Accidents involving hoisting can be catastrophic. Such was the case in 1973 at the Markham Colliery in Derbyshire, UK when the conveyance overwound and fell to the shaft bottom, resulting in 17 deaths. Hoist and elevator machinery must meet the requirements specified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 57 and 75. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data, many shaft-related accidents in the United States are associated with the hoisting cycle. MSHA statistics show that there were about 1500 shaft- related accidents in the 5 -year period between 1992 - 1996. Most of these accidents resulted from the action, motion, or failure of the hoisting equipment or mechanism and involved movement of the conveyance which includes cages, skips, ore buckets, and elevators. A hoisting hazard may be characterized as an "unsafe hoist operating condition caused by insufficient or inaccurate information available to the hoist operator" (authors' quote). Earlier investigators have defined safety features and operating and maintenance standards for hoists, and reported on monitoring and control systems and sensors for hoists and conveyances [Farley, 1983; Ward, 19931. However, despite the considerable technological progress and hoisting control improvements in recent years, safety- related issues that require further investigation still remain. The hoist operator must constantly be aware of two important hoist-operating conditions: the position of the conveyance and the tension in the hoist rope. If this information is not available or is inaccurate, the hoist becomes unsafe. Current technology provides this information indirectly from sensors and indicators in the hoist room. However, unlike a building elevator hoistway, mine shaft hoistway problems often include: 1. poor ground conditions and excessive <b>shaft</b> wall and <b>guide</b> displacement; 2. rock bursts in deep mines (resulting in large rock movements and fragments blocking the hoist way); 3. water, ice, and salt buildup (impeding the smooth flow of the conveyance); 4. severe vibration from hoisting (resulting in loose guide support brackets, broken welds, or other alignment and conveyance mechanism malfunctions). The second issue relates to dynamic rope loads applied during normal winding, particularly during loading, acceleration, and stopping. Safety factors on wire rope are based on static load. They are artificially high to account for all cases of dynamic loads, even though the total load history on the rope (static and dynamic) during service is unknown. Therefore the tension, and thus the compliance with wire rope load safety factors, is unknown to the hoistman...|$|R
40|$|A formação profissional em saúde tem se tornado palco frequente de discussões devido à urgente necessidade de se repensar o modelo de ensino na saúde, historicamente pautado pelo modelo biomédico, e nesse contexto, a fisioterapia se destaca por ter sua gênese e desenvolvimento profissional voltados para a reabilitação. A fim de reformular as práticas destes profissionais e considerando o papel {{fundamental}} do Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) na ordenação de recursos humanos na área da saúde, as Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais orientaram mudanças para reorganização dos currículos destes profissionais com ênfase na integralidade da atenção. Este trabalho se constitui de um estudo misto, cujo objetivo é o de identificar no processo formativo da graduação em Fisioterapia a existência de componentes que conduzem à integralidade da assistência à saúde. Participaram do estudo discentes do curso de fisioterapia de três Instituições de Ensino Superior do Distrito Federal (DF) e fisioterapeutas da Secretaria de Estado de Saúde do DF (SES-DF). Os dados foram coletados em quatro etapas. Na primeira etapa, realizou-se levantamento da distribuição dos postos de trabalho ocupados por fisioterapeutas inseridos na rede pública de saúde do DF; na segunda, análise documental dos Projetos Pedagógicos de Curso (PPC) das três IES participantes; na terceira, aplicou-se a técnica de grupos focais com discentes de fisioterapia (32 no total) em cada IES; na quarta, houve a realização de entrevista semi-estruturada com sete fisioterapeutas da SES-DF. Cabe ressaltar que o princípio da integralidade assim como o modelo biomédico norteou a discussão deste trabalho. Observou-se que há predominância na ocupação de postos de trabalho por fisioterapeutas em serviços de média e alta complexidade e que, apesar de os PPC apresentarem grande parte de seus conteúdos em conformidade com as Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais da Fisioterapia (DCNF), a integralidade não se destaca como eixo orientador, a atenção básica ainda é subutilizada e a metodologia de ensino aprendizagem permanece baseada no modelo tradicional. Observou-se também a superficialidade do discurso dos discentes no que diz respeito à integralidade, e à atenção básica como campo possível de prática para a fisioterapia. Estes dados coadunam com os obtidos nas entrevistas com os fisioterapeutas, onde foi possível perceber a deficiência na formação para o SUS e principalmente para a atuação na atenção básica, sendo necessária a formação em serviço para apropriação do tema integralidade. Conclui-se que as lacunas deixadas pela formação tradicional recebida pelos fisioterapeutas entrevistados não foram preenchidas pela formação fornecida aos estudantes de hoje, o que nos leva a crer que o ensino em fisioterapia continua sob forte influencia do modelo biomédico e que, apesar das orientações das DCNF, as mudanças no ensino ainda não foram alcançadas.

In order to reformulate the practices of these professionals and considering the key role of the Unified Health System (SUS) in ordination of human resources {{in the area of}} health, the National Curricular Guidelines guided changes for reorganization of the curricula of these professionals with emphasis on completeness of attention. This work is a joint study, whose goal is to identify in the formative process of graduation in Physical Therapy the existence of components that lead to the integrality of health assistance. Students participated {{in the study of the}} physiotherapy course of three institutions of Higher Education of the Federal District (DF) and physiotherapists from the Secretary of State for Health of the DF (SES-DF). The data were collected in four steps. In the first step, a survey was conducted of the distribution of jobs occupied by physiotherapists inserted in the public health network of the DF; in the second, documentary analysis of the Pedagogical Projects of Curse (PPC) of the three participating IHEs. In the third, was applied the technique of focus groups with students of physiotherapy (32 in total) in each HEI; In the fourth, there was the realization of semi-structured interviews with seven physiotherapists of SES-DF. It is worth noting that the principle of completeness as well as the biomedical model guided the discussion of this work. It was observed that there is a predominance in occupation of jobs by physiotherapists in medium and high complexity services and that, in spite of the PPC submit great part of its content in accordance with the National Curricular Guidelines of Physiotherapy (NFCD), the integrality stands out not as <b>guiding</b> <b>shaft,</b> the basic attention is still underutilized and the teaching-learning methodology remains based on traditional model. It was also observed the superficiality of the discourse of the learners on the completeness, and the basic attention as possible field of practice for physical therapy. These data are consistent with those obtained in the interviews with the physiotherapists, where it was possible to realize the deficiency in training for the SUS and mainly for actuation in basic care, being required in-service training for ownership of the topic completeness. It is concluded that the gaps left by traditional training received by physiotherapists interviewed were not fulfilled by training provided to students of today. This leads us to believe that the education in physiotherapy continues under the strong influence of the biomedical model and that, despite the guidance of NFCD, the changes in education has still not been achieved...|$|R
