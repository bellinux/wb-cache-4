2500|$|As Democratic debates {{took place}} during the summer, Obama {{received}} at best mixed notices for his efforts. Democratic strategist Bob Shrum said, [...] "He slips into this tendency, which he probably learned as president of the Harvard Law Review, to overstate his premises before he states his position. In politics, you do the opposite of what you do in the Law Review—you <b>state</b> <b>your</b> position, then say your premises—if you ever get to them." [...] Commentator Eleanor Clift said that, [...] "Obama is almost too cerebral for the sound-bite world of modern politics, but that's part of his appeal." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with one message addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You <b>state</b> <b>your</b> intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber...I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and leave you with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons".|$|E
