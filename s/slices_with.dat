60|$|They then bade the man good-by, and {{he resumed}} his journey. Forester and Marco {{went back to}} the hut, where they had a most {{excellent}} dinner. They built a fire, and roasted the apples and toasted the bread. They cut it into <b>slices</b> <b>with</b> Marco's knife. They made wooden spoons for the honey out of pieces of pine, which answered very well indeed. Marco said it was the very best dinner he ever ate in his life.|$|E
60|$|A {{simpler and}} less ambitious sort of cook-shop abounds {{in the region}} of Rialto, where on market mornings I have seen it driving a prodigious {{business}} with peasants, gondoliers, and laborers. Its more limited resources consist chiefly of fried eels, fish, polenta, and sguassetto. The latter is a true roba veneziana, and is a loud-flavored broth, made of those desperate scraps of meat which are found impracticable even by the sausage-makers. Another, but more delicate dish, peculiar to the place, is the clotted blood of poultry, fried in <b>slices</b> <b>with</b> onions. A great number of the families of the poor breakfast at these shops very abundantly, for three soldi each person.|$|E

60|$|Then Frank and Jake {{thought they}} had better be going home, but Dave's mother would not let them start without {{something}} to eat; and she cut them each a slice of bread the whole width and length of the loaf, and spread the <b>slices</b> <b>with</b> butter, and then apple-butter, and then brown sugar. The boys thought they were not hungry, but when they began to eat {{they found out that}} they were, and before they knew it they had eaten the slices all up. Dave's mother said they must come and see Dave again some time, and she acted real clever; she was an American, anyway.|$|E
60|$|The {{sensation}} of unappeasable hunger, not unknown after {{the strain of}} a hazardous enterprise to adventurers of tougher fibre than Mr Verloc, overcame him again. The piece of roast beef, {{laid out in the}} likeness of funereal baked meats for Stevie’s obsequies, offered itself largely to his notice. And Mr Verloc again partook. He partook ravenously, without restraint and decency, cutting thick <b>slices</b> <b>with</b> the sharp carving knife, and swallowing them without bread. In the course of that refection it occurred to Mr Verloc that he was not hearing his wife move about the bedroom as he should have done. The thought of finding her perhaps sitting on the bed in the dark not only cut Mr Verloc’s appetite, but also took from him the inclination to follow her upstairs just yet. Laying down the carving knife, Mr Verloc listened with careworn attention.|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as the}} boy hailed, {{the captain}} {{led the way to}} the hatchway. They descended a short ladder into the fo'castle, which was low, but roomy. Supper {{consisted}} of boiled skate--a fish Cyril had never tasted before--oaten bread, and beer. His mouth was still sore, but he managed to make a hearty meal of fish, though he could not manage the hard bread. One of the men was engaged at the helm, but the other two shared the meal, all being seated on lockers that ran round the cabin. The fish were placed on an earthenware dish, each man cutting off <b>slices</b> <b>with</b> his jack-knife, and using his bread as a platter. Little was said while the meal went on; but when they went on deck again, the skipper, having put another man at the tiller, while the man released went forward to get his supper, said,-- ...|$|E

6000|$|Accordingly, as the {{sun went}} down, the little party came to a halt, made a large fire, spitted their buffalo meat on wooden sticks, and, when {{sufficiently}} roasted, planted the savory viands before them; cutting off huge <b>slices</b> <b>with</b> their hunting knives, and supping with a hunter's appetite. The light of their fire would not fail, as they knew, {{to attract the attention}} of any Indian horde in the neighborhood; but they trusted to be off and away, before any prowlers could reach the place. While they were supping thus hastily, however, one of their party suddenly started up and shouted [...] "Indians!" [...] All were instantly on their feet, with their rifles in their hands; but could see no enemy. The man, however, declared that he had seen an Indian advancing, cautiously, along the trail which they had made in coming to the encampment; who, the moment he was perceived, had thrown himself on the ground, and disappeared. He urged Captain Bonneville instantly to decamp. The captain, however, took the matter more coolly. The single fact, that the Indian had endeavored to hide himself, convinced him that he was not one of a party, on the advance to make an attack. He was, probably, some scout, who had followed up their trail, until he came in sight of their fire. He would, in such case, return, and report what he had seen to his companions. These, supposing the white men had encamped for the night, would keep aloof until very late, when all should be asleep. They would, then, according to Indian tactics, make their stealthy approaches, and place themselves in ambush around, preparatory to their attack, at the usual hour of daylight.|$|E
