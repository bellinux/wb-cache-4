40|$|A low-clay {{version of}} fine {{translucent}} china {{was designed to}} have desired properties and acceptable behaviour during manufacture. Low-clay contents of 10 to ISw/o were employed to reduce the deterious effects of preferential clay particle alignment and its adverse effect on colour. For example, alignment of clay particles in cast wares causes anisotropic drying and firing shrinkages and these cause distortion. Replacing clay with a pre fired body with low Fe and Ti contents, as in the present case, allowed a very white material to be produced. The prefired body was made with calcium carbonate, aluminium trihydroxide, quartz and a small fluxing addition of an hydrated magnesIUm carbonate. Desification of a whiteware is enhanced by increasing volume fraction of the viscous liquid and reducing by its viscosity. Both of these also enhance sagging. Consequently, compositional change cannot on its own lead to the favourable combination of high density, required to give translucency, with little sagging, that will allow wares to be fired without significant distortion. It was found by trail and error that use of finer particles reduced the sagging occurring in the densification heat treatment and enhanced densification. This finding allowed the body to be designed so that it densified without sagging excessively. After establishing this important result, an iterative approach was employed to produce a ware that was very white, translucent, had the required thermal expansion coefficient for glaze <b>fitting,</b> <b>shrank</b> acceptably during the first firing and did not sag during the second firing that stimulated glost firing. The finding on sagging was applied to an anorthite/mullite porcelain body that was under development. This body was also made with a low-clay content and the same prefired body. This whitware has potential to replace bone china and hard porcelain {{for use in the}} servere service conditions of hotels and restaurants. It has a higher fracture toughness than hard porcelain but has the same scratch resistant glaze and is more resistant to thermal shock. The sagging of the anorthite/mullite porcelain was substantially reduced while the body was densified. This was achieved by using a combination of finer particles and a reduction in the liquid-phase content that developed during firing...|$|R
40|$|Pyrite is {{the most}} {{abundant}} sulfide minerals on earth, and the oxidation of pyrite is highly related to metallurgy of sulfide ore and also acid drainage generation by ore residue and waste. Pyrite {{is the source of}} the excessive acid and iron in copper sulfide bioheap. The dissolution rate of pyrite is significant correlation with redox potential in ferric sulfate solution. Microbial activity played important role in pyrite oxidation. The planktonic bacteria can oxidize Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +, consequently, redox potential was lifted. However the role of bacteria attached on pyrite was not fully elucidated. In this project, the independent developed instruments which can control the redox potential during the pyrite oxidation is used to elucidated the boundary condition of oxidation of pyrite. Based on the result above, bio-oxidation of pyrite in a solution with a redox potential below the rest potential of the mineral via thermo orbital Shaker was investigated with a novel method to study the relative effect of “contact mechanism” and “non-contact mechanism”. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) are used to investigate the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) formation of mixed and attachment of microbes, and its influence on pyrite oxidation. We desire to deepen the understanding of the “contact mechanism” in the process of pyrite oxidation. The result shows the oxidation of pyrite is controlled by surface chemical reaction <b>fitting</b> <b>shrinking</b> core model and the dissolution rate is correlation with Eh in order of 11. 265 under the controlled potential. The dissolution of pyrite was negligible if the redox potential fell to 650 mV, even at 60 ℃. Based on this result, Pyrite was oxidized by growth of mixed mesophilic microorganisms below 650 mV. The pyrite was confirmed to be undissolved by leaching data and surface analysis, even with high activity leaching bacteria, 70 % coverage rate on pyrite surface and forming biofilm. Thus, the “contact mechanism” of leaching bacteria wasn’t detected under 650 mV. In addition, high acidity can inhibit the attachment of bacteria on pyrite. The conclusion point out the direction on inhibiting acid generation in copper sulfide bioheap system. Chalcocite {{is the most}} common secondary copper sulfides and one of the most important copper sulfide resources applied in metallurgy. Since 1980 s, there have been more than 20 copper bioleaching operations. There exist prominent problems in heap bioleaching of chalcocite ores, however, especially low efficiency and long period of copper extraction. In order to study the role of bacteria played in the process of chalcocite dissolution, relatively high-grade natural chalcocite (Cu 2 S) was leached in column under controlled redox potential (Eh) to simulate bioleaching test which was also conducted in similar column instrument. The result shows the second stage is controlled by in-diffusion that Fe 3 + diffuse from mineral surface to S-CuS interface. The ratio between chemical reaction and diffusion gradually decreases with process of reaction and effect of diffusion enhanced. The leaching bacteria indeed accelerate the dissolution rate of CuS in the second stage. The rate constant of bioleaching test was 2. 35 higher than the chemical leaching test. Different type of bacteria which played their own roles make the accelerating processes. At last, based on the composition of ore and chemical reaction in secondary copper sulfides bioheap system, the empirical equation which can be used to evaluate the overall acid generation was obtained from relation between the equations. The study shows that the oxidation reaction of S has a little effect on the acid balance and the empirical equation was confirmed to effectively evaluate the acid generation and the dissolution rate of pyrite at balance point. Based on the dissolution rate of pyrite combined with the pyrite and gangue content in ore, acid generation can be adjusted in the secondary copper sulfides bioheap. </p...|$|R
