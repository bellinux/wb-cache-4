To {{model the}} kilovoltage (kV) x-ray {{source of a}} superficial x-ray unit and to validate a rapid and accurate in-house software (kVDoseCalc) tool for computing absorbed radiation dose from <b>superficial</b> <b>x-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> energies. To validate kVDoseCalc, we measured central axis percent depth-doses (PDDs) and profiles using an Xstrahl 150 x-ray system (Gulmay Medical Inc.). We also compared the measured and calculated PDDs to those from the British Journal of Radiology Supplement 25 (BJR 25). The Xstrahl source was characterized as a point spectral source with varying spatial fluence, and this source model was used in kVDoseCalc to compute absorbed radiation dose at points of interest (POIs). The spectrum was derived by inputting half-value layers (HVLs) and kVps into third party software Spektr and SpekCalc. Doses for the PDDs and profiles were measured using 2, 5, and 15 cm cone sizes at 80, 120, 140, and 150 kVp energies in a scanning water phantom (IBA Blue Phantom 2) using Scanditronix Wellhofer farmer-type and compact chambers of volumes 0. 65 and 0. 13 cc, respectively. The percent difference in the computed PDD doses compared with our measurements range from - 4. 76 % to 4. 78 % with an overall mean percent difference and standard deviation of 1. 52 % and 0. 74 %, respectively. The percent difference between our PDD measurements and those from BJR 25 range from - 13. 98 % to 15. 7 % with an overall mean percent difference and standard deviation of 4. 94 % and 2. 10 %, respectively; showing that our measurements agree much better with kVDoseCalc than BJR 25. The range in percent difference between kVDoseCalc and measurement for profiles was - 5. 89 % to 5. 92 % with an overall mean percent difference and standard deviation of 1. 35 % and 1. 42 %, respectively. The results demonstrate that using our source model, kVDoseCalc can rapidly and accurately compute absorbed radiation dose for <b>superficial</b> <b>x-ray</b> <b>therapy.</b> The results demonstrate that using our source model, kVDoseCalc can rapidly and accurately compute absorbed radiation dose for <b>superficial</b> <b>x-ray</b> <b>therapy.</b> An instruction manual for kVDoseCalc is also accompanied...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{prospective}} clinical study of 46 ear keloids in 31 patients (with a mean follow-up of 18 months) treated from January 2006 to December 2006 at The Queen Elizabeth Public Hospital, Barbados, West Indies {{by a single}} surgeon. The mean age is 21. 9 years (range 3 - 66 years). Seven out of 46 lesions were recurrent lesions following previous surgery. All the lesions were excised surgically (extralesional). Ten out of 31 patients were given postoperative, Intralesional Triamcinolone starting from the 1 st post operative visit on three visits at monthly intervals. Fourteen patients were given postoperative <b>superficial</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> of 12 Gy in three equal fractions on three consecutive days starting from the 3 rd postoperative day. Seven recurrent keloids {{of this study were}} given a combination of both <b>superficial</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> and intralesional triamcinolone. All patients were followed at monthly intervals for three visits from the time of surgery and every three months {{until the end of the}} 1 st year and then every six months thereafter. Five of 46 postoperative surgical wounds showed evidence of recurrence during the 1 st year but could be suppressed with Intralesional triamcinolone. This study confirms that surgical excision of keloids supplemented with radiotherapy and/Intralesional triamcinolone is a reliable method with few complications. In addition, the study concludes that the key in preventing recurrence is regular clinical follow-up to encounter early recurring lesion (clinical evidence of raised scars or palpable nodules if deep seated) which is 100 % susceptible to Intralesional triamcinolone for 2 - 3 times at monthly intervals...|$|E

40|$|Iodinated {{contrast}} agents, {{which are}} routinely {{used to improve}} contrast in x-ray diagnostic radiography, have been successfully proven to enhance radiation effects in kilovoltage <b>x-ray</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> beams. The studies determined the influence of iodine {{on the level of}} radiation biotoxicity to cells as an indicator of the radiation dose enhancement. The use of other high-atomic-number materials such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) may also provide advantages in terms of radiation dose enhancement. In this work AuNPs have been used for the enhancement of radiation effects on bovine aortic endothelial cells of <b>superficial</b> <b>x-ray</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> and megavoltage electron radiation therapy beams. Results reveal an increase of cell damage with increasing concentration of AuNPs. At 1 mM concentration of AuNPs, enhancement of radiation peaked at 25 times for a kilovoltage x-ray beam. AuNPs showed similar effects on electron beams but to a lesser extent. This study showed that AuNPs can be used to enhance the effect of radiation doses from kilovoltage <b>x-ray</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> and megavoltage electron radiation therapy beams. In the prevailing clinical circumstances, wherein radiation therapy dose is constrained by normal tissue tolerance, this enhancement could in the future be used to improve local control in <b>superficial</b> <b>x-ray</b> treatments, megavoltage electron beam radiation therapy, microbeam radiation therapy, and intraoperative irradiation using kilovoltage x-rays or megavoltage electron beams. Moreover, the value of this work also {{stems from the fact that}} the damage to the endothelial cells lining the highly vasculature structure of tumors deprives tumors of their oxygen and nutrients supply and enhances the efficiency of radiation therapy treatment, where it has been proven that more of the AuNPs injected into animals ends up into the blood than in the tumor...|$|R
40|$|Review {{is made of}} dosimetric {{studies of}} Ge-doped SiO {{telecommunication}} fibre as a 1 -D thermoluminescence (TL) system for therapeutic applications. To-date, the response of these fibres has been investigated for UV sources, <b>superficial</b> <b>X-ray</b> beam <b>therapy</b> facilities, a synchrotron microbeam facility, electron linear accelerators, protons, neutrons and alpha particles, covering the energy range from a few eV to several MeV. Dosimetric characteristics include, reproducibility, fading, dose response, reciprocity between TL yield and dose-rate and energy dependence. The fibres produce a flat response to fixed photon and electron doses to within better than 3 % of the mean TL distribution. Irradiated Ge-doped SiO optical fibres show limited signal fading, with an average loss of TL signal of ~ 0. 4 % per day. In terms of dose response, Ge-doped SiO optical fibres {{have been shown to}} provide linearity to x and electron doses, from a fraction of 1 Gy up to 2 kGy.

40|$|Introduction <b>Superficial</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} treatment methods in radiotherapy especially in the treatment of superficial skin lesions (Up to 300 kVp). Quality of the X-ray beam that can be expressed by Half-Value Layer (HVL), are important indices for this type of treatment effective energy of photon and Homogeneity Coefficient (HC). Materials and Methods The HC of the superficial X-ray machine at 180 kVp was determined by an experimental method and also by simulation (EGSnrc code) and the results were compared. The exposure after the first (0. 5 mmCu) and second (1 mmCu) attenuation layers were measured by Farmer dosimeter for three different field sizes. The HC was derived from these experimental data and was compared with corresponding results acquired by EGSnrc code package. The BEAMnrc code was used to transport photons and electrons at exit level of the applicator, DOSXYZnrc code for calculation of absorbed dose in the phantom, and BEAMDP for drawing the output spectra. Results Results showed that the mean percentage difference of errors obtained by experimental data and simulation method is 3. 3 % and the average energy of output spectra in 180 kVp after passing through filters and attenuation layers increases to 15. 3 % to 25. 4 %. Conclusion The maximum percentage difference of errors for the applied methods is higher than analogous devolves elsewhere reports which could be due to setup parameters such as SSD and field size. However, the present method has the advantage of ease of setup and matching with clinical conditions...|$|E

The medical records of 597 patients with 1021 lesions (720 BCC, 242 SCC, 59 SCC in situ) treated with kilovoltage radiation from 1979 - 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The majority of patients were treated according to 1 of 3 institutional protocols based on the discretion of the radiation oncologist: 1) 22 x 2. 5 Gy; 2) 20 x 2. 5 Gy; 3) 30 x 2. 0 Gy. "T" stage at first presentation was as follows: Tis (59); T 1 (765); T 2 (175); T 3 (6), T 4 (9); Tx, (7). All patients were clinical N 0 and M 0 at presentation. Chi-square test was used to evaluate any potential association between variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival with the Log Rank test used for comparison. A Cox Regression analysis was performed for multivariate analysis. The median follow up was 44 months. No significant difference was observed among the 3 prescribed fractionation schemes (p = 0. 78) in terms of RTOG toxicity. There were no failures among SCC in situ, 37 local failures (23 BCC, 14 SCC), 5 regional failures (all SCC) and 2 distant failures (both SCC). For BCC, the 5 -year LC was 96 % and the 10 -year LC was 94 %. For SCC the corresponding rates of local control were 92 % and 87 %, respectively (p = 0. 03). The use of > 2. 0 Gy daily was significantly associated with improved LC on multivariate analysis (HR: 0. 17; CI 95 %: 0. 05 - 0. 59). SXRT for N-MSC {{of the head and neck}} is well tolerated, achieves excellent local control, and should continue to be recommended in the management of this disease. Fractionation schedules using > 2. 0 Gy daily appear to be associated with improved LC...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} 68 -year-old patient with {{multiple}} primary infiltrative BCCs in the scalp area, initially treated 14 {{years ago with}} <b>superficial</b> contact <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy,</b> end dose 60 greys, followed by electrocautery (x 2) several years later. He presented in the dermatologic policlinic for diagnosis and therapy of two additional, newly-formed pigmented lesions, and because of an uncomfortable, itchy, burning sensation {{in the area where}} lesions had been treated years before. Screening cranial computer-tomography (CT) examination revealed two deformities in the form of tumor-mediated osteolysis, affecting the diploe of the tabula externa on the left parietal and parasagittal areas. Complete excision with removal of periosteum and partial removal of the tabula externa was planned with neurosurgeons at a later stage. BCC {{is one of the most}} common malignant skin tumours of the head and neck region (about 90 % of cases) and is characterised by a significant potential for local infiltration and destructive growth. Recurrent, invasive BCC of the scalp and calvarium is a difficult problem for which universally accepted treatment protocols had not been established. The primary treatment of aggressive BCCs is surgical, with a thorough examination of excision margins to ensure complete resection. Procedural-based options include standard excision, curettage, curettage with electrodessication, and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), with MMS being the gold standard for the definitive treatment of BCC. Improper removal or electrocautery (as in our case) of the several aggressive forms of BCC seems to be a particular problem, and not only for dermatologic surgeons. The risk of subsequent invasion and destruction of the cranium, underlying dura, and cranial nerves by basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is extremely low, with an estimated incidence of 0. 03 %, but is a potential complication over time. Computed tomography is the modality of choice for detecting tumour invasion into bone, which commonly appears as irregular demineralization or osteolysis...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{relationship}} of {{x-ray tube housing}} temperature to duty cycle was studied for a <b>superficial</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>x-ray</b> installation, a dental radiographic installation, and a rotating-anode medical diagnostic installation. Thermistors were {{used to measure the}} tube housing temperature at points selected to be representative of thermal conditions {{on the surface of the}} x-ray tube housing. Measurements were made for continuous operation and intermittent operation, for the beam directed horizontally, and for the beam directed vertically down. Maximum temperatures were observed on the uppermost surfaces of the tube housings and minimum temperatures were observed on the lower surfaces of the tube housings. The orientation of the tube housing was found in some cases to alter the maximum tube housing temperature. Theoretically, tube housing temperatures for continuous and intermittent operation should be the same, but some differences were observed. These differences between tube housing temperatures observed for continuous operation and those observed for intermittent operation were due to differences in the duty cycle ratings specified by the x-ray tube manufacturer for continuous and intermittent operation...|$|R
40|$|Background. Advanced {{basal cell}} {{carcinoma}} (BCC) is often treated by surgery or <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy.</b> The consequences of <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> on the patients’ health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) have {{so far not been}} described. Objectives. To quantify quality of life in BCC patients before and after <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> compared with matched healthy controls. Materials. Twenty-five patients (mean age 69) with BCC completed the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) before and two weeks and three months after <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> and their results were compared with the DLQI scores for 25 matched controls. Results. Compared to the healthy controls the patients' DLQI score was significantly higher before and 2 weeks after <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> (P= 0. 005; P= 0. 000).

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{planning}} problems {{presented by}} abutting electron fields are well recognized. Junctioning electron fields {{with a large}} hinge angle compounds the problems because {{of the creation of}} closely situated high dose and low-dose regions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The technique involving a compensated <b>superficial</b> <b>x-ray</b> (SXR) field to treat the junction region between electron fields was developed and used in a particular clinical case (treatment of a squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead/scalp). The <b>superficial</b> <b>x-ray</b> beam parameters were chosen and the compensator was designed to make the SXR field complementary to the electron fields. RESULTS: Application of a compensated SXR field eliminated low dose zones in the junction region and reduced high dose zones to 110 %. In the clinical case discussed, the high-dose areas due to the SXR field would not appear because of increased attenuation of the soft X-rays in bone. CONCLUSION: The technique proposed produces uniform dose distribution up to 3 cm deep and can be considered as an additional tool for dealing with electron field junctioning problems. Sergel F.

Male Wistar rats were submitted to treatment on the ninth day after transplantation of the tumour. Two groups of rats received either a therapeutic X-ray dose of 800 cGy by a 6 -MeV linear accelerator (Mevatron, Siemens) or treatment by 432 MHz of microwaves with continuous control of tumour tissue temperature to 44 ± 1 °C for 45 min. Another group of rats was submitted to a combined treatment, with <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> preceding hyperthermia by 24 h. The last group of animals constituted the control rats.
