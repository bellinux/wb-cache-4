40|$|The {{mean water}} vapor {{transfer}} of the Southwest Pacific, as determined from radiosonde records near the 170 °E meridional transect, is computed for the 1960 – 73 period. Emphasis is placed on defining average patterns, then examining variations that arise during the wettest and driest years and seasons in New Zealand over that period. Over the midlatitudes, the mean transfer is predominantly from the west, and most developed in summer. Over the subtropics, the mean summer transfer is predominantly from the north or northeast, but in winter a northwest flow prevails. Patterns of water vapor transfer during wet and dry periods over New Zealand differ more in direction than in magnitude, with the <b>subtropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> extending farther poleward during wet periods, especially in summer...|$|E
40|$|The general {{circulation}} during August 1955 {{was characterized by}} an abnormally contracted circumpolar westerly whirl and an associated northward displacement of the belt of subtropical anticyclones and <b>subtropical</b> <b>easterlies.</b> While this zonal circulation was similar in many respects {{to that of the}} preceding July and led to a pattern of temperature anomaly over the United States similar to July's, the rainfall differed tremendously, particularly over the Northeast where flood-producing rains associated with hurricanes Connie and Diane replaced a regime of drought. The differences between July and August are accounted for by westward displacements of the centers of action coupled with markedly similar anomalous zonal circulations (i. e., displaced poleward). The early onset of the hurricane season is attributed to the premature northward displacement of the subtropical belt of anticyclones. The unprecedented precipitation associated with hurricanes Connie and Diane is believed to be partially related to injection of abnormally moist tropical air from an appreciably warmer than normal sea surface. The 1955 crop of hurricanes contained two early season Climatic fluctuations of short and long duration in storms, Connie and Diane, which will furnish ample temperature, precipitation, and other meteorologica...|$|E
40|$|Subtropical {{maritime}} {{low pressure}} systems frequently impact Australia's eastern seaboard. Closed circulation lows in the Tasman Sea region are termed East Coast Cyclones (ECC); they can evolve {{in a range}} of climatic environments and have proven most destructive during the late autumn-winter period. Using criteria based on pressure gradients, inferred wind field, and duration, an objectively determined database of ECC occurrences is established to explore large-scale influences on ECC evolution. Subclassification based on evolutionary trajectory reveals two dominant storm types during late autumn-winter: easterly trough lows (ETL) and southern secondary lows (SSL). Synoptic composites are used to investigate the climatological evolution of each storm type. ETL cyclogenesis occurs along the eastern seaboard at the confluence of warm moist <b>subtropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> and cool air over the continent that is advected from higher latitudes. SSL develop when a cold extratropical cyclone moves equatorward and interacts with warm moist conditions in the Tasman Sea. At seasonal time scales, a complex interplay of tropical and extratropical influences contributes to high-frequency storm seasons. ETL are more frequent during neutral or positive phases of the El Ni~no- Southern Oscillation, cool sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the tropical Indian Ocean, and neutral to positive southern annular mode phases. SSL are more frequent during years with warm SSTAs in the eastern Indian Ocean, warm SSTAs in the western Pacific, and high-latitude blocking. 16 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Global {{meteorological}} analyses from an {{assimilation of}} operational and research observations spanning the ~ 0 - 90 ~km altitude range confirm earlier tentative suggestions that high-altitude winds throughout the upper mesosphere reversed {{a week before}} the major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) of January 2009. Analyzed winds reveal descent of mean easterlies from the upper mesosphere to the lower stratosphere, followed by more easterly winds throughout the Arctic troposphere in the weeks after the SSW, indicating that these descending Northern Annular Mode (NAM) anomalies reached the surface. &nbsp; Eliassen-Palm fluxes reveal that the mesospheric precursor to this event was driven by transient nonstationary wave- 2 planetary waves that propagated rapidly from the troposphere into the upper mesosphere, where they dissipated and produced easterly mean-flow accelerations. &nbsp; This early SSW phase was characterized by both descending mesospheric easterlies and poleward expansion of <b>subtropical</b> stratospheric <b>easterlies,</b> which eventually merged in the extratropical upper stratosphere. These wind structures may in turn have focused transient wave- 2 PW activity emerging from the troposphere in ways that intensified the SSW...|$|R
50|$|In the {{tropical}} latitudes, tropical storms and hurricanes generally move westward {{with a slight}} tend toward the north, {{under the influence of}} the subtropical ridge, a high pressure system that usually extends east-west across the subtropics. South of the <b>subtropical</b> ridge, surface <b>easterly</b> winds (blowing from east to west) prevail. If the subtropical ridge is weakened by an upper trough, a tropical cyclone may turn poleward and then recurve, or curve back toward the northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. Poleward (north) of the subtropical ridge, westerly winds prevail and generally steer tropical cyclones that reach northern latitudes toward the east. The westerlies also steer extratropical cyclones with their cold and warm fronts from west to east.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{sensitivity}} of southern Africa to climate change, a reliable understanding of its hydrological system is crucial. Recent studies of the regional climatic system have revealed a highly complex interplay of forcing factors on precipitation regimes. This includes {{the influence of the}} tropical easterlies, the strength of the southern hemispheric westerlies as well as sea surface temperatures along the coast of the subcontinent. However, very few marine records have been available in order to study the coupling of marine and atmospheric circulation systems. Here we present results from a marine sediment core, recovered in shallow waters off the Gouritz River mouth on the south coast of South Africa. Core GeoB 18308 - 1 allows a closer view of the last [*]∼[*]  4  kyr. Climate sensitive organic proxies, like the distribution and isotopic composition of plant-wax lipids as well as indicators for sea surface temperatures and soil input, give information on oceanographic and hydrologic changes during the recorded time period. Moreover, the micropaleontology, mineralogical and elemental composition of the sediments reflect the variability of the terrigenous input to the core site. The combination of down-core sediment signatures and a catchment-wide provenance study indicate that the Little Ice Age ([*]∼[*]  300 – 650  cal yr BP) was characterized by climatic conditions favorable to torrential flood events. The Medieval Climate Anomaly ([*]∼[*]  950 – 650  cal yr BP) is expressed by lower sea surface temperatures in the Mossel Bay area and humid conditions in the Gouritz River catchment. These new results suggest that the coincidence of humid conditions and cooler sea surface temperatures along the south coast of South Africa resulted from a strengthened and more southerly anticyclonic circulation. Most probably, the transport of moisture from the Indian Ocean by strong <b>subtropical</b> <b>easterlies</b> was coupled with Agulhas Bank upwelling pulses, which were initiated by an increase in Agulhas Current strength...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The North African {{climate is}} {{analysed}} for August during a 32 -year period using the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) global data set {{to investigate the}} intensity variability at 600 mb of the <b>subtropical</b> highs, Africa <b>easterly</b> jet (AEJ) with two embedded local wind maxima, and African easterly waves over North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The variability of these synoptic weather systems is higher in East Africa. Themost noticeable variability of intensity occurredwith easterlywaves. Maintenance of easterlywaves from theArabian Peninsula into East Africa is dependent on strong zonal gradients from the AEJ through shear vorticity. These zonal gradients were induced by the strengthening of the subtropical highs {{and the presence of}} a westerly jet in Central Africa and south of the Arabian Peninsula. During positive ENSO periods, these systems are generally weaker while in negative periods are stronger. The focus of this research is to investigate the role of the Arabian High and eastern local wind maximum (LWME) on complementing the Saharan High and western local wind maximum (LWMW). It is found that an intense local wind maximum in East Africa helps maintain the easterly waves and their westward propagation from the Arabian Peninsula...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} low-frequency {{variability of}} the zonally averaged atmospheric circulation {{in the winter}} hemisphere {{is found to be}} amenable to an interpretation where the subtropical jet is flanked by a secondary midlatitude one. Observations also suggest that the link between the stratosphere and the troposphere modulates the variability of the tropospheric double-jet structure. Moreover, the summer hemisphere is characterized by a strong midlatitude jet sided by an intermittent <b>subtropical</b> one and <b>easterly</b> winds in the stratosphere. This work addresses the question about the role of eddies in generating and maintaining these key features of the general circulation by means of a simplified general circulation model. Model solutions for different parameter settings and external radiative forcings in the stratosphere are studied with and without eddies active on the system. The following main findings are noted. 1) Eddy dynamics alone, through the baroclinic instability processes in an atmosphere subjected to radiative forcing and dissipation, may account for the observed meridional variance of the tropospheric jets. 2) The Hadley cell can extend to the pole overlying the Ferrel cell, a feature supported by observations in the summer hemisphere. 3) The meridional temperature gradient reversal in the summer stratosphere contributes to the observed low-frequency variability introducing an intermittent formation of a subtropical jet and the occurrence of easterlies in the tropical stratosphere. 4) Poleward propagation of the zonal wind anomaly is, when it occurs, related to the activity of synoptic eddies...|$|R
40|$|Indian {{summer monsoon}} is characterised by periods of weak and strong monsoon activity. A {{particular}} {{example of the}} weak monsoon case is the so-called "break monsoon " situation. During the break the rainfall is mainly concen-trated near {{the foot of the}} Himalayas and over western ghats and the remaining parts of the country experience little or no precipitation. If this type of situation continues for a long time almost all parts of the country suffer from below normal rainfall and {{is considered to be a}} calamity. This will not nonnally happen. Gen-erally, a disturbance develops over the head of Bay of Bengal after a few days of break and monsoon revives to its nonnal activity. Thus, the break situation is shortlived and leads to the fonnation of disturbances. This suggests the existence of some sort of instability mechan-ism during a break situation. It has been earlier shown by the author (Brahmananda Rao, 1968) that baroclinic insta-bility does not exist in a nonnal monsoon situa-tion. Even during a break the situation is not expected to be different because the vertical distribution of the zonal wind and static stabil-ity will not be different from that of the nonnal monsoon case. However, major changes occur in the horizontal distribution of the zonal wind during a break. There is a southward shift of the <b>subtropical</b> westerlies and <b>easterlies</b> north of the easterly jet strengthen. In some cases the easterly jet occupies a more northerly position (Koteswaram, 1958). This suggests the possi bility of barotropic instability.
