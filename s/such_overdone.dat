50|$|In the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe, {{published}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, the basso continuo was again rendered as a figured bass. Performance editions, such as those by Robert Franz, expanded the continuo in separate written out parts for multiple instruments. Philipp Spitta, siding with the Bach Ausgabe, disagreed with <b>such</b> <b>overdone</b> expansions of the continuo.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{was only}} {{slightly}} less harsh, saying, [...] "We've been here before, most memorably with Bonnie and Clyde, but also with Roger Corman's seamy examination of the Barker family in Bloody Mama. Robert Aldrich's new film owes something to both. To Bonnie and Clyde for its convincing period feel, and to Bloody Mama for its treatment of a violent, sexually twisted family of criminals," [...] adding [...] "...the movie is deliberately melodramatic, and to <b>such</b> an <b>overdone</b> degree that (if you suspend your sanity {{for an hour or}} so) you can almost wallow in it. Everyone screams, shouts, flashes knives at each other and sweats a lot." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{attained}} mixed receptions {{from television}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C' grade, scoring lower than [...] "Road to the North Pole" [...] of Family Guy and [...] "For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls" [...] of American Dad. VanDerWerff {{felt that the}} episode was [...] "fairly lazy", and commented that the main plot was [...] "too much of a mob movie pastiche." [...] Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic criticized the humor of the episode, opining that [...] "for an episode with <b>such</b> an <b>overdone</b> story, we could have forgiven things if it were at least funnier." [...] He continued: [...] "Unfortunately, there just weren't enough jokes to make the episode worth it." [...] In conclusion of his review, Hochberger gave [...] "Donnie Fatso" [...] a 2.5 out of 5 stars.|$|R
