25|$|The DA36 E-Star, an {{aircraft}} designed by Siemens, Diamond Aircraft and EADS, employs a <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> powertrain with the propeller being turned {{only by a}} Siemens 70kW (94hp) electric motor. The aim is {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions by up to 25%. An onboard 40hp (30kW) Austro Engines Wankel rotary engine and generator provides the electricity because of the small size, light weight and high power-to-weight ratio of the engines. The electric motor also uses electricity stored in batteries to take off and climb reducing sound emissions by eliminating the engine. The <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> powertrain using the Wankel engine reduces the weight of the plane by 100 kilos to its predecessor. The DA36 E-Star first flew in June 2013, making this the first ever flight of a <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> powertrain. Diamond aircraft state that the technology using Wankel engines is scalable to a 100-seater aircraft.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a {{research}} program that powered the <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> Gen2 version from a Stirling engine-based generator.

5000|$|With the Formula Zero Competition {{coming to}} a {{foreseeable}} end, the remaining {{members of the team}} started out to find a new alternative energy motorsports competition. After much review of the available venues, the team decided upon the SAE sanctioned Formula Hybrid Competition. In this new venue, the focus of design turned away from fuel-cell power <b>series</b> <b>hybrids,</b> to internal combustion parallel and <b>series</b> <b>hybrids</b> exclusively. With all previous focus being on series-hybrid architecture, the team continued onward into the 2010 competition year with an independent rear wheel drive vehicle power by two DC motors.

25|$|In May 2003, JR East started test {{runs with}} the {{so-called}} NE (new energy) train and validated the system's functionality (<b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> with lithium-ion battery) in cold regions. In 2004, Railpower Technologies had been running pilots in the US {{with the so-called}} Green Goats, which led to orders by the Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific Railways starting in early 2005.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, Aptera Motors {{announced}} their Typ-1 two-seater. They planned to produce both an electric 2e and a plug-in <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> 2h {{with a common}} three-wheeled, composite body design. As of 2009, over two thousand hybrid pre-orders had been accepted and production of the hybrid configuration was expected to begin in 2010. However, the company folded in December 2011.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, GM {{unveiled}} {{the prototype of}} the Chevrolet Volt, which was expected to feature a plug-in capable, battery-dominant <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> architecture called E-Flex. Future E-Flex plug-in hybrid vehicles may use gasoline, diesel, or hydrogen fuel cell power to supplement the vehicle's battery. General Motors envisions an eventual progression of E-Flex vehicles from plug-in hybrids to pure electric vehicles, as battery technology improves.|$|E
50|$|Daimler Trucks uses such {{a system}} {{for most of its}} full-hybrid {{commercial}} vehicles, including in the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco <b>Hybrid,</b> while <b>series</b> <b>hybrids</b> are reserved for urban buses, where they work most efficiently.|$|R
25|$|Series hybrids use an {{internal}} combustion engine (ICE) to turn a generator, which in turn supplies current to an electric motor, which then rotates the vehicle’s drive wheels. A battery or supercapacitor pack, {{or a combination of}} the two, can be used to store excess charge. Examples of <b>series</b> <b>hybrids</b> vehicles include the Chevrolet Volt (first generation), Fisker Karma, Renault Kangoo, Elect'Road, Toyota's Japan-only Coaster light-duty passenger bus, Daimler AG's hybrid Orion bus, Opel Flextreme concept car, Swissauto REX VW Polo prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives. With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ICE. As is the case for other architectures, <b>series</b> <b>hybrids</b> can operate without recharging {{as long as there is}} liquid fuel in the tank.|$|R

The models included diesel/electric parallel hybrid, gas turbine/electric <b>series</b> <b>hybrid,</b> fuel cell/electric version and {{compressed natural gas}} low emission internal combustion engine version. In addition, during this period, GM reorganized their electronics divisions (among them Hughes Electronics and Delco Divisions) into Delco Propulsion Systems in order to attempt to commercialize this technology in niche markets. Several non-affiliated companies purchased inverter and drivetrain systems from DPS for vehicle/fleet conversion purposes.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand Porsche {{designed}} and built a four-wheel-driven electric vehicle for the k. u. k. Hofwagenfabrik Ludwig Lohner & Co. in Vienna in 1899, presented to the public during the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris. The vehicle was a <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> car, that used an electric hub motor at each wheel, powered by batteries, which were in turn charged by a gasoline-engine generator. It was clumsily heavy and due to its unusual status the so-called Lohner-Porsche is not frequently given its credit as the first four-wheel-driven automobile.|$|E

25|$|On 1 June 2009, Volvo {{announced}} {{the launching of}} series production diesel-electric plug-in hybrids by 2012. The company plans to sell a <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{with the goal of}} achieving emissions of less than 50grams of CO2 per kilometer. As part of a joint venture with Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, Volvo converted two Volvo V70 to plug-in hybrid demonstrators that have been in field testing in Göteborg, Sweden since December 2009. Vattenfall offered customers participating in this trial the supply of renewable electricity generated from wind power or hydropower. Among other challenges, this test has allowed to experience the all-electric range at low temperatures, which has been a disadvantage of plug-in vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{permits the}} Volt {{to operate as}} a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity has been depleted to a defined level, at which time it commences to operate as a <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> design where the gasoline engine drives the generator, which keeps the battery at minimum level charge and provides power to the electric motors. The full charge of the battery is replenished only by loading it on the electrical grid. While in this series mode at higher speeds and loads, (typically above [...] at light to moderate loads) the gasoline engine can engage mechanically to the output from the transmission and assist both electric motors in driving the wheels, {{in which case the}} Volt operates as a power-split or series-parallel hybrid. After its all-electric range has been depleted, at speeds between , the Volt is programmed to select the most efficient drive mode, which improves performance and boosts high-speed efficiency by 10 to 15 percent.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ways to create an electric-Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) hybrid. The variety of electric-ICE designs can be {{differentiated}} by how the electric and combustion portions of the powertrain connect, at what times each portion is in operation, and what percent of the power is provided by each hybrid component. Two major categories are <b>series</b> <b>hybrids</b> and parallel hybrids, though parallel designs are most common today.|$|R
25|$|In <b>series</b> <b>hybrids,</b> {{only the}} {{electric}} motor drives the drivetrain, {{and a smaller}} ICE works as a generator to power the electric motor or to recharge the batteries. They also usually have a larger battery pack than parallel hybrids, making them more expensive. Once the batteries are low, the small combustion engine can generate power at its optimum settings at all times, making them more efficient in extensive city driving.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{prototype}} had a {{gas turbine}} engine APU placed in the trunk. A single-stage, single-shaft, recuperated gas turbine unit with a high-speed permanent-magnet AC generator was provided by Williams International; it weighed , measured [...] in diameter by [...] long and was running between 100,000 and 140,000rpm. The turbine could run {{on a number of}} high-octane alternative fuels, from octane-boosted gasoline to compressed natural gas. The APU started automatically when the battery charge dropped below 40% and delivered [...] of electrical power, sufficient to simultaneously sustain the EV1's 80mph top speed whilst returning the car's 44 NiMH cells to (and maintain them at) a 50% charge level.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the more}} {{comprehensive}} fuel economy and environment label {{that will be}} mandatory in the U.S. beginning in model year 2013, [...] the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids because of their design complexity, as PHEVS can operate {{in two or three}} operating modes: all-electric, blended, and gasoline-only. One label is for <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> or extended range electric vehicle (like the Chevy Volt), with all-electric and gasoline-only modes; and a second label for blended mode or series-parallel hybrid, that includes a combination of both gasoline and plug-in electric operation; and gasoline only, like a conventional hybrid vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the compact}} {{size and the}} high {{power to weight ratio}} of a Wankel engine, it has been {{proposed}} for electric vehicles as range extenders to provide supplementary power when electric battery levels are low. There {{have been a number of}} concept cars incorporating a <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> powertrain arrangement. A Wankel engine used only as a generator has packaging, noise, vibration and weight distribution advantages when used in a vehicle, maximizing interior passenger and luggage space. The engine/generator may be at one end of the vehicle with the electric driving motors at the other, connected only by thin cables. Mitsueo Hitomi the global powertrain head of Mazda stated, [...] "a rotary engine is ideal as a range extender because it is compact and powerful, while generating low-vibration".|$|E

2500|$|The {{general layout}} of the initial {{production}} platform is considered {{by some to be}} a plug-in <b>series</b> <b>hybrid</b> design (since mechanical power initially drives the generator, which in turn charges the battery pack), despite its transmission design that makes it, by definition, a parallel hybrid. Power is drained from the batteries to run the electrical motors which move the vehicle. The internal combustion engine can run at a constant speed for both optimal efficiency and mechanical simplicity (i.e., {{there is no need for}} variable cam phasing). [...] The Voltec, like the Prius, uses a planetary gearset to couple power from two sources to the wheels. Unlike the Prius, the Voltec only rarely drives the wheels with mechanical assist from the engine, and only when battery charge is depleted. The Voltec could therefore be considered a power-split hybrid.|$|E
