5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of <b>spillover</b> between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E

5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge <b>spillover</b> and technological advancements into economies.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected <b>spillover</b> effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

40|$|To date, the {{analysis}} of R&D <b>spillovers</b> between firms has been largely restricted to static two-stage models (R&D decisions followed by product market decisions). Such models are silent {{on the relationship between}} <b>spillovers</b> and concentration. We present a dynamic duopoly model of R&D with <b>spillovers</b> where industry concentration is endogenous. In our model, firms compete repeatedly in both the product market via Cournot competition and in imperfectly appropriable process R&D. The analysis highlights previously ignored welfare effects of <b>spillovers</b> through dynamic changes in industry concentration. In addition, the impact of imperfect appropriability of R&D on concentration and welfare depends crucially on the manner in which <b>spillovers</b> are obtained. We find that when <b>spillovers</b> require absorptive capacity investment in own R&D, larger <b>spillovers</b> lead to declines in concentration while rates of innovation increase and welfare rises. In contrast, when <b>spillovers</b> are costlessly obtained the effect on concentration depends on the extent of <b>spillovers.</b> At low levels of <b>spillovers,</b> concentration declines because larger firms reduce R&D more than small firms.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that <b>spillovers</b> can enhance private returns to {{innovation}} if they {{feed back into}} the dynamic research of the original inventor (Internalized <b>spillovers),</b> but will always reduce private returns, if the original inventor does not benefit from the advancements other inventors build into the "spilled" knowledge (Externalized <b>spillovers).</b> I empirically identify unique patterns of knowledge flows (based on patent citations), which provide information about whether "spilled" knowledge is reabsorbed by its inventor. A simple model of sequential innovation with dynamic <b>spillovers</b> is developed, which predicts that market value and R&D expenditures should rise with Internalized <b>spillovers</b> and fall with Externalized <b>spillovers.</b> These predications are confirmed using panel data on U.

To the extent that firms internalize some of the <b>spillovers</b> they create, the classical underinvestment problem in R&D will be mitigated and {{the central role of}} <b>spillovers</b> in promoting economic growth will be enhanced. market value, patents, R&D and <b>spillovers...</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{approach}} to increasing adsorption in MOFs is {{to alter the}} system {{in such a way}} that chemisorption becomes possible. This functionality has been introduced by making a composite material, which contains a MOF and a complex of platinum with activated carbon. In an effect known as hydrogen <b>spillover,</b> H2 can bind to the platinum surface through a dissociative mechanism which cleaves the hydrogen molecule into two hydrogen atoms and enables them to travel down the activated carbon onto the surface of the MOF. This innovation produced a threefold increase in the room-temperature storage capacity of a MOF; however, desorption can take upwards of 12 hours, and reversible desorption is sometimes observed for only two cycles. The relationship between hydrogen <b>spillover</b> and hydrogen storage properties in MOFs is not well understood but may prove relevant to hydrogen storage.|$|E
