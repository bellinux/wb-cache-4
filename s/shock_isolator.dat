40|$|Simulating {{the impact}} of debris flows on {{structures}} and exploring the feasibility of applying energy dissipation devices or <b>shock</b> <b>isolators</b> to reduce {{the damage caused by}} debris flows can make great contribution to the design of disaster prevention structures. In this paper, we propose a new type of device, a lateral damping buffer, to reduce the vulnerability of building structures to debris flows. This lateral damping buffer has two mechanisms of damage mitigation: when debris flows impact on a building, it acts as a buffer, and when the structure vibrates due to the impact, it acts as a shock absorber, which can reduce the maximum acceleration response and subsequent vibration respectively. To study the effectiveness of such a lateral damping buffer, an impact test is conducted, which mainly involves a lateral damping buffer attached to a two-degree-of-freedom structure under a simulated debris flow load. To enable the numerical study, the equation of motion of the structure along with the lateral damping buffer is derived. A subsequent parametric study is performed to optimize the lateral damping buffer. Finally, a practical design procedure is also provided...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} is performed in the High Enthalpy ShockTunnel Göttingen to investigate {{the response of the}} HyShotII scramjet combustor to equivalence ratios close to the critical value at which the onset of thermal choking occurs. This critical equivalence ratio is first identified (for simulated Mach- 8, 27 -km altitude conditions) as 0. 38 - 0. 39. Subsequent experiments cover the range between this value and 0. 50. As the HyShotII combustor has a constant-area cross section, the expected behavior in this equivalence-ratio range is the formation and upstream propagation of an unsteady shock train, that would eventually lead to inlet unstart. Instead, however, the shock train is observed to become lodged in the in the heat-release zone of the combustion chamber, with a quasi-stable position that shifts upstream within creasing equivalence ratio. This behavior is distinct from the steady <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> train is observed to become lodged in the heat-release zone of the combustion chamber, with a quasi-stable position that shifts upstream with increasing equivalence ratio. This behavior is distinct from the steady <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> trains seen in traditional dual-mode scramjet configurations. The shock-train development in the present experiments is characterized through fast-response surface pressure and heat-flux measurements, as well as simultaneous high-speed schlieren and OH*chemiluminescence visualization. Possible explanations for this unexpected behavior are proposed in terms of the increased heat-transfer to the combustor walls and a possible increased uniformity of the heat release across the combustor cross-section caused by the presence of the shock train...|$|R
40|$|One-Dimensional {{modeling}} of dual mode scramjet and ramjet flowpaths {{is a useful}} tool for scramjet conceptual design and wind tunnel testing. In this thesis, modeling tools that enable detailed analysis of the flow physics within the combustor are developed as part of a new one-dimensional MATLAB-based model named VTMODEL. VTMODEL divides a ramjet or scramjet flow path into four major components: inlet, isolator, combustor, and nozzle. The inlet module provides two options for supersonic inlet one-dimensional calculations; a correlation from MIL Spec 5007 D, and a kinetic energy efficiency correlation. The kinetic energy efficiency correlation also enables the user to account for inlet heat transfer using a total temperature term in the equation for pressure recovery. The isolator model also provides two options for calculating the pressure rise and the <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> train. The first model is a combined Fanno flow and oblique shock system.

40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the {{dual-mode}} scramjet isolator, a critical component in preventing inlet unstart and/or vehicle loss by containing a collection of flow disturbances called a shock train, have been performed since the dual-mode propulsion cycle {{was introduced in the}} 1960 s. Low momentum corner flow and other three-dimensional effects inherent to rectangular isolators have, however, been largely ignored in experimental {{studies of the}} boundary layer separation driven <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> train dynamics. Furthermore, the use of two dimensional diagnostic techniques in past works, be it single-perspective line-of-sight schlieren/shadowgraphy or single axis wall pressure measurements, have been unable to resolve the three-dimensional flow features inside the rectangular isolator. These flow characteristics need to be thoroughly understood if robust dual-mode scramjet designs are to be fielded. The work presented in this thesis is focused on experimentally analyzing shock train/boundary layer interactions from multiple perspectives in aspect ratio 1. 0, 3. 0, and 6. 0 rectangular isolators with inflow Mach numbers ranging from 2. 4 to 2. 7. Secondary steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics studies are performed to compare to the experimental results and to provide additional perspectives of the flow field. Specific issues that remain unresolved after decades of <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> train studies that are addressed in this work include the three-dimensional formation of the <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> train front, the spatial and temporal low momentum corner flow separation scales, the transient behavior of shock train/boundary layer interaction at specific coordinates along the isolator's lateral axis, and effects of the rectangular geometry on semi-empirical relations for shock train length prediction. A novel multiplane shadowgraph technique is developed to resolve the structure of the shock train along both the minor and major duct axis simultaneously. It is shown that the shock train front is of a hybrid oblique/normal nature. Initial low momentum corner flow separation spawns the formation of oblique shock planes which interact and proceed toward the center flow region, becoming more normal in the process. The hybrid structure becomes more two-dimensional as aspect ratio is increased but corner flow separation precedes center flow separation on the order of 1 duct height for all aspect ratios considered. Additional instantaneous oil flow surface visualization shows the symmetry of the three-dimensional shock train front around the lower wall centerline. Quantitative synthetic schlieren visualization shows the density gradient magnitude approximately double between the corner oblique and center flow normal structures. Fast response pressure measurements acquired near the corner region of the duct show preliminary separation in the outer regions preceding centerline separation on the order of 2 seconds. Non-intrusive Focusing Schlieren Deflectometry Velocimeter measurements reveal that both shock train oscillation frequency and velocity component decrease as measurements are taken away from centerline and towards the side-wall region, along with confirming the more two dimensional shock train front approximation for higher aspect ratios. An updated modification to Waltrup & Billig's original semi-empirical shock train length relation for circular ducts based on centerline pressure measurements is introduced to account for rectangular isolator aspect ratio, upstream corner separation length scale, and major- and minor-axis boundary layer momentum thickness asymmetry. The latter is derived both experimentally and computationally and it is shown that the major-axis (side-wall) boundary layer has lower momentum thickness compared to the minor-axis (nozzle bounded) boundary layer, making it more separable. Furthermore, it is shown that the updated correlation drastically improves shock train length prediction capabilities in higher aspect ratio isolators. This thesis suggests that performance analysis of rectangular confined supersonic flow fields can no longer be based on observations and measurements obtained along a single axis alone. Knowledge gained by the work performed in this study will allow for the development of more robust shock train leading edge detection techniques and isolator designs which can greatly mitigate the risk of inlet unstart and/or vehicle loss in flight...|$|R

The ELS consists of a high tensile stainless steel elliptical leaf spring with polymer or rubber compound. This device is conceived as a <b>shock</b> and vibration <b>isolator</b> for equipment and lightweight structures. The enhancement to the ELS consists of a lead spring plugged vertically between the leaves (referred to as lead-rubber elliptical leaf spring (LRELS)). The lead is shown to produce hysteretic damping under plastic deformations. The LRELS isolator is shown to exhibit nonlinear hysteretic behavior. In both horizontal directions, the LRELS showed symmetrical rate independent behavior but undergoes stiffening behavior under large displacements. However, in the vertical direction, the LRELS behavior is asymmetric, exhibiting softening behavior in compression and stiffening behavior in tension. Mathematical models based on the Bouc-Wen model, describing the hysteretic behavior of the proposed isolator, are developed and numerically calibrated using a series of finite element analyses. The LRELS {{is found to be}} effective in the in-plane and vertical directions. The improved damping and energy dissipation of the LRELS is provided from the hysteretic damping of the lead spring...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{propulsion}} technologies, including hybrid {{electric and}} hydraulic hybrid, equip vehicles with nonconventional power sources (in {{addition to the}} internal combustion engine) to provide higher fuel efficiency. However, these technologies tend to lead {{to higher levels of}} noise, vibration, and harshness in the vehicles, mainly due to the switching between the multiple power sources involved. In addition, the shocks and vibrations associated with the power sources switching may occur over a wide range of frequencies. It has been proven that passive vibration isolators (e. g., elastomeric and hydraulic mounts) are unable to mitigate or totally isolate such shocks and vibrations. Active mounts, while effective, are more complex, require significant power to operate, and can lead to system instabilities.

A 22 -species reduced mechanism for ethylene-air combustion is employed, and the calculations are performed on a mesh containing 93 million cells. Fuel plumes injected at the isolator entrance are processed by the <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> train, yielding a premixed fuel-air mixture at an equivalence ratio of 0. 42 at the cavity entrance plane.

Maximum heat release occurs when the flame front reaches its most downstream extent, as the flame surface area is larger. Minimum heat release is associated with flame propagation toward the cavity and occurs through a reduction in core flow velocity that is correlated with an upstream movement of the shock train.

40|$|The use of {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} in scramjet engine component development is widespread in the existing literature. Unfortunately, the quantification of model-form uncertainties is rarely addressed with anything other than sensitivity studies, requiring that the computational results be intimately tied to and calibrated against existing test data. This practice must be replaced with a formal uncertainty quantification process for {{computational fluid dynamics}} to play an expanded role in the system design, development, and flight certification process. Due to ground test facility limitations, this expanded role {{is believed to be}} a requirement by some in the test and evaluation community if scramjet engines are to be given serious consideration as a viable propulsion device. An effort has been initiated at the NASA Langley Research Center to validate several turbulence closure models used for Reynolds-averaged simulations of scramjet isolator flows. The turbulence models considered were the Menter BSL, Menter SST, Wilcox 1998, Wilcox 2006, and the Gatski-Speziale explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models. The simulations were carried out using the VULCAN computational fluid dynamics package developed at the NASA Langley Research Center. A procedure to quantify the numerical errors was developed to account for discretization errors in the validation process. This procedure utilized the grid convergence index defined by Roache as a bounding estimate for the numerical error. The validation data was collected from a mechanically back-pressured constant area (1 2 inch) isolator model with an isolator entrance Mach number of 2. 5. As expected, the model-form uncertainty was substantial for the shock-dominated, massively separated flowfield within the isolator as evidenced by a 6 duct height variation in shock train length depending on the turbulence model employed. Generally speaking, the turbulence models that did not include an explicit stress limiter more closely matched the measured surface pressures. This observation is somewhat surprising, given that stress-limiting models have generally been developed to better predict shock-separated flows. All of the models considered also failed to properly predict the shape and extent of the separated flow region caused by the shock boundary layer interactions. However, the best performing models were able to predict the <b>isolator</b> <b>shock</b> train length (an important metric for isolator operability margin) to within 1 isolator duct height...|$|R
