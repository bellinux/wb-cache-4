Method: Integrative review performed by literature in CAPES databases, ScieLO and LILACS, with data collection on the period from March to April 2014. Results: Alcohol consumption was evidenced as an usual activity among fishermen, emphasizing its association with religion, long working hours, {{lack of knowledge about}} weekly maximum levels of satisfactory consumption of alcohol, occupational accidents, <b>sexually</b> <b>transmited</b> and cardiovascular diseases, and hyperlipidemia.

40|$|Abstract: Ceftriaxone is {{a third-generation}} of {{cephalosporins}} {{which is used}} for community acquired infections such as pneumonia and urinaly tract infections. It showed great advantage of once-daily administration based on pharmacological manner and need no renal impairment. It is stable for β-lactamases against first- or second- generations of cephalosporins. Ceftriaxone is also used for streptococcal endocarditis as alternative first-line therapeutic regimen and used for <b>Sexually</b> <b>Transmited</b> Disease (STD) such as syphilis and chancoroid. Due to its pharmacological advantage, Ceftriaxone is used for Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy (OPAT) with sufficient clinical efficacy in the world. This review focused on therapeutic option or alternative first line therapy of Ceftriaxone and Ceftriaxone in OPAT. The reappraisal of ‘traditional antibiotics’, such as ceftriaxone, has triggered a review of adequate antibiotic treatment...|$|R

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground High participation and follow-up rates of population-based cervical cancer screening programs using cytology-based methods (Pap smear) have been effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of invasive cervical cancer in many developed countries [1]. Since 1995, the Norwegian Coordi-nated Cervical Cancer Screening Programme (NCCSP) has sent reminder letters to women aged 25 – 69 who have not had a registered Pap smear within the last three years and a second reminder is sent to women who have not had a reg-istered smear within 12 months of the initial letter. The NCCSP also sends reminder letters to encourage women to follow-up with their physician in the case of an abnormal or unsatisfactory result. Currently, 80 % of targeted women regularly participate in screening, while approximately 65 - 70 % of women with a high-grade abnormal result return within one year [2]. Due to the causal link between cervical cancer and hu-man papillomavirus (HPV), a common <b>sexually</b> <b>transmit...</b>|$|R
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E

40|$|To {{serially}} {{examine the}} immunopathogenesis and histopathology of rectal infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, we inoculated five cynomolgus monkeys with C trachomatis sero-var E (non-LOV) and five with serovar L 2 (LOV). After inoculation, C trachomatis was isolated from rectal cultures {{in three of}} five non-LOY-infected monkeys and in all five LOV-infected monkeys {{for a period of}} 10 weeks. LOV-infected monkeys developed a se-vere hemorrhagic ulcerative proctitis, in contrast to a mild proctitis in the non-LOV-in-fected monkeys. Hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles and a mucosal polymorphonuclear leukocyte and mononuclear cell infiltrate were evident in all infected monkeys. Crypt ab-scesses with giant cells and a rare granuloma formation were present in two of five LOV-infected monkeys. C trachomatis inclusions were initially present in epithelial cells and later in tissue histiocytes, Experimental primate infection with C trachomatis appears to clinically and histopathologically mimic rectal infection in humans and provides a model for immunopathogenesis studies in chlamydial proctitis and granulomatous proctitis.

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control.

Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex.

40|$|Crown gall, a neoplasmic {{transformation}} of plant cells, {{is caused by}} transfer and integration into nuclear plant DNA of T-DNA, {{a segment of the}} Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (1 – 8). In plant cells, this T-DNA is expressed (9 – 12) and determines the morphogenetic growth properties of crown gall cells (12 – 16) and the synthesis of opines (17 – 21). The T-DNA in octopine crown galls is composed of either one or two fragments derived from a continuous Ti sequence. Thus far, all octopine tumour lines contain the TL fragment (14 kilobases (kb)), whereas TR-DNA (approx. 6 kb) can be present as an additional sequence (22 – 24). Foreign DNA, inserted in the T region of a Ti plasmid, is co-transferred to the plant genome (17, 18, 21). However, an important requirement for the use of T-DNA as vectors for plant genetic engineering is the regeneration of normal plants which stably maintain, express and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmit</b> the transferred DNA. We report here the isolation, from tumour tissues induced by mutant Ti plasmids, of morphologically normal plants that produce octopine synthase in all tissues. This enzymatic activity is inherited as a dominant mendelian marker (25). These regenerated plants retained and expressed only the octopine synthase gene of the T-DNA...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the current data {{concerning}} the associations between Chlamydia pneumoniae and heart disease. Chlamydiae have been placed in their own order, Chlamydiales, with one family, Chlamydiaceae, and a single genus Chlamydia. Molecular evaluation of rRNA sequences confirms that chlamydiae are eubacteria with very distant relationships to other eubacterial orders. The genus Chlamydia consists of four major species, Chlamydia trachomatis, C. psitacci, C. pneumoniae. and C. pecorum. These microorganisms are obligate parasites that replicate in vacuole in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Chlamydia spp. cause a variety of diseases and are mostly prevalent pathogens causing <b>sexually</b> <b>transmited</b> diseases. Since the known Chlamydia spp. are obligate intracellular parasites, pure cultures are not available for studying of many of their biochemical properties. Molecular sequence provides a comprehensive outline of the phylogenetic organization of the Chlamydiae. Chlamydiae are known to cause various heart diseases. Endo-, myo- and pericarditis were associated with chlamydial infections during the first epidemics of psittacosis due to Chlamydia psittaci. The most common Chlamydia of humans, C. pneumoniae has also been incriminated in these diseases. Recently, greatest attention has been afforded to the association of C. pneumoniae with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) ...|$|R
