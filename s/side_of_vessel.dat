5000|$|The {{operation}} (from June 2013 onwards) was delineated by Costa's Cristiano De Musso, Head of Corporate Communications, {{according to}} the following plan:* Site inspections {{of the ship and}} its position;* Securing of the wreck to ensure on-going safety and stability;* Installation of sponsons on port <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> and construction of submarine platforms;* Parbuckling of the wreck, rotating it past a critical angle of about 24° from its resting position, beyond which the sponsons would be flooded and the ship would roll into a fully upright position on the underwater platforms;* Installation of sponsons on the starboard side of the ship;* Sponsons are dewatered to raise the ship from the bottom;* Ship delivered to an Italian port for processing according to regulations;* Cleaning and replanting of marine flora. By 20 February 2012, the tanks in the forward part of the ship, which had held about two-thirds of the fuel, had been emptied, but the following day defuelling was suspended because of poor weather conditions. On 3 March 2012, salvage workers cut a hole in the ship for access to the engine room, the location of the remaining fuel. On the morning of 12 March, defuelling operations resumed and were completed on 24 March.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} dense phase pneumatic conveying in a horizontal rectangular channel using the fluidizing air. The powder used the glass beads belongs to Geldart B particle, where the {{mean particle diameter}} is 127 μm, the particle density is 2623 kg/m 3 and the minimum fluidizing velocity is 12. 3 mm/s. The experimental device consists of a powder discharge vessel, a horizontal rectangular channel at the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> and the air supply section {{at the bottom of}} the vessel and the horizontal channel. The powder was fluidized by air through the porous membrane of the air supply section {{at the bottom of the}} vessel and the horizontal channel. Then, this system can be conveyed the fluidized powder. As the result, we confirmed the requirement that the fluidizing air to the bottom of the powder discharge vessel was required to the powder conveying of this system, and that the fluidizing velocity at the bottom of the horizontal channel was larger than that of the minimum fluidizing velocity. This result means that the fluidizing velocity at the bottom of the vessel and the horizontal channel is important to obtain the stable powder conveying. The mass flow rate and solid loading ratio were estimated by the measured data of the mass of transported powder. In addition, these results were compared with the conveying characteristic of the glass beads of 53 μm belongs to Geldart A particle. Then, the mass flow rate of Geldart A particle was higher than that of Geldart B particle. The solid loading ratio of the Geldart A particle was also greatly large to that of Geldart B particle. Therefore, we considered that the high conveying efficiency to Geldart A particle was obtained, when the dimensionless fluidizing velocities at the bottom of the powder discharge vessel and the horizontal channel were same condition...|$|E
40|$|Denne oppgaven undersøker hva det vil innebære når ansvaret for tildeling av tilskudd til en frivillig organisasjon går fra departements- til direktoratsnivå. Caset i oppgaven er Norsk Forening for Fartøyvern, der ansvaret for å tildele driftstilskudd til foreningen gikk fra Miljøverndepartementet til Riksantikvaren fra og med 2012. Studien bygger på tidligere forskning og litteratur om offentlig styring og frivillige organisasjoner, data fra dokumentanalyse og kvalitative intervjuer med ansatte i Miljøverndepartementet, politisk ledelse i Miljøverndepartementet, Riksantikvaren og fem ulike frivillige organisasjoner. Miljøverndepartementets begrunnelse for omleggingen er at direktoratet er nærmere til å vurdere den frivillige organisasjonens faglige og samfunnsfaglige nytte. Riksantikvaren har fagekspertise, men manglet kompetanse på interesseorganisasjoner og deres samfunnsfaglige nytte. Å delegere Riksantikvaren ansvaret for tildeling av tilskudd til Norsk Forening for Fartøyvern kan vise seg å gå på bekostning av større transaksjonskostnader og uklare ansvarsforhold. Riksantikvaren og Norsk Forening for Fartøyvern jobber begge for fartøyvern samtidig som de har forskjellige roller og ståsted. Som fagekspert er det naturlig for et direktorat å vektlegge det faglige samtidig som direktoratet er i en maktposisjon. Hvis forholdet og samarbeidet mellom foreningen og Riksantikvaren blir for nært er det en fare for at det fører til et for ensrettet felt ved at det faglige blir tillagt for mye vekt. Frivillige organisasjoner forsøker å tilpasse seg statlige regler for å få mest mulig tilskudd. Hvis et direktorat legger større føringer i et nytt regelverk for tilskuddsordninger, vil konsekvensen være at direktoratet har innflytelse over hvordan en frivillig organisasjon skal være. Dette strider i mot selve grunnlaget for frivillige organisasjoner som har oppstått i sivilsamfunnet utenfor statlige reguleringer. Det at det ikke eksisterer en enhetlig praksis ved forvaltning av tilskuddsmidler innenfor samme fagområde, kulturminnevern, kan føre til forskjellsbehandling av organisasjonene og dermed at noen felt innen kulturminnevernet prioriteres mer enn andre. Hva som skal prioriteres har tradisjonelt vært et politisk ansvar og ikke en faglig oppgave for embetsverket. Government finance to nongovernmental {{organizations}} - The Norwegian Ship Preservation Association {{as a case}} study. This thesis investigates what is involved when the responsibility for financing a nongovernmental organization (NGO) goes from department to directorate level. The case study in this thesis is The Norwegian Ship Preservation Association, where the responsibility for financing the organization was transferred from the Ministry of the Environment to the Directorate for Cultural Heritage in 2012. The study builds on earlier research and literature on public administration and NGOs, data from document analysis and interviews with employees from: the Ministry of the Environments, political leadership in the Ministry of the Environments, the Directorate for Cultural Heritage and five NGOs. The Department`s grounds for the restructuring are that the Directorate is better able to evaluate the NGOs technical and social benefits. The Directorate for Cultural Heritage has expertise on cultural heritage, but lacks expertise to evaluate the NGOs and their social benefits. To transfer the responsibility of financing The Norwegian Ship Preservation Association to The Directorate for Cultural Heritage may lead to greater transaction costs and unclear distribution of responsibility. The Directorate for Cultural Heritage and The Norwegian Ship Preservation Association both work for vessel protection while they have different roles and perspective. As an expert, it is natural for the Directorate {{to focus on the}} academic as well as it is in a position of power. If the relationship and cooperation between The Directorate for Cultural Heritage and The Norwegian Ship Preservation Association becomes too close, there is a danger that it will lead to a uniform field where the professional <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> protection is given too much emphasis. NGOs are trying to adapt to government rules to get the highest financial support possible. If the Directorate places greater constraints in the new regulations for the grant, the consequence will be that the Directorate has influence over basic premises for an NGO. This is in conflict with the very foundations of NGOs that have arisen in civil society outside of government regulations. 7 That there is no uniform administrative practice even within the same field, cultural heritage conservation, can lead to unstandardized or discriminatory treatment. This in turn will lead to some sectors being given higher priorities than others, which has hitherto been a political rather than an administrative responsibility. Master i styring og ledels...|$|E

40|$|The human {{vasculature}} {{is critical}} to healthy functioning of the tissues {{of the body and}} a major factor in main-taining homeostasis is the endothelial barrier. In the brain, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is highly specialized in order to sustain the neural tissue. Here, we have examined the effects of radiation on BBB models using a unique variety of endpoints to assess barrier function. These include trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), morphological effects, lo-calization of adhesion and cell junction proteins (in two-dimensional monolayers and in three-dimensional tissue models) and permeability of molecules through the endothelial barrier. Two culture conditions were used to represent conditions on the inside or the lumen <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> and conditions on the outside or ablumenal <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> For the lumen, cells were cultured in serum and growth factor containing media, and for the ablumenal <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels,</b> cells were cultured in serum-free defined media. Initial experiments with gamma rays in serum-free conditions revealed a previously unknown acute effect involving cell detachment and the loss of the clinically relevant cell adhesion molecule—cell platelet endothelial adhesion molecule (PECAM) - 1 [1]. Gamma radiation (5 Gy) induced a rapid and transient de-crease in TEER at 3 h, with effects also seen at the lower radiotherapy dose of 2 Gy. This dip in resistance cor-related with the transient loss PECAM- 1 in discrete areas where cells often detached from the monolaye...|$|R
