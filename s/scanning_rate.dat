40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> on the {{morphology}} and properties of polyaniline {{has been investigated}} for samples deposited electrochemically on nickel from sulfuric acid solution. A nanofibrilar network structure has been obtained for low <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> (10, 25 and 50 mV s- 1) whereas for the highest <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> (100 mV s- 1) the structure was more compact, the nanofibrils aggregated and their features were not very obvious. Both diameter and length of nanofibers are <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> dependent, decreasing from 140 to 90 nm and from 1. 35 to 0. 72 μm when the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> is increased from 10 to 50 mV s- 1. The nanofiber network {{tends to be more}} compact and with less free-volume as the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> is increased. Generally, high specific capacitances and low charge transfer resistance values are obtained for all nanofibrilar polyaniline films as compared to the compact structure. The optimum <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> for deposition was found to be 25 mV s- 1, leading to the highest specific capacitance and lowest charge transfer resistance...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5 a–e, with the {{increase}} of <b>scan</b> <b>rates,</b> the redox peaks shift to higher and lower potentials, respectively. The potential difference between oxidation peaks and reduction peaks also increased {{with the increase}}d <b>scan</b> <b>rate.</b> It indicates that the irreversible degree and the quasi-reversible reaction are increased {{with the increase of}} <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> [36, 41]. The shift is mainly related to the internal resistance of the electrode and the polarization caused by high <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> [36, 42]. A near linearly relationship between redox peaks potentials and the square root of the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> was observed, which {{can be seen in the}} inset of Fig.  5 f.

50|$|PsF was {{designed}} to simplify the conversion of cinematic content to different video standards, and {{as a means of}} video exchange between networks and broadcasters worldwide. Brought to life by the movie industry in the end of the 1990s, the original PsF specification was focused on 24 frame/s content, resulting in existing interlaced equipment having to be modified for 48 Hz <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> in order to work properly with 24 frame/s content.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{the term}} {{can refer to}} the process itself, the {{equipment}} used for the procedure (a 16 mm or 35 mm movie camera mounted {{in front of a}} video monitor, and synchronized to the monitor's <b>scanning</b> <b>rate),</b> or a film made using the process. Kinescopes were the only practical way to preserve live television broadcasts prior to the introduction of videotape in 1956. A small number of theatrically released feature films have also been produced as kinescopes.|$|E
50|$|The audio, video, and {{metadata}} are packaged into 80-byte Digital Interface Format (DIF) blocks {{which are}} multiplexed into a 150-block sequence. DIF blocks {{are the basic}} units of DV streams and can be stored as computer files in raw form or wrapped in such file formats as Audio Video Interleave (AVI), QuickTime (QT) and Material Exchange Format (MXF). One video frame is formed from either 10 or 12 such sequences, depending on <b>scanning</b> <b>rate,</b> which results in a data rate of about 25 Mbit/s for video, and an additional 1.5 Mbit/s for audio. When written to tape, each sequence corresponds to one complete track.|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} expressions, {{we can see}} that {{increasing}} the scan Window Size or Integration size increases the scan time and thus reduces the <b>Scan</b> <b>Rate.</b> However, increasing the Step Size decreases the <b>Scan</b> <b>Rate.</b>|$|R

50|$|To {{access the}} {{steady-state}} region the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> must be dropped. As <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> are slowed, the relative currents also drop {{at a given}} point reducing {{the reliability of the}} measurement. The low ratio of diffusion layer volume to electrode surface area means regular stationary electrodes can not be dropped low enough before their current measurements become unreliable. In contrast, the ratio of diffusion layer volume to electrode surface area is much higher for UME. When the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> of UME is dropped it quickly enters the steady-state regime at useful <b>scan</b> <b>rates.</b> Even though UME supply small total currents their steady-state currents are high compared to regular electrodes.|$|R
50|$|The Mk. IX {{allowed the}} <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> {{to be set}} at 8, 16 or 32 RPM. Additionally, the IX {{included}} the ability to perform a sector scan, limiting {{the movement of the}} scanner so instead of performing complete circles it scanned back and forth across a smaller angle. This provided much more rapid updates of the selected area, which was needed in order to account for the much higher speed of the aircraft. This was especially useful on the v-force, where the radar's location in the nose made it difficult to scan to the rear anyway, and at best some 60 to 90 degrees was always blocked.|$|E
50|$|Yet {{the various}} {{television}} systems were not {{originally designed to}} be compatible with film at all. Traditional, narrow-screen movies are projected onto a television camera either so that {{the top of the}} screens line up to show facial features, or, for films with subtitles, the bottoms. What this means is that filmed newspapers or long captions filling the screen for explanation are cut off at each end. Similarly, while the frame rate of sound films is 24 per second, the screen <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> of the NTSC is 29.97 Hz (per second), which requires a complex scanning schedule. That of PAL and SECAM are 50 Hz, which means that films are shortened (and the sound is offkey) by scanning each frame twice for 25 per second.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{subsampling}} {{that occurs}} during broadcast, many professional video recording formats do not deliver full horizontal resolution as well. For example, frame size of 1080-line HDCAM format is 1440x1080, frame size of 1080-line DVCPRO HD format is either 1440x1080 or 1280x1080 depending on <b>scanning</b> <b>rate,</b> frame size of 720-line DVCPRO HD format is 960x720. Horizontal downsampling {{is used in}} preference to vertical downsampling because vertical downsampling would break any interlacing, and also because Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays (which were still common when the HD formats were standardised) scan horizontal rows continuously, but vertical lines discretely, making changes to vertical resolution more visible on such displays. The situation has begun to change with launch of newer video recording formats that use full 1920x1080 raster, like XDCAM HD422 or AVC-Intra.|$|E
30|$|Relation of the redox current {{intensity}} of the modified electrode to the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> and {{the root of the}} <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated (curves not shown), which revealed that the {{current intensity}} was proportional to the root of the <b>scan</b> <b>rate.</b> This feature suggests that, compared to the diffusion layer, the present pythio-MWNT-Cyt c SAMs was rather thicker. These results are also in agreement with our previous work on the LB films of MWNTs-hydrogenase, wherein it was revealed that, because of the different diameters of nanotubes, the current intensity was proportional to the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> for the electrodes modified with the LB films of pure proteins and their composites with single-walled carbon nanotubes, but to the root of <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> for those modified with the LB films of MWNTs [13]. The redox reaction of Cyt c in the present SAMs was a diffusion control process.|$|R
5000|$|Every {{electrode}} has a {{range of}} <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> called the linear region. The response to a reversible redox couple in the linear region is a [...] "diffusion controlled peak" [...] which can be modeled with the Cottrell equation. The upper limit of the useful linear region is bound by an excess of charging current combined with distortions created from large peak currents and associated resistance. The charging current scales linearly with <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> while the peak current, which contains the useful information, scales with the square root of <b>scan</b> <b>rate.</b> As <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> increase, the relative peak response diminishes. Some of the charge current can be mitigated with RC compensation and/or mathematically removed after the experiment. However, the distortions resulting from increased current and the associated resistance cannot be subtracted. These distortions ultimately limit the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> for which an electrode is useful. For example, a working electrode with a radius of 1.0 mm is not useful for experiments much greater than 500 mV/s.|$|R
50|$|In cyclic voltammetry, the Randles-Sevcik {{equation}} {{describes the}} effect of <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> on the peak current ip.

50|$|The {{frequency}} {{spectrum of the}} modulated color signal overlaps that of the baseband signal, and separation relies {{on the fact that}} frequency components of the baseband signal tend to be near harmonics of the horizontal <b>scanning</b> <b>rate,</b> while the color carrier is selected to be an odd multiple of half the horizontal scanning rate; this produces a modulated color signal that consists mainly of harmonic frequencies that fall between the harmonics in the baseband luma signal, rather than both being in separate continuous frequency bands alongside each other in the frequency domain. In other words, the combination of luma and chroma is indeed a frequency-division technique, but it is much more complex than typical frequency-division multiplexing systems like the one used to multiplex analog radio stations on both the AM and FM bands.|$|E
50|$|In a large group, it is {{possible}} for an individual to cheat by scanning less than other members of the group without having any negative effect on the collective vigilance of the group. Cheating would seem to be the most beneficial strategy as the individual still benefits from the collective detection of the group while being able to feed more than other individuals. However, cheating is not a stable strategy because if all members of the group did it, then there would be no collective vigilance. Adopting a very high level of vigilance in a group is also not a stable strategy as an individual who adopts a lower level of vigilance would have a greater advantage. The evolutionarily stable (ESS) <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> is the rate that if all group members adopted, an individual that scanned more or less frequently would have a lower chance of survival.|$|E
5000|$|Hand-held {{document}} scanners are manual {{devices that}} are dragged {{across the surface}} of the image to be scanned by hand. Scanning documents in this manner requires a steady hand, as an uneven <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> produces distorted images; an indicator light on the scanner indicates if motion is too fast. They typically have a [...] "start" [...] button, which is held by the user for the duration of the scan; some switches to set the optical resolution; and a roller, which generates a clock pulse for synchronization with the computer. Older hand scanners were monochrome, and produced light from an array of green LEDs to illuminate the image"; later ones scan in monochrome or color, as desired. A hand scanner may have a small window through which the document being scanned could be viewed. In the early 1990s many hand scanners had a proprietary interface module specific to a particular type of computer, such as an Atari ST or Commodore Amiga. Since the introduction of the USB standard, it is the interface most commonly used. As hand scanners are much narrower than most normal document or book sizes, software (or the end user) needed to combine several narrow [...] "strips" [...] of scanned document to produce the finished article.|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 c, d {{presents}} the specific capacitance comparison of CNFs and AC from 5 to 500  mV/s <b>scan</b> <b>rates.</b> As {{it can be}} seen in Fig.  4 c, CNFs show highest specific capacitance 52  F/g at <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> of 5  mV/s. The specific capacitance decreased to 32  F/g at 500  mV/s <b>scan</b> <b>rate.</b> These results indicate the moderate decrease in specific capacitance, and at even higher <b>scan</b> <b>rates,</b> most of the surface area and pores of CNFs are accessible to the ions. The capacitance of AC decreases from 334 to 50  F/g for 5 to 500  mV/s Fig.  4 d. Very high specific capacitance at low <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> is due to ions have enough time to go deep inside the microporous (less than 2  nm) structure of AC. It can be presumed that at higher <b>scan</b> <b>rates,</b> mostly the larger pores mesopores (2 – 50  nm) are contributing to capacitance. This is mainly due to the difference in diffusion rate of electrolyte in the pores of different size and also due to network connection between large and small pores [23]. As discussed by A.G. Pandolofo et al., the measured surface area is contributed by the all the open pores, but all pores are not accessibly electrochemically [8].|$|R
50|$|Unlike atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy, {{which can only}} measure a single element at a time, ICP-MS has the capability to scan for all elements simultaneously. This allows rapid sample processing. A simultaneous ICP-MS that can record the entire analytical spectrum from lithium to uranium in every analysis won the Silver Award at the 2010 Pittcon Editors' Awards. An ICP-MS may use multiple scan modes, each one striking a different balance between speed and precision. Using the magnet alone to scan is slow, due to hysteresis, but is precise. Electrostatic plates {{can be used in}} addition to the magnet to increase the speed, and this, combined with multiple collectors, can allow a scan of every element from Lithium 6 to Uranium Oxide 256 in {{less than a quarter of}} a second. For low detection limits, interfering species and high precision, the counting time can increase substantially. The rapid scanning, large dynamic range and large mass range is ideally suited to measuring multiple unknown concentrations and isotope ratios in samples that have had minimal preparation (an advantage over TIMS), for example seawater, urine, and digested whole rock samples. It also lends well to laser ablated rock samples, where the <b>scanning</b> <b>rate</b> is so quick that a real time plot of any number of isotopes is possible.This also allows easy spatial mapping of mineral grains.|$|E

Therefore, foraging Ruffs were filmed at four different salt ponds, with a final total of 681 film sequences being available for analysis. To test for effects of predictor variables on <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> (number of <b>scans</b> per 30  s) of foraging Ruffs, generalised linear models (GLMs) were calculated including all variables and all possible subsets.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of {{constraints}} on pre-ejection dynamical states which cause differential resolution in resonance ejection experiments using Paul traps with stretched geometry. Both analytical and numerical computations are carried out to elucidate the role of damping and <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> in influencing coherence in ion motion associated with the forward and reverse scan. Adopting the Dehmelt approximation, our analytical study is carried out on a damped, driven Duffing oscillator with positive octopole nonlinearity. Using the method of multiple scales, we derive approximate slow flow equations which describe the ion motion. The phase portraits generated from the slow flow equations, {{in the vicinity of}} the jump, display two stable equilibria (centers) and an unstable fixed point (saddle). Numerical studies on the original equation are used to understand the influence of damping and <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> in causing coherent ion ejection in these experiments. In the forward scan experiments, for a given damping, low <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> result in coherent motion of ions of a given mass at the jump point. At this point, the amplitude and phase of ions of a given mass, starting at different initial conditions, become effectively identical. As the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> is increased, coherence is destroyed. For a given <b>scan</b> <b>rate,</b> increasing damping introduces coherence in ion motion, while decreasing damping destroys this coherence. In reverse scan experiments, for a given damping, very low <b>scan</b> <b>rates</b> will cause coherent ion motion. Increasing the <b>scan</b> <b>rate</b> destroys this coherence. The effect of damping in reverse scan experiments is qualitatively similar to that in the forward scan experiments, but settling times in the forward scan are shorter, leading to improved coherence and resolution.
