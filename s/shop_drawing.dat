50|$|A <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> is {{a drawing}} {{or set of}} {{drawings}} produced by the contractor, supplier, manufacturer, subcontractor, or fabricator. Shop drawings are typically required for prefabricated components. Examples of these include: elevators, structural steel, trusses, pre-cast concrete, windows, appliances, cabinets, air handling units, and millwork. Also critical are the installation and coordination shop drawings of the MEP trades such as sheet metal ductwork, piping, plumbing, fire protection, and electrical. Shop drawings are produced by contractors and suppliers under their contract with the owner. The <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> is the manufacturer’s or the contractor’s drawn version of information shown in the construction documents. The <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> normally shows more detail than the construction documents. It is drawn to explain the fabrication and/or installation of the items to the manufacturer’s production crew or contractor's installation crews. The style of the <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> is usually {{very different from that}} of the architect’s drawing. The shop drawing’s primary emphasis is on the particular product or installation and excludes notation concerning other products and installations, unless integration with the subject product is necessary.|$|E

The Monster, like the stylistically similar 1901 British film The Haunted Curiosity <b>Shop,</b> <b>drew</b> heavily on Western conceptions of Ancient Egypt for design elements {{as well as}} for a sense of ancient ritualism and occultism. The film is not a narrative-centered work, but rather a trick film in which the Ancient Egyptian elements, filtered through a long tradition of representation and popularity in Western culture, contribute to the sense of magic.|$|R

50|$|The shop {{drawings}} {{should include}} {{information for the}} architect and engineer to compare to the specifications and drawings. The <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> should address the appearance, performance, and prescriptive descriptions in the specifications and construction drawings.The <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> often is more detailed than the information shown in the construction documents to give the architect and engineer the opportunity to review the fabricator’s version of the product, prior to fabrication. References to the construction documents, drawings, and specifications assist the architect and engineer in their review of the shop drawings. Attachment of manufacturer’s material specifications, “catalog cut sheets,” and other manufacturer’s information {{may be helpful to}} accompany these drawings. Because shop drawings facilitate the architect’s and engineer’s approval of the product, they should be as clear and complete as possible.|$|E

50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the river was}} {{supplemented}} as Callicoon's connection to the wider world by the New York and Erie Railroad's Delaware Division, which established a station in the small settlement, where trains stopped on their way between the Great Lakes and New York City. It grew in population, and by 1875 the local lumber industry reached its peak, with over 3,000 rafts leaving the village for markets and mills downriver. Other forest-product industries followed. Tanneries set up <b>shop,</b> <b>drawn</b> by the abundant Eastern Hemlock in the woods {{on both sides of}} the river, and a paper mill flourished until it burned down in 1879.|$|R
50|$|Notes {{concerning}} {{changes or}} differences {{from the original}} documents should {{be made on the}} <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> for the architect’s and engineer’s approval. Ultimately, they are responsible for changes in these drawings and should have the opportunity to analyze any modifications. A dialogue should occur between the fabricator and the architect and engineer about any areas needing clarification. Successful installations are the result of collaboration between the designer, fabricator, and contractor.|$|E
50|$|Tekla Structures is 3D {{building}} information modeling (BIM) software {{used in the}} building and construction industries for steel and concrete detailing, precast and cast in-situ. The software enables users to create and manage 3D structural models in concrete or steel, and guides them through the process from concept to fabrication. The process of <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> creation is automated.

50|$|Concrete {{reinforcing}} {{is one of}} {{the many}} items requiring specialized shop drawings for the fabrication of the material. Concrete reinforcing is custom-fabricated from 60-foot-long reinforcing bars.The reinforcing bars are cut to length and bent to specific configurations. The <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> and the accompanying “cut sheet” lists the quantity, sizes, lengths, and shapes of the reinforcing bar. This information is provided for review by the structural engineer to ensure that sufficient reinforcing is being supplied; fabrication of the bar by the supplier’s shop; an inventory list for the contractor, upon delivery the typical project has thousands of pieces of reinforcing steel that need to be organized for storage and installation; and placement by the ironworker. The Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) has developed standard symbols, graphics, and formats for shop drawings and cut sheets that generally are used by reinforcing steel fabricators. Each fabricator, has particular style for shop drawings and cut sheets, depending on the draftspeople and Computer-aided design systems. Examples of software used are Advance Concrete, AutoCAD, MicroStation, ProConcrete and Tekla Structures.|$|E

Mobile phones enable consumers to access, store, and process information in new ways; supporting new modes of social shopping, enabling consumers to change the experience of shopping, and making them better equipped economic actors with more access to financial systems and new calculative capacities. While this new agency is beneficial to consumers, it also causes them stress and anxiety...|$|R

5000|$|Typically, the {{architect}} {{will review the}} submittal for compliance to the requirement in the construction documents. Revisions may be noted on the submittal. Colors and other selection items {{will be made by}} {{the architect}} during this review. Sometimes the architect will reject the entire submittal and other times will request resubmittal of some of the items. The architect also will make corrections, which normally {{do not need to be}} resubmitted, but that do need to be applied to the product. While the architect and engineers review products for performance and design intent, the contractor must review the product for preparation, quantity and installation requirements. [...] The contractor should manage the submittal process just like any other process in the construction cycle. The submittal process requires lead-time consideration to produce the submittal, <b>shop</b> <b>drawing</b> (engineering), review and revise and the shop fabrication period. Careful planning is necessary to ensure that the products are ordered and delivered within the construction schedule, so as not to delay any activities. The contractor must prioritize the submittal process, submitting and obtaining approval for materials needed for the first part of the project.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, Matt Browne and Martyn Nelson formed King Adora in Birmingham, England, {{after leaving}} their {{respective}} bands the Blaggards and the Joylanders. Both bands regularly {{played at the}} Flapper & Firkin in the city centre and the Jug Of Ale in Moseley was another popular hotspot. The first song the pair wrote was Friday Night Explodes, which explored their experiences of working all week and getting drunk at Snobs nightclub in the city every Friday night. They later added Walsall-based bassist Robert Grimmit, who {{was the only person}} to attend the bass auditions. While out celebrating Grimmit's arrival, the band completed the lineup by adding drummer Dan Dabrowski, who cancelled plans to move to Nottingham in order to join. King Adora's name was reputedly taken from an oversized adult toy the band had seen in a sex <b>shop.</b> <b>Drawing</b> strong glam influences from the likes of Guns N' Roses, Mötley Crüe, Alice Cooper, T-Rex, David Bowie and Blondie, King Adora often drew comparisons to Suede, Pixies and early Manic Street Preachers.

50|$|Parkin {{was born}} in 1932, the second of two daughters, in Pontycymer in the Garw Valley, Glamorgan, Wales. She and her family moved to London {{to live with her}} {{grandparents}} when World War II began in 1939. Parkin passed her eleven plus exam and went to Willesden County Grammar School (now Capital City Academy). During the war, without her parents' knowledge, at the age of 12 she worked on a paper round in Dollis Hill, London, in the evenings. She told her mother that she was studying art after-hours at school. Her grandfather saw her delivering papers, however, and reported this to her mother who prevented her from continuing with the job and punished her by making her do housework. After this she earned a little money from a Mr Hill, their lodger, who took pity on her and paid her to clean his room. She idolised Hill, who she thought was a gentleman, and many years later saw similar characteristics in the actor James Robertson Justice. Later the family bought a tobacconist and newsagent shop, which employed four paperboys. When one of the paperboys was caught stealing money her mother had to fill his shift quickly and made Parkin, then aged 14, do his paper round instead. On her first day doing the job a car knocked her off her bicycle and she hit her head on the kerb. She was knocked unconscious, hospitalised, and spent about a year off school, convalescing. Parkin spent much of this period alone in her room above the <b>shop,</b> <b>drawing</b> and painting. This developed into an interest in the arts.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{household}} pre-purchase {{practices and}} their mediation by information and communications technologies (ICTs), specifically online grocery <b>shopping.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on practice theory, {{the impacts of}} ICTs on household grocery shopping behavior are conceptualized, {{and the concept of}} "front-loading" is introduced. Emerging themes generated from 31 semi-structured interviews conducted via Skype with Turkish consumers focusing on their experiences of online grocery practices are presented. To this end, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, an understanding of the domestication of online grocery shopping and its affect on the dynamics of household decision making, information sharing, and responsibilities of tasks before the actual act of online shopping is developed. Second, how such pre-purchase practices undertaken by consumers act as a catalyst of change at the industry level is appraised...|$|R
