The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re {{being asked to do}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> legal questions about.

[...] CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating, [...] "...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but many do not have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, does that make you any more innocent? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Today, the retrieval-failure hypothesis, {{concerning}} {{the function of}} the memory, is more widely accepted and popularized (Schöpper-Grabe 1998:237). It says that the storage of information happens on different levels. Therefore, information or memory is not deleted, but rather, the access to the current level is blocked. Thus, the information is not available. Hansen quotes Loftus & Loftus (1976) to describe forgetting: [...] " [...] much like being unable to find <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> misplaced somewhere" [...] (1999: 10). Cohen states, evidence for knowing that a learner is not able to [...] "find" [...] something, is the use of the so-called progressive retrieval (1986). Thereby, the learner is unable to express something that is in his mind and consequently uses an incorrect form. He eventually remembers the correct one (Cohen 1986; Olshtain 1989). Time is considered the decisive factor to measure how far the attrition has proceeded already (de Bot & Weltens, 1995).|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{systemic}} problems mentioned in previous compliance reports persist, however. [...] Primarily, our greatest concern remains {{the inability to}} locate missing children and taking parents in Mexico. [...] Although it does seem that the MCA is beginning to work more closely with the various branches of local law enforcement, including Interpol, {{there has not been}} a substantial change in the frequency with which children are found. [...] Secondly, cases continue to experience lengthy court delays, especially due to the excessive use of a special appeal process (the [...] "amparo") to block Convention proceedings almost indefinitely, and also due to the ability of the Mexican courts to reconsider factual determinations made by a lower court. [...] These case delays could be dealt with through the passage of implementing legislation to integrate the Convention into the Mexican legal system, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> urged Mexico to do in the past. [...] Finally, Mexico has participated in Department-sponsored training and conferences, but the Government of Mexico (GOM) has not taken sufficient lead to broaden the amount of training offered within its borders to judges, or to provide additional resources to the Mexican Central Authority. [...] As a result, we continue to see Convention cases mishandled as custody cases and not strictly as Convention (i.e. habitual residence) determinations. [...] As for enforcement of judicial orders for return, it seems the record in Mexico is mixed. [...] Although some mechanisms do exist to enforce court orders, they are not utilized consistently.|$|E

60|$|The fashionable fallacy {{is that by}} {{education}} we can give people <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not got.

These pages have, of course, no other general purpose than to point out that we cannot create anything good until we have conceived it. It is odd that these people, who in the matter of heredity are so sullenly attached to law, in the matter of environment seem almost to believe in miracle. They insist that nothing but what was in the bodies of the parents can go to make the bodies of the children. But they seem somehow to think that things can get into the heads of the children which were not in the heads of the parents, or, indeed, anywhere else.|$|E

It is through these prolongations of expectancy, this succession of one hope to another, that we live out long seasons of pleasure in a few hours' walk. It is in following these capricious sinuosities that we learn, only bit by bit and through one coquettish reticence after another, much as we learn {{the heart of a}} friend, the whole loveliness of the country. This disposition always preserves something new to be seen, and takes us, like a careful cicerone, to many different points of distant view before it allows us finally to approach the hoped-for destination.|$|E

60|$|Lastly, {{there is}} a fourth class of people who take {{whatever}} it is that they happen to want, and say that that is the ultimate aim of evolution. And these are the only sensible people. This is the only really healthy way with the word evolution, to work for what you want, and to call THAT evolution. The only intelligible sense that progress or advance can have among men, {{is that we have a}} definite vision, and that we wish to make the whole world like that vision. If you like to put it so, the essence of the doctrine is that what we have around us is the mere method and preparation for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to create. This is not a world, but rather the material for a world. God has given us not so much the colours of a picture as the colours of a palette. But he has also given us a subject, a model, a fixed vision. We must be clear about what we want to paint. This adds a further principle to our previous list of principles. We have said we must be fond of this world, even in order to change it. We now add that we must be fond of another world (real or imaginary) in order to have something to change it to.|$|E
6000|$|But {{this larger}} and more adventurous Christian {{universe}} has one final mark difficult to express; yet as a conclusion of the whole matter I will attempt to express it. All the real argument about religion turns {{on the question of}} whether a man who was born upside down can tell when he comes right way up. The primary paradox of Christianity is that the ordinary condition of man is not his sane or sensible condition; that the normal itself is an abnormality. That is the inmost philosophy of the Fall. In Sir Oliver Lodge's interesting new Catechism, the first two questions were: [...] "What are you?" [...] and [...] "What, then, is the meaning of the Fall of Man?" [...] I remember amusing myself by writing my own answers to the questions; but I soon found that they were very broken and agnostic answers. To the question, [...] "What are you?" [...] I could only answer, [...] "God knows." [...] And to the question, [...] "What is meant by the Fall?" [...] I could answer with complete sincerity, [...] "That whatever I am, I am not myself." [...] This is the prime paradox of our religion; <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> never in any full sense known, is not only better than ourselves, but even more natural to us than ourselves. And there is really no test of this except the merely experimental one with which these pages began, the test of the padded cell and the open door. It is only since I have known orthodoxy that I have known mental emancipation. But, in conclusion, it has one special application to the ultimate idea of joy.|$|E
60|$|Mr. MORLEY: I {{am afraid}} I must {{traverse}} my hon. friend's description of Mr. Bright's view, with which, I think, I am pretty well acquainted. Mr. Bright was, I believe, {{on the right}} track at the time, when in 1858 the Government of India was transferred to the Crown. He was not in favour of universal suffrage--he was rather old-fashioned--but Mr. Bright's proposal was perfectly different from that of my hon. friend. Sir Henry Maine, and others who had been concerned with Indian affairs, {{came to the conclusion that}} Mr. Bright's idea was right--that to put one man, a Viceroy, assisted as he might be with an effective Executive Council, in charge of such an area as India and its 300 millions of population, with all its different races, creeds, modes of thought, was to put on a Viceroy's shoulder a load that no man of whatever powers, however gigantic they might be, could be expected effectively to support. My hon. friend and others who sometimes favour me with criticisms in the same sense, seem to suggest that I am a false brother, that I do not know what Liberalism is. I think I do, and I must even say that I do not think I have anything to learn of the principles or maxims or the practice of Liberal doctrines even from my hon. friend. You are bound to look at the whole mass of the difficulties and perplexing problems connected with India, from a common-sense plane, and it is not common sense, if I may say so without discourtesy, to talk of Imperial Dumas. I have not had a word of thanks from that quarter, in the midst of a shower of reproach, for what I regard, in all its direct and indirect results and bearings, as one of the most important moves that have been made in connection with the relations between Great Britain and India for a long time--I mean, the admission of two Indian gentlemen to the Council of the Secretary of State. An hon. friend wants me to appoint an Indian gentleman to the Viceroy's Executive Council. Well, that is a different thing; but I am perfectly sure that, if an occasion offers, neither Lord Minto nor I would fall short of some such application of democratic principles. In itself it is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a Viceroy and a Secretary of State thoroughly alive to the great change in temperature and atmosphere that has been going on in India for the last five or six years, and I do not think we ought to be too impatiently judged. We came in at a perturbed time; we did not find balmy breezes and smooth waters. It is notorious that we came into enormous difficulties, which we had not created. How they were created is a long story that has nothing whatever to do with the present discussion. But what I submit with the utmost confidence is that the situation to-day is a considerable improvement on the situation that we found, when we assumed power two years ago. There have been heavy and black clouds over the Indian horizon during those two years. By our policy those clouds have been to some extent dispersed. I am not so unwise as to say that the clouds will never come back again; but what has been done by us has been justified, in my opinion, by the event.|$|E

This is true for at least two types of feed: the delta-function generator and the frill generator. For the case of subsectional basis functions in Galerkin's method, recent papers have shown that the main associated difficulty is the unavoidable appearance of oscillations near the center and/or the ends of the antenna.
