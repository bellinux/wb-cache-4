How cruel this is for me, since you have become very dear to me not just as a composer, but also as the splendid person you are. I must therefore call out to you a written Grüß Gott, and, if He grants it, Auf Wiedersehen we meet!". The Fifth Symphony was received very warmly at Tchaikovsky's concert in Hamburg, dispelling his earlier doubts about this work. However, as Modest Tchaikovsky observed in his biography of the composer: [...] "The agreeable impression of that evening was <b>slightly</b> <b>clouded</b> by the fact that Avé-Lallemant, to whom the symphony is dedicated, was unable to attend the concert due to ill health. For Pyotr Ilyich had set such store on his being there, he had been so keen to know his opinion! Before the concert the old man sent a letter with many blessings and wishing him success, but he did not get to hear the symphony itself". It seems very likely that Tchaikovsky did not meet Avé-Lallemant at all during his brief stay in Hamburg on that occasion (already on 4/16 March, the day after the concert, he left for Hanover), but he did keep his promise of providing Avé-Lallemant's wife with a portrait photograph of himself — it was in fact one of the prints made, at Avé-Lallemant's instigation, by the Hamburg photographer E.

60|$|If I did {{not entirely}} {{participate}} in this roseate view {{it may have been}} because Enriquez, although a few years my senior, was much younger-looking, and with his demure deviltry of eye, and his upper lip close shaven for this occasion, he suggested a depraved acolyte rather than a responsible member of a family. Consuelo had also confided to me that her father--possibly owing to some rumors of our previous escapade--had forbidden any further excursions with me alone. The innocent man did not know that Chu Chu had forbidden it also, and that even on this momentous occasion both Enriquez and myself were obliged to ride in opposite fields like out flankers. But we nevertheless felt the full guilt of disobedience added to our desperate enterprise. Meanwhile, although pressed for time, and subject to discovery at any moment, I managed at certain points of the road to dismount and walk beside Chu Chu (who did not seem to recognize me on foot), holding Consuelo's hand in my own, with the discreet Enriquez leading my horse in the distant field. I retain a very vivid picture of that walk--the ascent of a gentle slope towards a prospect as yet unknown, but full of glorious possibilities; the tender dropping light of an autumn <b>sky,</b> <b>slightly</b> filmed with the promise of the future rains, like foreshadowed tears, and the half frightened, half serious talk into which Consuelo and I had insensibly fallen. And then, I don't know how it happened, but as we reached the summit Chu Chu suddenly reared, wheeled, and the next moment was flying back along the road we had just traveled, {{at the top of her}} speed! It might have been that, after her abstracted fashion, she only at that moment detected my presence; but so sudden and complete was her evolution that before I could regain my horse from the astonished Enriquez she was already a quarter of a mile on the homeward stretch, with the frantic Consuelo pulling hopelessly at the bridle. We started in pursuit. But a horrible despair seized us. To attempt to overtake her, to even follow at the same rate of speed would only excite Chu Chu and endanger Consuelo's life. There was absolutely no help for it, nothing could be done; the mare had taken her determined long, continuous stride, the road was a straight, steady descent all the way back to the village, Chu Chu had the bit between her teeth, and there was no prospect of swerving her. We could only follow hopelessly, idiotically, furiously, until Chu Chu dashed triumphantly into the Saltellos' courtyard, carrying the half-fainting Consuelo back to the arms of her assembled and astonished family.|$|R

A reanalysis which will extend the present data set back to 1979 and up to now is at present in preparation.

Contrails form when the hot and humid exhaust gases from the combustion of fuels by an aircraft mix with the ambient, cold atmosphere. Their persistence depends on upper tropospheric relative humidity. Trends of seasonal mean effective high cloud amount have been analyzed in regions with high and low air traffic density.

To do this, a simple rotation mechanism, turning at a constant speed of one revolution per day or 15 degrees per hour, is adequate for many purposes, such as keeping a photovoltaic panel pointing within a few degrees of the Sun, but for accurate tracking, such as may be needed to keep a telescope aimed at the Sun, the equation of time must be taken into account, so the tracker moves according to apparent solar time, often called [...] "sundial time". The speed of the apparent motion of the Sun in the <b>sky</b> varies <b>slightly,</b> depending on the time of year, for reasons which are explained in the article Equation of time#Explanations for the major components of the equation of time. This causes the reading of a sundial to advance at a varying rate. The tracker contains a mechanism that takes account of the equation of time and makes the tracker move according to sundial time. For example, it turns 15 degrees in one hour as measured by a sundial, which may be slightly longer or shorter than an hour as measured by a clock. So the tracker's movement is governed by sundial time, which in turn is governed by the movement of the Sun in the sky. This makes the tracker accurately keep pace with the Sun.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{negative}} effects of artificial light at night, measurement data are often necessary. These can be acquired from ground or satellite-based measurements. Satellite-based observations of artificial light have an advantage of global coverage. Since the launch of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day-Night Band (DNB) provides a tool for worldwide night time remote sensing for various applications, including artificial light. We used the data in year 2015 from the VIIRS-DNB sensor to study the angular distribution of artificial light in major cities and metropoles in Europe. Despite encountering some issues, for example low overflight rate with cloud-free sky condition, we are able to investigate the angular distributions of upwelling artificial light emission for 74 regions, almost all of which emit more light near the horizon. In comparison to satellite-based observations, ground-based measurements can acquire data more frequently. An international campaign studying variations of night sky at 44 worldwide locations was conducted in 2011 and 2012, measuring the night sky using broadband radiometers, the Sky Quality Meters (SQMs), and was the first time comparing ground-based night sky measurement in a unified analysis procedure. The presence of artificial light reverses the variation pattern of sky brightness at cloudy nights. Instead of darkening of night sky by blockage of extraterrestrial light sources, clouds backscatter the artificial light emitted from ground, brighting the night sky. Comparison with daytime aerosol measurement data did not yield a consistent relationship between the aerosol content and night sky brightness for the rural site in Cabauw, the Netherlands, but found the brightening of the night sky of Madrid with increasing atmospheric aerosol load. Long-term monitoring of the night sky enables us to observe the change in skyglow pattern over a long period. Two SQMs have been set up in a suburban site and a rural site in Bremen, Germany since December 2011. The night sky of the suburban site is found to be brighter during cloudy nights and becomes darker {{during the course of the}} night, which is typical for a light-polluted location. While instrumental issues cannot be ruled out, we found a decrease of sky brightness over a span of about 4. 5 years, with a stronger decreasing trend at late hours of the night. For the rural site, the local public and domestic lightings are the dominating light source, contributing to the larger skyglow in the early hours of the night. However, with domestic and public lighting switched off as the night progresses, the variation pattern of the night sky is typical for a location with less light pollution, where the overcast <b>sky</b> is only <b>slightly</b> different in brightness from clear sky. It is suspected that this trend in the change of sky brightness originates from the gradual decrease of output of the public lighting system due to aging, while the progress replacing the public lighting to light-emitting diode (LED) devices is slow.

Cycle of paintings “Funeral symphony”, first part of tryptic “Rex” and painting “Night” are also influenced by Böcklin as it is described by art critics A. Savickas and V. Landsbergis. Influence of Böcklin in Čiurlionis’ music is not so evident. Here it is possible to talk about such influence only on very general level and partly expressed ideas of death, fatality and eternity. Nevertheless Čiurlionis titled some of his late symphonic poems as “Creation of the World”, “Dies irae” which links our mind with basic ideas of human life. The genesis of the symphonic poem “Dies irae” is analysed for the first time. Reasons and circumstances of disappearance of the poem from the research discourse during the 20 th century are also explained. The first question concerns the date when the symphonic poem was composed. A signed date of 1 February 1910 at the end of the score means only the final date when the manuscript was finished. Another composition written in the same manuscript book before “Dies irae” is the symphonic poem “Creation of the World” dated 15 March 1907, Warsaw. So it is possible that the symphonic poem “Dies irae” was created between 1907 and 1910 and only rewritten into one manuscript book together with previous compositions on 1 February 1910. In the analysis of the symphonic poem thematic and structural features are presented together with the explanation of new principles of music composition – the specific way to organize musical elements according to the principles of visual art. There are a lot of themes used in the symphonic poem “Dies irae” and they are used like visual icons with minimum transformations. Only different ways of comparing these themes between themselves is used instead of thematic evaluation. This influenced the main structure of the poem. There are features of 3 part recapitulative structure as well as concentric form (symmetrical, 5 parts) and sonata allegro form as well.
