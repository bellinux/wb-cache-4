40|$|AIM: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the dietary intake and physical activity levels of children while attending childcare. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 18 centre-based childcare services in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. Childcare service characteristics were assessed via telephone interview. Child dietary intake and physical activity levels were assessed during a one-day observation conducted at participating childcare services using previously validated tools. RESULTS: Children consumed a mean <b>of</b> 0. 2 <b>serves</b> <b>of</b> vegetables, 0. 7 <b>serves</b> <b>of</b> fruit, 1. 4 <b>serves</b> <b>of</b> grain (cereal) foods, 0. 1 <b>serves</b> <b>of</b> lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds and legumes/beans, 0. 6 <b>serves</b> <b>of</b> milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives, and 0. 7 <b>serves</b> <b>of</b> discretionary foods during attendance at childcare. Of all child physical activity counts, 48. 6 % were classified as 'sedentary', and 22. 3 % classified as 'very active'. Bivariate analyses indicated that children attending services located in rural areas consumed significantly more <b>serves</b> <b>of</b> vegetables (0. 3 serves (SD 0. 7) vs 0. 1 serves (SD 0. 2), P = 0. 05). Multivariate analyses indicated that services with large child enrolments had a significantly greater proportion of child counts classified as 'very active' (23. 6 % of child counts (95 % CI 1. 6, 29. 5) vs 14. 9 % of child counts (95 % CI 9. 1, 20. 6), P = 0. 007). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable scope to improve the diet and activity behaviours of children during attendance at childcare. Future research is needed to identify effective strategies to best support childcare services in implementing policies and practices to improve such behaviours in children...|$|R
5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford.

5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E

5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the <b>serving</b> <b>of</b> alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E
