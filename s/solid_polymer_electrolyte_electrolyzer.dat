Equimolar solutions of p-nitrotoluene and p-nitrophenol and equimolar solutions of o- and p-nitrotoluene {{were subjected to}} electroreduction on Cu,Pt-Nation.

However, current lithium ion batteries with liquid electrolyte have been suffering from potential safety crisis mainly due to their highly flammable organic liquid carbonate organic electrolyte and explosion hazards. These potential risks (combustion and explosion) would retard the commercialization of electric vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles. Thus, the safety issue of lithium ion battery merits further study. Solid electrolytes have attracted ever-increasing interest owing to their enhanced safety issue and higher energy density of lithium battery. Solid electrolyte materials mainly include inorganic solid <b>electrolytes</b> (ISEs) and <b>solid</b> <b>polymer</b> <b>electrolytes</b> (SPEs). The ISEs are classified into oxide-based, sulfide-based and etc. However, {{in spite of the}} presence of highly ion conductive ISEs, there are still many undergoing issues that limit the practical application at the present stage, like the large interface impedance between electrode and ISEs and the difficulty of processing. More {{attention has been paid to}} <b>solid</b> <b>polymer</b> <b>electrolytes</b> due to their superior flexibility and processability, which are also subjected to thermal expansion at elevated temperature. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) <b>solid</b> <b>polymer</b> <b>electrolyte</b> has undergone a sort of renaissance in the past few decades.
