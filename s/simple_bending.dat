A cornice brake only allows for <b>simple</b> <b>bends</b> and creases, while a box-and-pan brake also allows one to form box and pan shapes.

5000|$|Undulators {{can provide}} several orders of {{magnitude}} higher flux than a <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. For an undulator with N periods, the brightness can be up to [...] more than a bending magnet. The first factor of N occurs because the intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. The usual pulse is a sine with some envelope. The second factor of N comes from {{the reduction of the}} emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced as 1/N. When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively, the undulator stays dark. The same is true, if they come as a bead chain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>bending</b> {{behavior}} in homogenous beams suggests ε increases with {{distance from the}} neutral axis (z). This poses a problem to animals, such as fishes and salamanders, which undergo undulatory movement. Muscle fibers are constrained by the length-tension and force-velocity curves. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that muscle fibers recruited for a particular task must operate within an optimal range of strains (ε) and contractile velocities to generate peak force and power respectively. Non-uniform ε generation during undulatory movement would force differing muscle fibers recruited for the same task to operate on differing portions of the length-tension and force-velocity curves; performance would not be optimal. Alexander predicted that the dorsoventral (α) and mediolateral (φ) orientation of the white fibers of the fish axial musculature may allow more uniform strain across varying mesolateral fiber distances. Unfortunately, the white muscle fiber musculature of fishes is too complex to study uniform strain generation; however, Azizi et al. studied this phenomenon using a simplified salamander model.|$|E
5000|$|This drive towards {{lightening}} {{was based}} on a misunderstanding of the component's mechanical behaviour. The assumption for a H girder was that all of the resistance to bending stresses was carried in the two top and bottom flanges of the girder, with the central web only carrying out a spacing function. The central web could thus be drilled indiscriminately, supposedly without weakening the overall girder. This {{was based on}} two fallacies: firstly that the only forces on the beam were <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> forces in the plane of the web. In practice, a more complicated force, such as an unexpected torsional twisting from a sudden suspension bump overloaded the now-weakened central web and the lightened beam failed immediately. Secondly, the assumption that the ideal forces were separated into the top and bottom flanges was increasingly unrealistic with the development of stressed skin and monocoque designs, where loads were more evenly shared. In these designs there was no [...] "unloaded web" [...] that could be safely drilled.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{equations}} {{were developed}} for calculating the apparent elastic modulus {{and the strength}} of corn cob under quasi-static radial compression and <b>simple</b> <b>bending.</b> An empirical equation was derived for calculating its modulus of toughness. Experimental justification was provided for the application of the Hertz linear elastic contact theory in determining cob mechanical properties in radial compression, since the cob is a composite of three inelastic materials. In <b>simple</b> <b>bending,</b> the basic flexure formula was modified to account for the composite and tapered structure of the cob. The relative contributions of the macro-structural components of the corn cob to its mechanical properties were determined. Cob mechanical properties were found to be significantly affected by corn variety, harvest date and moisture content, but not by loading rate. Further experimental investigations showed that the cob mechanical properties were much dependent on fertilizer type and application rate but less dependent on soil type and condition...|$|E

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) {{are a new}} {{generation}} material which exhibits unique nonlinear deformations due to a phase transformation which allows it to return to its original shape after removal of stress or a change in temperature. It shows a shape memory effect (martensitic condition) and pseudoelasticity (austenitic condition) properties depends on various heat treatment conditions. The reason for these properties depends on phase transformation through temperature changes or applied stress. Many technological applications of austenite SMAs involve cyclical mechanical loading and unloading {{in order to take}} advantage of pseudoelasticity, but are limited due to poor fatigue life. In this thesis, I investigated two important mechanical feature to fatigue behavior in pseudoelastic NiTi SMA wires using high energy synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD). The first of these involved <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> and the second of these involved relaxation during compression loading. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed to identify the phase transformation temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected for the initial condition of the NiTi SMA wires and during <b>simple</b> <b>bending,</b> SEM revealed that micro-cracks in compression regions of the wire propagate with increasing bend angle, while tensile regions tend to not exhibit crack propagation. SR-XRD patterns were analyzed to study the phase transformation and investigate micromechanical properties. By observing the various diffraction peaks such as the austenite (200) and the martensite (100), (110), and (101) planes, intensities and residual strain values exhibit strong anisotropy depending upon whether the sample is in compression or tension during <b>simple</b> <b>bending.</b> This research provides insight into two specific mechanical features in pseudoelastic NiTi SMA wires...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} many {{submarine}} pipelines, especially for operating in deep water, relies on accurate test {{results for the}} local buckling collapse of pipe subjected to bending loading. Recent test results have shown apparently anomalous values of axial tensile and compressive strains {{in comparison to the}} values that would be expected {{on the basis of the}} <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> theory. This could have important consequences for the efficacy of the design factors derived using these anomalous results. Examples of anomalous test results are given in the paper and the cause of the differences between the strain values obtained in the tests and those expected on the basis of the <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> theory are explained using finite element modelling. The major point is that the general application of the simplified engineering theory of bending can be erroneous when ovalisation is imposed or, on the contrary, the boundary conditions of the section are restrained from ovalising deformations. This is a crucial limit state for the design of onshore and offshore pipelines...|$|E

40|$|Previous work {{indicates}} that shear properties of plastic laminates are {{a function of}} the shear properties of the bonding resin and therefore largely independent of the plane of the laminate. Direct and indirect tests involving shear properties in all planes of two similar, half inch thick hand lay-up panels, were conducted to test this hypothesis. The main correlation was {{made on the basis of}} apparent elastic modulus in <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> as a function of span-depth ratio. Curves for this value were calculated using an elastic solution accounting for load concentration effects. This calculation was made for various values of shear modulus as obtained by direct and indirect tests. Conclusions were drawn from a comparison of these curves, and an experimental curve for <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> tests over four span-depth ratios. In the latter tests, curvature was transverse to the plane of the laminate and so therefore were shear effects. Direct tests for shear modulus proved unsatisfactory, but the comparison of calculated apparent modulus, for shear modulus in the plane of the laminate, agreed within 2 % of the experimental curve. It is thought that further work will indicate that a single value of shear modulus will suffice for design purposes...|$|E
40|$|Earlier work on devising {{generalised}} noise prediction {{techniques for}} ventilation system elements based upon <b>simple</b> <b>bend</b> configurations {{has been extended}} {{to the study of}} the noise generated by branch take-offs. These configurations are more complex than <b>simple</b> <b>bends</b> as there is a divergence of the airflow. The simple semi-empirical technique proposed by Oldham and Ukpoho, based upon a modified version of the Nelson and Morfey equations, has been employed to collapse the experimental data. A good collapse of normalised data is seen for each component. Furthermore, a single collapsed data curve is proposed for each main/branch diameter ratio for all circular junctions. The resulting curves were found to be very similar for most configurations examined and to have a form similar to those of the bends considered in the earlier work. The general form is characterized by a region for which the Strouhal number is less than two over which the value of 20 log[K(St) ] falls at a rate of approximately of 40 dB per decade. For Strouhal numbers greater than two the curve is approximately linear and falls with increasing Strouhal number at a rate of approximately 65 dB per decade. The results indicate that a method based upon pressure loss characteristics could form the basis of a technique for predicting the airflow generated noise due to branch take-offs in circular ductwork. However, it is not proven that a single universal curve for the prediction of the airflow generated noise due to any duct component exists, but this work lends support to the theory that a range of component specific curves might exist and provide a means of accurately predicting airflow generated noise in ventilation systems...|$|R

40|$|With {{reference}} to eccentrically braced frames (EBFs), the issues regarding momentshear interaction in plastic design are examined. In particular, a procedure for computing the ultimate shear forces and end moments of intermediate links {{for a given}} collapse mechanism is presented. The requirements to be fulfilled are the yielding condition, the flow rule, the kinematic compatibility condition depending on the examined collapse mechanism and, finally, the minimisation of the internal work according to the kinematic theorem of plastic collapse. Moreover, through the definition of an equivalent moment, the link is modelled as an element with plastic hinges in <b>simple</b> <b>bending.</b> This is obtained by imposing the equivalence between the internal work developed by the actual link and the internal work corresponding to the simplified theoretical model. Therefore, moment-shear interaction in plastic design can {{be accounted for by}} means of formulations which are formally coincident with those commonly used for plastic hinges in <b>simple</b> <b>bending.</b> Finally, the kinematic theorem of plastic collapse is used to define the design requirements to be fulfilled to prevent yielding of the beam part outside of the link and yielding of the bracing element. The additional design rules to be satisfied for failure mode control of multi-storey EBFs are presented in a companion paper...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the design of {{submarine}} pipelines relies on accurate test results for the local buckling collapse of pipes subjected to bending loading. The present paper analyses apparently anomalous values of axial tensile and compressive strains from recent test results in comparison to the values that would be expected on the basis of <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> theory. This could have important consequences for the efficacy of the design factors derived using these results. The cause {{of the differences between the}} strain values obtained in the tests and those expected on the basis of <b>simple</b> <b>bending</b> theory are explained using finite element modelling. The differences result from the type of collars and supports commonly used in bending tests, the effects of which persist for a greater length along the test pipe than has hitherto been assumed. In general, it is pointed out that the application of the simplified engineering theory of bending can be erroneous when ovalisation is imposed or, on the contrary, the boundary conditions of the section are restrained from ovalising deformations. The influence of the D/t ratio is also analysed. The results contribute to the understanding of a crucial limit state for the design of onshore and offshore pipelines...|$|E
