5|$|Christian {{churches have}} existed in Greater Manchester since the Anglo-Saxon era, but no {{significant}} Saxon features remain in its listed churches, {{and the only}} Norman material {{is to be found}} in StLeonard, Middleton. The churches in this list fall into two main groups: those originating mainly from the medieval period, which are in Gothic style, and churches built during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly in Gothic Revival style, with only a few churches created between these periods. Gothic churches originating from the medieval era include Manchester Cathedral, StMary, Radcliffe, and StWerburgh Old Church, Warburton. Churches from the 19thcentury include <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finest</b> works of the leading architects of the period: George Gilbert Scott (StMark, Worsley), Alfred Waterhouse (StElisabeth, Reddish), George Frederick Bodley (StAugustine, Pendlebury), and Charles Barry (All Saints, Whitefield).

5|$|Parish church {{architecture}} in Scotland was often much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers.
