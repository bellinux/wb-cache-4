50|$|To {{produce this}} form of yellowcake, crushed ore is mixed with hot water to a 58% solids slurry. The solids slurry is then {{processed}} {{through a series of}} tanks, where sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate, and steam are used to extract the uranium from the solids slurry. The average leaching efficiency for this process is 98.5%. The uranium-bearing solution is then decanted and directed to a solvent extraction (SX) process for further purification. In this extraction step, the dissolved uranium is transferred from the feed solution into the organic solvent. Next a stripping step recovers the uranium into a sodium chloride aqueous phase after which the barren solvent is recycled. The average efficiency of the SX circuit is 99.9%. The high-grade “pregnant” <b>strip</b> <b>solution</b> from SX goes to the next stage where magnesia slurry is added to precipitate magnesium diuranate. The yellow cake precipitate is then thickened, dried, re-crushed and packed into industry standard 220 litre steel drums for shipment to customers.|$|E

Several <b>stripping</b> <b>solutions</b> containing different concentrations of zinc and iron in acid media obtained previously by the treatment of SPB by MBSX, were subjected to electrowinning to assess the efficiency and selectivity of zinc electrodeposition over iron under different operation conditions.

Finally, the increase in the applied current, promoted the increase in zinc fractional conversion and in the zinc space–time yield, while the zinc current efficiency was reduced due to the stronger effect of secondary reactions.

With 5 M HCl aqueous solution as the <b>strip</b> <b>solution,</b> we observed an initial indium permeability of 2. 4 × 10 − 4 m/min. However, the permeability decreases with time, dropping to about 3. 4 × 10 − 5 m/min after 200 min of operation. Evidence was obtained showing that hydrolysis of CTA occurred, causing a dramatic decrease in the feed pH (protons transported from strip to feed solutions) {{and a loss of}} extractant and plasticizer from the membrane, and then leading to the loss of indium permeability. To alleviate the problem of hydrolysis, we proposed an operation scheme called polymer inclusion membranes with strip dispersion: dispersing the <b>strip</b> <b>solution</b> in extractant-containing oil and then bringing the dispersion to contact with the polymer membrane. Since the strong acid was dispersed in oil, the membrane did not directly contact the strong acid at all times, and membrane hydrolysis was thus alleviated and the loss of indium permeability was effectively prevented.
