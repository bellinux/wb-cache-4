5000|$|In addition, 70 {{percent of}} the {{supported}} enterprises reported an increase in income {{as a result of}} micro-credit - by ‘taking advantage of working capital to diversify or improve the quality of goods’, or through savings by making seasonal bulk purchases. In the urban <b>sample,</b> <b>part</b> of this diversification was directed at manufacturing (10 percent) and new non-farm enterprises like a small shop or handlooms (25 percent). On the other hand, clients in the rural sample invested proportionally between agriculture, animals and non-farm activities like a milch animal. [...] This has helped to reduce the dependency of farmers to seasonal incomes and encourages ‘grass roots level’ entrepreneurship. At the same time, investment into insurance has also helped farmers to hedge against the risk of seasonal difficulties, like an extended monsoon season.|$|E

In product design, tangible prototype is fabricated using CAD/CAM techniques in the design phase to analyse and modify the product before actual production. In this research, industrial clay is used as the prototype material. The objectives of the study are to investigate the machining parameters of industrial clay using the CNC milling machine and to apply the CAD/CAM system in producing a clay <b>sample</b> <b>part</b> via the CNC milling machine. Using uncomplicated and low cost setup for the fabrication method, an industrial clay <b>sample</b> <b>part</b> is prepared in the CAD/CAM system and shaped using the CNC milling machine.

In this paper, we present the hardware-design of the SPP, together with software for hardware-control, data-acquisition and surface-reconstruction. First results on a <b>sample</b> <b>part</b> are presented, compared with interferometric metrology, and error-contributions considered. Notably, during each individual scan of a measurement-cycle, the probe remains fixed. This lends itself to automated probe-deployment by the same robot as performs surface-processing, as probe stability is required on only the time-scale for a single scan...|$|E

Every constituent word in the expressions is manually annotated with its full context-sensitive morphological analysis. Some of the expressions contain semantic variables as place holders for words that play the same semantic role. In addition, we have automatically annotated a large corpus of Arabic text using a pattern-matching algorithm that considers some morphosyntactic features as expressed by a highly inflected language, such as Arabic. A <b>sample</b> <b>part</b> of the corpus is manually evaluated {{and the results are}} reported in this paper. ...|$|E

Rerouting knowledge about deviation behavior back from production into development is crucial {{for the quality of}} the product. This study aims to make deep drawing deviations of aluminum body sheets more traceable. Geometrical measurements of a <b>sample</b> <b>part</b> are compared to the part's topology. Similarities between local stiffnesses and deviations can be detected and quantified by a higher-order polynomial, making it easier to predict deviations. Moreover, the standard deviations and mean values are analyzed regarding the topology...|$|E

Activity Based Costing (ABC) has become a mature cost estimation and accounting methodology, but cost estimation of the design activity has been nebulous and hard to implement.

According to the required outer surface forming quality, the dominant parameter is determined firstly from various parameters using AutoForm™ sigma module.

This methodology can decrease the optimisation time and predict the most crucial parameter in the forming process for design engineers, which can dramatically reduce the lead time of automobile industries...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} {{techniques for}} CNC machining {{have been developed}} {{in an effort to}} produce functional prototypes in appropriate materials. One of the major challenges for rapid machining is to develop an automatic fixturing system for securing the part during the machining process. The method proposed in this paper is the use of sacrificial fixturing, similar to the support structures in existing rapid processes like Stereolithography. During the machining process, sacrificial supports emerge incrementally and, {{at the end of the}} process, are the only entities connecting the part to the stock material. This paper presents methodologies for the design of sacrificial support structures for a rapid machining process and illustrates them using a complex <b>sample</b> <b>part</b> machined in the laboratory...|$|E

This method allows {{for the creation of}} overhanging parts without reliance on support structures, which are difficult if not impossible to remove at the micro/nano scale. Standard values and procedures are established in order to create design rules for the electrochemical deposition process. The voxel size, tool clearance values, raster path generation, approach and retract paths, and part segmentation rules are established. The algorithm was then executed on a <b>sample</b> <b>part</b> and successful performance was verified. This lays the foundation for future experimental verification and commercial adoption of the proposed method...|$|E
