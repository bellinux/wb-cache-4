50|$|Furthermore, {{the most}} of the {{available}} <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> are not very flexible when it comes to routing lines with varying diameters. That causes higher acquisition and storage costs. The installation of the single <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> can take a lot of mounting time, depending on the laying length of the lines. Strain relief plates are therefore a more flexible solution which allows a parallel routing of several lines with varying diameters.|$|R
50|$|Accessories or Backshells are {{mechanical}} devices (e.g., strain reliefs, <b>cable</b> <b>clamps,</b> adapters, potting boots) {{that are}} threaded onto the rear connector accessory threads of plug or receptacle connectors {{to make up}} the total connector assembly.|$|R
50|$|A more cable-friendly {{alternative}} is attaching the lines to special strain relief plates using common cable ties. In case of industrial applications these strain relief plates are as well cost-effective because {{the packing density}} (meaning the possible number of lines to be fixed on one plate) {{is much higher than}} with common <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> which are normally designed for holding one single line.|$|R
50|$|With {{a strain}} relief component, the {{connection}} between a flexible electrical line and its connection port is protected against mechanical stress. Usually, the lines are fixed by clamping them into single <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> made of plastic or metal. Another possibility is to use so called cord grips which consist of weaved wire strands that put a grip around the cables.|$|R

50|$|Bad {{contacts}} are {{the cause}} of failure or poor performance {{in a wide variety}} of electrical devices.

It would be this last device that developed into the widely used Stockbridge damper.|$|R

40|$|Within {{the past}} ten years, the roof rat (Rattus rattus) problem in {{residential}} Santa Clara County has developed from an insignificant nuisance to one of major concern. When {{a considerable number of}} complaints to the Santa Clara County Health Department reported roof rats on telephone cables, a study was made of 29 city blocks to determine the feasibility of utility pole baiting as a means of roof rat control. In the baiting process, rat signs were commonly observed on telephone equipment attached to the utility poles. A correlation was observed between bait consumption and the close proximity of vegetation to the telephone <b>cable</b> <b>clamp.</b> Bait consumption profiles on most blocks demonstrated patterns which resembled activity ranges.

50|$|Electrical {{connector}} contacts {{are typically}} Beryllium copper (BeCu) or Phosphor bronze {{which is then}} plated with gold or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a dielectric insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer, and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often die-cast aluminum and plated or anodized for corrosion protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a soldered or crimped connection. The seal between the shell and insert may be moisture resistant or a hermetic seal. The inserts in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a keying feature to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem. <b>Cable</b> <b>clamps</b> and other mounting hardware may be provided, and the mated halves are usually secured by a locking mechanism to prevent disengagements.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{technique}} of inductive contactless energy transfer (CET) has found its application in specific industrial applications where an (air) gap between energy source and load is preferable or even required. A relative new application area of CET is where CET {{is part of}} a general energy distribution network. As an example, electrical sockets might give problems in bathrooms for safety reasons: CET provides a solution because of inherent electrical isolation between source (grid) and loads (e. g. hair dryer or electrical shaver). For such application this paper reports on the design of a contactless power system that is able to supply to multiple users simultaneously, analogously to the regular plug-and-socket network. The proposed contactless system consists of a special energy supply <b>cable</b> where <b>clamps</b> (each maximum 240 W) can be mounted on at arbitrary locations along the cable while electrical isolation is maintained between <b>cable</b> and <b>clamps.</b> Result is a supply cable design and a prototype with 2 clamps, which are compared by means of analytical calculations, simulations and experimental results.

40|$|Introduction. To {{achieve a}} {{functional}} atraumatic cochlear implantation, intracochlear pressure changes during the procedure should be minimized. Postinsertional cable movements {{are assumed to}} induce intracochlear pressure changes. The {{aim of this study}} was to observe intracochlear pressure changes due to postinsertional cable movements. Materials and Methods. Intracochlear pressure changes were recorded in a cochlear model with a micro-pressure sensor positioned in the apical region of the cochlea model to follow the maximum amplitude and pressure gain velocity in intracochlear pressure. A temporal bone mastoid cavity was attached to the model to simulate cable positioning. The compared conditions were (1) touching the unsealed electrode, (2) touching the sealed electrode, (3) <b>cable</b> <b>storage</b> with an unfixed cable, and (4) <b>cable</b> <b>storage</b> with a fixed cable. Results. We found statistically significant differences in the occurrence of maximum amplitude and pressure gain velocity in intracochlear pressure changes under the compared conditions. Comparing the <b>cable</b> <b>storage</b> conditions, a <b>cable</b> fixed mode offers significantly lower maximum pressure amplitude and pressure gain velocity than the nonfixed mode. Conclusion. Postinsertional cable movement led to a significant pressure transfer into the cochlea. Before positioning the electrode cable in the mastoid cavity, fixation of the cable is recommended...|$|R

There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.|$|R

40|$|The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI’s) 4000 meter {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV), Tiburon operates directly off a double helically wound steel cable {{without the use of}} a clump weight. On dives between 1500 and 4000 meters, rotationally induced hockles or tight bends in the umbilical cable have intermittently occurred. The hockles have the potential to disable and possibly even lose Tiburon. In an effort to compensate for this problem, MBARI engineers are designing a rotation sensor that <b>clamps</b> on the <b>cable</b> near the sections where hockles have occurred. A magnetic compass will take the heading of the cable and send the processed information acoustically back to the ship or vehicle. This information will appear on the ROV pilot’s display screen so that the ROV pilot can compensate for any rotation or misalignment before hockles occur. This paper describes the mechanical design and analysis of the umbilical cable rotation sensor. The goals of the mechanical design are to house the electronics and batteries in a safe and clean environment, incorporate the housings in a hydrodynamically balanced <b>cable</b> <b>clamp</b> assembly and allow for easy attachment and removal from the umbilical. The final design met all of the necessary mechanical and operational requirements {{with the exception of the}} size and weight of the assembly, which was dictated largely by the Sonardyne acoustic hardware. The 60 lb final weight of the assembly was over twice the desired weight, which greatly complicates the cable attachment procedure.
