2500|$|The French Marquise de Créquy {{wrote in}} her book [...] "Souvenirs", that the tune Grand Dieu Sauve Le Roi, was written by Jean-Baptiste Lully in {{gratitude}} for the survival by Louis XIV of an anal fistula operation. The <b>surgical</b> <b>knife</b> that was purpose-built for the occasion is {{on display in the}} Musée d'histoire de la médecine. Lully set words by Marie de Brinon to music, and Créquy claims the tune was later plagiarised by Handel. Translated in Latin under the name Domine, Salvum Fac Regem, it became the French anthem until 1792. After the Battle of Culloden, the Hanover dynasty supposedly then adopted this melody as the British anthem.|$|E

5000|$|The knife {{was named}} after Robert Liston a Scottish surgeon noted for his skill and speed in an era prior to anaesthetics, when speed made a {{difference}} in terms of pain and survival. The knife was made out of high-quality metal and had a typical blade length of 6-8 inches. <b>Surgical</b> amputation <b>knives</b> came in many styles and changed very much between 1840 and the American Civil War. These changes reflect changes in techniques used by the surgeons and makers of <b>surgical</b> <b>knives</b> during the period.|$|R

2500|$|Sir John Williams was {{obstetrician}} to Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Beatrice, and {{was accused}} of the Ripper crimes in the book, Uncle Jack (2005), written {{by one of the}} surgeon's descendants, Tony Williams, and Humphrey Price. The authors claim that the victims knew the doctor personally, that they were killed and mutilated in an attempt to research the causes of infertility, and that a badly blunted <b>surgical</b> <b>knife,</b> which belonged to Williams, was the murder weapon. Jennifer Pegg demonstrated in two articles that much of the research in the book was flawed; for example, the version of the notebook entry used to argue that Williams had met Ripper victim Mary Ann Nichols had been altered for print and did not match the original document, and the line as found in the original document was in handwriting that did not match the rest of the notebook.* Pegg, Jennifer (January 2006).

2500|$|His {{interest}} in physics {{led him to}} develop new ultrasound technologies for examining and treating the eye. [...] Together with William Konig and Louis Katz, he created the first commercially available B-scan ultrasound equipment. [...] His numerous patents include those for an ultrasonically vibrated <b>surgical</b> <b>knife,</b> an ultrasonic diagnostic and therapeutic transducer assembly (with methodology), a system of therapeutic ultrasound and real-time ultrasonic scanning, and an ultrasound system for corneal biometry. His pioneering surgical techniques include the first vitreo-retinal surgery in New York and, using the ultrasound that he developed, demonstrating that operating at an earlier stage in ocular trauma could vastly improve the patient's prognosis for recovery. He has specialized in vitreo-retinal surgery and has had a career-long {{interest in}} imaging research. With a generous gift from Charles and Margaret Dyson, He established the Margaret M. Dyson Vision Research Institute, {{one of the major}} retinal research programs in the world. [...] The Dyson Institute continues research on the causes and possible therapies for age related macular degeneration and ultrasound imaging of the retina and choroid.|$|E
2500|$|Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} {{was first}} developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small {{targets in the}} brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation {{was made in the}} early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. [...] At this time, stereotactic proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the <b>surgical</b> <b>knife,</b> but the synchrocyclotron was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England. The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{assassination}} in {{the park}} was committed by Joe Brady, who attacked Burke with a 12-inch knife, followed in short order by Tim Kelly, who knifed Cavendish. Both men used <b>surgical</b> <b>knives.</b> The British press expressed outrage and demanded that the [...] "Phoenix Park Murderers" [...] be brought to justice.|$|R
50|$|In 1882, {{it was the}} {{location}} of a double murder. The Chief Secretary for Ireland (the British Cabinet minister with responsibility for Irish affairs), Lord Frederick Cavendish and the Under-Secretary for Ireland (chief civil servant), Thomas Henry Burke, were stabbed to death with <b>surgical</b> <b>knives</b> while walking from Dublin Castle. A small insurgent group called the Invincibles were responsible.|$|R
25|$|Brodovitch embraced {{technical}} developments {{from the}} spheres of industrial design, photography, and contemporary painting. His broad curiosity began to assimilate {{the most interesting}} aspects of all these fields into his work, eventually making them his own. He later instilled this same curiosity in his students, encouraging them to use new techniques like the airbrush, industrial lacquers, flexible steel needles, and <b>surgical</b> <b>knives.</b>|$|R
60|$|Charlie now {{procured}} two knives; the one a sharp <b>surgical</b> <b>knife,</b> from a case {{which he}} had brought; the other he placed in a charcoal fire, {{which one of the}} men speedily fanned, until the blade had attained a white heat. Charlie had decided that, if the snake bit Tim, he would instantly make a deep cut through the line of the puncture of the fangs, cutting down as low as these could penetrate, and immediately cauterize it, by placing the hot knife in the gash so made. Six men were called in, with orders to seize Tim on the instant, and hold his leg firm, to enable the operation to be performed. Two others were to occupy themselves with the snake. These were armed with sticks.|$|E
60|$|I hold it clear, therefore, if {{anything}} is clear about the business, that the Eugenists do not merely mean that the mass of common men should settle each other's marriages between them; the question remains, therefore, whom they do instinctively trust when they say that this or {{that ought to be}} done. What is this flying and evanescent authority that vanishes wherever we seek to fix it? Who is the man who is the lost subject that governs the Eugenist's verb? In a large number of cases I think we can simply say that the individual Eugenist means himself, and nobody else. Indeed one Eugenist, Mr. A.H. Huth, actually had a sense of humour, and admitted this. He thinks a great deal of good could be done with a <b>surgical</b> <b>knife,</b> if we would only turn him loose with one. And this may be true. A great deal of good could be done with a loaded revolver, {{in the hands of a}} judicious student of human nature. But it is imperative that the Eugenist should perceive that on that principle we can never get beyond a perfect balance of different sympathies and antipathies. I mean that I should differ from Dr. Saleeby or Dr. Karl Pearson not only in a vast majority of individual cases, but in a vast majority of cases in which they would be bound to admit that such a difference was natural and reasonable. The chief victim of these famous doctors would be a yet more famous doctor: that eminent though unpopular practitioner, Dr. Fell.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{always wore}} high boots {{for the same}} reason, and had no fear {{whatever}} of the snakes; but Mr. Hardy insisted that each of them should always carry in a small inner pocket of their coats a phial of spirits of ammonia, a small <b>surgical</b> <b>knife,</b> {{and a piece of}} whipcord; the same articles being always kept in readiness at the house. His instructions were, that in case of a bite they should first suck the wound, then tie the whipcord round the limb above the place bitten, and that they should then cut deeply into the wound crossways, open it as much as possible, and pour in some spirits of ammonia; that they should then pour the rest of the ammonia into their water-bottle, which they always carried slung over their shoulders, and should drink it off. If these directions were instantly and thoroughly carried out, Mr. Hardy had little fear that the bite, even of the deadliest snake, would prove fatal. In addition he ordered that in case of their being near home they should, upon their arrival, be made to drink raw spirits until they could not stand, and that, if they were some distance away from home, and were together, the one bitten should lie down while the other galloped at full speed to take back a bottle of brandy, and order assistance to be sent. This remedy is well known throughout India. Any one bitten by a poisonous snake is made to drink spirits, which he is able to do without being affected by them, to an extraordinary extent; a man who at ordinary times could scarcely take a strong tumbler of spirits and water, being able, when bitten, to drink a bottle of pure brandy without being in the least affected by it. When the spirit does at last begin to take effect, and the patient shows signs of drunkenness, he is considered to be safe, the poison of the spirit having overcome the poison of the snake.|$|E

50|$|He broke {{tradition}} with Galen {{by claiming that}} pus formation was bad for wounds and for the patient. He was {{a professor at the}} University of Bologna. In 1275 he wrote Chirurgia which promoted the use of a <b>surgical</b> <b>knife</b> over cauterizing. He also was the author of Summa conservationis et curationis on hygiene and therapy. Lanfranc of Milan was a pupil who brought William's methods into France. William gave lectures on the importance of regular bathing for infants, and special care for the hygiene of pregnant women.|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{precision}} <b>surgical</b> <b>knives</b> is enormous. Currently, diamond knives {{have been the}} preferred choice among surgeons for use in precision surgeries, owing to the extreme hardness of diamond and the sharpness {{that can be achieved}} in single crystal diamond blades, but material and processing costs are high. Bulk metallic glass (BMG) {{has the potential to be}} an economically-viable material of similar performance for use in precision <b>surgical</b> <b>knives.</b> To this end, a novel hybrid manufacturing process integrating thermally-assisted micromolding and micro-drawing has been developed for producing BMG surgical-grade knife blade cutting edges with edge radii < 25 nm. A hybrid process testbed was designed and used to successfully run tests over a range of the key process variables. Three distinct deformation types were observed and were dependent on the balance between necking and elongation during drawing. The amount of necking and elongation was determined by the free volume behavior of bulk metallic glass and the formation of nano-crystals. Both these phenomena were found to be influenced by the atomic mobility of the material, which is based on both the material temperature and induced strain. A second generation hybrid manufacturing process and testbed were developed to improve blade straightness, edge radius and repeatability. The enhancements made included symmetric dies, an alignment flexure and force-limited drawing. Experimental results from the second generation process exhibited straight edges with less than 10 ??m of deviation across the blades 2 mm width and edge radii as low as 14 nm. Repeatability was also improved with all tests generating a viable cutting blade with comparable necking behavior, straight edges. Two processes were proposed to enable the manufacturing of multi-facet blades; a process based on forces generated by a magnetic field and a process based on multi-stage molding. Initial testing of the magnetic drawing process with a modified testbed revealed low forces relative to friction and inconsistent heating and it was concluded that magnetic drawing would not be able to produce meaningful results without major changes to the existing testbed. A review of previous research on tissue modeling and tissue cutting in terms of analyzing blade cutting performance was conducted. Based on this review, a testbed design and testing method was proposed with which to perform extensive analysis of blade cutting performance. The proposed method consisted of basic blade characterization, incision testing and wear resistance testing...|$|R
50|$|After {{a three-day}} search, Eberle's body was {{discovered}} {{in a patch of}} high grass alongside a gravel road some 4 miles (6 km) from his bicycle. He had been stripped to his underwear, his feet and hands had been bound, and his mouth had been taped with <b>surgical</b> tape. <b>Knife</b> wounds across his body suggested he had been tortured before death. In addition, Joubert had stabbed him nine times. As a kidnapping, the crime came {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government of the United States, so the FBI was called in.|$|R
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, the family {{moved back to the}} United States, after William and Kate fell ill. The family spent the summer of that year in New Hampshire on a farm with Kate’s sister before they {{relocated}} to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1908, the family moved to Farson, Wyoming where they settled for the next five years, living in a small three-room house. During the five years in Farson, Rambo and the family planted crops and raised chickens for food, often struggling to produce enough for all members of the household. When Rambo was sixteen, he began working as a water boy to earn money for the family. He soon got a more permanent job driving a Fresno scraper, a metal basket that dumped dirt into an irrigation ditch, but was subsequently fired after he joined a group of workers protesting the wage. He then worked as an orderly in the local hospital and caught the attention of the resident doctor, who began to teach him common procedures such as catheterization. After the doctor left the hospital, Rambo performed many of the former doctor's duties, assisting in the operating room and helping out with emergencies at midnight. He learned to recognize and use different <b>surgical</b> <b>knives</b> and other tools and started handling the catheterization of paraplegics. He attended a nursing class and was two months short of graduating with a registered nurse's certificate when the family suddenly moved to Idaho after William was asked to preach in Emmett. In March 1914, the family moved again to Chehalis, Washington, where Rambo remained until September 1915, graduating from high school at the age of twenty-one.|$|R
