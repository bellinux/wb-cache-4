5|$|Nagle {{acquired}} {{her first}} Irish <b>Setter,</b> whom she named Sulhamstead D'Or, in 1924 {{to keep a}} wolfhound puppy company. In April 1930 she entered him into the All-Aged Stakes at the Kennel Club field trials. In August 1932 she entered a dog named Sulhamstead Token D'Or into the Scottish Field Trials in the same category. At the Kennel Club field trials of April 1933, Nagle entered Sulhamstead Bob D'Or into the All-Aged Stakes and the judge awarded her the prize presented by the Irish <b>Setter</b> Association of England. In September 1934, she entered her Irish <b>Setter</b> Sulhamstead Snip D'Or into the Novice Stake of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and <b>Setter</b> Society's 12th working trials at Pynes, near Exeter.|$|E
5|$|C# {{provides}} properties as syntactic sugar for {{a common}} pattern in which a pair of methods, accessor (getter) and mutator (<b>setter)</b> encapsulate operations on a single attribute of a class. No redundant method signatures for the getter/setter implementations need be written, and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more verbose method calls.|$|E
5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an Irish <b>setter</b> named Kelly, and had him sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made very much noise.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near the mouth of the Somme. This caused the infusion of English <b>Setter</b> blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon <b>Setter</b> {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
25|$|Irish <b>Setters</b> {{are deep}} chested dogs with small waists. An Irish <b>Setter's</b> life {{expectancy}} {{tends to be}} around 11 to 12 years.|$|R
50|$|The 4-2 {{formation}} {{has four}} hitters and two <b>setters.</b> The <b>setters</b> usually set {{from the middle}} front or right front position. The team will therefore have two front-row attackers at all times. In the international 4-2, the <b>setters</b> set from the right front position. The international 4-2 translates more easily into other forms of offense.|$|R
2500|$|Irish <b>Setters</b> enjoy {{having a}} job to do. Lack of {{activity}} {{will lead to a}} bored, destructive, or even hyperactive dog. This is not a breed that can be left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, nor should they be. Irish <b>Setters</b> thrive on constant human companionship. Irish <b>Setters</b> respond swiftly to positive training and are highly intelligent.|$|R
5|$|On March 7, Mayor Cornelius Devennel {{ordered all}} closet doors be {{equipped}} with special knobs that can open easily from both inside and outside. This order was made mandatory for all new home constructions or reconstructions. A ceremony in her memory {{was held at the}} St. Francis de Sales Church that same day. On March 20, radio station WPEN presented Freitta with a new puppy, an English <b>Setter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the breed in Russia increased after the early 1990s, with Moscow dog shows since that time annually including between 120 and 131 Russian Spaniels, which qualifies the breed {{as one of the}} most popular, along with the Irish <b>Setter.</b> In 2002, the Russian Spaniel Club was set up in the United States to increase the knowledge of the breed outside Russia and to enable owners to register their dogs.|$|E
5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White <b>Setter</b> breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.|$|E
50|$|Originally, <b>setters</b> in Ireland {{were mostly}} red, or the parti-colour red and white, or even nearly all white dogs. All were {{accepted}} as Irish <b>Setters</b> and were mated to each other.|$|R
50|$|According to Tsebelis, among {{feasible}} outcomes (that is, {{the shared}} winset of outcomes which meet each veto player’s requirement of being {{superior to the}} status quo), agenda <b>setters</b> pick the outcome that they like most. Tsebelis predicts that when few outcomes are feasible, agenda <b>setters</b> will have a small role; where none at all are possible (that is, there is no ‘core’ where all winsets overlap), agenda <b>setters</b> are irrelevant.|$|R
50|$|<b>Setters</b> and {{pointers}} hunt {{over long}} distances to find game birds like {{members of the}} pheasant and quail family, using their noses to find the prey and then sneaking up on them in the brush, showing the hunter exactly where the bird is hiding. Most of this family comes from Europe, and would include the Shorthaired, Wirehaired, Shorthaired German Pointers and Weimaraner from Germany, The Viszla from Hungary, Bracco Italiano from Italy, and field bred Irish <b>Setters,</b> Irish Red and White <b>Setters,</b> English Pointers, English <b>Setters,</b> and Gordon <b>Setters</b> from the British Isles. Many in this group share traits with spaniels {{in terms of the}} coat they have: it is easier to pick out bits of nettle from a long coat than a short one and the coat itself offers some protection from damp and thorny conditions.|$|R
5|$|In 1992, {{competition}} at Westminster {{was restricted to}} champions only. A dog can only become a champion by gaining championship points at other conformation shows. Prior to 1992, admission to dogs was open, and in 1938 an English <b>Setter</b> named Daro of Maridor was the Best in Show title at Westminster in his very first outing at a dog show {{at the age of}} 11 months. In 1929, a previously unregistered British dog won at Westminster using the name Laund Loyalty of Bellhaven, aged nine months in his only show on American soil.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and {{this resulted in a}} change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English <b>Setter</b> into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has many}} {{similarities}} with the Picardy Spaniel {{due to the}} two breeds' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, {{as well as the}} obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed by the introduction of English <b>Setter</b> blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1930, Thomas {{published}} a heavily fictionalized article in American Magazine, entitled [...] "Blind Jilson: Singin' Fiddler of Lost Hope Hollow", detailing Thomas first encountering <b>Setters,</b> their arrangement of his operation, and radio station work in New York City. In 1931, <b>Setters</b> traveled to London {{to perform at}} Royal Albert Hall, and for King George V and Mary of Teck. Upon {{his return to the}} U.S., <b>Setters</b> was the featured performer in the American Folk Song Festival, which was managed by Thomas from 1930 to 1972. However, whether it was a consequence of insufficient record sales or lack of interest, Thomas abandoned her project with <b>Setters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} field {{trial in the}} UK was held in April 1865 on the estate of Samuel Whitbread (MP) at Southill, Bedfordshire. It was only open to <b>setters</b> and pointers. All the <b>setters</b> entered were black and tans (Gordons).|$|R
40|$|In New Keynesian models nominal rigidities {{determine}} socially ineffi - cient outcomes. Our paper reverses this view: properly designed monetary policies {{may take}} advantage of predetermined nominal wages to discipline monopolistic wage <b>setters.</b> This, in turn, requires accepting a non-zero in- flation rate. Discretionary monetary policy is effective when wage <b>setters</b> are non atomistic. Inflation targeting has real effects irrespective {{of the degree of}} labor market centralization. inflation bias, discretionary monetary policy, non-zero inflation targeting, unemployment, strategic wage <b>setters...</b>|$|R
5|$|A tile <b>setter,</b> Anthony Cacchio Sr., {{rented the}} {{building}} in 1949 and converted it into a movie theater; it opened on February18, 1949 with a screening of the film Blood on the Moon. Cacchio owned the building outright by the mid-1950s. During this time, a severe flood damaged the Theatre's interior, and all the equipment had to be replaced. In its early years, the Theatre showed about 300 different movies each year, making it unpopular with film distributors. Denied easy access to first run films, the Theatre turned to independent movies and art films, and eventually began exhibiting live performances. Cacchio's entire family helped run the Theatre; his wife Fannie sold tickets and determined the Theatre's movie selection, while their sons Anthony Jr. and Rocco, and grandson Michael, ran the projector and eventually managed the day-to-day operation of the business.|$|E
5|$|Federer's season {{turned around}} in the final masters event of the clay season when he {{defeated}} Nadal on clay {{for only the second}} time to capture the Madrid Masters. Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin Söderling, Federer suddenly became the overwhelming favorite. It would not be easy as in his next match as he was forced to come from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets. He was also forced to fight back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Martín del Potro to win a five <b>setter</b> in the semifinals. In the final, he faced Söderling, and with a straight sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam. This victory tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete in that class are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 dogs, with third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees {{to be of the}} same breed, a distribution across twenty or more states, and the breed standard must be reviewed and approved by the AKC. Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White <b>Setter,</b> Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in that class are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of local {{monopoly}} agenda setting on federal standards. Federal standards specify a minimum (or maximum) point in policy space which can be raised (or lowered) by local option. Without local agenda <b>setters,</b> this creates incentives for nonmajoritarian outcomes, with a tendency for policies to be too high (low). Local agenda <b>setters</b> may have incentives to distort these outcomes even further. We demonstrate that federal standards can counterbalance the distortions of local agenda <b>setters...</b>|$|R
50|$|Irish <b>Setters</b> {{tend to be}} a {{relatively}} healthy breed. Problems that have been noted in Irish <b>Setters</b> includehip dysplasia, cancer, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), epilepsy, entropion, hypothyroidism, hyperosteodystrophy, gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), osteosarcoma, Von Willebrand's disease, patent ductus arteriosus, canine Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD) and celiac disease.It should be noted that Irish <b>Setters</b> are now one of the few breeds for which genetic tests have been developed to detect the presence of both CLAD and PRA (RCD-1).|$|R
50|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{as to how}} <b>setters</b> {{would be}} classified at early shows. Three classes were usually scheduled in 1862 dividing <b>setters</b> into three categories: English, Black/Tan and Irish. These became official breed classifications when The Kennel Club was founded in 1873.|$|R
5|$|The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a {{breed of}} dog of the Spaniel-like <b>setter.</b> It was {{developed}} in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct {{by the turn of}} the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in France {{for use as}} a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought {{to be one of the}} two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English <b>Setter</b> but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.|$|E
5|$|Julián Leal took seventh after encountering {{traffic on}} his final lap {{and needed to}} pass one car to record his fastest time. Dillmann lined up in eighth place. Nasr set the early pace in Group B before {{settling}} for ninth and Frijns rounded out the top ten. Ericcson was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best time of one minute and 22.349 seconds was 1.208 seconds off Cecotto's pace. Ericsson paced Group B early on but was demoted as the session progressed. He was followed by Sergio Canamasas in 12th and Rossi in 13th place. Coletti was another Group B early pace <b>setter</b> but ended up starting from 14th position. Haryanto qualified in 15th but was demoted ten places on the grid for causing an avoidable accident at the previous round {{of the season in}} Catalunya. As a result Nathanaël Berthon inherited the place and was followed by Calado. Richelmi and Daniël de Jong filled the next two placings and 20th place qualifier René Binder was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Canamasas during the session. Giovesi thus started from Binder's qualifying position with Daniel Abt joining him on the grid's tenth row. Simon Trummer and Jake Rosenzweig clinched the 22nd and 23rd positions. Lancaster started from 24th after spinning his car at Sainte Dévote turn necessitating yellow flags to be waved in the area. The final position in the field was taken by Adrian Quaife-Hobbs whose fastest time was 2.2 seconds slower than Cecotto.|$|E
50|$|Torquemada's puzzles were {{extremely}} obscure and difficult, and later <b>setters</b> reacted against this tendency {{by developing a}} standard for fair clues, ones that can be solved, at least in principle, by deduction, without needing leaps of faith or insights into the <b>setter's</b> thought processes.|$|R
2500|$|Irish <b>Setters</b> {{get along}} well with children, other dogs, and will enthusiastically greet visitors. [...] Even {{though they do}} well with {{household}} pets, small animals may pose a problem for this breed, as they are a hunting breed. [...] Some Irish <b>Setters</b> may have problems with cats in the house, and may be too rambunctious with small children. [...] As the FCI, ANKC and UK Standards state, the breed should be [...] "Demonstrably affectionate." [...] As a result, Irish <b>Setters</b> make excellent companion animals and family pets.|$|R
50|$|Irish Red and White <b>setters</b> {{should be}} combed and well brushed {{each week to}} keep the coat well groomed. Any wispy hair on feet should be trimmed away {{regularly}} and bushy hair behind ears should be thinned. They should only need bathed when necessary as {{they are easy to}} keep clean due to the single coat not being too thick. Irish Red and White <b>setters</b> do not require as much trimming for presentation in conformation shows as the other <b>setters</b> as they have lighter coats.|$|R
