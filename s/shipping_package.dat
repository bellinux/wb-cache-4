40|$|The {{fiberboard}} assembly used in 9975 <b>shipping</b> <b>packages</b> as an impact-absorption and insulation component has {{the capacity}} to absorb moisture, with an accompanying change to its properties. While package fabrication requirements generally maintain the fiberboard moisture content within manufacturing range, there is the potential during use or storage for atypical handling or storage practices which result in the absorption of additional moisture. In addition to performing a transportation function, the 9975 <b>shipping</b> <b>packages</b> are used as a facility storage system for special nuclear materials at the Savannah River Site. A small number of packages after extended storage have been found to contain elevated moisture levels. Typically, this condition is accompanied by an axial compaction of the bottom fiberboard layers, and the growth of mold. In addition to potential atypical practices, fiberboard can exchange moisture with the surrounding air, depending on the ambient humidity. Laboratory data have been generated to correlate the equilibrium moisture content of cane fiberboard with the humidity of the surrounding air. These data are compared to measurements taken within <b>shipping</b> <b>packages.</b> With a reasonable measurement of the fiberboard moisture content, an estimate of the fiberboard properties can be made.

Each of those facilities has a documented safety analysis (DSA) that describes accidents that the facility and the materials within it may encounter. Facilities at the SRS are planning on utilizing the certified Model 9977 <b>Shipping</b> <b>Package</b> as a long term storage package and one of these facilities required ballistics testing. Specifically, {{in order to meet the}} facility DSA, the radioactive materials (RAM) must be contained within the storage package after impact by a. 223 caliber round. In order to qualify the Model 9977 <b>Shipping</b> <b>Package</b> for storage in this location, the package had to be tested under these conditions. Over the past two years, the Model 9977 <b>Shipping</b> <b>Package</b> has been subjected to a series of ballistics tests.

The available data suggest that the EPDM O-rings can retain significant mechanical properties and sealing force at or below bounding service temperatures (169 F or 76 C) beyond the 1 year maintenance period. Interpretation of available data suggests that a service life of at least 2 years and potentially 4 - 6 years may be possible at bounding temperatures. Seal lifetimes at lower, more realistic temperatures will likely be longer. Being a hydrocarbon elastomer, EPDM O-rings may exhibit an inhibition period due to the presence of antioxidants.

This justification is established with the stipulation that surveillance activities will continue throughout the extended time to ensure the continued integrity of the 9975 materials of construction and to further understand the currently identified degradation mechanisms. The 10 year storage life justification was developed prior to storage. A subsequent report was later used to validate the qualification of the 9975 shipping packages for 10 years in storage.

40|$|A new {{radioactive}} shipping packaging for transporting bulk {{quantities of}} tritium, the Bulk Tritium <b>Shipping</b> <b>Package</b> (BTSP), {{has been designed}} for the Department of Energy (DOE) {{as a replacement for}} a package designed in the early 1970 s. This paper summarizes significant design features and describes how the design satisfies the regulatory safety requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The BTSP design incorporates many improvements over its predecessor by implementing improved testing, handling, and maintenance capabilities, while improving manufacturability and incorporating new engineered materials. This paper also discusses the results from testing of the BTSP to 10 CFR 71 Normal Conditions of Transport and Hypothetical Accident Condition events. The programmatic need of the Department of Energy (DOE) to ship bulk quantities of tritium has been satisfied since the late 1970 s by the UC- 609 <b>shipping</b> <b>package.</b> The current Certificate of Conformance for the UC- 609, USA/ 9932 /B(U) (DOE), will expire in late 2011. Since the UC- 609 was not designed to meet current regulatory requirements, it will not be recertified and thereby necessitates a replacement Type B <b>shipping</b> <b>package</b> for continued DOE tritium shipments in the future. A replacement tritium packaging called the Bulk Tritium <b>Shipping</b> <b>Package</b> (BTSP) is currently being designed and tested by Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). The BTSP consists of two primary assemblies, an outer Drum Assembly and an inner Containment Vessel Assembly (CV), both designed to mitigate damage and to protect the tritium contents from leaking during the regulatory Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) events and during Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT). During transport, the CV rests on a silicone pad within the Drum Liner and is covered with a thermal insulating disk within the insulated Drum Assembly. The BTSP packaging weighs approximately 500 lbs without contents and is 50 - 1 / 2 inches high by 24 - 1 / 2 inches in outside diameter. With contents the gross weight of the BTSP is 650 lbs. The BTSP is designed for the safe shipment of 150 grams of tritium in a solid or gaseous state. To comply with the federal regulations that govern Type B shipping packages, the BTSP is designed so that it will not lose tritium at a rate greater than the limits stated in 10 CFR 71. 51 of 10 {sup - 6 } A 2 per hour for the 'Normal Conditions of Transport' (NCT) and an A 2 in 1 week under 'Hypothetical Accident Conditions' (HAC). Additionally, since the BTSP design incorporates a valve as part of the tritium containment boundary, secondary containment features are incorporated in the CV Lid to protect against gas leakage past the valve as required by 10 CFR 71. 43 (e). This secondary containment boundary is designed to provide the same level of containment as the primary containment boundary when subjected to the HAC and NCT criteria...|$|E

40|$|This is {{an interim}} status report for tasks carried out per Task Technical Plan SRNL-STI- 2011 - 00506. A series of tasks/experiments are being {{performed}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory to monitor the aging performance of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) Orings used in the H 1616 <b>shipping</b> <b>package.</b> The data will support the technical basis to extend the annual maintenance of the EPDM O-rings in the H 1616 <b>shipping</b> <b>package</b> and to predict {{the life of the}} seals at bounding service conditions. Current expectations are that the O-rings will maintain a seal at bounding normal temperatures in service (152 F) for at least 12 months. The baseline aging data review suggests that the EPDM O-rings are likely to retain significant mechanical properties and sealing force at bounding service temperatures to provide a service life of at least 2 years. At lower, more realistic temperatures, longer service life is likely. Parallel compression stress relaxation and vessel leak test efforts are in progress to further validate this assessment and quantify a more realistic service life prediction. The H 1616 <b>shipping</b> <b>package</b> O-rings were evaluated for baseline property data as part of this test program. This was done to provide a basis for comparison of changes in material properties and performance parameters as a function of aging. This initial characterization was limited to physical and mechanical properties, namely hardness, thickness and tensile strength. These properties appear to be consistent with O-ring specifications. Three H 1616 - 1 Containment Vessels were placed in test conditions and are aging at temperatures ranging from 160 to 300 F. The vessels were Helium leak-tested initially and have been tested at periodic intervals after cooling to room temperature to determine if they meet the criterion of leaktightness defined in ANSI standard N 14. 5 - 97 (< 1 E- 07 std cc air/sec at room temperature). To date, no leak test failures have occurred. The cumulative time at temperature ranges from 174 days for the 300 F vessel to 189 days for the 160 F vessel as of 8 / 1 / 2012. The compression stress-relaxation (CSR) behavior of H 1616 <b>shipping</b> <b>package</b> O-rings is being evaluated to develop an aging model based on material properties. O-ring segments were initially aged at four temperatures (175 F, 235 F, 300 F and 350 F). These temperatures were selected to bound normal service temperatures and to challenge the seals within a reasonable aging period. Currently, samples aging at 300 F and 350 F have reached the mechanical failure point (end of life) which is defined in this study as 90 % loss of initial sealing force. As a result, additional samples more recently began aging at {approx} 270 F to provide additional data for the aging model. Aging and periodic leak testing of the full containment vessels, as well as CSR testing of O-ring segments is ongoing. Continued testing per the Task Technical Plan is recommended in order to validate the assumptions outlined in this status report and to quantify and validate the long-term performance of O-ring seals under actual service conditions...|$|E
