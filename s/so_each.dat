5|$|As {{the highway}} {{is still under}} state jurisdiction, M-155 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 13,699vehicles used the highway daily in Howell and 3,960vehicles did <b>so</b> <b>each</b> day near the souther terminus, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of OLD M-155 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing <b>so.</b> <b>Each</b> Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E
5|$|Like other provincial {{routes in}} Ontario, Highway112 is {{maintained}} by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario.

5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, <b>so</b> <b>each</b> item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards {{from the top of the}} baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
5|$|Working as an {{additional}} producer, Don Was helped keep Weiland's {{and the rest of}} the band's separate recording sessions in sync by bringing them together to perform live. When the band performed together, they would do so acoustically, <b>so</b> <b>each</b> member could hear the nuances of the songs. Weiland credited Was for helping Stone Temple Pilots re-learn how to play together again. Was also worked closely with Weiland during the recording of the vocals.|$|E

5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and <b>so</b> <b>each</b> time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, <b>so</b> <b>each</b> sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In order to do <b>so,</b> <b>each</b> aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|E

5|$|I-96 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as {{a segment of the}} larger State Trunkline Highway System. In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 201,200vehicles used the highway daily between 6 and 7Mile roads in Livonia. Near Norton Shores, 20,638vehicles did <b>so</b> <b>each</b> day between Airline and Fruitport roads. These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-96 is included in the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway in Detroit has been named the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature to honor the civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. The segment from Livonia west to I-275 is the Jeffries Freeway, named for a former mayor of Detroit, Edward Jeffries.|$|E
5|$|In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in {{accordance}} with a new war establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set <b>so</b> <b>each</b> troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and one unit in the 'Dutch' type landing ship. The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 hundredweight (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other state}} {{highways}} in Michigan, I-496 is {{maintained by the}} Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 61,082vehicles used the freeway between BL I-96 and the Trowbridge Road interchange south of US127, the highest traffic count along I-496. West of Creyts Road, 17,600vehicles did <b>so</b> <b>each</b> day, which was the lowest count along the trunkline. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-496 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads deemed important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|Mastodon {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to be stored at Tengah when they became available, <b>so</b> <b>each</b> Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, <b>so</b> <b>each</b> day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.|$|E
