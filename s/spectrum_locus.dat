When the vacuum moduli can be dialed adiabatically until the central charges become anti -parallel, a paradox arises. We {{show that this}} paradox is always resolved by the existence of "bound state transformation walls" across which {{the nature of the}} bound state changes, although the index does not jump. We find that there are two distinct phenomena that can take place on these walls, which we call recombination and conjugation. The latter is associated to the presence of singularities at finite distance in moduli space. Consistency of conjugation and wall-crossing rules near these singularities leads to new constraints on the BPS <b>spectrum.</b> Singular <b>loci</b> supporting massless vector bosons are particularly subtle in this respect. We argue that the <b>spectrum</b> at such <b>loci</b> necessarily contains massless magnetic monopoles, and that bound states around them transform by intricate hybrids of conjugation and recombination.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} space-time adaptive processing (STAP) in a bistatic radar configuration {{and when}} the radar returns are recorded by a conformal antenna array (CAA). The statistics of the secondary data snapshots used to estimate the optimum weight vector are not identically distributed with respect to range, thus preventing the STAP processor from achieving its optimum performance. The compensation of the range-dependence of the secondary data requires {{the knowledge of the}} clutter power <b>spectrum</b> <b>locus.</b> This paper proposes a new RANSAC-based method for estimating, in the case of CAAs operating in arbitrary bistatic configurations, the clutter power <b>spectrum</b> <b>locus</b> or, equivalently, the flight configuration parameters. Based on the knowledge of this locus, we can perform a range-dependence compensation of the snapshots to obtain an accurate estimate of the clutter covariance matrix.

Moreover, human subjects with damage to or loss of V 1 are typically completely unaware of the stimulus that generates the aftereffect or of the aftereffect itself, both of which can be seen clearly in normal vision. The results show that pupillary responses can reveal the processing of color afterimages {{in the absence of}} primary visual cortex and {{in the absence of a}}cknowledged awareness. This phenomenon is therefore a striking example of "blindsight" and makes possible the formulation of a model that predicts well the observed properties of color afterimages...|$|E

40|$|The Abney effect {{refers to}} changes in the hue of lights as they are desaturated. Normally the purity is varied by desaturating with a fixed spectrum. Mizokami et al. [J. Vis. 6, 996 (2006) ] instead varied purity by using Gaussian spectra and {{increasing}} their bandwidth. Under these conditions the hues of lights at short and medium wave-lengths tended to remain constant and thus were tied to a fixed property of the stimulus such as the spectral peak, possibly reflecting a compensation for the spectral filtering effects of the eye. Here we test this account more com-pletely by comparing constant hue loci across a wide range of wavelengths and between the fovea and periphery. Purity was varied by adding either a fixed spectrum or by varying the spectral bandwidth, using an Agile Light Source capable of generating arbitrary spectra. For both types of <b>spectra,</b> hue <b>loci</b> were approximated by the Gaus-sian model at short and medium wavelengths, though the model failed to predict the precise form of the hue changes or the differences between the fovea and periphery.

The frequency <b>spectrum</b> across <b>loci</b> showed a modest excess of mutations segregating at low frequency and a marked excess of high-frequency derived mutations at silent sites, relative to neutral expectations. These excesses were also seen at replacement sites, but were not so pronounced for high-frequency derived mutations. There was a marked excess of low-frequency mutations at replacement sites, likely indicating deleterious amino acid-changing mutations that segregate at low frequencies in P. tremula. I used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to evaluate {{a number of different}} demographic scenarios and to estimate parameters for the best-fitting model. The data were found to be consistent with a historical reduction in the effective population size of P. tremula through a bottleneck. The timing inferred for this bottleneck is largely consistent with geological data and with data from several other long-lived plant species. The results show that P. tremula harbors substantial levels of nucleotide polymorphism with the posterior mode of the scaled mutation rate, θ = 0. 0177 across loci. The ABC analyses also provided an estimate of the scaled recombination rate that indicates that recombination rates in P. tremula are likely to be 2 – 10 times higher than the mutation rate.

Participants included 49 color-normal observers {{ranging in age from}} 16. 8 to 86. 3 years. A double-pulse method was used to measure the IRF with S-cone modulation at constant luminance. Stimuli were presented as a Gaussian patch (± 1 SD= 2. 3 °) in one of four quadrants around a central fixation cross on a CRT screen. The test stimulus was modulated from the equal-energy white of the background toward the short-wave <b>spectrum</b> <b>locus.</b> Each of the two pulses (6. 67 ms) was separated by an interstimulus interval (ISI) from 20 to 720 ms.

IRFs were calculated from the threshold data using a model with four parameters of an exponentially damped sine wave. S-cone IRFs have only an excitatory phase and a much longer time course compared with IRFs for luminance modulation measured with the same apparatus. The results demonstrated significant age-related losses in IRF amplitude, but the latency (time to peak) of the IRF was stable with age. © 2006 Optical Society of America...|$|E

The challenge is in the realization of these possibilities in an industry rooted in 1950 s technology where color gamut is represented {{with little or no}} insight into the way an observer perceives color as a complex mixture of the observer’s intentions, desires, and interests. By today’s standards, five perceptual attributes – brightness, lightness, colorfulness, chroma, and hue - are believed to be required for a complete specification. As a compelling case for such a representation, a display system is demonstrated that is capable of displaying color beyond the realm of object color, perceptually even beyond the <b>spectrum</b> <b>locus</b> of pure color. All this begs the question: Just what is meant by perceptual gamut? To this end, the attributes of perceptual gamut are identified through psychometric testing and the color appearance models CIELAB and CIECAM 02.

The advance in genotyping technologies has made possible the understanding and deployment of host resistance to plant pathogens, previously unachievable through conventional plant breeding. In this work, the application of Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) and Resistant Gene Enrichment Sequencing (RenSeq) has identified a single GDSL lipase {{as a candidate for}} recessive race non-specific resistance to A. candida in B. oleracea. A second locus has been identified conferring dominant race specific resistance to an A. candida isolate collected from Australia. Much work has been achieved in understanding the genetic basis of resistance to A. candida in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, including the identification of white rust resistance (WRR) 4, a single dominant resistance (R) gene conferring resistance to A. candida races 2, 4, 7 and 9 in A. thaliana Columbia.

The contribution to QTL-governed resistance of one of nine rice OsPAL genes, which encode phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, was determined using reverse genetics.

The aim of this study was to find the FRMD 7 gene mutations in a large eleven-generation Indian pedigree with 71 members who are affected by NYS. Mutation analysis of the entire coding region and splice junctions of the FRMD 7 gene revealed a novel missense mutation, c.

This mutation was found to be at a highly conserved residue within the FERM-adjacent domain in affected members of the family. Structure prediction and energetic analysis of wild-type FRMD 7 compared with mutant (Q 305 R) revealed that this change in amino acid led to a change in secondary structure predicted to be an energetically unstable protein.

Masked G 1 mosaics reveal themselves by producing clusters of whole-body mutants in G 2. We provide evidence that most, if not all, mosaics detected in the SLT (both radiation and control progenies) result from a single-strand spontaneous mutation subsequent to the last premeiotic mitosis and before the first postmeiotic one of a parental genome—the “perigametic interval. ” Such events in the genomes of the G 1 and G 0 result, respectively, in visible and masked 50 : 50 mosaics.

40|$|Temperature-sensitive {{mutations}} {{fall into}} two general classes: those generating thermolabile proteins; and those generating defects in protein synthesis, folding or assembly. Temperature-sensitive mutations at 17 sites in the gene for the coat protein of Phage P 22 are of the latter class, preventing the productive folding of the polypeptide chain at restrictive temperature. We show here that, though the coat subunits interact intimately to form the viral shell, these temperature-sensitive folding (TSF) mutations were all recessive to wild type. The mutant polypeptide chains were not rescued {{by the presence of}} wild-type polypeptide chains. Missense substitutions in multimeric proteins frequently exhibit intragenic complementation; however, all pairs of coat protein TSF mutants tested failed to complement. The recessive phenotypes, absence of rescue and absence of intragenic complementation are all accounted for by the TSF defect, in which destabilization of a folding intermediate at restrictive temperature prevents the mutant chain from reaching the conformation required for subunit/subunit recognition. We suggest that absence of intragenic complementation should be a general property of TSF mutations in genes encoding multimeric proteins. The <b>spectra</b> of new <b>loci</b> identified by isolating second-site suppressors and synthetic lethals of temperature sensitive mutants will also differ depending {{on the nature of the}} defect.

Identifying {{the relative importance of}} these varied components in evolution provides the principal challenge for population genetics. To address this issue in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei, I sampled nucleotide polymorphism at 40 loci across the X chromosome. The site-frequency <b>spectrum</b> for these <b>loci</b> provides no evidence for population size change, and one locus presents a candidate for linkage to a target of balancing selection. Selection for codon usage bias leads to the non-neutrality of synonymous sites, and despite its weak magnitude of effect (Nes ∼ 0. 1), is responsible for profound patterns of diversity and divergence in the C. remanei genome. Although gene conversion is evident for many loci, biased gene conversion is not identified as a significant evolutionary process in this sample. No consistent association is observed between synonymous-site diversity and linkage-disequilibrium-based estimators of the population recombination parameter, despite theoretical predictions about background selection or widespread genetic hitchhiking, but genetic map-based estimates of recombination are needed to rigorously test for a diversity–recombination relationship. Coalescent simulations also illustrate how a spurious correlation between diversity and linkage-disequilibrium-based estimators of recombination can occur, {{due in part to the}} presence of unbiased gene conversion. These results illustrate the influence that subtle natural selection can exert on polymorphism and divergence, in the form of codon usage bias, and demonstrate the potential of C. remanei for detecting natural selection from genomic scans of polymorphism...|$|R

These parameters were estimated in the long-lived, outcrossing gymnosperm loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) from a survey of single nucleotide polymorphisms across ≈ 18 kb of DNA distributed among 19 loci from a common set of 32 haploid genomes. Estimates of 4 Neμ at silent and nonsynonymous sites were 0. 00658 and 0. 00108, respectively, and both were statistically heterogeneous among loci.

When geological dating, an assumed generation time (25 years), and an estimated divergence from Pinus pinaster Ait. are used, the effective population size of loblolly pine should be 5. 6 × 105.

40|$|The {{domestication}} {{of plants}} and animals has been a powerful force in the development of human societies over the past millennia. Domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favourable traits, such as flowering time and disease resistance, which are often inherited in a quantitative manner. Advances in techniques relating to the study of quantitative traits over the past decades enable the dissection of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of these traits. In this thesis, I discuss the natural diversity governing flowering time and intermediate nonhost resistance in the non-domesticated grass Brachypodium distachyon. Three major loci were found to govern flowering time, two of which colocalise with the B. distachyon homologs of major flowering pathway genes identified in crop species. However, the identification of additional loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this non-domesticated system. In contrast, a natural stack of three resistance genes protects B. distachyon against colonisation by Puccinia striiformis and highlights a relatively simple genetic architecture for intermediate nonhost resistance. One broad <b>spectrum</b> major effect <b>locus</b> was narrowed down to genes that are commonly associated with isolate-specific host resistance While it has been proposed that nonhost and host resistance are inherently different, the genetic architecture and molecular basis of resistance in this intermediate nonhost system is reminiscent of a host system, which suggests that the genetic architectures of host and nonhost systems are structurally coupled and share conserved components. Studying the genetic basis of these quantitative traits in B. distachyon elucidates the way humans have utilised the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals. Additionally, exploring the interaction between B. distachyon and P. striiformis has provided an ideal system to investigate the transfer of resistance genes from wild relatives to agronomically important crops...|$|R
40|$|Background Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are {{extremes of}} a clinically, pathologically, and genetically overlapping disease <b>spectrum.</b> A <b>locus</b> on chromosome 9 p 21 {{has been associated}} with both disorders, and we aimed to identify the causal gene within this region. Methods We studied 305 patients with FTLD, 137 with ALS, and 23 with concomitant FTLD and ALS (FTLD-ALS) and 856 controls from Flanders (Belgium); patients were identified from a hospital-based cohort and were negative for mutations in known FTLD and ALS genes. We also examined the family of one patient with FTLD-ALS previously linked to 9 p 21 (family DR 14). We analysed 130 kbp at 9 p 21 in association and segregation studies, genomic sequencing, repeat genotyping, and expression studies to identify the causal mutation. We compared genotype-phenotype correlations between mutation carriers and non-carriers. Findings In the patient-control cohort, the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs 28140707 within the 130 kbp region of 9 p 21 was associated with disease (odds ratio [OR] 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 4. 7; p= 0. 001). A GGGGCC repeat expansion in C 9 orf 72 completely co-segregated with disease in family DR 14. The association of rs 28140707 with disease in the patient-control cohort was abolished when we excluded GGGGCC repeat expansion carriers. In patients with familial disease, six (86 %) of seven with FTLD-ALS, seven (47 %) of 15 with ALS, and 12 (16 %) of 75 with FTLD had the repeat expansion. In patients without known familial disease, one (6 %) of 16 with FTLD-ALS, six (5 %) of 122 with ALS, and nine (4 %) of 230 with FTLD had the repeat expansion. Mutation carriers primarily presented with classic ALS (10 of 11 individuals) or behavioural variant FTLD (14 of 15 individuals). Mean age at onset of FTLD was 55. 3 years (SD 8. 4) in 21 mutation carriers and 63. 2 years (9. 6) in 284 non-carriers (p= 0. 001); mean age at onset of ALS was 54. 5 years (9. 9) in 13 carriers and 60. 4 years (11. 4) in 124 non-carriers. Postmortem neuropathological analysis of the brains of three mutation carriers with FTLD showed a notably low TDP- 43 load. In brain at postmortem, C 9 orf 72 expression was reduced by nearly 50 % in two carriers compared with nine controls (p= 0. 034). In familial patients, 14 % of FTLD-ALS, 50 % of ALS, and 62 % of FTLD was not accounted for by known disease genes. Interpretation We identified a pathogenic GGGGCC repeat expansion in C 9 orf 72 on chromosome 9 p 21, as recently also reported in two other studies. The GGGGCC repeat expansion is highly penetrant, explaining all of the contribution of chromosome 9 p 21 to FTLD and ALS in the Flanders-Belgian cohort. Decreased expression of C 9 orf 72 in brain suggests haploinsufficiency as an underlying disease mechanism. Unidentified genes probably also contribute to the FTLD-ALS disease spectrum...|$|R

LeachBecause it is {{predicted}} to be durable and broad <b>spectrum,</b> quantitative trait <b>loci</b> (QTL) -based resistance is an important option for rice disease control. However, manipulation {{of this type of}} resistance requires knowledge of the contributing genes. This study demonstrates the contribution of two of three defense response (DR) genes to QTL-governed resistance, and identifies a third gene that negatively regulates resistance. The contribution to QTL-governed resistance of one of nine rice OsPAL genes, which encode phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, was determined using reverse genetics. Mutant ospal 4 contains a 750 bp deletion in OsPAL 4 and was identified using a PCR-pooling strategy. OsPAL 4 underlies a QTL on chromosome 2, and is located in cluster with three other OsPAL members. Rice lines mutated in OsPAL 4 are more susceptible to a virulent strain of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) than lines with the wild type allele. RNAi suppression was used to evaluate the contributions of genes encoding oxalate oxidase-like proteins (OsOXL) and a 14 - 3 - 3 protein (GF 14 -e) to disease resistance. Silencing of 12 OsOXL genes clustered on chromosome 8, varied from suppression of a few gene members to silencing of all expressed family members. Screening of transgenic lines by challenge with Magnaporthe grisea (Mg), the rice blast pathogen, revealed that the more chromosome 8 OsOXL genes suppressed, the more susceptible the plants were to Mg. GF 14 -e co-localizes with a disease resistance QTL on chromosome 2. Specific suppression of GF 14 -e by RNAi silencing did not result in enhanced susceptibility to Mg. Instead, the lines exhibited spontaneous HR-type lesions. The presence of this lesion mimic phenotype correlated with enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of Xoo, suggesting that the GF 14 -e encoded 14 - 3 - 3 protein functions as a negative regulator of plant cell death and bacterial resistance in rice. This study supports the hypothesis that DR genes, such as OsOXL and OsPAL 4 contribute to disease resistance governed by QTL. The role of GF 14 -e is less clear, however its down regulation may contribute to QTL-governed resistance. Thus, incorporation of regions harboring the effective DR gene alleles into rice will enhance broad spectrum and durable resistance...|$|R
