In order to analyse the conditions which favour the cultivation and selling of specific energy crops, a simple methodology is proposed, based on the calculation of the “threshold price ” of the energy crop products The “threshold price ” is the minimum price at which the primary products of the energy crop, i. e. : roots, tubers, seeds etc., must be sold in order to obtain a gross margin equal to that usually obtained from the traditional crop which has to be replaced by the energy crop. As a case-study, this methodology has been applied to twelve Italian provinces where the cultivation of six energy crops, both in productive <b>lands</b> and <b>set-aside</b> <b>lands,</b> is examined.

The study presents new data on, and insights into, the implications of the CAP for land use and land management on subsidy-dependent agricultural zones of Central Spain, particularly how this policy has impacted soil erosion and degradation since 1992. In many parts of cereal-growing Central Spain, an area of Mediterranean continental climate, <b>set-aside</b> <b>land</b> management techniques aimed at increasing soil moisture and fertility have been related to increased susceptibility to soil erosion.

Results indicate that post-CAP land use led to an increase in the amount of land in high erosion rate categories.

In many parts of cereal-growing central Spain, with Mediterranean continental climate, <b>set-aside</b> <b>land</b> management is managed as unseeded fallow, a management type used to increase soil moisture and fertility for subsequent rotations. Unseeded fallow land management has also been related to increased susceptibility to soil erosion.

Anaerobic digestion is a mature technology and is already {{used for the}} conversion of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and primary and secondary sludge from wastewater treatment plant. High methane yield up to 0. 45 Nm 3 CH 4 /kg volatile solids (VS) or 12, 390 Nm 3 CH 4 /ha can be achieved with sugar and starch crops, although these cultures are competing for high quality land with food and feed crops. The cultivation of lignocellulosic crops on marginal and <b>set-aside</b> <b>lands</b> is a more environmentally sound and sustainable option for renewable energy production. The methane yield obtained from these crops is lower, 0. 17 - 0. 39 Nm 3 CH 4 /kg VS or 5, 400 Nm 3 CH 4 /ha, as its conversion into methane is facing the same initial barrier as for the production of ethanol, e. g., hydrolysis of the crops. Intensive research and development on efficient pretreatments is ongoing to optimize the net energy production, which is potentially greater than for liquid biofuels, since the whole substrate excepted lignin is convertible into methane. Algal biomass is another alternative to food and feed crops. Their relatively high methane potential (up to 0. 45 Nm 3 CH 4 /kg VS fed) combined with their higher areal biomass productivity make them particularly attractive as a feedstock for an anaerobic digestion-based biorefinery concept.

In this study our aim was to determine whether management of the plant community influences the microarthropod community. We carried out a field experiment in three European countries on <b>set-aside</b> arable <b>land</b> and determined soil mites from the sites in Sweden, The Netherlands and Spain. Experimental plots on <b>set-aside</b> arable <b>land</b> were sown with high (15 species) or low (4 species) plant species seed mixtures; other plots were colonized naturally. A field with continued agricultural practices and a later successional site (target site) were used for comparison with the experimental plots. Soil from the later successional site was inoculated into half of the plots. Abandoning agricultural practices increased the density of mites at one site while the number of mite species was not affected. Sowing plant seeds had no effect on mite densities at any of the sites. The community composition of mites changed in response to management of the plant community, as shown by canonical correspondence analysis. Among the functional groups of mites, saprophytes generally dominated on all plots at all sites. Mites parasitic on insects were not present on fields with continued agricultural practice in Sweden and The Netherlands, and might thus be regarded as an indicator of an increase in trophic complexity in the sown and naturally colonized treatments. Predatory and plant parasitic mites showed no consistent pattern in relation to the treatments of the three sites.

40|$|Domestic {{production}} of bioenergy by utilizing <b>set-aside</b> <b>land</b> in Taiwan can reduce Taiwan?s reliance on expensive and politically insecure foreign fossil fuels while also reducing the combustion of fossil fuels, which emit {{substantial amounts of}} greenhouse gases. After joining the World Trade Organization, Taiwan?s agricultural sector idled {{about one-third of the}} national cropland, hereafter called ?<b>set-aside</b> <b>land?.</b> This potentially provides the land base for Taiwan to develop a bioenergy industry. This dissertation examines Taiwan?s potential for bioenergy production using feedstocks grown on <b>set-aside</b> <b>land</b> and discusses the consequent effects on Taiwan?s energy security plus benefits and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Taiwan Agricultural Sector Model (TASM) was used to simulate different agricultural policies related to bioenergy production. To do this simulation the TASM model was extended to include additional bioenergy production possibilities and GHG accounting. We find that Taiwan?s bioenergy production portfolio depends on prices of ethanol, electricity and GHG. When GHG prices go up, ethanol production decreases and electricity production increases because of the relatively stronger GHG offset power of biopower. Results from this pyrolysis study are then incorporated into the TASM model. Biochar from pyrolysis can be used in two ways: burn it or use it as a soil amendment. Considering both of these different uses of biochar, we examine bioenergy production and GHG offset to see to what extent Taiwan gets energy security benefits from the pyrolysis technology and how it contributes to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, by examining ethanol, electricity and pyrolysis together in the same framework, we are able to see how they affect each other under different GHG prices, coal prices and ethanol prices. Results show that ethanol is driven out by pyrolysis-based electricity when GHG price is high. We also find that when biochar is hauled back to the rice fields, GHG emission reduction is higher than that when biochar is burned for electricity; however, national electricity production is consequently higher when biochar is burned...|$|E

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier tariff rate import quota system. Although Taiwan maintained <b>land</b> <b>set-asides</b> and domestic support prices for producer sales to the State Trading Enterprise, the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, <b>land</b> <b>set-aside</b> and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the tariff quota system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and <b>land</b> <b>set-aside</b> improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments. But the policy regime of the tariff quota (the in-quota tariff versus the out-of-quota tariff versus the quota) and hence social welfare is sensitive to changes in both domestic policy instruments and market structure. tariff rate quota, strategic alliance, domestic support, market structure, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|R

40|$|Willow short {{rotation}} coppice (SRC) is seen as {{an important}} renewable energy source within temperate regions including the UK and its deployment within the agri-environment is supported by a number of goverment policies. Willow SRC represents a significant land use change and its deployment has raised questions regarding the possible impacts on biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services. This work assessed the impact of three commercial willow SRC plantations on ecosystem processes through the use of herbivory, decomposition and predation bioassays. Comparisons were also made between the willow SRC plantations and the abundance and diversity of: summer ground flora and winged invertebrates in the alternative land use options of set-aside and cereal crops; predatory ground invertebrates and small mammals in winter wheat and barely. In comparison to cereal crops the willow SRC plantations contained a higher abundance and species richness of ground flora and small mammals, and a higher abundance and family richness of predatory ground invertebrates. Ground flora richness was higher in the <b>set-aside</b> <b>land</b> than within the willow SRC. The ground flora community within the willow SRC was markedly different to both set aside and arable land with a shift from an annual and ruderal to competitive and perennial dominated community. The composition of winged invertebrate Orders also varied between the land uses with higher numbers of Hymenoptera and Hemiptera trapped within the willow SRC plantations than within the arable and <b>set-aside</b> <b>land.</b> No differences were detected on rates of predation on invertebrate prey, seedling herbivory and decomposition between willow SRC and <b>set-aside</b> <b>land.</b> In comparison to cereal crops higher rates of decomposition and higher rates of predation by small mammals in the autumn were recorded in willow SRC. Overall the results suggest that, willow SRC plantations may benefit farm-scale biodiversity by providing a habitat where plants and animals that are uncommon on alternative land use can persist. Moreover positive effects on the species richness of small mammals and the abundance and richness of predatory invertebrates may have positive implication for natural pest control both within willow SRC plantations and possibly on surrounding landscape. Comparisons to set-aside did, however, highlight that willow SRC is not a panacea for all species and care must be taken in the location and fraction of the landscape that is devoted to this cro...|$|E

The policy effect of a reform in 2008, where the mandatory set-aside policy was abolished due to inefficiencies, is studied by applying a quasi-experimental method to estimate the casual relationship between mandatory set-aside abolishment and farm environmental performance. This evaluation is relevant as the mandatory set-aside was re-introduced in 2013 and this study contributes with insights into policy implications of mandatory set-aside, as it has never been evaluated before. The difference-in-difference results show signs of improved environmental performance of farmers due to the policy change, in opposite towards the hypothesis. Thus, it does not support the expectation that more land would be used for fertiliser and pesticide due to the mandatory set-aside elimination.

Our objective {{was to assess the}} potential benefits of SAFE for upland gamebirds and grassland songbirds in Kansas. We monitored lands enrolled in SAFE to estimate bird density based on field scale and landscape scale characteristics. Our study was conducted in three ecoregions: Smoky Hills (4 counties), Flint Hills (3 counties), and the High Plains (3 counties). We surveyed 121 SAFE fields and 49 CRP fields from 2012 – 2013. Northern Bobwhite density was negatively associated with percent litter within survey fields. Ring-necked Pheasant density differed among ecoregions, and was positively associated with percent bare ground in the High Plains, but negatively associated with field age in the Smoky Hills. Mourning Dove density differed among ecoregions, and was negatively associated with percent forb in the High Plains, and positively associated with percent grassland in the Smoky Hills. In the Flint Hills, Mourning Doves were negatively associated with CRP fields and large fields. Brown-headed Cowbirds were positively associated with percent forbs. Amount of CRP surrounding survey locations was positively associated with bird density through the entire range for Grasshopper Sparrows, Dickcissels, and Lark Buntings, and in the High Plains for Western Meadowlarks. Percent woodland had negative effects on Western Meadowlarks in the Smoky Hills, whereas percent cropland had negative effects on Eastern Meadowlarks statewide. CRP positively affected abundance of four of our species, whereas percent cropland and woodland negatively affected others.

Willow SRC had the highest abundance and diversity of ground-dwelling arthropod predators, but land-use had no detectable influence on predation of fly pupae or the combined activity-density of the two principal Coleoptera families (carabids and staphylinids). Overall, our study demonstrates that the conversion of arable land to SRC may have implications for the rate of some, but not all, ecosystem processes, and highlights the need for further research in this are...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} agricultural sustainability in {{the context}} of land degradation, rural poverty and social inequality, taking China’s Loess Hills as an example. The analysis attempts to understand the multi-dimensionality of sustainability at the farm level and its relationship with physical-socio-economic-infrastructural-technological framework conditions {{in the context}} of the <b>land</b> <b>set-aside</b> program viz. the Grain for Green Project (GGP). We developed composite indices of sustainability and its environmental, economic and social dimensions using a principal component analysis (PCA) -based weighting scheme. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the estimated sustainability indicators and the variables representing framework conditions of knowledge, demographics, resource endowment and production techniques. The stated analysis was conducted on a dataset collected by means of household surveys in 2014 in valleys and flood plain areas in Yanhe Township. Findings reveal hidden correlations among the indicators of environmental, economic, and social pillars of sustainability. The ratio of land under the conservation program to actual farmland emerged as a key determinant of overall agricultural sustainability and its social dimension, which reaches the maximum when the ratio is around 0. 56 and 0. 64, respectively. The results also show that there is need to balance off-farm and on-farm income diversification as well as highlight the role of women in ensuring the sustainability of farming households. The core achievement of the article is the definition of the thresholds for the <b>land</b> <b>set-aside</b> program and the identification of major determinants of agricultural sustainability in the rural Chinese context in particular and in rural farming communities in general...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytical}} framework allowing {{estimation of the}} effects of the new instrumentation of the CAP in the arable crop sector- price cuts, compensatory payments and <b>land</b> <b>set-aside</b> schemes- on crop acreage alloca-tions, supplies and yields. Duality theory is used to model crop supply response in the presence of voluntary acreage control programmes and direct aids per hectare to producers. The definition of a profit function where total land is fixed but allocatable to the various crops allows us to obtain, via the envelope theorem, output and variable input equations, which can be used with the first-order conditions for an optimal land allocation as a basis for comparative statics analysis of the three main instruments of the CAP...|$|R
