25|$|Of Languedoc Gothic style, the Sainte-Thérèse Church is {{opposite}} the market halls and the Place Marcadieu. Its history {{began with the}} establishment of the Carmelites in the 13th century. The bell tower, {{which is one of the}} oldest items, dates from the 15th century and is a remnant of the ancient abbey. The church was, however, largely renovated in the 19th century by the architect of the city, Claude Tiffon.

25|$|After 1686, the Baroque {{architecture}} {{designated the}} dominant style {{of art in}} catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century. There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest {{and one of the}} finest examples of original Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has <b>some</b> <b>beautiful</b> historic buildings with original Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.|$|E
25|$|Behind the scenes, Miles and Teo {{took the}} tapes of the In a Silent Way {{sessions}} and transformed <b>some</b> <b>beautiful,</b> folk-tinged, melody-driven sets into two exquisite, beguiling and otherworldly pieces of music. Using techniques that pre-dated {{the proliferation of}} tape loops, cut-ups, edits and sequencing in rock, pop, hip hop and dance music, Miles and Teo took apart the original recording and reassembled them outside of any traditional or accepted jazz structure or melodic framework. This idea of taking jazz away from its birth, genesis and flowering as a live art and into the studio would soon become standard practice, but in 1969 it was groundbreaking.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the second}} time trial stage, with long {{straight}} stretches, <b>some</b> <b>beautiful</b> sections of unbending road and some slight inclines (with one located about 600 m to the finish line). It was clear that time-trial specialists would be the center of attention. After an impressive performance during the Pyrenees crossing and the capture of the yellow jersey due to Michael Rasmussen's dismissal, Alberto Contador expressed his concerns about being beaten in the final time trial of the competition. Before the riders located above the 20th place started, Belgian Leif Hoste set a time of 1h 05' 32", making him the 1st ranked rider of the stage {{for a long period of}} time. Nonetheless, with the start of the favourites for the stage, he gradually went down through the standings, finishing in 9th position. David Millar, who was expected to be a contender for victory, experienced mechanical trouble, needing to change bikes twice within the first kilometer.|$|E
25|$|In early {{times the}} choir alone possessed seats, the nave being left bare. Gradually benches were introduced, {{and during the}} 15th century became universal. The poppyhead form of B {{ornament}} now reached perfection and was constantly used enc for seats other {{than those of the}} choir. The name refers en a. to the carved finial which is so often used to complete the top of the bench end and is peculiarly English in character. In Devon and Cornwall it is rarely met with (Ilsington, Devon). In Somerset it is more common, while in the eastern counties thousands of examples remain. The quite simple fleur-de-lys form of poppyhead, suitable for the village, is seen in perfection at Trunch, Norfolk, and the very elaborate form when the poppyhead springs from a crocketed circle filled in with sculpture, at St Nicholas, King's Lynn. Often the foliage contained a face (St Margaret's, Cley, Norfolk), or the poppyhead consisted of figures or birds only (Thurston, Suffolk) or a figure standing on a dragon (Great Brincton, Northampton); occasionally the traditional form was departed from and the finial carved like a lemon in outline (Bury St Edmuncis) or a diamond (Tirley, Glos.). In Denmark an ornament {{in the form of a}} large circle sometimes takes the place of the English poppy-head. In the Copenhagen Museum there is a set of bench ends of the 15th century with such a decoration carved with coats of arms, interlacing strap-work, etc. But the old 15th-century bench end did not depend entirely on the poppy-head for its embellishment. The side was constantly enriched with elaborate tracery (Dennington, Norfolk) or with tracery and domestic scenes (North Cadbury, Somerset), or would consist of a mass of sculpture in perspective, with canopy work, buttresses and sculptured niches, while the top of the bench end would be crowned with figures carved in the round, of the finest craftsmanship. Such work at Amiens cathedral is a marvel alike of conception, design and execution. In the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin <b>some</b> <b>beautiful</b> stall ends are to be seen. Out of a dragons mouth grows a conventional tree arranged and balanced in excellent proportion. On another, stall end a tree is carved growing out of the mouth of a fool. This custom of making foliage grow out of the mouth or eyes is hardly defensible, and was by no means confined to any country or time. We have plenty of Renaissance examples of the same treatment.|$|E

500|$|Once again, as John Kinnaird observed, Hazlitt is here {{far more}} than a [...] "character critic", showing serious {{interest}} {{in the structure of the}} play as a whole. [...] "The whole of the trial-scene", he remarks in this essay, [...] "is a master-piece of dramatic skill. The legal acuteness, the passionate declamations, the sound maxims of jurisprudence, the wit and irony interspersed in it, the fluctuations of hope and fear in the different persons, and the completeness and suddenness of the catastrophe, cannot be surpassed". He points to <b>some</b> <b>beautiful</b> poetic passages, and concludes that [...] "the graceful winding up of this play [...] is one of the happiest instances of Shakespear's knowledge of the principles of the drama".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game's {{graphical}} quality. Gerstmann said {{the use of}} lighting added a unique style to the game. He also liked the depiction {{of the two major}} areas of the game, and the game's sounds, which he said suited the tone of the game. Alexandra Hall from GamesRadar said [...] "Starbreeze really coaxed <b>some</b> <b>beautiful</b> sights out of aging hardware". She added that some players may not be pleased with the game's bloom effects. David Houghton of the same publication said the game is [...] "a decent shooter" [...] but that its lightbloom effects were [...] "nonsensically over-the-top". Peter Eykemans from IGN echoed similar thoughts, declaring that the motion bloom and blinding light a problem. However, he admitted that the game [...] "constantly looks great", and that its simple design has made the game to look very polished.|$|E
500|$|When {{the tour}} was announced, U2 guitarist The Edge {{said of the}} show's design: [...] "It's hard {{to come up with}} {{something}} that's fundamentally different, but we have, I think, on this tour. Where we're taking our production will never have been seen before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing to be able to say. For a band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill." [...] Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side: [...] "We have some magic, and we've got <b>some</b> <b>beautiful</b> objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object." [...] He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: [...] "The band is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand." [...] At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures in different parts of the globe and turn them into permanent concert venues. An auction of the stages was planned following the last concert.|$|E
500|$|The journal, which {{switches}} {{between the}} first-person singular and plural but never identifies its narrators, describes Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week tour across the Continent. It is divided by country: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the group arrives in Calais {{and proceeds to}} Paris, they decide on a plan: [...] "After talking over and rejecting many plans, we fixed on one eccentric enough, but which, from its romance, was very pleasing to us. In England {{we could not have}} put it in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence: the French are far more tolerant of the vagaries of their neighbours. We resolved to walk through France". Each day they enter a new town; but even while travelling, they spend time writing and reading. The journal comments on the people they meet, the countryside, and the current events that have shaped the environment. Some of what they see is beautiful and some is [...] "barren and wretched". Percy sprains his ankle, which becomes an increasing problem—the group is forced to hire a carriage. By the time the trio reaches Lucerne, they are nearly out of money and decide to return home. They return by boat along the Rhine, the cheapest mode of travel. Despite problems with unreliable boats and dangerous waters, they see <b>some</b> <b>beautiful</b> scenery before landing in England.|$|E
