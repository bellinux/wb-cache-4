25|$|In 1977, Hughes-Games {{described}} the first practical marine fish/shellfish/phytoplankton culture, followed by Gordin, et al., in 1981. By 1989, a semi-intensive (1kg fish/m−3) <b>seabream</b> and grey mullet pond system by the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat) on the Red Sea supported dense diatom populations, excellent for feeding oysters. Hundreds of kilos {{of fish and}} oysters cultured here were sold. Researchers also quantified the water quality parameters and nutrient budgets in (5kg fish m−3) green water <b>seabream</b> ponds. The phytoplankton generally maintained reasonable water quality and converted on average over half the waste nitrogen into algal biomass. Experiments with intensive bivalve cultures yielded high bivalve growth rates. This technology supported a small farm in southern Israel.|$|E

30|$|At {{the same}} time, at the Neretva Estuary, {{a total of}} 234 adult gilthead <b>seabreams</b> were caught by {{gillnets}} and long lines. It was found that 63.4 and 33.2  % of the specimens were aged 1 + and 2 + years, respectively. The rest were 3 + (2.3  %) and 4 + years (1.1  %) individuals. Two spear gun fishermen were questioned and they caught approximately 570  kg of adult gilthead <b>seabreams</b> together (360 and 210  kg each fisherman, respectively). The structure of their catches was not completely scientifically verified and thus we relied on their estimation. Moreover, this estimation is also biased by the preference of spear divers for larger fish. This {{was reflected in the}} structure of the catches: over 840 specimens with an individual weight of 300 – 500  g range (age 2 + and 3 + years) and 75 fish with weight between 1, 500 and 2, 100  g (age 5 + and 6 + years).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the quality traits of Sparus aurata {{specimens}} from 2 different farming activities (intensively-reared in sea cages and extensively-reared in a coastal lagoon) and from the wild in Sardinia (Italy). Yields and biological indexes of the fish and biochemical and nutritional factors of their muscle were evaluated to verify putative differences due to their origin and/or the farming technique employed. Two different statistical approaches were applied to find out possible dissimilarities among the 3 groups: 1) univariate analysis and subsequent post-hoc comparison tests were employed to test specific hypotheses on each variable’s role; 2) multivariate analyses were used to assess which variables mainly contributed to differentiate the 3 groups. The results obtained showed that yields and biological indexes were higher in extensively-reared <b>seabreams.</b> Proximate composition revealed differences in term of lipid and moisture content: the former was superior in intensively-cultured fish, while the second was higher in those from wild stock. Protein and ashes did not show significant differences among the 3 groups studied. As regards mineral content, significant differences were detected probably as a consequence of different diets of the 3 groups. Finally, fatty acids profiles revealed that n- 3 PUFAs were higher in wild <b>seabreams,</b> n- 6 PUFAs were superior in the intensively-reared ones, while extensivelyreared fish showed the highest n 3 /n 6 ratio...|$|R

Cooked dumplings are commonly served with a dipping sauce such as mustard or choganjang (soy sauce mixed with vinegar).|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Canary Current Large Ecosystem is {{characterized}} by a major, nutrient-rich up-welling of deep, cold oceanic waters, which stimulates high biological productivity that results in an abundance of both pelagic and demersal fishery resources. In this area, the Moroccan coast is also under direct anthropogenic activities influences such as phosphates industries. Several observations indicate that variations of the upwelling activities observed in the recent years would generate the remobilization of the contaminants. Our study deals with the metallic concentrations in the otoliths of 3 fish species of economic interest (Merlucius merlucius, Pagellus acarne, Sardina pilchardus) along the Moroccan coast. The fishes were collected in markets in june 2012 for the northern part of Morocco (during the maximum of the upwelling activity) and in November 2012 for the southern part. Concentrations were measured by ICP-MS on transects from nucleus to the edge of otoliths to characterize environmental variations or accumulations linked to ecophases and growth. For each species, 5 fishes were analyzed in 7 locations from North to south of the Moroccan Atlantic coast.

40|$|In the Mediterranean, sea breams are {{the most}} {{effective}} Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula predators. Generally, <b>seabreams</b> dislodge adult urchins from the rocky substrate, turn them upside down and crush their tests. Sea urchins may respond to fish attacks clinging tenaciously to the substratum. This study is the first attempt to investigate sea urchin adhesion strength in two alternative algal assemblages of the rocky infralittoral and valuated its possible implication for fish predation. We hypothesized that (1) sea urchin adhesion strength is higher in rocky shores dominated by encrusting macro-algae (ECA) than in erected macro algae (EMA); (2) predation rates upon sea urchins are lower in ECA than in EMA; and (3) predation rate on A. lixula is lower than that on P. lividus. We observed that attachment tenacity of both sea urchins was higher in ECA than EMA and that A. lixula exhibited a stronger attachment tenacity than P. lividus in ECA. Results supported the importance of adhesion strength, as efficient defence against sea bream attacks, only for, P. lividus. A. lixula adhesion strength {{does not seem to}} be an important factor in avoiding fish predation, possibly because of the low palatability of the species. These patterns may deserve particular interest in understanding the processes responsible for the maintenance of sea urchin barrens that are dominated by ECA assemblage...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{development}} of economic globalization, oceanic ports became important cores of economic activity and, therefore, potential sources of diffuse and chronic impacts on coastal ecosystems. Monitoring biological communities {{is a very important}} tool to assess these impacts. In a multi-environment monitoring programme of the oceanic port of Sines running for several years, the rocky subtidal macrobenthic community has been studied, including the fish community. Patterns of spatial and temporal variation of the diversity and structure of the fish community were studied in the summer of 2014 (two random dates sampled) sampling six areas in the port (three sheltered and three exposed) and two areas outside the port. The total number of taxa and the density of each observed taxon were quantified through visual censuses in belt transects by scuba diving. Data were analysed with univariate and multivariate techniques. Substrate physical features (bottom complexity and type) were sampled in the same transects. Outside areas were significantly different from the port areas. These differences were due to a lower number of taxa in the outside areas and, generally, to a greater abundance of several taxa in the port areas, such as some species with commercial value (e. g. <b>seabreams</b> Diplodus spp.). These results suggest that this port may provide favorable conditions for the occurrence of a greater fish diversity and abundance than outside areas, particularly for some species that live in subtidal rocky substrates.
