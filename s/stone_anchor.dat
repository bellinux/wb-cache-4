On Prestongrange's cover, where the Government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent, I writ, by the boat's lantern, a few necessary words, and Andie carried them to Rankeillor.

Whether it was Chili or Peru that lay ahead of him he had no means of knowing, but he believed it was the former, for he had headed rather to the south of east and felt sure that he should strike the coast somewhere on the long seaboard of Chili. He was the more convinced of this as two days before he had seen an island far to the north of him and guessed it to be either San Felix or San Ambrose, and had shaped his course rather more to the south in consequence. That night he was too excited to turn in as usual, but held on his course. By morning the land lay little more than twenty miles away, and he recognized at once the outline of the hills that he had passed when sailing north, and knew where Valparaiso lay, some fifty miles further south. He changed his course accordingly, and at four o’clock in the afternoon dropped his <b>stone</b> <b>anchor</b> a hundred yards off the quay of the Chilian port.|$|E

40|$|Marine archaeological {{investigations}} {{brought to}} light {{a large number of}} antiquities suggesting active maritime practices along the Saurashtra coast dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization. Recent underwater explorations between Miyani and Madhavpur on the Saurashtra coast yielded the remains of jetties along the Porbandar creek, <b>stone</b> <b>anchors</b> at Srinagar, Ghumli and Tukda. <b>Stone</b> <b>anchors</b> were also reported off Miyani (Harshad Mata) and Kindari creek. The discovery of these <b>stone</b> <b>anchors</b> also indicate that the mouth of creeks had been extensively used as anchoring points by ancient mariners. This is one parameter to explain anchoring points and existence of ancient ports on the coast of India. Creeks and the banks of tidal rivershad provided sheltered harbours forancient settlers on the Saurashtra coast. This coast has been a focal point for marine archaeological research in India.

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>stone</b> <b>anchors</b> can provide {{information}} on the size, date and provenance of the ships that carried them, as they were provided by the boat- or ship-builder. In general terms {{the size of the}} ship can be correlated with the anchor, but finds of <b>stone</b> <b>anchors</b> from various sites both in India and abroad suggest that ships carried a number of anchors of various sizes. This may have been related to the type of journey, or expected weather conditions. In storms or other unfavourable conditions sailors looked for a sheltered place to anchor. The types of anchors depend {{on the nature of the}} seabed. Generally, anchors are found in harbour sites, dockyards, shipwreck sites, and sheltered places along trade routes. Many examples have been found on rocky sea beds and in shallow waters in Indian coastal waters (Gaur et al., 2001; Sundaresh et al., 1999 and Sila Tripati et al., 2003). Over the years exploration and chance finds have yielded 59 triangular anchors, 109 Indo-Arabian and 60 ringstone (Fig. 1) and these have helped to reconstruct the history and development of <b>stone</b> <b>anchors</b> of India...|$|R

50|$|Similar anchors {{were also}} found {{on the left side}} wall. A further five grapnel stone anchors were noticed behind the dockyard. At one spot two have been erected and one is laid on the ground {{probably}} to prevent soil erosion. The other two anchors have been erected at different places for use as mooring bits for ships berthed in the dock. About 200 m south east from the dock, a triangular <b>stone</b> <b>anchor</b> was found lying on the wall. Stone anchors constitute the earliest antiquities discovered in the region. Such anchors were in use in India up to the 17th century AD, until the advent of iron anchors. The availability of the raw material and thus reduction in the cost of manufacture facilitated the extensive use of such anchors over a long period. It is still not clear whether these stone anchors were used for coastal or oversea voyages. All the grapnels and the triangular stone anchors found in clusters are made of local sandstone and fine laterite. These anchors have been uniformly chiselled on both sides and are similar to anchors from Sindhudurg Fort (Malwan) which belong to the Early Historic Period. A further eight grapnel stone anchors were noticed {{for the first time on}} the arches of the parapet wall of the second fortification of Vijaydurg Fort. These anchors have been used as lintels of arches. It is a protected yet a forgotten monument about 1 km from Rameshwar Wadi.|$|E
50|$|The stone anchors {{have been}} noticed {{close to the}} present {{lighthouse}} in inter tidal zone. Being in the high tidal range, the stone anchors that are lying in 5 to 10 m water depth during high tide get exposed during low tide. These stone anchors are found either partially buried or exposed on the gravel bed. The seabed at the finding spot of the anchor consisted of gravel and fine sand. The majority of the anchors are of Indo-Arabia type and one <b>stone</b> <b>anchor</b> falls {{in the category of}} composite type. The Indo-Arabia type anchors of typically made from a vertical stone block with often square section with two lower holes are rectangular/ square and an upper circular hole. Two anchors in the group of Indo-Arab type are having uniform vertical deep and wide groove on all the four faces of the anchor. The broken single composite anchor is made of a thin limestone block with two lower holes are square and two circular holes are placed randomly on upper side. The detail measurements and drawing could be completed just of 14 anchors due to tidal time and muddy seabed and hence rest anchors were only photographed. Many stone anchors are fragmented in nature. Majority of the anchors are parted with lower 2 holes and sometimes holes also broken which might have been broken during manufacturing stage. The raw material used for these anchors are hard basaltic, sedimentary and a few of conglomeratic material. A fragmentary anchor is the biggest anchor found from here. Only lower portion is surviving and is very similar to those reported from Mithi Virdi. There is a stone block without any holes noticed similar to the Indo-Arabia type anchor.|$|E

Being on {{the trade}} route, boats and ships used the islands of Lakshadweep as a {{stopover}} to take on fresh water. Lakshadweep Islands {{played an important role}} in the shipping route before the opening of the Suez Canal. In order to understand the earliest human habitation at Lakshadweep Islands archaeological exploration was conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and (National Institute of Oceanography) NIO and varieties of pottery, Roman coins and Buddha heads were recovered at Androth, Kadmat, Kavaratti and Minicoy. In addition to these finds, in recent past an Indo-Arabian type of <b>stone</b> <b>anchor</b> has come to light at the Jama Mosque of Funhilol of Minicoy. The anchor was used as a lintel at the entrance of the mosque. Further study shows that ring stone anchors were used by the fishermen of Minicoy until the 20 th century. Similarly, ring stone anchors which are popularly known as ‘fanaa ’ were used by the fishermen of Maldives in recent years. The stone anchors of Minicoy and Maldives resemble stone anchors recovered from other parts of India. Ring stone anchors were used in Minicoy and Maldives till the advent of iron anchors. In this paper an attempt has been made to describe the Indo-Arabian <b>stone</b> <b>anchor</b> of Jama Mosque of Funhilol of Minicoy and ring <b>stone</b> <b>anchor</b> of Minicoy and their importance.

40|$|There {{are three}} systems of' dol' (bag net) operation, locally known as * Khamba ', ' Khunt-sus' (both in Maharashtra) and ' Kaba-sus' (in Gujarat). ' Kaba-sus' is a {{permanent}} <b>stone</b> <b>anchor</b> consisting of a heap of stones with a rope tied to float (Kaba) for net operation. In Maharashtra, ' Khunt-sus • consists of anchor pole or spike (of about 8 - 10 feet in length) driven in mud {{at the bottom of}} the sea. Another system of ' dol' operation is ' Khamba' which consists of very long wooden poles or pylons fixed to the bott om. For the three ' dol' opsrating system, the cost and earning data from 20 sample units were collected on 5 systematically selected sample days each month for a period of one year starting from Septembsr 1984 aad analysed. This papsr deals with the different components of variable and fixed costs and monthwise distribution of catch, fishing days and income for the three systems.
