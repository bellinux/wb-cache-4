40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} whether matching implementation intentions to people 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory orientation affects {{the effectiveness of}} changing unhealthy <b>snacking</b> habits. Design: Participants 2 ̆ 7 regulatory orientation was either measured (as a chronic trait) or manipulated (as a situational state), and participants {{were randomly assigned to}} implementation intention conditions to eat more healthy <b>snacks</b> or avoid eating unhealthy ones. Main Outcome Measures: A self-reported online food diary of healthy and unhealthy <b>snacks</b> over a 2 -day period. Results: Participants with weak unhealthy <b>snacking</b> habits consumed more healthy <b>snacks</b> when forming any type of implementation intentions (regardless of match or mismatch with their regulatory orientation), while participants with strong unhealthy <b>snacking</b> habits consumed more healthy <b>snacks</b> only when forming implementation intentions that matched their regulatory orientations. Conclusion: Results suggest that implementation intentions that match regulatory orientation heighten motivation intensity and put <b>snacking</b> under intentional control for people with strong unhealthy <b>snacking</b> habits.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of adolescents eats too many energy-dense <b>snacks,</b> which is detrimental for their current and future health. To understand how to promote healthy dietary behaviors in adolescents, we need to identify factors that affect their <b>snacking.</b> While previous cross-sectional work has shown mother-child similarities in eating behavior, longitudinal studies are lacking. Hence, the first {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether maternal <b>snacking</b> predicted changes in adolescents' <b>snacking</b> over time. A second aim was to examine whether adolescents' television viewing magnified the strength of this longitudinal association. Television viewing may increase the motivation to eat the <b>snacks</b> consumed by mothers later on, for example through food advertisement exposure and mindless eating. To address both aims, 2051 adolescents (Mage baseline = 13. 81; 51. 5 % boys) were asked to report on their <b>snacking</b> and television viewing three times, with intervals of one year. Moreover, a subsample of mothers of adolescents (N = 1080) reported on their <b>snacking</b> at baseline as well. The results indicate that maternal <b>snacking</b> indeed predicts adolescents' <b>snacking</b> over time and that this effect is more pronounced among adolescents who watch a great amount of television. These findings attest to the importance of mothers in forming adolescents' <b>snacking,</b> not only concurrently but also prospectively. Additionally, this study highlights the relevance of assessing other home environmental factors that may influence maternal effects on their children's <b>snacking...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} salt on the expansion of starchy <b>snacks</b> during frying {{by means of a}} multiscale simulation model. This model has been developed earlier for starchy <b>snacks</b> without salt. The simulation results are analysed by means of the supplemented state diagram. We have found that the optimal expansion for salty <b>snacks</b> occurs under the same conditions as for <b>snacks</b> without salt. This occurs at the moisture content where the 4 bar boiling line intersects the critical isoviscosity line of 1 MPa s. Salt is shown to influence both the boiling line and the critical isoviscosity line, via a change of the glass transition. The optimal moisture content for salty <b>snacks</b> is lower than that of unsalted <b>snacks.</b> We view our findings as important for reformulations of starchy <b>snacks</b> with lower salt levels.

40|$|ABSTRACT Physicochemical {{properties}} of rice-based expanded <b>snacks</b> extruded with rice flour, high amylose starch, and {{isolated soy protein}} were investigated using a twin-screw extruder. The ingredients were extruded at various feed moisture contents (19 ～ 23 %) and screw speeds (200 ～ 400 rpm) at a constant feed rate (43. 4 kg/hr). Bulk density and apparent density of rice <b>snacks</b> were 0. 06 ～ 0. 21, and 0. 55 ～ 0. 65 respectively. Bulk density, apparent density, water absorption index, and breaking strength of rice <b>snacks</b> increased with increasing feed moisture content and decreas-ing screw speed. However, expansion and water solubility index of rice <b>snacks</b> increased with decreasing feed moisture content and increasing screw speed. Hunter's color L values of rice <b>snacks</b> was lower with increasing screw speed at feed moisture contents of 19 % and 21 %, but was {{not significantly different from}} a feed moisture content of 23 %. On the other hand, a and b values of rice <b>snacks</b> were higher with increasing screw speed a feed moisture content of 19 %.
