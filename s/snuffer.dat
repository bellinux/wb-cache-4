The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

60|$|As {{there were}} candlesticks and lamps, {{so there were}} <b>snuffers</b> also {{prepared}} for these in {{the temple of the}} Lord.

This should teach ministers, to whom it belongs under Christ to use the <b>snuffers</b> well. Strike at the snuff, not at the light, in all your rebukes and admonitions; snuff not your lamps of a private revenge, but of a design to nourish grace and gifts in churches. Thus our Lord himself says he did, in his using of these <b>snuffers</b> about these candlesticks. 'As many,' saith he, 'as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent' (Rev 3:19).|$|R

60|$|Answ. If our snuffs are our superfluities of naughtiness, our <b>snuffers</b> {{then are}} those righteous reproofs, rebukes, and admonitions, which Christ has ordained {{to be in}} his house for good; or, as the apostle hath it, for our edification; and perhaps Paul alludes to these when he bids Titus to rebuke the Cretians sharply, that they might be sound in the faith (Titus 1:12,13). As who should say, they must use the <b>snuffers</b> of the temple to trim their lights withal, if they burn not well. These <b>snuffers</b> {{therefore}} are of great use in the temple of God; only, as I said, they must be used wisely. It is not for every fool to handle <b>snuffers</b> at or about the candles, lest perhaps, instead of mending the light, they put the candle out. And therefore Paul bids them that are spiritual do it (Gal 6:1). My reason tells me, that if I use these <b>snuffers</b> as I should, I must not only endeavour to take the superfluous snuff away, but so to do it, that the light thereby may be mended; which then is done if, as the apostle saith, I use sharpness to edification, and not for destruction (1 Cor 5:4,5; 2 Cor 13:10).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Background: A high smoking {{prevalence}} {{has been}} reported in treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals. It has also been suggested that alcohol-dependent individuals who smoke may have a more severe course and greater severity of their alcoholism. Methods: This study evaluated the impact of tobacco use in 108 Swedish male type 1 alcohol-dependent individuals, recruited by advertisement in a local daily newspaper. They were sub-grouped into smokers (N = 50), <b>snuffers</b> (N = 12) and tobacco nonusers (N = 46). The number of criteria for the diagnosis of alcohol dependence was used to assess the severity of alcohol dependence. Results: The smokers were significantly younger compared to the tobacco non-using group, and also younger at their onset of excessive alcohol consumption. Both smokers and <b>snuffers</b> fulfilled significantly more DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence than tobacco nonusers. Furthermore, significantly higher proportions of smokers and <b>snuffers</b> fulfilled the criteria no 2 (experiencing withdrawal syndrome) and no 7 (continuing to use alcohol despite problems). Conclusions: These findings indicate that not only smoking, but also snuffing, is associated with greater severity of alcohol dependence, as reflected by the greater number of DSM-IV criteria...|$|R
60|$|Ah! snuffs pulled off, lie {{still in}} the temple-floor, and there stink, and defile both feet and fingers, both the callings and conversations of temple-worshippers, to the disparaging of religion, {{and the making of}} {{religious}} worship but of low esteem with men; and all, I say, for want of the due use of these <b>snuffers,</b> and these snuff-dishes, there. Nay, are not whole churches now defiled with those very snuffs, that long since were plucked off, and all for want of the use of these snuff-dishes, according to the Lord's commandment. For you must know, that reproof and admonitions are but of small use, where repentance, or church-censures, are not thereto annexed.

60|$|As {{there were}} <b>snuffers,</b> {{so there were}} also snuff-dishes in the temple; 'and they were also made of gold' (Exo 25:38; 37:23; Num 4:9). The snuff-dishes were those in which the snuffs were put when snuffed off, and by which they were carried forth of the temple. They therefore, as the <b>snuffers</b> are, are of great use in the temple of God. 1. By them the golden floor of the temple is kept from being daubed by the snuffs. 2. By them also the clean hands of those that worship there are kept from being defiled. 3. By them also the stinks of the snuffs are soonest {{suppressed}} in the temple; and consequently the tender noses of them that worship there preserved from being offended.|$|R
