500|$|The Sea Pines <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> {{can be seen}} {{near the}} east {{entrance}} to the Sea Pines Forest Preserve. The ring, one of only 20 in existence, is [...] in diameter and {{is believed to be}} over 4,000 years old. Archeologists believe that the ring was a refuse heap, created by Indians who lived in the interior of the ring, which was kept clear and used as a common area. Two other shell rings on Hilton Head were destroyed when the shells were removed and used to make tabby for roads and buildings. The Green's Shell Enclosure, Sea Pines, and Skull Creek shell rings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and are protected by law.|$|E
60|$|That same bill, by the way, is {{sometimes}} a source of danger. Once, on the coast, I saw a shelldrake tying in vain to fly against the wind, which flung rudely among some tall reeds near me. The next moment Don, my old dog, had him. In a hungry moment he had driven his bill through both shells of a scallop, which slipped or worked its way up to his nostrils, muzzling the bird perfectly with a hard <b>shell</b> <b>ring.</b> The poor fellow by desperate trying could open his mouth barely wide enough to drink or to swallow the tiniest morsel. He {{must have been in}} this condition a long time, for the bill was half worn through, and he was so light that the wind blew him about like a great feather when he attempted to fly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> at Horr's Island was an {{elongated}} horseshoe shape. It {{is one of}} the few sites where a <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> is definitely associated with ceremonial mounds. The <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> was 160 by 100 meters, and the central area, or plaza, was 125 meters at its widest. The middens making up the ring were up to three meters high. The <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> has been dated to between 4800 and 4200 Before Present.|$|E
50|$|Fig Island, {{also known}} as 38CH42, is an archaeological site on the Atlantic Coast of South Carolina, {{consisting}} of three <b>shell</b> <b>rings.</b> <b>Shell</b> <b>rings</b> are curved <b>shell</b> middens wholly or partially surrounding a clear central area or plaza. The site includes {{one of the largest}} and most complex <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> in North America, and one of the best preserved circular <b>shell</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The known <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> {{are various}} states of preservation. Rings have been {{impacted}} by rising sea levels, erosion, plowing, and coastal development. <b>Shell</b> <b>rings,</b> along with other shell mounds, have been mined for shell {{to be used in}} road paving and other construction projects. <b>Shell</b> <b>rings</b> in Peru have been particularly impacted by mining.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shell</b> <b>rings</b> are {{archaeological sites}} with curved shell middens {{completely}} or partially surrounding a clear space. The rings were sited next to estuaries that supported large populations of shellfish, usually oysters. <b>Shell</b> <b>rings</b> {{have been reported}} in several countries, including Colombia, Peru, Japan, and the southeastern United States. Archaeologists continue to debate the origins and use of <b>shell</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R

50|$|Across {{what is now}} {{the southeastern}} United States, {{starting}} around 4000 BCE, people exploited wetland resources, creating large shell middens. Middens developed along rivers, but there is limited evidence of Archaic peoples along coastlines prior to 3000 BCE. Archaic sites on the coast may have been inundated by rising sea levels (one site in 15 to 20 feet of water off St. Lucie County, Florida has been dated to 2800 BCE). Starting around 3000 BCE evidence of large-scale exploitation of oysters appears. During the period 3000 BCE to 1000 BCE <b>shell</b> <b>rings,</b> large <b>shell</b> middens more or less surrounding open centers, developed along the coast of the Southeastern United States. These <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> are numerous in South Carolina and Georgia, but are also found scattered around the Florida peninsula. Some sites also have sand or sand-and-shell mounds associated with <b>shell</b> <b>rings.</b> Sites such as Horr's Island, in southwest Florida, supported sizable mound-building communities year-round. Four shell and/or sand mounds on Horr's Island have been dated to between 4870 and 4270 Before Present (BP).|$|R
25|$|The {{preserve}} {{includes a}} number of registered historic sites, including two listed in the National Register of Historic Places: a set of three surviving 1840s outbuildings from Bleak Hall Plantation, and the prehistoric Fig Island <b>shell</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|About 60 shell rings {{had been}} {{identified}} in the southeastern United States by 2002. Most date from the Late Archaic period (c. 3000 BCE to 1000 BCE), but shell rings were also constructed during the Woodland (c. 1000 BCE to 1000 CE) and Mississippian (c. 800 - 1500) periods. Close to 100 circular and horseshoe-shaped shell mounds {{have been identified in}} the Kantō region of Japan (where a large majority of Japanese shell mounds are found). Shell rings in Japan have been dated from late in the Early Jōmon period until early in the Late Jōmon period (from before 3000 BCE until after 1000 BCE). While there are reports of a number of <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> sites in Colombia, only the Puerto Hormiga <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> (c. 3000 BCE to 2500 BCE) has been described in the archaeological literature. Archaeologists have continued to identify and investigate additional <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> sites into the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|The western section {{consists}} of seven smaller shell middens forming a rough <b>shell</b> <b>ring.</b> The eastern area {{consists of}} five much larger shell middens, also forming a rough <b>shell</b> <b>ring,</b> and enclosing {{the remains of}} the settlement. The 27 varieties of shells excavated indicate that the nearby Ogawawa inlet was salt water in the early Jōmon period, but had become brackish by the middle Jōmon period. In additions to shells, the middens also contained fragments of pottery, tools, and many fish bones, bones from swans, ducks, deer, boars and other animals, indicating the varied diet of the local inhabitants.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> of the Late Archaic {{period has}} been {{described}} at Puerto Hormiga. The Puerto Hormiga ring is composed primarily of clam shells, and {{is located in a}} marsh. It has an outside diameter of 280 ft, a height of about 4 ft, and the base of the ring mound is 52 ft to 75 ft wide. It has a clear interior plaza.Sherds of fiber-tempered and sand-tempered pottery, as well as stone tools, were found associated with the <b>shell</b> <b>ring.</b> The earliest have been dated to 3794 BC. The fiber-tempered pottery is [...] "crude", formed from a single lump of clay. Sand-tempered coiled ceramics have also been found at Puerto Hormiga.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{a boiler}} made from three <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> with a semi-circular cover which, {{in the area}} of the firebox, was tucked in it between the frame plates. The boiler was fed by two non-sucking injectors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shell</b> <b>rings</b> in the United States may form a {{complete}} ring, or be open, C-shaped, or U- or horseshoe-shaped. They may form a nearly perfect circle, or an oval. In almost all cases, the central area or [...] "plaza" [...] contains {{little or no}} shell or occupational debris. Most <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> in the United States consist primarily of oyster shells, but may include periwinkles, razor clams, whelks, ribbed mussels, hard-shelled clams (quahogs), and blue and stone crab claws and shell bits. The Common orient clam {{is the most common}} component in shell mounds in Japan. Other shells found in Japanese mounds include those of sea snails, surf clams (Mactra veneriformes), and Japanese littleneck clams (Tapes japonica).|$|R
50|$|The {{evidence}} of the <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> for residential vs. ceremonial origins in the United States is mixed. Some <b>shell</b> <b>rings,</b> such as Sapelo 3, Lighthouse Point, and Stratton Place, had houses {{on the crest of}} the rings. Other rings, such as Horr's Island, Sewee, Sapelo 1, and Fig Island 1 had rings that were too steep for building on the crest. The top part of Fig Island 1 was built up with shells mined from other middens. Villages have been found near the rings at Horr's Island, Rollins, Guana, and Sapelo 1. No living site has been found at or near the Sewee, Joseph Reed, and Hill Cottage rings. The Horr's Island, Joseph Reed, and Fig Island sites supported large, settled populations.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{an inside}} frame {{which was built}} as a water tank. The boiler comprised two shell rings. The steam dome with its safety valve sat on the forward <b>shell</b> <b>ring.</b> The smokebox was very short. The smokestack has a Kobel spark arrestor. Later a Prüsmann chimney was used.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "c"-shaped <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> {{of about}} 275 m in width {{and up to}} 4 m high {{is located in the}} open end of the shell works on Dismal Key. A central plaza about 50 m across {{surrounds}} a deep pond. The opening in the ring faces northeast, away {{from the rest of the}} shell works. The ring is constructed of layers of clean, unbroken oyster shells mixed with layers of crushed oyster and other shells, with some fish bones. The ring appears to have been rapidly constructed in several episodes. The layers of crushed shell, which include possible post holes, may have been living floors. Artifacts found in the ring include ceramics, shell and bone tools, shark teeth, and sting ray spines. A chert flake was found (the nearest source of chert is 250 km away). Fragments of human bone and a human tooth were found, but excavation was halted in the area to avoid further disturbing a potential grave site. Six shell samples from the ring yielded calibrated radiocarbon dates between 450 BCE and 50 BCE, very early in the Glades culture period. While the <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> appears to have been a habitation site, 4 m of shell were deposited in 150 years, and the ring is not just a midden. There is no evidence of human use of the <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> after 50 BCE.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> {{sites have}} {{multiple}} rings. Some more-or-less equal-sized rings may be joined {{together in a}} [...] "figure-8", as with the Skull Creek 1 and 2 and Coosaw 1 and 2 rings in South Carolina, or be touching, as with the two circular mounds in the Kasori shellmound in Japan. Smaller rings may be attached to a main ring, as at Fig Island 1 in South Carolina and the Rollins <b>shell</b> <b>ring</b> in Florida. Shell rings in southwest Florida are often associated with large mounds and other shell works. Shell rings in Georgia average 53 m in diameter, and those in South Carolina 64 m in diameter. The U-shaped shell rings in Florida described as of 2006 averaged 178 m in length. Middle and Late Jomon shell middens in Japan are often circular or horseshoe-shaped, typically about 150 m in diameter and may be up to 200 m in diameter.|$|E
40|$|Seventeen morphometric {{characters}} of Sepia aculeata of Mumbai coast {{have been studied}} and the relationships of morphometric characters with dorsal mantle length (DML) were established. The characters compared showed a fair to high degree of correlation ('r' 0. 63 - 0. 99). Number of arm suckers and <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> were related with DML. The <b>shell</b> <b>rings</b> also showed high degree of correlation with DML ('r' 0. 79 - 0. 95). However, the relationship between arm suckers and DML was not so good ('r' 0. 1 - 0. 4). The length-weight relationship is described as W= 0. 1821336 L sub(2. 801102). Food and feeding analysis confirm the carnivorous feeding behaviour of the species. Mature females found in all months indicate that it has prolonged spawning season with two peaks, september and march-april. Absolute fecundity ranged from 214 to 4143 eggs...|$|R

50|$|By this time, serious gunnery {{malfunctions}} {{had caused}} intermittent {{problems with the}} main armament, leading to a 26% reduction in output. According to Captain Leach, he decided that continuing the action would risk losing Prince of Wales without inflicting further damage on the enemy. He therefore ordered the ship to make smoke and withdraw, 'pending a more favourable opportunity'. Prince of Wales turned away just after 06:04, firing from her rear turret under local control until the turret suffered a jammed <b>shell</b> <b>ring,</b> cutting off the ammunition supply and making the guns inoperable. Despite efforts by crew members and civilian technicians to repair the <b>shell</b> <b>ring,</b> all four guns were not back in service until 08:25, although {{two of the four}} guns were serviceable by 07:20. This temporarily left only five 14 in guns operational, but nine of the ten were operational in five hours. The final salvos fired were ragged and are believed to have fallen short. The ship retired from the battle around 06:10. Thirteen of her crew had been killed, nine were wounded. The timing of Prince of Wales withdrawal was fortunate for her, as she had come into torpedo range of Prinz Eugen and turned away as the German cruiser was about to fire.|$|E
