Yet, trends from <b>sentinel</b> <b>surveillance</b> of pregnant women in high-risk areas might indicate that such spread may not have occurred. Another study showed, however, that 43% of the tested infected people were from low-risk groups.

Here we described the impact of a <b>sentinel</b> site malaria <b>surveillance</b> system on promoting laboratory testing and rational antimalarial drug use. <b>Sentinel</b> site malaria <b>surveillance</b> was established at six health facilities in Uganda between September 2006 and January 2007. Data were collected from all patients presenting to the outpatient departments including demographics, laboratory results, diagnoses, and treatments prescribed. Between the start of surveillance and March 2010, a total 424, 701 patients were seen of which 229, 375 (54 %) were suspected of having malaria. Comparing the first three months with the last three months of surveillance, the proportion of patients with suspected malaria who underwent diagnostic testing increased from 39 % to 97 % (p< 0. 001). The proportion of patients with an appropriate decision to prescribe antimalarial therapy (positive test result prescribed, negative test result not prescribed) increased from 64 % to 95 % (p< 0. 001). The proportion of patients appropriately prescribed antimalarial therapy who were prescribed the recommended first-line regimen artemether-lumefantrine increased from 48 % to 69 % (p< 0. 001). The establishment of a <b>sentinel</b> site malaria <b>surveillance</b> system in Uganda achieved almost universal utilization of diagnostic testing in patients with suspected malaria and appropriate decisions to prescribed antimalarial based on test results.

40|$|Background: Yunnan {{is one of}} {{the provinces}} hardest-hit by HIV in China. To {{understand}} HIV epidemic dynamics and evaluate prevention effectiveness, we studied the changing trends in HIV- 1 prevalence and incidence among five sub-populations in Yunnan. Methods: Consecutive <b>sentinel</b> <b>surveillances</b> were conducted among people who inject drugs (PWID), male sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic attendees, and pregnant women for 2001 – 2010,female sex workers (FSWs) for 2007 – 2010, {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) for 2008 – 2010. For the newly diagnosed HIV-seropositive samples, the recent infections were determined with BED-capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA), based on which HIV incidence was calculated for each sub-population using McDougal algorithm. Results: From 231, 117 individuals, 6, 107 HIV-positive samples were tested with BED-CEIA, among which 964 samples were identified as recent infections. In PWID, HIV prevalence for 2001 – 2010 was between 27. 16 % and 18. 35 %, while the estimated incidence rate significantly decreased from 11. 68 % in 2001 to 1. 70 % in 2010.

In July 1989 a <b>sentinel</b> <b>surveillance</b> system for infectious diseases was established in Taiwan by Disease, Surveillance and Quarantine Service, Ministry of Health of Taiwan. The <b>sentinel</b> <b>surveillance</b> system is physician based and has approximately 850 Taiwanese physicians participating from various regions all over Taiwan.
