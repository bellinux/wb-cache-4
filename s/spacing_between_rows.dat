5000|$|There are {{a number}} of Agronomic issues, both biotic and abiotic, that have {{considerably}} reduced the production of chickpeas in the Terai of Nepal. Botrytis gray mold (BGM) was the main cause of the rapid decline in production of chickpeas, as it completely devastated crops in 1997-1998, especially in the humid eastern part of the country causing farmers to switch to a more stable, albeit less profitable legume, such as lentil. This devastation have given chickpeas a very negative reputation of being a risky crop and has likely delayed the spread of new technologies and cultivars to increase production. [...] Fusarium wilt is another major biotic problem to chickpea production in Nepal. Abiotic issues include boron deficient soils, as well as infertile land due to soil acidity and drought. [...] However, these issues can be dealt with by a number of low cost techniques without having to rely heavily on expensive alternatives such as fungicides. Larger <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> can decrease leaf wetness to decrease BGM. Intercropping with mustard also seems to significantly reduce the disease. Coating the seed with Rhizobium or mixing the rhizobium into the soil can combat poor nodulation and therefore improve the nitrogen fixing capacity of the chickpea. [...] Poor soil fertility can be combated with vermicompost along with fertilizers in order to increase root length, grain yield and further nodulation. Ideally, using an Integrated Crop Management strategy using genetically resistant seeds incorporated into local varieties, the use of fungicides, along with the simpler strategies mentioned could allow for sustainable and profitable production of chickpeas for Nepalese farmers.|$|E

Analysis of variance was carried out and means were compared by Tukey's test at 5 % of probability. A reduction in row spacing provided better spatial distribution of plants, but did not alter morphological composition or dry matter production. The corn with most equidistant spatial distribution (lowest row spacing) showed an increase in lignin concentration, neutral detergent fiber, and total carbohydrates, and showed a decrease in total digestible nutrients when compared with 80 cm row spacing. However, the organic digestibility matter was not affected by the treatments.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades the use of {{externally}} bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials for structural strengthening applications has become an accepted and widely used method. A primary concern of FRP structural strengthening systems is that the FRP often debonds from the concrete well before the load capacity of the FRP material is reached. In addition, debonding failures are often brittle and occur with little warning. Past research concluded that fastening FRP sheets with FRP anchors is an effective method for delaying or preventing debonding failures. However, there is a clear lack of research pertaining to fastening FRP sheets with FRP anchors, and a corresponding lack of design guidance. The primary objective of this research program was to better understand the behavior of bonded FRP sheets that are secured with FRP anchors to aid in future development of design recommendations of this anchorage system.

This study investigates the near wake flow as it develops through arrays of staggered pin fins. The height-to-diame-ter ratio was unity while the transverse spacing was kept constant at two cylinder diameters. The streamwise spacing was varied between 3. 46 and 1. 73 cylinder diameters. For each geometric arrangement, experiments were conducted at Reynolds numbers of 3. 0 e 3 and 2. 0 e 4 based on cylinder diameter and velocity through the minimum flow area of the array. Time-resolved flowfield measurements provided insight into the dependence of row position, Reynolds number, and streamwise spacing. Decreasing streamwise spacing resulted in increased Strouhal number as the near wake length scales were confined. In the first row of the bundle, low Reynolds number flows were mainly shear-layer-driven while high Reynolds number flows were dominated by periodic vortex shedding. The level of velocity fluctuations increased for cases having stronger vortex shedding.
