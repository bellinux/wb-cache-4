Press-Hardened Steel (PHS) components for passenger cars are generally coated by aluminized or galvanized (GI) coatings. The aluminized coating presents a good formability at high temperature and permits forming and quenching components in the same press tools with a so called direct hot stamping method. Due to a strong cracking in the base material during direct hot stamping induced by liquid-metal embrittlement (LME), galvanized coated products must be pre-formed at low temperature and undergo heat treatment in separate press units. Moreover, the oxide scale formed on GI parts must be removed by abrasive blasting, whereas aluminized parts can be directly painted after hot forming. However, higher performance in corrosion resistance has been observed for galvanized parts, in particular in cosmetic and cut-edge corrosion. This increase {{is linked to the}} sacrificial effect or cathodic protection provided by the layer containing zinc. Daimler AG is investigating the possibility of improving performance of PHS body parts in terms of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> direct hot <b>stamping</b> and corrosion protection by developing new coating materials. In the following article, the main particularities and challenges involved in both current coating products will be introduced. The development of specific press tools for this study, as well as the corresponding simulation of hot forming will be presented. Finally, the hot forming behaviour and anticorrosive properties of both current products will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to reveal the shifts in climate <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine {{production}} affecting Romanian wine growing regions. For this, we analyzed the spatial distribution over Romanian territory of the oenoclimate aptitude index (IAOe) for the 1961 to 1990 and 1991 to 2013 time periods. The IAOe has been calculated based on gridded data at 10 × 10 [*]km resolution of average daily temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration between 1961 – 2013, originating from about 150 weather stations across Romanian territory and recorded in the ROCADA database. The study reveals: northward shifts and to higher altitudes of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine production; the appearance of new areas suitable for wine production; the expansion or the shrinkage of the current areas suitable for wine production; shifts in classes of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine production in the current wine regions and appearance of premises of replacing their specific varieties and traditional wine type production; the tendency to level climate suitability at regional scale by diminishing <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> white wines and replacing it with climate <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> red wines. The study provides a solid support for developing strategies to adapt Romanian viticulture to climate change...|$|R
