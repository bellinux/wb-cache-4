5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
500|$|Tali's unmasked {{face and}} its {{potential}} appearance {{have been subject to}} discussion by both critics and fans. Casey Hudson, in an interview, acknowledged depictions of Tali's face as the most common fan art. Jordan Boughman, writing for GamesRadar, highlighted a piece of fan art that he enjoyed and which a BioWare developer had retweeted. Before the face was revealed, IGN's Scott Nichols ran an article about the possibility of revealing the face, concluding that fans did not just want to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> but also [...] "the expressions it can make, adding yet another level of emotional depth and complexity to a fan favorite character". GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz listed it as one of the 12 gaming mysteries he wanted solved in 2011, and hoped that it would be something unusual-looking; this sentiment was echoed by fellow GamesRadar writer Tyler Nagata, who felt that the face should be ugly. PC Gamer's Tom Francis also included the face in their list of 15 things he wanted to see in Mass Effect 3.|$|E
60|$|Had he <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> then, {{it might}} have warned him to take care; but he heard her words only, {{and they were not}} at all in keeping with <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought she}} stared at me too," [...] Edgar said. [...] "I am sure I do not know her. I don't think I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{one could}} have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> I think {{she might have been}} nice-looking," [...] said Margaret. [...] "She had pretty golden curls, and merry blue eyes, rather like Harry's." ...|$|R
500|$|His wife Maria, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} from poor health for many years, became very ill {{in the spring of}} 1853 and died on October 27 of tuberculosis. Just before her burial, her coffin was opened so that her daughter Mabel could <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> while Lowell [...] "leaned for a long while against a tree weeping", according to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his wife, who were in attendance. In 1855, Lowell oversaw the publication of a memorial volume of his wife's poetry, with only fifty copies for private circulation. Despite his self-described [...] "naturally joyous" [...] nature, life for Lowell at Elmwood was further complicated by his father becoming deaf in his old age, and the deteriorating mental state of his sister Rebecca, who sometimes went a week without speaking. He again cut himself off from others, becoming reclusive at Elmwood, and his private diaries from this time period are riddled with the initials of his wife. On March 10, 1854, for example, he wrote: [...] "Dark without & within. M.L. M.L. M.L." [...] Longfellow, a friend and neighbor, referred to Lowell as [...] "lonely and desolate".|$|E
500|$|The rumour {{was that}} Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having {{been born with}} a pig's head. Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name {{may have contributed to}} the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named [...] "Grisly" [...] on account of her {{appearance}} when born. It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mother had said [...] "take away your litter of pigs!" [...] to a woman beggar asking for money to feed her children, and Griselda had then been born with the head and face of a pig. Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital. The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her. She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.|$|E
2500|$|Sheikh Tantawi {{clarified}} {{that a woman}} {{wears the}} niqāb so that no man may <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> – {{and that it was}} completely illogical for her to wear it where only women were present. He stressed that for this decision, he had relied on a majority clerical opinion that a woman's face is not shameful. [...] The council asserted that it was not against the practice, but did not consider the niqāb an Islamic obligation.|$|E
60|$|She went to {{her room}} and did {{something}} with the black doll. She did not cry, but if you could have <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> you would have wished she would cry.|$|R
60|$|Miss Haldane bent {{her head}} again over her work. Suddenly as it was done, <b>her</b> aunt had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> face--and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> betrayed <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|That faint {{cleaving}} doubt {{which he}} {{had never been able to}} shake off in Rebecca Murdoch's presence was fatally set at rest forever. He had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> then, before--seven years before, on his birthday, in the bedroom of the lonely inn.|$|R
2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{comments}} by Jack Straw, MP started {{a national debate}} over the wearing of the [...] "veil" [...] (niqab), in October 2006. Around that time there was {{media coverage of the}} case of Aishah Azmi, a teaching assistant in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, who lost her appeal against suspension from her job for wearing the niqab while teaching English to young children. It was decided that being unable to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> prevented the children from learning effectively. Azmi, who had been interviewed and hired for the position without the niqab, allegedly on her husband's advice, argued it was helping the children understand different people's beliefs. In 2010, a man committed a bank robbery wearing a niqab as a disguise.|$|E
2500|$|The album characterizes {{a person}} who becomes trapped in a {{lighthouse}} after leaving the earth. He tries to fight against his destiny, which Atropos and her other two sisters decided for him but he finds out he can't overcome his destiny so he starts writing his [...] "Will to Live". And in the end when he's dying, he's saying his last words in [...] "An Audience" [...] that he feels Atropos is {{standing next to him}} and she's ready to cut his thread of life and finish him. But we find out that this person was in love with Atropos and he was waiting for his time to come, which Atropos comes along then he can <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and say goodbye to this world. That's when he starts describing beauty of Atropos to his only audience that was watching him dying, which is a [...] "Snail" [...] and asking that snail to describe Atropos' beauty to anyone he see.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{leave her}} at once--never <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> again. Go from her now, while love is fresh {{and your heart}} is free from wicked intent. Go quick--go far, and never <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then at last {{there came}} a voice, [...] "Oh, Will, why have you done this? Why have you treated me so badly?" [...] When he had last <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> mouth had been full of scorn, {{but there was no}} scorn now in her voice. [...] "Why--why--why?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Later, {{after he}} had left Mrs. Bland with a meaning [...] "Adios--manana," [...] and was walking along beside the old outlaw, he found himself {{thinking}} of the girl instead of the woman, and of how he had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> blaze with hope and gratitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was as if}} a child running beside its mother, {{looked up}} and saw that he had never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> before, that she was not his mother, and that the words he had seemed to {{understand}} were--now that he listened--words in an unknown tongue.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped her}} head again, {{and once more}} began {{to play with the}} bronze lobster, holding her arm in such a fashion that Eustace could not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> But if he could not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> she could see his in the glass, and {{narrowly}} observed its every change, which, on the whole, though natural, was rather mean of her.|$|E
60|$|She {{had turned}} her {{shoulder}} {{to him so}} {{that he should not}} <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|There {{was light}} on the drive. He could <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Her eyes were troubled.|$|E
6000|$|He turned sharply at {{the sound}} of <b>her</b> voice. <b>Seeing</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> pale and {{distorted}} in the twilight, he was filled with dismay. She mutely lifted her arms to him, watching him in despair. Swiftly he took her in his arms, and asked in a troubled voice: ...|$|R
60|$|She started erect, and {{he could}} <b>see</b> <b>her</b> pale <b>face</b> glow with joy.|$|R
60|$|You {{should have}} <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> then! Gratitude? Lord, {{what do you}} want with words to express that? Words are only painted fire; a look is the fire itself. She gave that look, and carried it away to the {{treasury}} of heaven, where all things that are divine belong.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{could no}} longer <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> clearly. He {{did not know what}} he was saying.|$|E
60|$|SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! there's no {{judging by}} her looks, unless {{one was to}} <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>Face.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{were with}} our {{backs to the}} light, so that I could not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hannah {{had never}} <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>face</b> so dour {{as it looked}} that night.|$|R
6000|$|... "All the choir?" [...] {{said the}} {{astonished}} vicar (who may be shortly {{described as a}} good-looking young man with courageous eyes, timid mouth, and neutral nose), abandoning his writing and looking at his parlour-maid after speaking, {{like a man who}} fancied he had <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> before but couldn't recollect where.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was quite}} a girl, and for an Arab very good looking. She and the Emir's wife were {{continually}} sending me out choice bits from their dinner, but I had not before <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She was evidently a good deal confused, at thus unveiling before a man, but Abu said: ...|$|R
60|$|Peter {{had crossed}} over and was {{standing}} {{where he could}} <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> illumined by the lamplight.|$|E
60|$|Miss Havisham sat {{listening}} (or {{it seemed}} so, for I could not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face),</b> but still made no answer.|$|E
60|$|She let him <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> For {{a moment}} only, {{she looked at}} him--and then let silence tell him the rest.|$|E
6000|$|She came in, a tall dark figure, {{and stood}} facing me in silence until {{the door had}} closed behind <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was white and drawn and very grave. She stooped a little, I could see she had had no sleep, never before had I <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> marked by pain. And she hesitated.... "My dear!" [...] I said; [...] "why have you come to me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Beka is {{slender and}} tall at five feet and eight inches. She has dark-blond hair and light blue-gray eyes that unsettle people when she's mad. Someone once {{told her that}} it's like being touched by ice when she glares at people, though Beka herself can neither prove nor {{disprove}} this, seeing as she's never <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> while angry ...|$|R
60|$|That was a moment! Having <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> then I {{would not}} have missed sight of it for {{anything}} I could name; never so long as memory remained with me would I forget. She did not speak. Sally, however, bowed {{and spoke to the}} Ranger. Steele, after the first start, showed no unusual feeling. He greeted both girls pleasantly.|$|R
