40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of hair loss prevention by <b>scalp</b> cooling to prevent chemotherapy induced hair loss {{has been shown}} to be related to <b>scalp</b> skin temperature. <b>Scalp</b> skin temperature, however, is dependent not only on local cooling but also on the thermal status of the body. Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of body temperature on <b>scalp</b> skin temperature. Methods: We conducted experiments in which 13 healthy subjects consumed ice slurry to lower body temperature for 15 minutes after the start of <b>scalp</b> cooling and then performed two 12 -minute cycle exercise sessions to increase body core temperature. Esophageal temperature (T es), rectal temperature (T re), mean skin temperature (eight locations, T skin), and mean <b>scalp</b> temperature (five locations, T <b>scalp)</b> were recorded. Results: During the initial 10 minutes of <b>scalp</b> cooling, T <b>scalp</b> decreased by > 15 °C, whereas T es decreased by 0. 2 °C. After ice slurry ingestion, T es, T re, and T skin were 35. 8, 36. 5, and 31. 3 °C, respectively, and increased after exercise to 36. 3, 37. 3, and 33. 0 °C, respectively. T <b>scalp</b> was significantly correlated to T es (r = 0. 39, P es corresponded to an increase of 1. 6 °C in T <b>scalp.</b> Conclusions: Slight cooling of patients with an elevated body temperature during <b>scalp</b> cooling contributes to the decrease in <b>scalp</b> temperature and may improve the prevention of hair loss. This may be useful if the desired decrease of <b>scalp</b> temperature cannot be obtained by <b>scalp</b> cooling systems...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people feel}} {{frequent}} prickling or itching sensations on their <b>scalp.</b> The <b>scalp</b> is an atypical {{area of the}} skin since it is normally covered with thick hair and has many sebaceous glands and sweat glands. The <b>scalp</b> often has skin problems that can affect its sensitivity and functions. However, not much is known about stratum corneum function and the neural sensitivity of the <b>scalp.</b> Here we evaluated stratum corneum function and the neural sensitivity of the <b>scalp</b> of 47 normal male individuals in various skin conditions and compared the results to that to the forehead. The neural sensitivity was evaluated by measuring the electrical current perception threshold (CPT). The cutaneous barrier function and stratum corneum moisture-retention ability (MRA) of the <b>scalp</b> were significantly lower than on the forehead, {{even if there were}} some <b>scalp</b> problems. Depending on the increase in severity of <b>scalp</b> skin problems, both these skin functional properties and the CPT decreased significantly. However, regardless of its lower functional properties, <b>scalp</b> skin was not significantly lower than that of the forehead. Although the <b>scalp</b> has a low stratum corneum function compared with the forehead and has easily induced skin problems, the <b>scalp</b> skin has less sensitive sensory nerves, resulting in experiencing a worsening of <b>scalp</b> symptoms more easily...|$|R

40|$|With modern <b>scalp</b> cooling {{equipment}} cytotoxic damage of hair root cells {{can be prevented}} in half of the patients with cancer {{at high risk of}} alopecia. However, traditionally doubt has existed whether <b>scalp</b> cooling might facilitate hiding and disseminating <b>scalp</b> skin metastases and thus decrease survival. We discuss this risk using frequency data on metastases in breast cancer from observational and autopsy studies and the Munich cancer registry. They showed the incidence of <b>scalp</b> skin metastases to be very low and not differ between scalp-cooled (0. 04 – 1 %) and non scalp-cooled (0. 03 – 3 %) patients with breast cancer and in need of chemotherapy. We found it rather unlikely that the incidence of <b>scalp</b> skin metastases might increase at all after <b>scalp</b> cooling, whereas a very small proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy are at risk to develop metastases at this site. <b>Scalp</b> cooling can thus safely be offered to patients treated with alopecia-inducing chemotherapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{success of}} <b>scalp</b> cooling in {{preventing}} or reducing chemotherapy induced alopecia (CIA) is highly variable between patients undergoing similar chemotherapy regimens. A decrease of the <b>scalp</b> skin temperature {{seems to be}} an important factor, but data on the optimum temperature reached by <b>scalp</b> cooling to prevent CIA are lacking. This study investigated the relation between <b>scalp</b> skin temperature and its efficacy to prevent CIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this explorative study, <b>scalp</b> skin temperature was measured during <b>scalp</b> cooling in 62 breast cancer patients undergoing up to six cycles of anthracycline containing chemotherapy. <b>Scalp</b> skin temperature was measured by using two thermocouples at both temporal sides of the head. The primary end-point was the need for a wig or other head covering. RESULTS: Maximal cooling was reached after 45 min and was continued for 90 min after chemotherapy infusion. The <b>scalp</b> skin temperature after 45 min cooling varied from 10 degrees C to 31 degrees C, resulting in a mean <b>scalp</b> skin temperature of 19 degrees C (SEM: 0, 4). Intrapersonal <b>scalp</b> skin temperatures during cooling were consistent for each chemotherapy cycle (ANOVA: P = 0, 855). Thirteen out of 62 patients (21 %) did not require a wig or other head covering. They appeared to have a significantly lower mean <b>scalp</b> skin temperature (18 degrees C; SEM: 0, 7) compared to patients with alopecia (20 degrees C; SEM: 0, 5) (P = 0, 01). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of <b>scalp</b> cooling during chemotherapy is temperature dependent. A precise cut-off point could not be detected, but the best results seem to be obtained when the <b>scalp</b> temperature decreases below 18 degrees C. TRIALREGISTER. NL NTR NUMBER: 3082...|$|R
