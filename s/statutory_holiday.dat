5|$|The Sex Party was a {{political}} party based in British Columbia, Canada. The party was guided by {{the philosophy of the}} sex-positive movement. Among other points, the party advocated for reform of sex education in schools so that sexual issues are taught more gradually over time and included a more comprehensive coverage of them. They advocated for the repeal of laws that promote antisexualism, such as prostitution laws and censorship. They also supported making Valentine's Day a <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday</b> and renaming Victoria Day to Eros Day.|$|E

Most <b>statutory</b> <b>holidays</b> {{can be substituted}} for a mutually agreeable alternative paid day off in lieu or employers can require employees {{to work at a}} premium rate of pay. Several types of employment, including workplaces covered by a collective agreement, are exempt from provincial rules governing <b>statutory</b> <b>holidays.</b>|$|R
25|$|In September 2009, President John Atta Mills {{declared}} 21 September (the 100th {{anniversary of}} Kwame Nkrumah's birth) to be Founder's Day, a <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday</b> in Ghana {{to celebrate the}} legacy of Kwame Nkrumah.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1974, 300 members in Department of Health & Social Development {{demonstrated}} against an arbitrary change in <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday</b> entitlements. The government backed down. That same season, employees of the Alberta Liquor Control Board went on strike for 10 days, winning substantial wage increases.|$|E
25|$|Most {{workplaces}} in Canada {{are regulated}} by the provincial or territorial government. Therefore, although Victoria Day is a <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday</b> for federal purposes, whether an employee is entitled to a paid day off generally depends on the province or territory of residence (with the exception of employees in federally regulated workplaces such as banks).|$|E
30|$|We {{would like}} to point out that, the {{extraction}} of ACL data requires huge amounts of historical residential loads. Due to lack of historical load data, the data of ACL on <b>statutory</b> <b>holidays</b> (e.g., the Spring Festivals, the National Day, etc.) cannot yet be accurately mined out. Thus, the proposed methodology does not work well for the scenarios on <b>statutory</b> <b>holidays.</b> It is desirable to improve the methodology to identify the NCBC-parameters on <b>statutory</b> <b>holidays</b> in the future.|$|R
5000|$|Five {{nationwide}} and four territorial <b>statutory</b> <b>holidays.</b> In addition, Easter Monday, Boxing Day, and Heritage Day are statutory {{for public service}} workers.

25|$|Under {{the federal}} Holidays Act, Canada Day is {{observed}} on July 1, unless that date falls on a Sunday, {{in which case}} July 2 is the <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday.</b> Celebratory events will generally still take place on July 1, {{even though it is}} not the legal holiday. If it falls on a Saturday, any businesses normally closed that day will usually dedicate the following Monday (July 3) as a day off.|$|E
25|$|For example, if 1 January or 25 December is a Saturday or Sunday, {{then the}} {{following}} Monday is the <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday</b> for New Year's Day or Christmas Day. If 2 January or 26 December is a Saturday, then the Day after New Year's Day or Boxing Day is celebrated {{on the next}} Monday. If either of these days occurs on a Sunday, then the holiday occurs on the following Tuesday, as the Monday will {{have been used for}} New Year or Christmas.|$|E

Selected episodes from the podcast programs may also sometimes air terrestrially on CBC Radio One as substitute programs, such as when a regularly scheduled program is preempted due to a <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday.</b>|$|E

25|$|The holiday {{has been}} {{observed}} in Canada since at least 1845, originally falling on Victoria's actual birthday (24 May 1819). It continues to be celebrated in various fashions across the country; the holiday {{has always been a}} distinctly Canadian observance. Victoria Day is a federal <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday,</b> as well as a holiday in six of Canada's ten provinces and all three of its territories. In Quebec, before 2003, the Monday preceding 25 May of each year was unofficially the Fête de Dollard, a commemoration of Adam Dollard des Ormeaux initiated in the 1920s to coincide with Victoria Day. In 2003, provincial legislation officially created National Patriots' Day on the same date.|$|E
500|$|Indian reserves, {{established}} in Canadian law by treaties such as Treaty 7, are lands of First Nations recognized by non-indigenous governments. Some reserves are within cities, {{such as the}} Opawikoscikan Reserve in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Wendake in Quebec City or Stony Plain 135 in the Edmonton Capital Region. There are more reserves in Canada than there are First Nations, which were ceded multiple reserves by treaty. Aboriginal people currently work {{in a variety of}} occupations and may live outside their ancestral homes. The traditional cultures of their ancestors, shaped by nature, still exert a strong influence on them, from spirituality to political attitudes. [...] National Aboriginal Day is a day of recognition of the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada. [...] The day was first celebrated in 1996, after it was proclaimed that year, by then Governor General of Canada Roméo LeBlanc, to be celebrated on June 21 annually. Most provincial jurisdictions do not recognize it as a <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Sex Party was {{guided by}} the {{philosophy}} of sex-positivism. While the party did not maintain a full slate of policy positions, both its federal and provincial election platforms have three goals: reform of how sex education is taught, [...] "repeal sex-negative laws and regulations, and support sex-positive community". Regarding education the party advocated for a restructuring of sex education in public schools {{so that it is}} taught gradually, rather than all in one class, and would include other aspects of human sexuality, like non-coital contact, emotional intimacy, and LGBT issues. The Sex Party wanted provincial funding directed at research into sexuality policy issues and an expansion University of British Columbia's Critical Studies in Sexuality program into an entire department. Regarding sex-negative laws, The Sex Party wanted to work towards undoing legislation and regulations that support antisexualism. This included legalizing prostitution, starting a Sex Worker Empowerment Program to counsel and educate sex workers, reserving areas on public parks and beaches for nudists, allowing for sexually explicit private gatherings, (uncensored) films, and entertainment, and repealing provisions that allow municipalities to prohibit the sale of sex toys. Regarding sex-positive community issues, The Sex Party wanted to enable residents of long term care facilities to express their sexuality in a safe, respectful and dignified manner, create a Sex Positive Press Council to expose and remove censorship, make Valentines Day a <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday,</b> and rename Victoria Day to Eros Day.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{has ruled}} {{that there is a}} duty to {{accommodate}} religious observance under human rights legislation. [...] The 1990 case Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta concerned an employee who was required by his religion to take Easter Monday as a holy day. As this is not a <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday,</b> his employer required that he work that day or lose his job.
