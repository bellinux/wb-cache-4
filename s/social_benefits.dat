5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting <b>social</b> <b>benefits.</b> For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
40|$|China and Vietnam {{have both}} {{experienced}} significant political, economic, and social changes {{during the past}} quarter century. Alongside such transitions has been the restructuring of their respective <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> systems. Using recent national household survey data, this paper compares the sizes, structures, and progressivity of the <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> systems in China and Vietnam and examines their impacts on income inequality. It also contrasts the urban and rural systems within and between the two countries. We find {{that the size of}} China’s <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> system, as measured by the share of <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> income in total household income, was much larger than that of Vietnam, but the Vietnamese system was much more progressive than the Chinese system. Pensions and social welfare transfers were more prominent in Vietnam, while education benefits were more generous in China. The urban-rural gap in <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> provision was much wider in China than in Vietnam: Chinese urban residents enjoyed significantly more benefits than their rural peers, while Vietnamese urban residents only had modest advantage over their rural peers. Based on these comparative analyses, implications for social policy developments in both countries are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to create a brief scale to measure perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> that would be appropriate for use in future research aiming to explore the role of this variable in determining word-of-mouth (WOM) behaviour. There is evidence that perceived social risk negatively impacts the willingness to share, but the role of perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> has not yet been explored. Understanding how perceived <b>social</b> risk and <b>benefit</b> interact to determine WOM will inform social marketing campaign design. Design/methodology/approach - This paper outlines two studies: Study 1 was concerned with the development of the perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> of sharing scale (PSBSS), including the construction of preliminary items and the reliability and discriminant validity of the final scale. Study 2 involved an investigation of the concurrent validity of the PSBSS in relation to the likelihood to share. Findings - Study 1 demonstrated that the perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> associated with WOM was related to social approval, impression management and social bonding. The results of Study 2 established that scores on the PSBSS predicted self-reported likelihood to engage in both face-to-face WOM and electronic WOM. Originality/value - The PSBSS can be used to examine the role of perceived <b>social</b> <b>benefit,</b> including how the interaction between perceived <b>social</b> risk and <b>benefit</b> determines where, when and with whom people will share WOM...|$|R

5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E
5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and <b>social</b> <b>benefits.</b> The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E
5|$|A devout Buddhist from youth, {{once her}} {{children}} {{had grown up}} Ho decided to serve the Buddhist cause, and to dedicate {{the rest of her}} life to caring for others. In 1958, she became a Buddhist nun at the age of 50. In 1969, aged 61, Ho bought a two-storey detached house in Richards Avenue with her savings, and turned it into the Man Fut Tong Old Peoples' Home for aged sick and single elderly women. Most of the 20 or so residents had neither enough earnings to support themselves nor any relatives to turn to. To raise additional funds for the home, she cultivated and sold prize-winning white orchids at Tanglin, and vegetarian food at Kong Meng San Temple in Bishan. She cleaned, cooked, took her charges to the doctors, helped them to collect their <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and even sometimes saw to their last rites.|$|E

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November the Troika (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank) and the Cypriot Government {{had agreed}} on the bailout terms with only {{the amount of money}} {{required}} for the bailout remaining to be agreed upon. Bailout terms include strong austerity measures, including cuts in civil service salaries, <b>social</b> <b>benefits,</b> allowances and pensions and increases in VAT, tobacco, alcohol and fuel taxes, taxes on lottery winnings, property, and higher public health care charges. At the insistence of the EU negotiators, at first the proposal also included an unprecedented one-off levy of 6.7% for deposits up to €100.000 and 9.9% for higher deposits on all domestic bank accounts. Following public outcry, the eurozone finance ministers were forced to change the levy, excluding deposits of less than €100,000, and introducing a higher 15.6% levy on deposits of above €100,000 ($129,600)—in line with the EU minimum deposit guarantee. This revised deal was also rejected by the Cypriot parliament on 19 March 2013 with 36 votes against, 19 abstentions and one not present for the vote.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese colonial-era, a {{sizeable}} minority of mixed-race Japanese-Palauans emerged. Japanese-Palauans were offsprings of intermarriages between Japanese men and Palauan women. Most of them lived in urban areas, and {{were brought up}} in accordance to Japanese norms and values and spoke Japanese in their daily lives. A few sought further education in Japan, {{and at the same}} time had limited knowledge of Palauan customs and language, although children that were born out of wedlock reportedly had a greater exposure to their matrilineal customs and spoke both Japanese and Palauan fluently. Although Japanese-Palauan children were generally classified as Japanese in official figures and had access to Japanese social privileges, many reportedly faced discrimination when placed in Japanese and Palauan circles. In rural areas where Palauans formed higher concentrations, spouses and mistresses of Japanese men were shunned upon, and Palauan nationalists (especially Modekngei) actively discouraged mixed unions between Japanese men and Palauan women. The Japanese government encouraged such intermarriages, and provided <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> to women who had married Japanese men. However, only unions with civilian men were recognised and military personnel were prohibited from marrying Palauan women, although they were allowed to keep mistresses. The civilian government suppressed unions between Palauan men and Japanese women, and there was only one known case of a union between a Palauan man and a Japanese woman during the Japanese colonial-era.|$|E
