5|$|Hügel-Marshall {{continued}} {{to study and}} achieved a license in child education and welfare. She then found work in a children's home in Frankfurt am Main, where she worked for twelve years. The home {{reminded her of the}} degrading orphanage she had been sent to and <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> like a detention center than a school. Working with the other teachers, and over the opposition of the school's management, she was able to make substantial changes and to modernize it during her time there. While working there, she completed a degree in social work and pedagogy.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, {{during the}} Second English Civil War, Charles moved to The Hague, where his sister Mary and his {{brother-in-law}} William II, Prince of Orange, <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to provide}} substantial aid to the royalist cause than his mother's French relations. However, the royalist fleet that came under Charles's control {{was not used to}} any advantage, and did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist Engager army of the Duke of Hamilton before it was defeated at the Battle of Preston by the Parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E

50|$|The core {{dynamic of}} Rachilde's fiction is {{frequently}} gender reversal. Either {{at the outset}} or as an outcome of the story line there is a biologically female character who <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> culturally masculine and a biologically male character who <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> culturally feminine. There is variation in degree and manifestation, {{but it is important}} time and time again.|$|R
5|$|In {{the matter}} of the annulment, no {{progress}} seemed possible. The Pope <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> afraid of Emperor Charles V than of Henry. Anne and Cromwell and their allies wished simply to ignore the Pope, but in October 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that Parliament could not empower the archbishop to act against the Pope's prohibition. Henry thus resolved to bully the priests.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|Lenalee is {{voiced by}} Shizuka Itō in the {{original}} Japanese animated adaptation of the manga. Hoshino joked that Lenalee <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> beautiful after she saw Itō's work. Itō was replaced by Ai Kakuma in the Japanese anime sequel D.Gray-man Hallow. Lenalee is voiced in English by Luci Christian. The apparent romantic relationship that grows between Lenalee and Allen in the series led to a brief video clip where Christian acting as Lenalee confesses her feelings to Allen. Christian has stated she liked the character and was happy that Funimation intended to release the series' second half in 2017 {{so that she could}} voice her again.|$|E

5|$|These modernizations {{have been}} criticized by some naval historians, given that not only these ships would {{eventually}} prove to be inferior to the British battleships {{they were meant to}} face (namely the Queen Elizabeth-class), since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> likely, but also because the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays {{in the construction of the}} modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, McKinley and Hay {{engaged in}} {{negotiations}} with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn. Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E
25|$|As land values {{escalated}} and the phalanx's {{financial status}} <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> secure, the board began requiring {{larger and larger}} cash investments for admission to membership. Consequently, few new members were gained; energetic workers committed to the associationist ideal without sufficient financial means were turned away. Stagnation was the result.|$|E

The logical formulation of pure mathematics suggested by Bertrand Russell in terms of a quantifier structure of propositions <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of rigorous proof.|$|E

The KOL subordinated separate craft interests to the welfare of all the workers.|$|E

The Swedes were the {{official}} mediators, {{but it was}} through the private efforts of Boufflers and William Bentinck, the Earl of Portland that the major issues were resolved. William III {{had no intention of}} continuing the war or pressing for Leopold I's claims in the Rhineland or for the Spanish succession: it <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> important for Dutch and British security to obtain Louis XIV's recognition of the 1688 revolution.|$|E

25|$|Al-Radi was {{recalled}} by the Central Committee in June 1955, {{after it}} removed Uthman from the secretariat. His more moderate line, focused on {{an alliance with}} all potential progressive and national forces, <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> likely to yield results; in any case, the series of confrontations with the police which Uthman had incited had greatly weakened the organisation and were clearly not sustainable. Al-Radi reorganised the Central Committee, and the following year succeeded in reuniting the party, bringing two dissident groups back into the fold.|$|E
25|$|Going {{into the}} sixth test at the Oval, all England {{could hope for}} was to salvage some pride {{in the form of}} at least a solitary test win. However the hosts had looked {{unlikely}} to challenge the tourists for all but a few sessions during the whole series. England made two more changes, the introduction of debutants Alan Igglesden and John Stephenson, but the picks <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> likely to have come from the chance to expose them to the top level rather than hope that they might prove competitive against a clearly superior Australian side. Australia remained unchanged since the second test.|$|E

He did the double again although he only needed 47 in the last match {{of the season and}} scored 48 in the first innings. Somerset won by an innings so it was his last innings of the season. His best bowling was against Middlesex at Bath when he had match figures of 13-141, a match Somerset won by 9 wickets. With 10 championship wins, including 8 at home, against 9 defeats this was a rare season when they had more victories than losses.|$|E
