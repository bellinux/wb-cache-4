50|$|A {{finishing}} process called <b>S-Finishing</b> or surface saponification is sometimes applied to acetate and triacetate fabrics using a sodium hydroxide solution. This removes part {{or all of}} the acetyl groups {{from the surface of the}} fibres leaving them with a cellulose coating. This reduces the tendency for the fibres to acquire a static charge.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} SB-finished clothes, made of {{textiles}} for inhibiting MRSA, {{were examined in}} two ways; a test method and a wearing methed. The results are as follows. 1 : SB-finished clothes in test method showed positive antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 2 : SB-finished and <b>S-finished</b> clothes in the wearing method showed no positive antimicrobial activity. 3 : In the wearing method, considerable amounts of soiles were observed by scanning electron microscope {{on the surface and}} between fibers of socks-soles which had been worn for 8 hours. It is assumed that antimicrobial activities are {{under the influence of the}} quantity of these soiles. The MRSA-inhibiting textiles showed positive antimicrobial activities befor they were used. However, when they are being in use, the effect is not clear. That is because the antimicrobial activity is under the influence of soiles which attach to the fabrics when they are in use...|$|R
