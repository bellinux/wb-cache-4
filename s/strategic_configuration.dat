Based on the similarities and fundamental differences between Japan and China, we analyzed the experience of Japan’s useful ideas, and we also compared and analyzed the <b>strategic</b> <b>configuration</b> of our country’s mineral going-out strategy with several ministries and organizations. The results show that Japan’s global resource cycle system is a two-dimensional seamless-aid mechanism model, which brings them more benefits about mineral resources security.

40|$|By {{developing}} <b>strategic</b> <b>configurations</b> which describe {{commonly used}} paths to competitive advantage for manufacturers, this paper reconciles some basic concepts from competitive strategy and manufac-turing strategy. Four basic <b>strategic</b> <b>configurations</b> are identified: niche diflerentiator, broad differentiator, cost leader, and lean competitor. The configurations are traced conceptually through competitive strategy, organizational structure, environment, and a strategic framework of manufacturing capabilities and decisions. Examples {{from the major}} home appliance industry are provided for each configuration. Over the last two decades, the language and concepts of business-level competi-tive strategy have grown in both sophistication and acceptance by practitioners, {{as evidenced by the}} pervasive influence of schemes such as generic strategy (Porter, 1980) and core competence (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990). Over the same period, the acceptance and use of strategic approaches to managing manufacturing has enjoyed a similar growth, with the advent of concepts such as just-in-time produc-tion (Schonberger, 1982), lean manufacturing (Womack, Jones & Roos, 1990), flexible manufacturing (Goldhar & Jelinek, 1983; Meredith, 1987), and total qual-ity management (Hall, 1987). Surprisingly, research in strategic manufacturing practices has been largely independent of research in competitive strategy despite a considerable literature proclaiming the need to regard manufacturing as a competitive weapon (Buffa, 1984; Cohen & Zysman, 1987; Hayes & Wheel-wright, 1984). We seek to reconcile some basic concepts from competitive strat-egy and manufacturing strategy, and in so doing, present a framework for considering these two domains simultaneously.

40|$|The {{literature}} widely {{debated the}} importance of studying manufacturing strategies in terms of <b>strategic</b> <b>configuration,</b> i. e., coherent sets of priorities pursued by the companies. While the literature proved both empirically and theoretically the stability {{of a set of}} manufacturing strategy configurations, studies on the specific choices made by companies over time are lacking. This paper aims at analysing the stability of strategic configurations selected by companies over a 10 years period of time. Three different longitudinal samples from the IMSS database help to identify and study patterns of change from one <b>strategic</b> <b>configuration</b> to the other. Empirical evidence shows that companies are mostly seeking strategic flexibility, changing their set of priorities over time. The most stable strategies are the ones based on differentiation, while the pure focus on cost reduction or the multi-focused strategy of "do all" are not stable configurations. INTRODUCTION The theory about Manufacturing Strategy evolved significantly since the seminal work of Skinner (1969). This contribution put forward the basic elements of the definition of manufacturing strategy, the decision areas faced by manufacturing managers, and the principles that drive manufacturing choices. Based on this model, a number of authors (e. g. Buffa, 1984; Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Fine and Hax, 1985; Schroeder et al., 1986; Hill, 1989) contributed to the advancement of the discipline, both through empirical research and theoretical studies. The traditional model is partly questionable, because of its limited power of capturing and interpreting internal links among the elements of manufacturing strategy, i. e. the internal consistency, and the links of manufacturing decisions with the external environment, i. e. external consistency (Bozarth and McDermott, 1998). In order to address this gap, a number of studies tried to explore the priorities of manufacturing strategy as manufacturin...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} research conducted on Science and Technology Parks (STPs) examining their nature, formation, evolution and outcomes, limited research {{can be found}} using a network level of analysis. Instead, most research is conducted at the team or entrepreneurial firm level, with limited attention given to either relationships or the embedding network surrounding entrepreneurial firms in STPs. On the other hand, studies focusing on entrepreneurship are characterized by a growing network-based research tradition. What this stream of research lacks, though, are further qualitative studies to enrich {{our understanding of the}} content of relationships and of the structures within entrepreneurial networks. With this paper, we integrate these two areas of research (i. e. STPs and entrepreneurship) from a business marketing perspective and address the identified research gaps. This is achieved by undertaking a network study to analyse different <b>strategic</b> net <b>configurations</b> of the 46 entrepreneurial high technology firms within a UK-based STP.

These two unique characteristics change, in a fundamental way, how strategic capacity planning problem should be approached.

40|$|The paper explores firms {{as complex}} anticipatory systems which {{construct}} dynamic <b>strategic</b> <b>configurations</b> based on anticipation {{of their future}} possible states within the competitive environment. We argue that firm’s performance depends on (a) its strategy making process based on anticipation, and (b) its managerial capabilities which effectuate the anticipatory process in the following four stages: search across anticipated “what-if” resource configurations, the articulation and conversion of their meaning, and the finding and evolution of strategic patterns and courses of action for environmental fit. We performed an in-depth exploratory study {{with a group of}} senior managers in a pharmaceutical firm to uncover diverse anticipatory capabilities.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to address}} the {{question}} of how and how often companies change their manufacturing strategy in the medium and long run, thus addressing a lack of evidence in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores the movements made by companies among four manufacturing strategy configurations drawn from the literature (market-based, product-based, capability-based and price-based configuration). Analyses are based on three longitudinal samples from the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) database. Findings – Results show that while strategic configurations are rather stable, many companies do indeed change strategy and identifies which patterns of change prevail. Product-based strategy is the most-widely spread and most stable strategy. Capability-based competition is the rising star. The market-based strategy is struggling and price-based competition is on its way out.

40|$|Based on the {{fundamental}} principle of teaching psychology that retentiveness increases if students actively apply learning topics rather than only attend oral or visual presentations, {{the concept of}} learning factories {{becomes more and more}} popular. Academic education in the field of production science is imparted by means of real-world manufacturing facilities. By applying the manufacturing process of a real product, students or professionals incorporate the learning contents effectively and gain consciousness about their practical implications. Most learning factories are focused on lean manufacturing, lean administration or resource efficiency. As today manufacturing is not only subject to a single factory, but a network of globally distributed production sites, at the wbk Institute of Production Science,currently, a learning factory dealing with the topic of global production is developed. On the one hand, the curriculum of the Learning Factory Global Production (LGP) involves the specifics of local production sites with different location factors, such as different degrees of automation, cost structures and qualification levels, and their effects on the reconfigurability of the production systems. On the other hand, the interaction of the production sites in a globally distributed production network and the <b>strategic</b> <b>configuration</b> of the network are also subject to the curriculum.

40|$|Until the {{beginning}} of 1950 s, the economic theory in general, and the microeconomic theory in particular, relied totally on the deterministic character of economic phenomena. Nowadays microeconomic models are built on uncertain elements in a competitive environment that is affected by risk and uncertainty. Two centuries later, traditional microeconomics, also known as derived microeconomics, continues {{to be based on}} Adam Smith’s theory. As individuals are interested in participating in commercial transactions, but for these to take place effectively, two essential principles should be observed: the principle of rationality and the principle of pure and perfect competition. The link between Brower’ fixed point theorems {{on the one hand and}} John von Neumann’s minimax theorem on the other hand enabled other authors such as McKenzie Arrow and Debreu Uzawa to state and demonstrate simpler but more general theorems than that of Abraham Wald. It was thus supposed that consumer preferences in a pool of possible consumptions are reflexive, transitive and all are comparable. Using game theory as a reference framework to represent the behavior of economic agents, microeconomics strongly renews its scope of investigation. The problem that arises is no longer linked to the study of perfectly competitive markets, but mostly to how agents coordinate their decisions in different <b>strategic</b> <b>configuration</b> circumstances. The use of such concepts as risk, antiselection or coordination limits has opened new scopes to economy in general and to microeconomics in particular.
