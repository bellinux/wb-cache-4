50|$|Trapped key {{interlocking}} utilizes locks and keys for sequential control {{of equipment and}} machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting. A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power <b>source</b> (<b>circuit</b> breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an access lock. The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the access lock, this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety.|$|E

40|$|The cost {{of several}} circuit {{configurations}} for large (5 MW) array fields were investigated {{to assess the}} relative costs {{of high and low}} voltage configurations. Three <b>source</b> <b>circuit</b> NOC voltages were evaluated: 400 V (ungrounded), 800 V (+ or 400 V center grounded), and 2000 V (+ or - 1000 V center grounded). Four <b>source</b> <b>circuit</b> configurations were considered {{for each of the three}} NOC voltages. The configurations correspond to <b>source</b> <b>circuit</b> currents of 15, 30, 45, and 60 amperes, respectively. Conceptual layouts for 5 MW building blocks for each of the above configurations were developed. The designs were optimized to minimize BOS electrical and structural costs. Only the BOS electrical costs were evaluated. The designs were broken down into the following elements for cost: (1) basic <b>source</b> <b>circuit</b> intermodule wiring, bypass diodes and associated hardware, <b>source</b> <b>circuit</b> to J-Box wiring, etc; (2) J-Box blocking diodes, varistors, heat sinks, and housing; (3) disconnects <b>source</b> <b>circuit</b> disconnects, fuses, and housing; (4) bus cabling J-Box to PCU interface wiring, and trenching; (5) interface bus bar, group disconnects, and fuses; and (6) fault detection shunts, signal wire, electronics, and alarm.
