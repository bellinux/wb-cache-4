40|$|Genomic DNA {{obtained}} from patient whole blood samples {{is a key}} element for genomic research. Advantages and disadvantages, in terms of time-efficiency, cost-effectiveness and laboratory requirements, of procedures available to isolate nucleic acids need to be considered before choosing any particular method. These characteristics have not been fully evaluated for some laboratory techniques, such as the <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method for DNA extraction, which has been excluded from comparison in different studies published to date. We compared three different protocols (a traditional <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method, a modified <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method and a commercially available kit method) to determine the most cost-effective and time-efficient method to extract DNA. We extracted genomic DNA from whole blood samples {{obtained from}} breast cancer patient volunteers and compared the results of the product obtained in terms of quantity (concentration of DNA extracted and DNA obtained per ml of blood used) and quality (260 / 280 ratio and polymerase chain reaction product amplification) of the obtained yield. On average, all three methods showed no statistically significant differences between the final result, but when we accounted for time and cost derived for each method, they showed very significant differences. The modified <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method resulted in a seven- and twofold reduction in cost compared to the commercial kit and traditional <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method, respectively and reduced time from 3 days to 1 hour compared to the traditional <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method. This highlights a modified <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method as a suitable choice to be used in laboratories and research centres, particularly when dealing with a large number of samples. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{important}} items in molecular characterization of food-borne pathogens is high quality genomic DNA. In this study, we investigated three protocols and compared their simplicity, duration and costs for extracting genomic DNA from Linguatula serrata. Methods: The larvae were collected from the sheep’s visceral organs from the Yazd Slaughterhouse during May 2013. DNA extraction was done in three different methods, including commercial DNA extraction kit, Phenol Chloroform Isoamylalcohol (PCI), and <b>salting</b> <b>out.</b> Extracted DNA in each method was assessed for quantity and quality using spectrophotometery and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Results: The less duration was regarding to commercial DNA extraction kit and then <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> protocol. The cost benefit one was <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> and then PCI method. The best quantity was regarding to PCI with 72. 20 ± 29. 20 ng/μl, and purity of OD 260 /OD 280 in 1. 76 ± 0. 947. Agarose gel electrophoresis for assessing the quality found all the same. Conclusion: <b>Salting</b> <b>out</b> is introduced as the best method for DNA extraction from L. seratta as a food-borne pathogen with the least costand appropriate purity. Although, the best purity was regarding to PCI but PCI is not safe as <b>salting</b> <b>out.</b> In addition, the duration of <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> was less than PCI. The least duration was seen in commercial DNA extraction kit, but it is expensive and therefore is not recommended for developing countries where consumption of offal is common. </p...|$|R

E coli isolated from patients with ulcerative colitis possess a mannose resistant adhesin similar to that found in pathogenic E coli. In this study 42 E coli isolates from patients with colitis have been compared with 15 from controls to assess hydrophobicity and cellular adherence. The <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> method and the buccal epithelial cell technique were used respectively. E coli isolated from colitics are significantly more hydrophobic than control E coli (p less than 0. 001). The <b>salting</b> <b>out</b> score correlates negatively with the buccal epithelial cell adhesion index. When E coli are grown at 18 degrees C both properties are temporarily reduced suggesting that they are related to each other.

This is {31} partly water, mixed with some kinds of air (ammonia, etc.,) but the plant can get both water and ammonia from the atmosphere; and, I believe, {{for the most part}} does so; though, when it cannot get water from the air, it will gladly drink by its roots. But the things it cannot receive from the air at all are certain earthy salts, essential to it (as iron is essential in our own blood), and of which when it has quite exhausted the earth, no more such plants can grow in that ground. On this subject you will find enough in any modern treatise on agriculture; all that I want you to note here is that this feeding {{function of}} the root is of a very delicate and discriminating kind, needing much searching and mining among the dust, to find what it wants. If it only wanted water, it could get most of that by spreading in mere soft senseless limbs, like sponge, as far, and as far down, as it could--but to get the <b>salt</b> <b>out</b> of the earth it has to sift all the earth, and taste and touch every grain of it that it can, with fine fibres.

60|$|It {{is natural}} that this second kind of wisdom, being {{detached}} and unsystematic, should embody {{itself in the}} short and pregnant form of proverb, sentence, maxim, and aphorism. The essence of aphorism is the compression of a mass of thought and observation into a single saying. It is the very opposite of dissertation and declamation; its distinction {{is not so much}} ingenuity, as good sense brought to a point; it ought to be neither enigmatical nor flat, neither a truism on the one hand, nor a riddle on the other. These wise sayings, said Bacon, the author of some of the wisest of them, are not only for ornament, but for action and business, having a point or edge, whereby knots in business are pierced and discovered. And he applauds Cicero's description of such sayings as saltpits,--that you may extract <b>salt</b> <b>out</b> of them, and sprinkle it where you will. They are the guiding oracles which man has found out for himself in that great business of ours, of learning how to be, to do, to do without, and to depart. Their range extends from prudential kitchen maxims, such as Franklin set forth in the sayings of Poor Richard about thrift in time and money, up to such great and high moralities of life as are the prose maxims of Goethe,--just as Bacon's Essays extend from precepts as to building and planting, up to solemn reflections on truth, death, and the vicissitudes of things. They cover the whole field of man as he is, and life as it is, not of either as they ought to be; friendship, ambition, money, studies, business, public duty, in all their actual laws and conditions as they are, and not as the ideal moralist may wish that they were.|$|E
