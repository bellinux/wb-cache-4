An example of recreational fatbiking is the announcement in 2015 by Gatineau Park in Canada's national capital region that snow biking and winter mountain biking will be permitted on selected snowshoe trails. The park only permits cyclists with [...] "..winter bikes equipped with tires at least 9.4 cm (3.7-in.) wide..." [...] to use the trails.

40|$|The {{world of}} extreme sports and more {{specifically}} the world of snow sports is changing by the minute. At the forefront of these new changes is the <b>snow</b> <b>bike.</b> The bike allows you to ride the mountain like you were riding a mountain-bike on skies, but it comes with challenges. The biggest of them being portability. The bike is restricted to certain types of lifts within the mountain and that restricts the user of its potential. This report will show {{that it is possible}} to “fold” both the frame and the handlebars to make the bike portable and therefore opening the user to new opportunities. This report shows with the use of the proper material, in this case steel, welded and fabricated correctly can withstand the forces and impacts the bike might encounter. As such, this essay will provide conclusive and positive results to both its physical and theoretical tests. The prototype will be ridden at Stevens pass resort to test its actual resistance to a drop from about 3. 5 meters into snow. The frame and the handlebars will also be tested for any deformation, and stresses such as compression, tension and shear. The bike is expected to respond mostly as the original, with some minor extra shaking due to the pins responsible for the attachments...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>biking,</b> {{also called}} icebiking {{is another example}} of mixed terrain bicycle travel and a great example of the bicycle's {{flexible}} technology. Nearly any bike which allows medium or wide tires can be outfitted with special snow studded tires. Surly Bikes and other manufactures make bikes with extra wide tires specifically designed for deep snow. Events for racing and adventure riding across the snow have been created. The Iditarod Trail Invitational is an 1100-mile race billed as the [...] "worlds longest winter ultra race across frozen Alaska". Another form of bicycle snow travel is called Skibobbing or ski biking which replaces wheels for skis.|$|R
5000|$|Skibobbing is {{a winter}} sport {{involving}} a bicycle-type frame attached to skis instead of wheels {{and a set}} of foot skis. The use of foot skis is what actually defines [...] "skibobbing". Although the original idea for a bicycle with skis was patented as early as 1892, and skibobbing had been a form of transportation in the Alps, it was not until 1954 that the first international race was held. Seven years later, the FISB (Fédération Internationale de Skibob) was formed, which since 1967 has held an annual Skibobbing World Championship. Although skibobs are often called ski <b>bikes</b> or <b>snow</b> <b>bikes</b> they are completely separate, and the sport {{should not be confused with}} snowbiking, which is the sport or recreation of cycling on snow.|$|R

5000|$|Parks can {{be divided}} into active and passive {{recreation}} areas. Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including playgrounds, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and skateparks. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called [...] "low intensity recreation" [...] is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails. Passive recreation typically requires little management and can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain <b>biking,</b> <b>snow</b> shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure.

50|$|Moisture-wicking fabrics are a {{class of}} hi-tech fabrics that provide {{moisture}} control for an athlete's skin. They move perspiration {{away from the body}} to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate. These fabrics typically are soft, lightweight, and stretchy—in other words, they are perfectly suited for making activewear. Moisture-wicking means that the fabric is absorbent and this can leave a barrier of wet fabric on your skin. Drywicking is the newest variation of moisture wicking. It is a smart two tier fabric that breaks the surface tension of sweat and propels it through the hydrophobic layer into a natural wicking outer layer like cotton where it is assisted by evaporative cooling leaving your skin absolutely dry. Besides the fact that your body can perform better, it will chemically free prevent odors because a bacteria microclimate cannot grow on dry skin. This broad category of fabrics is used to make garments like T-shirts, sports bras, running and cycling jerseys, socks, tracksuits, and polo-style shirts for any physical activity where the goal is to keep your skin as cool and dry as possible. Moisture-wicking fabrics are used to make apparel for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, mountain <b>biking,</b> <b>snow</b> skiing, and mountain climbing. Due to the popularity of garments made from these fabrics, more variations are being introduced to the market.|$|R
