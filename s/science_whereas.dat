25|$|The {{original}} DCSD {{decision about}} Lomborg provoked a petition signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD {{for evaluating the}} book {{as a work of}} <b>science,</b> <b>whereas</b> the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist. The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices. In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and natural sciences community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{research}} on perceptions of science among the American public concludes that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science {{or with the}} seeking out of scientific knowledge, although there may be epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets. Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science. [...] Also, cross-national studies, polled from 1981-2001, on views of science and religion have noted that countries with higher religiosity do not have stronger trust in <b>science,</b> <b>whereas</b> countries that are seen as more secular are less skeptical {{about the impact of}} science and technology. Though the United States is a highly religious country compared to other advanced industrial countries, according to the National Science Foundation, public attitudes towards science are more favorable in the United States than Europe, Russia, and Japan. A study on a national sample of US college students examined whether they viewed the science / religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or independence. The study concluded that the majority of undergraduates in both the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and religion. Another finding in the study was that it is more likely for students to move away from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration perspective than vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|This perspective, termed positivism, {{was first}} {{developed}} by theorist Auguste Comte. Positivism {{was founded on}} the theory that the only true, factual knowledge is scientific knowledge. Comte had very vigorous guidelines for a theory to be considered positivism. He thought that this authentic knowledge can only be derived from positive confirmation of theories through strict continuously tested methods, that are not only scientifically but also quantitatively based. Émile Durkheim was a major proponent of theoretically grounded empirical research, seeking correlations to reveal structural laws, or [...] "social facts". [...] Durkheim proved that concepts that had been attributed to the individual were actually socially determined. These occurrences are things such as suicide, crime, moral outrage, a person’s personality, time, space, and God. He brought to light that society had influence on all aspects of a person, far more than had been previously believed. For him, sociology could be described as the [...] "science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning". Durkheim endeavoured to apply sociological findings in the pursuit of political reform and social solidarity. [...] Today, scholarly accounts of Durkheim's positivism may be vulnerable to exaggeration and oversimplification: Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis {{in the same way as}} noble <b>science,</b> <b>whereas</b> Durkheim acknowledged in greater detail the fundamental epistemological limitations.|$|E

60|$|But the Dipsey had sailed in such devious {{ways and}} in so many {{directions}} that she had laid {{a great deal of}} the cable upon the bottom of the polar sea, and it would be difficult, or perhaps impossible, to sail back over her previous tracks and take it up again; and there was not enough of it left for her to proceed southward very far and still keep up her telegraphic communication. Consequently it was considered best, upon starting southward, that they should cut loose from all connection with their friends and the rest of the world. They would have to do this anyway in a short time. If they left the end of the wire in some suitable position on the coast of the polar sea, it might prove of subsequent advantage to <b>science,</b> <b>whereas</b> if they cut loose when they were submerged in the ocean, this cable from Cape Tariff to the pole must always be absolutely valueless. It was therefore determined to build a little house, for which they had the material, and place therein a telegraph instrument connected with the wire, and provided with one of the Collison batteries, which would remain in working order with a charge sufficient to last for forty years, and this, with a ground-wire run down through the ice to the solid earth, might make telegraphic communication possible to some subsequent visitor to the pole.|$|E

Formal models have also been developed to study the nature and consequences of institutional complementarity.|$|R

Results show that women are significantly less likely than men to be academically employed in the natural <b>sciences</b> and medicine, <b>whereas</b> no significant gender differences prevail for the social sciences and the humanities. On average, women earn 15 per cent less than men, and the academically employed earn 24 per cent less than PhDs outside academia.

A holistic research methodology in this respect helps understand common themes, patterns and conditions of existence, as well as features of social interaction and change across different sectors and communities in a society. Pragmatism as an overarching philosophy helps with reflexive interpretation of cultural and institutional contexts.

40|$|Self-concept {{and self-efficacy}} {{are two of}} the most {{important}} motivational predictors of educational outcomes. As most research has studied these constructs separately, little is known about their differential relations to peer ability, opportunities-to-learn in classrooms, and educational outcomes. We investigated these relations by applying (multilevel) structural equation modeling to the German PISA 2006 data set. We found a correlation of ρ =. 57 between self-concept and self-efficacy in science, advocating distinguishable constructs. Furthermore, science self-concept was better predicted by the average peer achievement (Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect), <b>whereas</b> <b>science</b> self-efficacywas more strongly affected by inquirybased learning opportunities. There were also differences in the predictive potential for educational outcomes: Self-concept was a better predictor of future-oriented motivation to aspire a career in the <b>sciences,</b> <b>whereas</b> self-efficacy was a better predictor of current ability. The study at hand provides strong evidence for the related but distinct nature of the two constructs and extends existing research on students’ competence beliefs toward social comparisons and opportunities-to-learn. Further implications for the relevance of inquiry-based classroom activities and for the assessment of competence beliefs are discussed...|$|R
