The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E

Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E

25|$|This {{would all}} {{change in the}} middle of 2005 however. In June 2005 Police responded to a call about a man doing pushups in the street and jumping on cars in a {{residential}} neighborhood near Tallahassee, Florida. When they reached the scene, Tallahassee police officer Zachary Lyne stated that Sexton was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the street wearing only a pair of wet shorts and when repeatedly asked to state his name he eventually responded only that he was God. Lyne then stated that Sexton became belligerent and had to be pepper sprayed and subdued. Sexton was not charged with a crime as he passed a sobriety test, and police stated that he had not committed a criminal act. The police then, after consulting with Sexton's parents, released him to a hospital for medical observation. Initially there were allegations of drug abuse which Sexton's family quickly repudiated. Sexton was later diagnosed with Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease that can cause joint swelling and brain inflammation if left untreated. The disease was deemed to be in its later stages by a Lyme disease specialist when it was diagnosed, who then recommended a treatment program of intensive antibiotic therapy for several months.|$|E
25|$|The league {{kept the}} number of games on the {{schedule}} at 36 for the 2009–10 season. High1 lost in the semi-finals of the Korea Domestic Championship to Korea University.

At the end of the regular season, High1 finished in fourth place with 60 points. They scored 150 goals while allowing 130 goals and won their season series against the China Dragon and Tohoku Free Blades and lost their series against the Cranes and Eagles. In contrast {{to the middle of the}} season when High1 had seven players in the top ten points ranking, they finished with only two players in the top ten. Alex Kim and Tim Smith tied for first place with 75 points. Kim also led the team in goals with 29, while Smith led the team in assists with 48. Kim also led the team in plus-minus with +50. High1 scored the lowest number of shorthanded goals, with only 2. The team played ten of their 18 home games in Goyang. Advancing to the playoffs, they faced Korean rival Halla in the semi-finals. Although they won the first game in Anyang, they lost three straight to be knocked out of the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|The semi-final match {{presented}} {{the first major}} challenge in the short reign of the then reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champions, Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero as they faced former champions Negro Casas and the returning Hijo del Santo, the clear crowd favorites. The crowd favorites got the fans on their feet during the first fall, especially when Hijo del Santo forced Rey Bucanero to submit to his trademark submission hold called La de a Caballo (Camel clutch). Moments later Último Guerrero was unable {{to return to the}} ring before the referee counted to twenty, costing his team the first fall. The tag team champions fought their way back in control of the ring and won the second fall to tie it all up. The third fall saw Casas and Hijo del Santo almost win the championship on several occasions, but in the end Bucanero pinned Negro Casas while Guerrero pinned El Hijo del Santo to retain their titles. The emotions behind the main event was evident from before the bell even rang, with both veteran competitors attacking each. The match was more of a brutal fight than a wrestling exhibition as the two fought {{both inside and outside the}} ring. The match was relatively short, three falls in the span of just eight minutes and twenty six seconds, but it was action filled from start to finish.

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} a [...] "very, very good piece of television".

VanDerWerff was also pleased with Duchovny's performance, writing that he [...] "brings the intense mania to Mulder that has always made the character work at his best." [...] Despite this, he was slightly critical of the concept of the [...] "walk-ins", which he called [...] "patently ridiculous". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that while [...] "Chris Carter penned this episode, [...] his attempts at clarifying his own confounded mythology are often even more confusing than revelatory, 'Sein Und Zeit' is a tense installment, and leads neatly to the supposed wrap-up in the second half. [...] " [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] "'Sein Und Zeit' not only served as a reminder of Fox Mulder's ongoing pain it provided yet another clue that, although its journey is nearing its completion, The X-Files still knows how to make the ride an enjoyable one." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two called the episode [...] "a welcome return to an X-Files we haven't seen for awhile—hard, passionate, and with an urgent story to tell.

500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. He {{felt it was}} {{refreshing}} to have a story about aliens that weren't invading and opined that [...] "the brutal scenes at the abattoir and the whale-like moans of agony from the beast tug on a few heartstrings." [...] However, he criticised the realisation of the alien describing it as [...] "basically a giant, moaning turd <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a warehouse" [...] and [...] "a large lump of putty with eyes". He felt that the episode gave Rhys [...] "a chance {{to step into the}} spotlight for a change and prove he has what it takes to carry a story" [...] and felt his reaction to the existence of aliens to be [...] "perhaps the most realistic that the genre has produced". Despite this, he felt that Rhys finding out about Torchwood {{put an end to the}} [...] "fun" [...] of Gwen [...] "keeping secrets and concealing her double life" [...] and expressed disappointment that Jack didn't wipe his memory at the end of the episode. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.6 on a one to ten scale and felt it provided a [...] "messy, odd and somewhat unsettling twist on alien encounters" [...] but felt the episode had several weak points. He felt it was hard not to see Rhys as [...] "a buffoon" [...] and questioned why Torchwood would use a civilian during a sting operation. He also felt that it pushed [...] "beyond the limits of its capacity to create convincing special effects" [...] and the creature itself looked like [...] "a hand puppet". Andrew Mickel of Den of Geek felt that Rhys has always been the [...] "Welsh heart of the show" [...] and praised his role in the episode for being [...] "actually rather entertaining, approaching everything with invigorating gusto." [...] However he also criticised the denouement of the episode for being [...] "daftly mawkish" [...] and opined that [...] "it’s always impossible to care about CGI characters".|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, Britain was {{waging war}} in the Mediterranean against the German Afrika Korps and Italian forces in North Africa.

2500|$|The {{main event}} match between the Mexican {{team and the}} Japanese La Fiebre Amarilla started out with the tecnico side showing a bit of unity as Stuka Jr. wore a mask that was a {{combination}} of his own and the mask style Rey Cometa had worn until September, 2012. Namajague also wore a mask created specifically for the occasion, featuring long, bright red hair attached to his mask. Okumura and Namajague sought to get an easy advantage by jumping their opponents before the bell, but based on the two teams previous history Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa were prepared for it and took control of the match for the early parts of the match. After several minutes of being on the defensive La Fievre Amarilla double teamed their way into control of the match and won the first fall of the match. The rudo duo continued to dominate throughout most of the second fall, but this time the Mexican team was able to overcome this and even the match with one fall to each team. Initially the crowd was quiet for the match, {{but by the end of}} the second fall the Mexico City fans were solidly cheering [...] "Mexico" [...] to support the home team. At one point a mistake between Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa saw the team almost fight each other, each thinking the other one intentionally knocked them down. After a few moments cooler heads prevailed and Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa turned their attention back towards their Japanese rivals for the third and final fall. In the third fall Stuka Jr. pinned Okumura to eliminate him from the match, while he himself being pinned by Namajague only moments later. This left Namajague and Rey Cometa in the ring, with the next elimination deciding which side lost the match. After several moments of high flying, fast paced wrestling Rey Cometa was able to execute a 450 degree splash off the top rope to Namajague for the final elimination. The crowd showed their appreciation for the performance of both Mexicans, cheering them on as brightly colored confetti dropped from the ceiling covering the defeated Okumura and Namajague. While Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa celebrated Okumura had all his hair shaved off while <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the ring, paying off on the [...] "bet" [...] he placed on the match.
