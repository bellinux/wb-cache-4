Until recently, Atlantic chub mackerel and Indo-Pacific chub mackerel {{were thought to be}} subspecies of the same species. In 1999, Collette established, on molecular and morphological considerations, that these are separate <b>species.</b> <b>Mackerel</b> are smaller with shorter lifecycles than their close relatives, the tuna, which are also members of the same family.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of egg and larvae of mackerel, horse mackerel, sardine, hake, megrim, blue whiting and anchovy along the European Atlantic waters (south Portugal to Scotland) during 1998 is described. Time of the year, sea surface temperature and bottom depth {{are used to}} define the spawning habitat of the different <b>species.</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> horse mackerel, and sardine eggs and larvae presented the widest distribution, whereas megrim and anchovy showed a limited distribution, restricted to the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay respectively. Correspondingly mackerel, horse mackerel and sardine showed the highest aggregation indices. Blue whiting larvae were found at the lowest temperatures, whereas anchovy eggs and larvae {{were found in the}} warmest waters. The analysis is a basis for evaluation of ongoing changes in the pelagic ecosystem of the north-east Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid {{analysis}} was used to study the trophic ecology of 10 demersal fish species in the South Georgia region. Principal component analysis grouped the species into three general clusters, revealing resource partitioning between species. Two groups were characterised by large proportions of either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, separating species according to their predominant feeding habitat. The third group showed fatty acid signatures overlapping with either or both of the previous two groups, suggesting a more opportunistic feeding behaviour for these species. Intraspecific comparisons furthermore revealed dietary variability with size, year and geographical location in several <b>species.</b> <b>Mackerel</b> icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) in particular showed inter-annual differences in muscle lipid concentrations closely linked to prey availability with low lipid contents found in years of low krill (Euphausia superba) abundance. Despite the intraspecific differences the majority of species could be easily distinguished from each other, which indicates the utility of this method in the dietary analysis of higher predators. ...|$|E

40|$|Estimates of {{discards}} by the Dutch pelagic freezer-trawler fleet {{were derived}} {{based on data}} from observers on board commercial vessels. In all, 27 fishing trips of duration 2 – 5 weeks each were sampled between 2002 and 2005, covering the North Sea and the western waters of the British Isles. Different methods to estimate discards were compared, and raising these estimates by number of trips or by total landings did not greatly influence the annual estimates of total discards. Some 30 000 t of fish were discarded annually by the fleet, the commercial target <b>species</b> <b>mackerel,</b> herring, and horse mackerel being discarded most, with 41 %, 19 %, and 15 % of the total discards by weight, respectively. The most commonly discarded non-commercial species was boarfish, accounting for 5 % of total discards. Slippage accounts for 10 % of all discards, and the most common species slipped is herring. There is extensive discarding of juvenile mackerel in the horse mackerel fishery, {{and to a lesser extent}} highgrading of mackerel in the same fishery...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of eggs and larvae of three pelagic <b>species,</b> <b>mackerel,</b> horse mackerel and sardine, in the Bay of Biscay was studied in 1998, 2001 and 2004. The {{spatial distribution}} was clearly different between the years studied and corresponds quite precisely to different water circulation regimes. Mackerel and horse mackerel larvae are more affected by the prevailing currents than sardine, as their spawning grounds are located offshore, far from the shelf break where the current velocities are higher. Survival rates for mackerel and horse mackerel were higher in 2001, when the offshore larval transport was stronger. However, for sardine, the mortality rate hardly varied between years. The abundance of 25 -day-old larvae, considered as an index of the survival rate, {{appears to be a}} good recruitment indicator, at least for 1998, 2001 and 2004. Our results did not support the hypothesis of Bakun (1996), which states that dispersion of early life stages towards open ocean waters should cause high larval mortality. At least under the conditions observed for the years studied, the retention of larvae offshore appears to {{have a positive effect on}} larval growth and/or survival...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{fatty acid}} {{compositions}} of phyto-zooplankton (calanoid copepod species, krill…) to fish <b>species</b> (<b>mackerel,</b> sardine anchovy, salmon, shark) are presented. Marine oils are essentially used for their high long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), namely eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) for their good health impact. Due to {{health benefits of}} the omega- 3, weekly fish consumption is today recommended by many authorities (FDA, AFSSA…). Capture fisheries and aquaculture supplied the world with about 110 million tonnes of food fish in 2006 (FAO 2009), providing an apparent per capita supply of 16. 7 kg. It is well established that the lipid composition of fish muscle {{is influenced by the}} diet and also depends on the effects of environmental factors (temperature, oxygen concentration in sea water) and endogenous medium (physiological state and individual variability). In general, cultured fish have been reported to have a softer texture than wild fish, which has been related to the differences in muscle structure, proximate composition and nutritional value. New applications of typical compounds (wax esters, squalene …) or lipid classes (glycerophospholipids, ether glycerolipids, sphingophospholipids …) as cosmetics, functional foods and dietary supplements will become very important in the near future with nano-structured drug carriers in pharmaceutical and biomedical areas...|$|E

40|$|International audience‘POKER 2006 ', {{a bottom}} trawl fish biomass survey, was {{conducted}} from September to October 2006 {{in the northern}} part of the Kerguelen Plateau (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58. 5. 1). The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, bigeye grenadier (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey. Some shelf and slope <b>species</b> (<b>mackerel</b> icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii)) exhibit low levels of biomass when compared to the results of previous surveys (SKALP surveys, 1987 and 1988). Other species (unicorn icefish (Channichthys rhinoceratus) and grey rockcod (Lepidonotothen squamifrons)) seem to have increased, even doubled, their biomass during the period between the two surveys. In addition to the commercial species, Zanclorhynchus spinifer was abundant on the shelf and Alepocephalus cf. antipodianus was abundant in the deep sea; the data on the latter are new. Data on the geographic and bathymetric distribution of the species provide evidence of geographically very stable species-specific concentrations.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Biomedical Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2003 Allergic {{conditions}} among workers processing seafood {{are most}} often related to inhalation of the seafood antigens or via direct unprotected handling of the seafood and its products. This can cause sensitised individuals to suffer from asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, urticaria and protein contact dermatitis, which are IgE mediated. Food intolerance may also occur which is a non-IgE mediated reaction, however the exact mechanism {{is yet to be}} determined. There is therefore a need to develop reliable tests to identify sensitised workers processing seafood. The objective {{of this study was to}} prepare specific seafood extracts from raw and cooked lobster; raw and cooked saltwater bony fish <b>species</b> (<b>mackerel,</b> red eye, maasbanker, pilchard and anchovy) and fishmeal dust obtained from a fish-processing factory. These extracts were tested by SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis to characterise the seafood proteins, and the allergenicity was confirmed by the Western blot technique. Polyclonal IgG antibodies were also successfully generated in rabbits, using the specific seafood extracts isolated from the various species. The second objective was to optimise and standardize an Enzyme Allergosorbent Test (EAST) method to quantify specific IgE antibodies in the sera of factory workers. This EAST was optimised and validated to detect allergen-specific IgE to each of the different fish species and also one crustacean species (rock lobster). Sera from a group of workers were selected and analysed for specific IgE antibodies by the optimised EAST (S) (South African laboratory), and commercial RAST techniques. Analysis was performed for the three most important extracts, pilchard (canned), anchovy, and lobster. The same samples were analysed by EAST (R) in the reference laboratory (Dr Gerald Reese; Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Germany). The different techniques, and the EAST (R) and the EAST (S) results were compared by using a statistical software package. An EAST method was successfully developed, however, compared to the results obtained by the reference laboratory the sensitivity and specificity was below 80 %. The main reason for the low agreement between the two laboratories was the fact that the South African laboratory used a modified EAST method, and different data calculation methods, for categorising positive results. The South African laboratory did not use a kit-based assay and a serum dilution of 1 : 4 and not 1 : 2 were used when compared to the reference laboratory. When the EAST results were compared to the RAST results, poor agreement was found due to the fact that canned pilchard was used in the EAST while raw pilchard in the commercial RAST assay. For pilchard, anchovy and lobster EAST, different species were utilized compared to the RAST, and this can also explain the poor level of agreement. Future directions would be to further standardise the EAST method and to introduce reference sera and a standard curve to determine positive results, thereby ensuring more reproducible results between laboratories...|$|E

40|$|Four <b>species</b> {{of large}} <b>mackerels</b> (Scomberomorus spp.) co-occur {{in the waters}} off {{northern}} Australia and are important to fisheries in the region. State fisheries agencies monitor these species for fisheries assessment; however, data inaccuracies may exist due to difficulties with identification of these closely related species, particularly when specimens are incomplete from fish processing. This study examined the efficacy of using otolith morphometrics to differentiate and predict among the four <b>mackerel</b> <b>species</b> off northeastern Australia. Seven otolith measurements and five shape indices were recorded from 555 mackerel specimens. Multivariate modelling including linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines, successfully differentiated among the four species based on otolith morphometrics. Cross validation determined a predictive accuracy of at least 96 % for both models. An optimum predictive model for the four <b>mackerel</b> <b>species</b> was an LDA model that included fork length, feret length, feret width, perimeter, area, roundness, form factor and rectangularity as explanatory variables. This analysis may improve the accuracy of fisheries monitoring, the estimates based on this monitoring (i. e. mortality rate) and the overall management of <b>mackerel</b> <b>species</b> in Australia...|$|R
