Several debates on educational policies have ensued, and discourse on this topic has featured political catchphrases such as ‘outcome orientation’ (Cochran-Smith et al. 2012; European Commission 2007). The central theme of the discussion on outcome orientation is that both the educational system and teaching can become more successful by focusing less on curricula and teaching objectives, and more on empirically assessed outcomes, such as student learning and resulting knowledge and skills. This also applies to the domain of teacher education.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increase}} in knowledge, it has becoming practically impossible for students to learn all that they need before being able to design a machine. Furthermore, these days, the acquisition of <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> quite as important as the acquisition of knowledge. As a consequence, we decided to modify the curriculum of Machine Design from classical lectures to a problem-based learning approach, based on the principle that new knowledge is acquired by building on previous knowledge (not by simple transmission) and that learning works best in communities of learners. Our approach may be summed up as learning by doing in small groups. This paper presents the experiment carried out over the past two academic years. It also discusses the advantages and the drawbacks of the new approach and gives some guidelines on implementing the approach correctly...|$|E

This paper studies the effectiveness of information skills learning by a group of undergraduates using Brookfield’s concept of critical reflection and Critical Incident Questionnaire (CIQ). Most students reported positive experiences where the learning environment encouraged a deep approach to learning and negative experiences where that environment encouraged a surface approach. To ensure that students’ approach to learning is appropriate for achieving the level of information literacy required of graduates, the study recommends the integration of information skills learning into course curricula through the close collaboration of academic and library staff. <br /...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{developments}} in the surgical literature highlight the need for assessment of nontechnical skills in surgery. We report a revision of the NOn-TECHnical Skills (NOTECHS) scale of the aviation industry for use in surgery and detailed analysis on its reliability. METHODS: The original NOTECHS scale assesses (1) Cooperation, (2) Leadership and Managerial Skills, (3) Situation Awareness and Vigilance, and (4) Decision Making. We added a Communication and Interaction dimension and adapted all subscales for use in surgical context. Reliability was assessed in simulation-based training for trainee clinicians. RESULTS: Satisfactory reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was obtained (1) across professional groups and trainers and trainees, (2) in separate analyses for trainers and trainees, (3) in successive administrations of the scale, and (4) in surgical, anaesthetic and nursing groups analyzed separately. In the operating department practitioners group, Situation Awareness and Vigilance and Cooperation and Team Skills exhibited lower reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of surgical nontechnical <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> a training priority.

40|$|Having {{pervasive}} <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{more important}} to employers {{as well as to}} professional bodies and associations. Consequently, the ability to work in groups is regarded as an essential skill. Although working in groups is found to heighten the performance of students and lead to the development of various pervasive skills, group work still forms a very small part of most South African tertiary education teaching frameworks. As a consequence, most professional bodies have updated their competency models and syllabuses they prescribe to tertiary institutions. In response to this development, the Department of Accounting at Stellenbosch University in South Africa has developed a management accounting project requiring students to prepare a business plan for a new business venture while working in groups, giving consideration to the skills they believe they should develop. A questionnaire was created to investigate students ’ perceptions of group work. Responses were favourable with the majority of respondents being of the opinion that the ability to work in groups is an important skill to develop while at university before commencing their professional careers. The study highlighted some obstacles which need to be considered in developing a project requiring group work. The main constraints appear to be group selection, group size, group management and assessing group work and time...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{technology}} {{within the context of}} a music lesson is now well established practice with most schools placing significant emphasis on the acquisition of technological skills. Similarly, outside of school, the availability of numerous free software packages allows children access to relatively sophisticated music programs providing them with the opportunity to compose, record and mix their own musical products. Given the increasing role which both music and technology play in the everyday lives of children, using appropriate pedagogy to facilitate the development of musical <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly important. Similarly, issues around developing inappropriate stereotypical attitudes are now being seen as a possible barrier – preventing individuals from achieving their potential and making their contribution to society. This study explores the use of a notation software program by boys and girls in a primary school in Tokyo, Japan. Children in the study were asked to complete a musical composition using the notation package whilst observations were carried out of their process. Initial findings suggest that some significant differences occur in the way that boys and girls approach composing as an activity. An issue which in turn, can have significant impact on the way in which music teachers organize such musical activities...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between ageing and <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> an important policy issue, not {{least in the}} context of population ageing. Data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) will potentially add considerably {{to the understanding of the}} {{relationship between}} ageing and foundation skills. In particular, the fact that data from the 1994 - 1998 International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) and the 2003 - 2007 Adult Literacy and Lifeskills Survey (ALL) will be linked with PIAAC offers a unique opportunity to examine trends over time at the cohort level for a wide range of countries. Specifically, repeated measures will enable an analysis of whether there is skill gain and skill loss over the lifespan of cohorts and overtime between cohorts. This is especially important because age-skill profiles observed on the basis of a single cross-section are difficult to interpret. With this as a backdrop, this paper has sought to provide an overview of what is known about age-skill profiles and to conduct an analysis that demonstrates how trend data based on repeated cross-sectional observations of direct measures of skill at the cohort level can be used to estimate skill gain and skill loss over the lifespan and over time...|$|E
40|$|Students ’ {{ability to}} use self-regulatory {{learning}} <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly important {{with the advent of}} web-based learning. Online courses delivered through the Web require students to take more ownership over how and when learning takes place, rather than tutors and lecturers making these decisions. This {{comes at a time when}} higher education institutions have increasing pressure to develop students ’ life long learning and generic skills from both employers and funding authorities. In this paper we will investigate a conceptual framework for identifying students’ self-regulatory skills and consider a testing instrument to identify students strengths and weaknesses. The instrument can be administered online, from which a full analysis of the results is immediately returned to both student and tutor. From the 77 items used, a subset of these are selected and mapped to the six dimensions defined in the conceptual framework. The conceptual framework and associated questions related to each of the defined dimensions, provides a quick and convenient tool for assessing students’ self-regulatory skills. This mapping can help educators provide assessment and timely feedback to students at a time when there is a pronounced emphasis in higher education to provide skills and competencies that can be transferred to the workplace...|$|E
40|$|As {{the share}} of older people increases, {{there is a need}} to improve their {{well-being}} and possibilities for integration in the knowledge society. In ageing societies, learning plays a key role in addressing challenges such as increasing social and health costs, re-skilling for employment and participation, and intergenerational sharing of experience and knowledge. It is important to recognize older people as a heterogeneous group, in terms of self-confidence for learning, learning skills and interests, health and social connections, among others. In general, older people's learning motivation is related to improving their everyday lives, to keeping themselves active, to sharing their knowledge with others and to connecting with other learners. ICT can help in providing new and flexible learning opportunities, which connect older people with each other and with younger generations. For older people, learning usually takes place in informal settings rather than in formal education and it is driven by their own interests and needs rather than by formal requirements. More attention needs to be paid to developing relevant and accessible learning opportunities and more user-friendly tools adapted to older people. Supporting learner-centred learning opportunities and personal learning <b>skills</b> <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> part of lifelong learning for everybody in the knowledge society, where older people make up one group of learners and mentors, interacting and integrating with others.
