5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the lieutenant governor was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of the same party. After a 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted upon, as a <b>single</b> <b>ticket.</b> Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both the governor and lieutenant governor to four years. There is no limit to the number of terms a lieutenant governor may hold.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of Lothian Buses, {{installation}} of 30 ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. Passengers had to purchase tickets before boarding the bus, reducing dwell times, but the machines were not popular with users and were scrapped in 2011. Consideration was given to installing similar on-street ticket machines, and new, advanced machines (capable of reading smartcards and accepting credit/debit cards) were installed in early 2014 at each tram stop. The new ticket machines are the Galexio-Plus type supplied by the French-based company Parkeon. however the option to accept banknotes or give change is not available. The minimum spend for a card transaction is £3 {{which is more than}} the cost for a <b>single</b> <b>ticket.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Tyler {{wished to}} attend to his private life and family, he was soon {{occupied}} with the presidential election of 1836. He had been suggested as a vice presidential candidate since early 1835, and {{the same day the}} Virginia Democrats issued the expunging instruction, the Virginia Whigs nominated him as their candidate. The new Whig Party was not organized enough to hold a national convention and name a <b>single</b> <b>ticket</b> against Van Buren, Jackson's chosen successor. Instead, Whigs in various regions put forth their own preferred tickets, reflecting the party's tenuous coalition: the Massachusetts Whigs nominated Daniel Webster and Francis Granger, the Anti-Masons of the Northern and border states backed William Henry Harrison and Granger, and the states' rights advocates of the middle and lower South nominated Hugh Lawson White and John Tyler. In Maryland, the Whig ticket was Harrison and Tyler and in South Carolina it was Willie P. Mangum and Tyler. The Whigs wanted to deny Van Buren a majority in the Electoral College, throwing the election into the House of Representatives, where deals could be made. Tyler hoped electors would be unable to elect a vice president, and that he {{would be one of the}} top two vote-getters, from whom the Senate, under the Twelfth Amendment, must choose.|$|E

25|$|SL has {{a common}} ticket {{system in the}} entire Stockholm County, which allows for easy travel between {{different}} modes of transport. The tickets are of two main types, <b>single</b> <b>ticket</b> and travel cards, both allowing for unlimited travel with SL in the entire Stockholm County {{for the duration of}} the ticket validity. On 1 April 2007, a zone system (A, B, C) and price system was introduced. Single tickets were available in forms of cash ticket, individual unit pre-paid tickets, pre-paid ticket slips of 8, sms-ticket and machine ticket. Cash tickets bought at the point of travel were the most expensive and pre-paid tickets slips of 8 are the cheapest. A <b>single</b> <b>ticket</b> is valid for 75 minutes. The duration of the travel card validity depended on the exact type; they were available from 24 hours up to a year. A 30-day card costs 790SEK (83EUR; 130USD). Tickets of all these types were available with reduced prices for students and persons under 20 and over 65 years of age. On 9 January 2017, the zone system was removed, and the cost of the tickets was increased.|$|E

25|$|The {{transport}} system uses the proof-of-payment approach for fare collection for the metro, local trains, trams and ferries. In the buses the driver checks the tickets as passenger step in. Ticket controllers check tickets on randomly selected vehicles and a penalty fee of 80 EUR and {{a price of}} a <b>single</b> <b>ticket</b> is charged from any passenger without a valid ticket. If a passenger has forgotten his/her Travel Card with valid travel period, the passenger may later visit a service point of the transport company and {{will not have to}} pay the penalty fee.|$|E

25|$|Quinn won the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor in March 2002, and subsequently won {{the general election}} on the Democratic ticket alongside gubernatorial nominee, Rod Blagojevich. In Illinois, candidates for Lieutenant Governor and Governor at that time ran in separate primary elections, but were conjoined as a <b>single</b> <b>ticket</b> for the general election. This same ticket won re-election in 2006, where Quinn was unopposed in the primary. While Lieutenant Governor, according to his official biography, his priorities were consumer advocacy, environmental protection, health care, broadband deployment, and veterans' affairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} branch {{is headed by}} the governor who serves as both head of state and head of government. The lieutenant governor {{may or may not}} have executive authority depending on whether the person is a member of the Governor's cabinet. Under the current Kentucky Constitution, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor only if the governor is incapacitated. (Before 1992 the lieutenant governor assumed power any time the governor was out of the state.) The governor and lieutenant governor usually run on a <b>single</b> <b>ticket</b> (also per a 1992 constitutional amendment), and are elected to four-year terms. The current governor is Republican Matt Bevin, and the lieutenant governor is Jenean Hampton.|$|E
25|$|The {{ticketing}} scheme on the Metro {{is consistent}} with other forms of transport inside the city of Helsinki, managed by the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) agency. The HSL travel card (matkakortti) is {{the most commonly used}} ticket, which can be paid either per journey or for a period of two weeks to one year. The metro lies entirely within the Helsinki zone. Single tickets can be bought from ticket machines at the stations or by SMS.

Multi-storey park & ride facilities are provided at Lat Phrao and Thailand Cultural Centre.

The turnstiles accept cards or tokens, both available from a manned booth or automated ticket machines.|$|E
25|$|The metro {{was finally}} {{opened to the}} public on February 4, 2006, after a 45-day delay. It {{operated}} on a shorter stretch (XVIII Dicembre (Porta Susa) to Fermi – 11 stations) than originally forecast; it finally reached the main railway station (Porta Nuova) {{and the rest of the}} city centre more than one year after the Games, in October 2007. For the duration of the Games, a <b>single</b> <b>ticket</b> (5 euros) covered use of both the metro and other means of public transportation for a whole day. However, during the Games, metro service stopped at 6:00pm, making it impractical for spectators of evening events. Furthermore, the metro did not reach any of the Olympic venues. On the other hand, the bus service was heavily improved for the Games, although still inadequate at night hours.|$|E

Despite this, by the end of the day millions had learned of Vysotsky's death. On 28 July, he lay in state at the Taganka Theatre. After a mourning ceremony involving an unauthorized mass gathering of unprecedented scale, Vysotsky was buried at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. The attendance at the Olympic events dropped noticeably on that day, as scores of spectators left to attend the funeral.
