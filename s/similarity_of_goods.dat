5000|$|In its judgment, the Supreme Court {{considered}} the tests applied by courts in England, Australia and the United States regarding the deceptive <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> The Court {{also referred to}} a passage in Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names and ruled that, [...] "the goods are expensive and not of a kind usually selected without deliberation and the customers are generally educated persons which are all matters to be considered". It also held that [...] "where the class of buyers is educated and rich, the test to be applied is different where the product would be purchased by the villagers, the illiterate and the poor". The Court reached {{the conclusion that the}} trademark concerned a class of buyers who were expected to know the value of money, the quality and content of Scotch whisky and the difference in the process of manufacture, the place of manufacture and their origin. The judgement also stated that [...] "the Trademark Registrar as well as the high court failed to apply the consumer's knowledge test to the issue and hence arrived at a wrong conclusion". The SWA described the Supreme Court verdict as [...] "inexplicable". The SWA petition seeking a review of the judgment was dismissed by the Supreme Court in February 2009.|$|E

An identification with the Gnbtyw people bringing aromatic goods to Egypt after Thutmoses III’s campaign to Syria in the mid 15th century BC has recently been proposed (Storck, 2005). If the newly proposed identification of Ganibatum with Gnbtyw finds acceptance, then the people/place of Ganibatum certainly moved after the destruction of Mari and the decline of Dur Yahdun Lim, perhaps to be connected with Galabatha near the confluence of the Balih and Euphrates (Burke, 1961).|$|R

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that developing valid animal models {{is essential for}} the research on the neuro-biological mechanisms of (and treatments for) psychiatric disorders, even when these are as com-plex as schizophrenia.

The complexity of symptoms (positive, negative and cognitive) of schizo-phrenia makes it a very difficult task for a model to mimic all the main features of the disorder, but some rodent (mouse and rat) models have behavioural and even neurobiological phenotype characteristics resembling positive-like symptoms, cognitive symptoms and some neurochemical features of schizophrenia. As several recent works have already reviewed the main behavioural and developmental models, as well as the most used drug-induced, lesion-induced and genetic mouse models, the present review focuses on describing the most relevant genetically-based rat models of schizophrenia-relevant symptoms.
