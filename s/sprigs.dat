5|$|To create Edward's scissor hands, Burton {{employed}} Stan Winston, {{who would}} later design the Penguin's prosthetic makeup in Batman Returns. Depp's wardrobe and prosthetic makeup took one hour and 45 minutes to apply. The giant topiaries that Edward creates in the film were made by wrapping metal skeletons in chicken wire, then weaving in thousands of small plastic plant <b>sprigs.</b> Rick Heinrichs worked {{as one of the}} art directors.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush <b>sprigs</b> of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E

25|$|Use of (inedible) tree {{leaves and}} {{branches}} as decor is also characteristic of Japanese cuisine. Maple leaves are often floated on water to exude coolness or , <b>sprigs</b> of nandina are popularly used. The haran (Aspidistra) and sasa bamboo leaves were often cut into shapes, and placed underneath or used as separators.|$|E
25|$|The press {{appeared}} to seize upon any point {{that could be}} sensationalised. For example, {{it was reported that}} Lindy Chamberlain dressed her baby in a black dress. This provoked negative opinion, despite the trends of the early 1980s, during which black and navy cotton girls' dresses were in fashion, often trimmed with brightly coloured ribbon, or printed with brightly coloured <b>sprigs</b> of flowers.|$|E
25|$|The Fox Hunt {{was painted}} in Homer's studio at Prouts Neck, Maine {{during the winter}} of 1893.

5000|$|In Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life, Bruce Ross {{evaluates the}} Impressionists' effect on van Gogh's work, [...] "Van Gogh's bright <b>Sprig</b> of Flowering Almond in a Glass embodies these streams* while {{exploring}} Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off <b>sprig</b> {{is set in}} a simple glass. The <b>sprig</b> is highlighted by a red line along the beige wall and lavish empty space. There is no formal decorative intent. Van Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a <b>sprig</b> in the upper left as if a symbol of hope. Van Gogh has transformed the still life with the help of these values. He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on life and possibility. His use of bright color reflects this. There is an individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a <b>sprig</b> of almond buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of flower arrangement, ikebana, in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as well as in its formal use of empty space." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} won by <b>Sprig,</b> the 8/1 {{favourite}} ridden by jockey Ted Leader. Leader's father, Tom, trained the winner.

25|$|Today, {{women may}} dine at a {{restaurant}} or gather in a pub in the evening. They may also receive gifts from children, grandchildren or other family members on this day. Other Epiphany customs, which symbolize {{the end of the}} Christmas season, are popular in Ireland, such as the burning the <b>sprigs</b> of Christmas holly in the fireplace which have been used as decorations during the past twelve days.|$|E
25|$|Until {{as late as}} 1939, {{women in}} the ceramic {{industry}} in Britain were mostly confined to decorating, since they were thought to have special aptitude for repetitive detailed work. The trades' unions did what they could to handicap women even in these occupations, for example refusing {{to allow them to}} use hand rests. Often the women were used for subordinate tasks such as filling in outlines or adding decorative <b>sprigs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} elder daughter's marriage, Michael Middleton {{was granted a}} coat of arms {{featuring}} three acorn <b>sprigs,</b> {{one for each of}} his children. The oak represents England and strength as well as the family's home district of West Berkshire. The white chevronels symbolise peaks and mountains, said to represent the family's love of the Lake District and skiing, and the gold chevron represents Carole Middleton's maiden name of Goldsmith.|$|E

25|$|The sacred plant haoma and {{the drink}} made from it. The {{preparation}} of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. <b>Sprigs</b> of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.|$|E
25|$|Many {{prominent}} Victorians {{were involved}} in La Trobe's establishment process, {{and there was a}} strong belief {{that it was important to}} increase research and learning in Victoria. One of the major individuals involved was Davis McCaughey, who later became Governor of Victoria. The university was named after Charles Joseph La Trobe, the first Governor of Victoria, and the university motto, 'whoever seeks shall find', is adapted from Charles La Trobe's family motto. The La Trobe University Coat of Arms incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, the Australian wedge-tailed eagle to represent Australia, and <b>sprigs</b> of heath to represent Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Typical modern dawn {{services}} {{follow a}} pattern that is now familiar to generations of Australians, containing the following features: introduction, hymn, prayer, an address, laying of wreaths, recitation, the playing of the Last Post, a minute of silence, Reveille, and the playing of both the New Zealand and Australian national anthems. At the Australian War Memorial, following {{events such as the}} Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services, families often place artificial red poppies beside the names of relatives on the Memorial's Roll of Honour. In Australia, <b>sprigs</b> of rosemary are often worn on lapels and in New Zealand poppies have taken on this role.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, Biyani co-founded <b>Sprig,</b> a food {{delivery}} service {{which has}} raised $1.2 million in seed funding from Battery Ventures and notable angel investors such as Andrew McCollum, co-founder of Facebook, and Justin Waldron, co-founder of Zynga. He {{got the idea}} while working at Lyft, when a friend suggested he applied the model to food. He left Lyft in April 2013 to execute the idea. The startup allows users to order a balanced meal, which is then prepared in <b>Sprig’s</b> industrial kitchen and get it delivered in 15-20 minutes. <b>Sprig's</b> chef is Nate Keller, Google’s former executive chef.|$|R
25|$|Upon the {{escutcheon}} (shield), {{there are}} three main features: the heath, the escallop shells and the book. The heath refers to the common heath (epacris impressa), which is the floral emblem of the State of Victoria, a highly relevant symbol being Victoria's third university. In a sense, it also reflects the university's attempts to cater to all Victorians, particularly regional Victorians, {{which at the time}} had felt excluded by the establishment of metropolitan-centred universities. The blue ribbon serves a decorative purpose in tying both <b>sprigs</b> of heath together to form a chaplet. The chaplet itself is a seemingly unintended reference to the State, as it traditionally represented victory (and hence, Victoria).|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, {{spaghetti}} {{is often}} {{served with a}} distinct, slightly sweet yet flavourful meat sauce (the base {{of which would be}} tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork and diced hot dogs and ham. It is spiced with some soy sauce, heavy quantities of garlic, dried oregano <b>sprigs</b> and sometimes with dried bay leaf, and afterwards topped with grated cheese. Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|E
25|$|Information: Preparations {{for seeing}} {{in the new year}} were {{originally}} undertaken to greet the toshigami, or deity of the incoming year. These begin on December 13, when the house was given a thorough cleaning; the date is usually nearer {{the end of the month}} now. The house is then decorated in the traditional fashion: A sacred rope of straw (shimenawa) with dangling white paper strips (shide) is hung over the front door to prevent evil spirits from entering and to show the presence of the toshigami. It is also customary to place kadomatsu, an arrangement of tree <b>sprigs,</b> beside the entrance way. A special altar, known as toshidana ("year shelf"), is piled high with kagamimochi (flat, round rice cakes), sake (rice wine), persimmons, and other foods in honor of the toshigami. A fair is traditionally held in late December at shrines, temples or in local neighborhoods. This is in preparation for the new year holidays. Decorations and sundry goods are sold at the fair. Originally these year-end fairs provided opportunities for farmers, fisherfolk and mountain dwellers to exchange goods and buy clothes and other necessities for the coming year.|$|E
