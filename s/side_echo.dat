40|$|Abstract Seismic {{soundings}} of Lake Vostok {{have been}} performed by the Polar Marine Geological Research Expedition {{in collaboration with the}} Russian Antarctic Expedition since the early 1990 s. The seismograms recorded show at least two relatively closely spaced reflections associated with the lake bottom. These were initially interpreted as boundaries of a layer of unconsolidated sediments {{at the bottom of the}} lake. A more recent interpretation suggests that the observed reflections are <b>side</b> <b>echoes</b> from the rough lake bottom, and that there are no unconsolidated sediments at the bottom of the lake. The major goal of this paper is to reveal the nature of those reflections by testing three hypotheses of their origin. The results show that some of the reflections, but not all of them, are consistent with the hypothesis of a non-flat lake bottom along the source-receiver line (2 D case). The reflections were also evaluated as <b>side</b> <b>echoes</b> from an adjacent sloping interface, but these tests implied unreasonably steep slopes (at least 8 degrees) at the lake bottom. The hypothesis that is the most compatible with seismic data is the presence of a widespread layer of unconsolidated sediments at the bottom of Lake Vostok. The modeling suggests the presence of a two hundred meter thick sedimentary layer with a seismic velocity of 1700 - 1900 m/sec in the southern and middle parts of the lake. Th...|$|R

50|$|In the English Civil War (1642-1649) Buckinghamshire {{was mostly}} Parliamentarian, {{although}} some pockets of Royalism did exist. The Parliamentarian John Hampden was from Buckinghamshire, known particularly for his significant and successful battle tactics at Aylesbury in 1642. Some villages {{to the west}} of the county (Brill and Boarstall for example) were under constant conflict for the duration of the war, given their equidistance between Parliamentarian Aylesbury and Royalist Oxford. Many of these places were effectively wiped off the map in the conflict, but were later rebuilt. In the north of the county, Stony Stratford was Royalist and Newport Pagnell was Parliamentarian: the line of control between the <b>sides</b> <b>echoed</b> the Danegeld 700 years earlier.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. IE-SASW method which {{combines}} two nondestructive testing techniques {{can be applied}} to detect the flaws and the thickness of concrete structures. In this method, IE method is used for the detailed nondestructive evaluation of concrete structure and Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) method is employed for the measurement of the average P-wave velocity of whole thickness. The signal received by the transducer in the IE test consists in a sum of the direct surface wave and <b>side</b> <b>echoes,</b> the bottom or defect echo (target echo), and the background noise. In the FFT based frequency domain analysis, sometimes, it is difficult and not straightforward to extract the information on the target echo. The time-frequency analysis can provide the temporal variation in frequency components of the signal and thereby has advantages in the analysis of IE signal. In this paper, time-frequency analysis based on short-time Fourier transform is presented to improve the interpretation of IE signal. Experimental studies were performed in the concrete model slab in which poor concrete was included at known location. Test results obtained by time-frequency analysis are compared to the conventional IE results and the advantages of using the proposed method were verified...|$|R

40|$|Transoesophageal {{cross-sectional}} echocardiography {{has special}} advantages when investigating the interatrial septum which is imaged perpendicularly without echo dropouts from an oesophageal transducer position. The technique was successfully used in 19 out of 20 patients (95 %) with an ostium secundum atrial septal defect and in 30 control subjects. In {{all of the}} latter the interatrial septum was visualised as a continuous echo structure separating the atria, whereas a distinct discontinuity representing the septal defect was apparent in all patients with atrial septal defect. Echocardiographic measurement of the defect size correlated well with surgical findings in 11 patients who underwent open heart surgery {{in the course of}} this study. In a comparative transthoracic examination, adequate recordings were obtained in 18 of the 20 patients and in 26 of the 30 control subjects. Direct subcostal visualisation of the defect was reliable in 10 of 18 patients. Peripheral venous contrast studies were also performed with the transoesophageal as well as the transthoracic technique. Echo contrast remained confined to the right heart in the control subjects. Left sided contrast appearance diagnostic of an interatrial communication was shown in the patients using the transoesophageal technique (100 % sensitivity), with an additional right atrial negative contrast apparent in seven patients. The transthoracic approach, on the other hand, showed left <b>sided</b> <b>echo</b> contrast in 14 of 18 patients and an additional negative contrast effect in two of the 14. It is concluded that transoesophageal is superior to transthoracic cross-sectional echocardiography as a highly sensitive method for the detection and evaluation of ostium secundum atrial septal defects...|$|R

A numerical model of realistic topography of the Martian surface, based on Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data, is developed. A specially developed computer routine for evaluation of wideband radar echoes reflected from rough surfaces, capable of aperture synthesis simulation, is described. A synthetic radargram for a portion of Mars Express (MEX) orbit 9466 is computed and validated against experimental data obtained by the MARSIS radar instrument. Finally, a previously developed ionospheric phase correction procedure is numerically tested with new simulated echo signals. Impact of the surface clutter on the ionospheric correction procedure is investigated with a direct numerical comparison to a known benchmark result, which shows robustness of the correction algorithm with respect to the surface clutter.

40|$|Abstract: The speech inverse problem {{focuses on}} {{retrieving}} the best articulatory vectors {{for the task}} of synthesizing a target voice signal. In this research the problem is approached from a neuromotor level, and by means of some machine learning techniques. Specifically, speech articulators are represented on the midsagittal plane, and controlled by muscular activations grouped in the articulatory vector. The movement of the tongue, by effect of muscular contraction, is derived from a TSK Fuzzy Inference System. On its <b>side,</b> an <b>Echo</b> State Network is used to model the glottal airflow. Later, Continuous Genetic Algorithms evolve populations of articulatory configurations in order to approximate acoustic features of target spanish vowels, and of consonants /m/, /n/, /f / and /s/. The recovered midsagittal configurations along with subjective tests performed {{by a group of}} evaluators, positively verify the effectiveness of these techniques.

50|$|The {{wings of}} Clermont are very {{different}} from those of other châteaux from the same period of the 17th century. Up until 1624, wings were designed to be of the same or very similar height to that of the main house, so the courtyard was enclosed on three <b>sides,</b> an <b>echo</b> of the former defensive role of castles. The Rocher-Portail, near Fougères, is a rare intact example of this kind of architecture. Clermont {{is one of the last}} châteaux to have wings attached to the central building in this fashion. They are, however, smaller, lower and have an Italian influence, natural enough at a time when many French architects were studying in Rome and Venice. Clermont was completed just before 1650, the year when, following the trend started by the builders of Vaux-le-Vicomte and François Mansart at the Château de Beaumesnil, the central bodies of the majority of new castles started to be built separated from the wings.|$|R
