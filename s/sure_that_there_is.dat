5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and {{those who can afford}} it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E

[...] Fortunately, D algorithms that are time-efficient often have relatively small recursion depth. [...] For example, the quicksort algorithm {{can be implemented}} so that it never requires more than [...] nested recursive calls to [...] sort [...] items.|$|E
2500|$|Jamsetji's {{plan for}} the city was clear. He envisioned {{far more than a}} mere row of workers hutments. He insisted upon {{building}} all the comforts and conveniences a city could provide. As a result, many areas in the city are well planned and there are public leisure places such as the Jubilee Park. While building the city, Jamsetji Tata had said, [...] "Be sure to lay wide streets planted with shady trees, every other of a quick-growing variety. Be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> plenty of space for lawns and gardens; reserve large areas for football, hockey and parks; earmark areas for Hindu temples, Muslim mosques and Christian churches." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Cantor's {{theory was}} {{controversial}} among mathematicians and (later) philosophers. As Leopold Kronecker claimed: [...] "I don't know what predominates in Cantor's theory – philosophy or theology, but I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no mathematics there". Many mathematicians agreed with Kronecker that the completed infinite {{may be part}} of philosophy or theology, but that it has no proper place in mathematics. Logician [...] has commented on the energy devoted to refuting this [...] "harmless little argument" [...] (i.e. Cantor's diagonal argument) asking, [...] "what had it done to anyone to make them angry with it?" [...] Others have also taken issue with Cantor's proof regarding the cardinality of the power set. Mathematician Solomon Feferman has referred to Cantor's theories as “simply not relevant to everyday mathematics.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Durdles the gravedigger, however, disagrees; he {{witnessed}} {{the crime and}} knows who truly killed Edwin Drood. Depending on the audience's vote, the finger is pointed at Bazzard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa or Durdles. The murderer confesses, then sings a reprise of one of several numbers, beginning with [...] "A Man Could Go Quite Mad", to admit his or her culpability; the gist {{of each of these}} songs is that the character who killed Drood was seeking to kill Jasper, not Drood, for his or her own purpose- Puffer to protect Rosa, Rosa to save herself, Helena to get revenge on Jasper for ruining her twin's chance at a new beginning, Bazzard to bring himself into the limelight, Neville because he wanted Rosa for himself, and Crisparkle because he killed Rosa's mother out of jealousy and religious mania and wanted to protect both Rosa and Neville from Jasper's evil. However, because of the storm, Jasper had walked with Drood {{for a while and then}} given him his coat to wear for the journey home, so the murderer, because of the laudanum in the wine and the foul night weather, mistook Drood for Jasper. (Durdles lacks this motivation, however, so his confession is simply that, in his drunkenness, he mistook Drood for a ghost.) If, although not likely, the audience chooses Jasper as the murderer, Durdles does not interrupt and a second confession is not performed (Some theaters will not count Jasper votes, to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a twist).|$|E
