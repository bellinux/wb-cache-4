5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the <b>statute,</b> and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object.

As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the <b>statute.</b> The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the <b>statute</b> will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|On 22 December 2010, a {{week after}} the ICC Prosecutor {{announced}} the individuals he was seeking to prosecute, the Kenyan National Assembly passed a motion seeking to withdraw Kenya as a State Party to the Rome <b>Statute,</b> the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. The motion, which was introduced by Assembly Member Isaac Ruto had previously been thrown out of the National Assembly by Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim who ruled it was unconstitutional; however an amended version was introduced the following day and passed. During the debate, the Minister for Energy Kiraitu Murungi claimed the ICC was a colonialist, imperialist court. This motion did not itself affect Kenya's status as a State Party to the Rome <b>Statute,</b> but rather obliges ministers to move to repeal Kenya's International Crimes Act which ratified the Rome <b>Statute</b> and made necessarily changes to Kenyan's criminal code. In February 2011, Kenya appealed to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to defer the trials at The Hague. Some critics in Kenya have also questioned the constitutionality of the Rome <b>Statute,</b> arguing that it is incompatible with the Constitution of Kenya, which was passed by a referendum in 2010.|$|E
