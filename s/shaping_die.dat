40|$|A new {{technique}} is described for growth of large-area silicon ribbons. This technique is an edge-defined, film-fed growth {{process by which}} single crystals can be grown having a shape controlled by the outside dimensions of a <b>shaping</b> <b>die,</b> growth taking place from an extremely thin film of liquid fed by capillary action from a crucible below. The material from which the die is fabricated is very critical to the process. The die must be wet by the silicon, but adverse impurities must not be introduced into the silicon, and the die must not become degraded by the molten silicon. A breakthrough in die fabrication that has allowed the growth of silicon ribbons having dimensions of 1 cm by 30 cm with a thickness of 0. 7 mm is described.

The principal problem to be overcome in the application of this process to the growth of thick film silicon ribbon relates to the material, such as the <b>shaping</b> <b>die.</b> For the method to operate, this die material must be wet by the liquid silicon. To preserve semiconductor quality, the liquid silicon must not react significantly with the die material. The most promising die material for this application appears to be SiC and SiC-SiO 2 admixture. In this case good wetting occurs between the molten silicon and the SiC.

40|$|The {{question}} why Arnold Schoenberg {{did not complete}} his oratorio Die Jakobsleiter according to his initial plan, but instead decided to set to music only the text from {{the first part of}} the work and to compose the Great symphonic interlude, is still unanswered today and is quite worthy of continuing scholarly attention. In this article the authors argue that Schoenberg's religious beliefs played a central role in both creating and (re) <b>shaping</b> <b>Die</b> Jakobsleiter. In other words, Schoenberg's post-war decision to abandon the plan to compose music for the second part of the oratorio (i. e. for the rest of the libretto published in 1917), was a direct outcome of the transition of his Weltanschauung from unorthodox theosophy and open-minded cosmopolitanism towards more earthly oriented and nationally uncompromising Judaism. According to these new beliefs, Schoenberg conceived the Great symphonic interlude as a real denial of all human endeavors to reach transcendence and as an epitaph for the romantic 'infinite urge', which so passionately inspired composers from the previous epoch. By doing this Schoenberg abandoned the tradition of musical romanticism, as well as his own 'free' atonal project, which was counterpart to his former beliefs and which in different conditions, was found to be 'heretical' according to the newly revealed Law of Dodecaphony...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation is to determine extrusion <b>die</b> <b>shapes,</b> which minimize distortion during axisymmetric and 3 D extrusion. An axisymmetric upper bound model with a flexible <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is developed in a spherical coordinate system. The flexible streamlined <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is described by a Legendre polynomial series, where the higher order coefficients are selected based upon optimization. Four criteria to minimize distortion {{are used in the}} upper bound model to determine optimal <b>die</b> <b>shapes.</b> Analysis of the optimal <b>die</b> <b>shapes</b> with FEM confirms two robust criteria: average effective strain and volumetric effective strain rate deviation. ^ When average effective strain is minimized with the axisymmetric upper bound model, <b>die</b> <b>shapes</b> are obtained which minimize the average effective strain in the extrudate, but do not minimize distortion. When volumetric effective strain rate deviation is minimized with the upper bound model, <b>die</b> <b>shapes</b> are obtained which minimize the deviation of the effective strain rate distribution in the deformation zone. Such a die is called a controlled strain rate die. The axisymmetric results show that minimizing the volumetric effective strain rate deviation produces controlled strain rate <b>die</b> <b>shapes,</b> which form product with minimum distortion. ^ The axisymmetric upper bound model in spherical coordinates is extended to the 3 D extrusion from round to square and round to rectangle and is used to obtain <b>die</b> <b>shapes</b> which produce minimum distortion in the extrudate by minimizing the volumetric effective strain rate deviation. The 3 D streamlined <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is characterized by a Legendre polynomial series where the higher order coefficients are either constants or functions of the rotational coordinate, 2 ̆ 6 phiv;. FEM is used to compare the average distortion along the rectangle symmetry planes for two optimal <b>die</b> <b>shapes.</b> ^ When the optimal <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is described by the Legendre coefficients as function of 2 ̆ 6 phiv;, the difference in the average distortion between the symmetry planes decreases. Such a <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> causes material in the deformation zone to speed up or slow down, creating a more uniform distortion distribution in the finished product. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of {{research}} aimed at creating theoretical grounds for a new method of mandrelless small-radius tube bending (1. 5 Dr<Rg< 2. 5 Dr, where Dr - tube diameter, Rg - bending radius). As the result of applying such a methodology {{it is possible to}} carry out the bending process (with an angle of up to 180 °) and obtain an ovalization and wall thinning in the bending area, which are much smaller than those in currently manufactured products. The currently used bending methods and bending equipment are able to achieve a minimum bending radius not less than three times the tube outer diameter. The research hypothesis has assumed the existence of tube bending methods that are more efficient that those known so far. Than methods do not rely on circular bending contours, but instead they may use other <b>shaping</b> <b>die</b> contours which has not been explored yet. Circular benders used in practice fail in that they do not yield the expected results on small radii and do not control the material flow (do not ensure its correct behaviour) in the bending zone. The literature review has shown that there are currently no theoretical studies, numerical analyses and experimental verifications related to the processes of mandrelless tube bending on small radii, i. e. for 1. 5 D≤R≥ 2. 5 D, where: (R - bending radius, D - tube outer diameter) up to an angle of 180 °. Due to the lack of studies on this subject, in their approach to the numerical modelling of the problem, the authors of the paper were guided by their own experience in this field and made every effort to make the numerical model reflect the actual process as accurately as possible. They were only aided by the general knowledge accumulated in the literature on numerical modelling. To sum up, the purpose of the publication is to demonstrate that the change in the die recess towards a shape resembling an ellipse results in a change in the characteristics of metal flow (movement) along the tube perimeter and in a change in the stress characteristics and, as a consequence, a change in the tube cross-section in the bending zone. The research discussed in this paper seeks to establish the correct flow of material in the tube cross-section in the bending zone by determining the most efficient bender recess shape and friction surface forming, which will eliminate the excessive ovalization and upper wall thinning. The expected effect of implementing this bending technology will be increasing the flow capacity in energy systems, which will directly translate into a reduction of atmospheric CO emissions due to the lower energy consumption. In addition, the paper has presented the concepts of tools intended for the experimental verification of tube bending process...|$|E
40|$|Load-adapted local {{reinforcements}} {{are used}} in the automotive industry in terms of lightweight construction and improvement of properties of mechanically loaded components. This can be done by the conventional way of separately formed reinforcement parts that are joined during the assembly process, or in the modern form of tailored products. In this report the research results of joining local reinforcements during the process of hydroforming are shown. Thereby, component and reinforcement are joined by a form lock in the hydroforming process, that ensures handling stability from the removal out of the <b>shaping</b> <b>die</b> until the end of curing of the previously applied adhesive on the reinforcement. This joining method is challenged to work within the circumstances of the hydroforming process, the requirements of a combined process and the potential of the adhesives. Major design criteria are the shaping of the form-locked joint and design of the adhesive bond. The demand on the form-locked joint is, to ensure handling stability until the adhesive layer has completely cured. When designing the form elements it is necessary to find a compromise between the maximum possible clamping of the parts {{on the one hand and}} minimal influence on the thickness profile of the hydroforming part on the other hand. By comparing different design alternatives in experiment and simulation it was determined that a sufficient handling stability is achieved best by using existing undercuts in the hydroforming profile by an embracing reinforcement and combining this undercut advantageously with an additional form element in the profile. To determine the best possible adhesive bond, the properties of several adhesives were tested and compared and also different adhesive systems were evaluated in terms of their process capability. An adhesive was supposed to be found, that can be applied previously, is compatible to hydroforming and contamination and achieves maximum strength in the cured state. In addition, the adhesive has to fill a diverging gap between reinforcement and hydroforming part. In this research project none of the adhesives available on the market could meet all general requirements. The research institutes see great potential in a development of pre-applicable melting adhesives towards greater flexibility and formability. Due to the experiments and testing of component properties, the feasibility of the method was successfully demonstrated. The reinforcement and the hydroforming part can be joined without adapting the hydroforming process and the handling stability of the reinforcement is given by the form-lock, generated in the hydroforming process. To create an adhesive bond, pre-applicable adhesives can be used advantageously. The locally reinforced hydroformed components show a significant increase in load capacity in the 3 -point bending test. In the fatigue test with local tension loads on the reinforced area of the component, an improvement of life expectancy was detected. In the crash test, local reinforcements also contribute to an improvement of the component behaviour. The risk of corrosion is minimized when the adhesive layer is optimal developed, resulting in passing the corrosion test after the EDP coating of the parts...|$|E
