25|$|Parākramabāhu's constructions work {{made up a}} {{significant}} chunk of the material history of Sri Lanka. Much of the remnants of Polonnaruwa date from his reign, as well as sites in western and south-eastern Sri Lanka. One of Parākramabāhu's first projects was the restoration of Anuradhapura, the ancient capital of Sri Lankan Kings which had been utterly destroyed by the Chola army, including the restoration of Thuparamaya (which had been lost to the jungle), Mihintale, and Ruwanwelisaya. Then, having founded an administrative center called Parakramapura, {{he turned his attention}} on Polonnaruwa. Unsurprisingly, due to the near-yearly sieges, the city had suffered and had reached a state that nothing but its name remained. It is perhaps because of this that <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> pre-12th century Polonnaruwa remains today.|$|E
25|$|Into the 2000s, {{the school}} came under {{criticism}} {{for keeping the}} entirety of the increasingly taxed Norval property while <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> it was actually used; this argument has gained increased credence in light of the consistent yearly tuition hikes and mounting legal costs. Despite repeated assertions that the college had no intention of selling the property, citing not only rapidly increasing land value, but also an intention to hold it in order to prevent industrial development on land that contains a variety of wildlife, including spotted deer and hares, UCC sold {{a small portion of the}} acreage in 2007 to help cover costs related to the 2003 class action lawsuit brought against the school by former students. In 2011, the Norval Long-Range Planning Committee recommended that Norval's facilities should be expanded to allow for more overnight students and co-educational use.|$|E

500|$|Noting the {{large-scale}} Mexican {{immigration to the}} Southwestern United States, Kennan said in 2002 there were [...] "unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand", and those of [...] "some northern regions". In the former, [...] "the very culture of {{the bulk of the}} population of these regions will tend to be primarily Latin-American in nature rather than what is inherited from earlier American traditions...

500|$|In 2004, Witherspoon {{starred in}} Vanity Fair, {{adapted from the}} 19th-century classic novel Vanity Fair and {{directed}} by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming {{she was pregnant with}} her second child. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: [...] "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with", she said. The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness." [...] At the same time, The Charlotte Observer called her work [...] "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" [...] and the Los Angeles Times concluded that Becky is [...] "a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play". However, LA Weekly wrote [...] " [...] ends up conveying <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> what’s at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair" [...] and states that it may have to do with Witherspoon's vanity, [...] "with an Oscar-less young star’s need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the “real” Becky Sharp.". Others have stated she was miscast.|$|E
500|$|The Kinetoscope {{was also}} gaining notice {{on the other}} side of the Atlantic. In the summer of 1894, it was {{demonstrated}} at 20, boulevard Poissonnière in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the Lumière brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie projection system. On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London. Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, claims that Edison [...] "apparently thought <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright [...]" [...] As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison [...] "balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents" [...] and [...] "saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope." [...] Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer Robert W. Paul to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades–Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology. Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the Black Maria to realize Edison's goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{recently}} discovered dark energy and its implication on the cosmological constant, Leonard Susskind says [...] "The great mystery is not {{why there is}} dark energy.

[...] A slightly larger quantity of dark energy, or a slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused space to expand rapidly enough that galaxies would not form. Despite this, Susskind does not necessarily see the universe as being fine-tuned, suggesting that some parts of the [...] "megaverse" [...] in which we live might just, by chance, be suitable for the emergence of life, while other parts might not be.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of the two operas turned Schubert's attention more firmly than ever {{in the direction of}} the stage, where, for a variety of reasons, he was almost completely unsuccessful. All in all, he embarked on twenty stage projects, each of them failures which were quickly forgotten. In 1822, Alfonso und Estrella was refused, partly owing to its libretto. Fierrabras (D 796) was rejected in the fall of 1823, but this was largely due to the popularity of Rossini and the Italian operatic style, and the failure of Carl Maria von Weber's Euryanthe. Die Verschworenen (The Conspirators, D 787) was prohibited by the censor (apparently on the grounds of its title), and Rosamunde, Fürstin von Zypern (D 797) was withdrawn after two nights, owing to the poor quality of the play for which Schubert had written incidental music. Of these works, the first two are written on a scale which would make their performances exceedingly difficult (Fierabras, for instance, contains over 1,000 pages of manuscript score), but Die Verschworenen is a bright attractive comedy, and Rosamunde contains some of the most charming music that Schubert ever composed. In 1822, he made the acquaintance with both Weber and Beethoven, but little came of it in either case. Beethoven is said to have acknowledged the younger man's gifts on a few occasions, but some of this is likely legend and in any case he could not have known the real scope of Schubert's music, especially not the instrumental works, as <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> it was printed or performed in the composer's lifetime. On his deathbed, Beethoven is said to have looked into some of the younger man's works and exclaimed: [...] "Truly, the spark of divine genius resides in this Schubert!", but what would have come of it, if he had recovered, we can never know.|$|E
