40|$|A {{model of}} {{analysis}} and environmental evaluation {{was applied to}} 11 stretches of the Adige River, where an innovative procedure was carried out to interpret ecological results. Within each stretch, the most suitable methods {{were used to assess}} the quality and processes of flood plains, banks, water column, bed, and interstitial environment. Indices were applied to evaluate the wild state and ecological quality of the banks (wild state index, buffer <b>strip</b> <b>index)</b> and the landscape quality of wide areas of the fluvial corridor (environmental landscape index). The biotic components (i. e., macrozoobenthos, phytoplankton and zooplankton, interstitial hyporheic fauna, vegetation in the riparian areas) were analysed by both quantitative and functional methods (as productivity, litter – processing and colonisation). The results achieved were then translated into five classes of functional evaluation. These qualitative assessments have thus preserved a high level of precision and sensitivity in quantifying both the quality of the environmental conditions and the integrity of the ecosystem processes. Read together with urban planning data, they indicate what actions are needed to restore and rehabilitate the Adige River corridor...|$|E

Egg output, the reagent <b>strip</b> <b>index</b> (RSI, a pathological marker), and circulating anodic antigen (CAA) and circulating ca-thodic antigen (CCA) in serum and urine were quantified. At enrollment, the median level of egg output was 365 / 10 mL of urine; 97 % of children {{had a positive}} RSI; CAA was detected in serum from 76 % of children and in urine from 64 %; and CCA was detected in serum from 55 % of children and in urine from 87 %. Two months after chemotherapy, egg output and RSI had decreased significantly; reinfection later developed in parallel with increases in the serum and urine concentrations of CAA and the urine concentrations of CCA. The measurement of CAA and CCA is useful for diagnosis, evaluation of disease severity, and follow-up of chemotherapy in individuals infected with S. haematobium.

The application of gap-coupled capacitive feeding mechanism for achieving UWB with microstrip antenna has also been proposed [...] The proposed antenna is capable of operating over a bandwidth (6. 4 GHz- 10. 4 GHz) as allocated by FCC (Federal Communications Commission), suited for an UWB (Ultra-Wideband) application. Although coaxial probe feed is one of the most popularly used feeding mechanism for thick substrates, but the inductance of the probe might create an impedance mismatch, which needs to be compensated by introducing a capacitive feed <b>strip.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms- microstrip; Vector Network Analyzer (VNA); Capacitive; IE 3 D; Ultra-Wideband (UWB) fabrication of the antenna prototype were verified using vector network analyzer. II. ANTENNA DESIGN A. Gap Coupled capacitive feed mechanism: The electromagnetically gap- coupled capacitive feed strip is represented by the equivalent circuit as shown in fig. 1. This feeding mechanism provides compensation for the increased feed inductance. The effect of direct radiation from the open end of the microstrip line can be represented by a conductance across the shunt capacitor. In such kind of antenna configuration, the radiation pattern becomes asymmetric due to capacitive loading. The radiation pattern can also be rotated electronically, by varying capacitive loading. This facility can be made use of to reduce the multipath fading in urban mobile communication when the antenna is mounted on a vehicle. E I...|$|E

50|$|The PowerVR chipset uses {{a method}} of 3D {{rendering}} known as tile-based deferred rendering (often abbreviated as TBDR) which is tile-based rendering combined with PowerVR's proprietary method of Hidden Surface Removal (HSR) and Hierarchical Scheduling Technology (HST). As the polygon generating program feeds triangles to the PowerVR (driver), it stores them in memory in a triangle <b>strip</b> or an <b>indexed</b> format. Unlike other architectures, polygon rendering is (usually) not performed until all polygon information has been collated for the current frame. Furthermore, the expensive operations of texturing and shading of pixels (or fragments) is delayed, whenever possible, until the visible surface at a pixel is determined — hence rendering is deferred.|$|R

The number of connections and capacity utilization are fixed with due regard to the timetable of Air Greenland and the density of traffic on each route. Assumptions as to the cost per hour {{as a function of}} the duration of the flight are made for each aircraft. Applying this to different investment scenarios for airports and landing <b>strips</b> an <b>index</b> for the costs of supply of air traffic is found. Using this index the supplier’s cost savings in the scenarios are found as a percentage of the relevant sale. A number of reports from recent years have information about the necessary investments in the scenarios, and matching these with the changes in costs permits the calculation of present values for the different projects. Apart from direct savings there are derived benefits in some of the scenarios the most prominent being the possibility to abandon Kangerlussuaq. The calculations include these indirect effects. Two scenarios have high present values: the use of Keflavik as hub, and the construction of a new airport with a 3000 meter runway south of Nuuk: two rather different scenarios, the first dominated by current savings, and the second dependent on a large fixed investment.

40|$|We {{describe}} an ef cient technique for out-of-core construction and accurate view-dependent visualization of very large surface models. The method uses a regular conformal hierarchy of tetrahedra to spatially partition the model. Each tetrahedral cell contains a precomputed simplified {{version of the}} original model, represented using cache coherent <b>indexed</b> <b>strips</b> for fast rendering. The representation is constructed during a fine-to-coarse simplification of the surface contained in diamonds (sets of tetrahedral cells sharing their longest edge). The construction preprocess operates out-ofcore and parallelizes nicely. Appropriate boundary constraints are introduced in the simplification {{to ensure that all}} conforming selective subdivisions of the tetrahedron hierarchy lead to correctly matching surface patches. For each frame at runtime, the hierarchy is traversed coarse-to-fine to select diamonds of the appropriate resolution given the view parameters. The resulting system can interatively render high quality views of out-of-core models of hundreds of millions of triangles at over 40 Hz (or 70 M triangles/s) on current commodity graphics platforms...|$|R

Measurements of a range of thorn and branching parameters of eight Acacia species were used to calculate three <b>indices</b> (<b>stripping,</b> biting and branching) describing different components of Acacia structural defences. These were combined to form an overall defence index that was tested against the results of three feeding simulation tests as well as actual animal feeding rates obtained from trials using nyala held in bomas. The stripping, biting and branching indices were shown to provide a good measure of the different components of a structural defence, although the scaling of their contribution to an overall defence index is complicated by variation in the suite of browsers and the resources available at a locality.

It integrates optical biosensors for label-free biomolecular recognition based on a novel photonic structure named slot-waveguide with immobilized bimolecular receptors on its surface. The slot-waveguides provide high optical intensity in a sub wavelength-size low refractive index region (slot-region) sandwiched between two high refractive <b>index</b> <b>strips</b> (rails) [1] leading to an enhanced interaction between the optical probe and biomolecular complexes (antibody-antigen).

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Salmonberry {{community}} {{structure was}} examined in alder-dominated riparian buffer strips in the Oregon Coast Range. Salmonberry growing on slopes {{was found to}} respond differently, to both characteristics of the buffer strips and to environmental factors, than salmonberry growing on terraces. Salmonberry, as measured by total height, number of ramets or sprouting centers, cover, and estimated biomass, was found to increase with increasing light on the slopes. Salmonberry cover, height and number of ramers were all found to be greater on slopes within buffer strips, than on slopes in undisturbed riparian stands, where the adjacent stand had not been cut and no buffer created. The greater dominance of salmonberry within buffer strips was attributed to increased sidelight into the riparian area, due to the hest of the adjacent stand. None of the four salmonberry characteristics {{were found to be}} related to light on the terraces. Salmonberry height, cover, number of ramets, and biomass on terraces did, however, all increase with increasing age of the buffer strip. There {{did not appear to be}} any clear edge effect on salmonberry within the buffer <b>strips.</b> An <b>index</b> of herbaceous vegetation was developed, through ordination, to examine the effects of unquantified environmental factors on salmonberry. Disturbance appeared to play a role in the variation seen in the salmonberry population. Salmonberry's aerial stem diameter distribution, both within buffer strips and in undisturbed stands, resembled an uneven-aged distribution. Sairnonberry stem distribution followed the same pattern whether on slopes or terraces. This suggests persistent, self-replacing salmonberry stands in these alder-dominated riparian communities. Salmonberry was found to be negatively correlated with herb, vine maple, and swordfern cover, and also with herbaceous species abundance. There was no relationship between salmonberry and elderberry cover. Tree regeneration was found to be extremely sparse. Only one alder seedling per hectare was found in the undisturbed riparian stands. There were 29 seedlings per hectare found within the buffer strips, 22 of which were conifers. The four salmonberry community variables increased in response to buffer strip creation when growing on both slopes and terraces. Salmonberry was shown to have a self-replacing canopy, and to dominate other shrubs and herbs in the riparian community. These factors, along with the lack of tree regeneration in these alder-dominated riparian areas, all suggest that without silvicultural intervention salmonberry could eventually dominate the riparian community...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Genetic Algorithms (GA) {{have gained}} {{popularity}} in structural design optimization {{due to their}} proficiency to search global optimal solution. The purpose of this work was to apply GA to solve support locations of an indeterminate structure, study the effect of various penalty functions {{and the size of}} discontinuous solution space on GA’s performance and develop an algorithm to eliminate penalty functions for similar constrained problems. TEST CASE: A rectangular shaped indeterminate homogeneous plate overhung with three supports was developed. METHOD: It was mathematically formulated with “Normalized” multi-objective function and solved using a novel approach, “Discretized Method” (DM), where the solution space was divided in smaller <b>strips</b> having specific <b>index</b> numbers and GA performed on those index numbers instead of real solution space, and compared with Continuous Simple GA (CSGA). With discontinuities applied, three penalty functions (flat, linear and non-linear) were developed and size of discontinuous space was increased by 25 % and 50 %. An algorithm was developed where smaller strips were generated using Finite Element Model. Paired t-test (α= 5 %) was used and sample size was 30. RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was observed between DM and CSGA. No significant difference was observed among penalty functions and the effect of the size of discontinuous spaces was not momentous. The developed algorithm successfully eliminated the complex procedure of applying penalty function. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that DM provided better results compared to CSGA and the proposed algorithm made GA more robust and effective for a class of constrained problems by eliminating penalty functions...|$|R
40|$|P Mokhles, JSAG Schouten, HJM Beckers, CAB Webers University Eye Clinic Maastricht, Maastricht, the Netherlands Purpose: Blindness in {{glaucoma}} {{is difficult}} to assess with merely {{the use of the}} current World Health Organization (WHO) definition (a visual field restricted to 10 ° in a radius around central fixation), as this criterion does not cover other types of visual field loss that are encountered in clinical practice and also depict blindness. In this study, a 5 -point ordinal scale was developed for the assessment of common visual field defect patterns, with the purpose of comparing blindness as outcome to the findings with the WHO criterion when applied to the same visual fields. The scores with the two methods were compared between two ophthalmologists. In addition, the variability between these assessors in assessing the different visual field types was determined. Methods: Two glaucoma specialists randomly assessed a sample of 423 visual fields from 77 glaucoma patients, <b>stripped</b> of all <b>indices</b> and masked for all patient variables. They applied the WHO criterion and a 5 -point ordinal scale to all visual fields for the probability of blindness. Results: The WHO criterion was mostly found applicable and in good agreement for both assessors to visual fields depicting central island of vision or a temporal crescent. The percentage of blindness scores was higher when using the ordinal scale, 21. 7 % and 19. 6 % for assessors A and B, respectively, versus 14. 4 % and 11. 3 % for the WHO criterion. However, Kappa was lower, 0. 71 versus 0. 78 for WHO. Conclusions: The WHO criterion is strictly applied and shows good agreement between assessors; however, blindness does not always fit this criterion. More visual fields are labeled as blind when a less stringent criterion is used, but this leads to more interobserver variability. A new criterion that describes the extent, location, and depth of visual field defects together with their consequence for the patient’s quality of life is needed for the classification of glaucoma blindness.

40|$|Background: The gold {{standard}} for diagnosis of meningitis depends on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination by microscopy, biochemistry, and culture, which require an experienced microscopist and laboratory support. We conducted this study to determine if urinary reagent strip is useful to make a semi-quantitative assessment of protein, glucose, and presence of leukocyte esterase in CSF. Materials and Methods: All consecutive CSF samples were evaluated in a blinded fashion. CSF was tested using Combur- 10 urinary reagent <b>strip</b> as an <b>index</b> test, and CSF microscopy and biochemistry as reference standards. Combur- 10 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a urinary reagent strip used to estimate ten parameters including protein, glucose, and leukocytes. We estimated diagnostic accuracy of each index test using corresponding cut-off levels (glucose 1 + vs. CSF glucose > 50 mg/dL; protein 1 + and 2 + vs. CSF protein > 30 mg/dL and > 100 mg/dL; leukocyte esterase positivity vs. > 10 granulocytes in CSF sample). We constructed receiver operating curves (ROC) to evaluate overall performance of index tests and estimated area under the curve (AUC). Results: CSF samples of 75 patients {{were included in the}} study. All the three indicator tests (CSF cells, protein, and glucose) were normal in 17 (22. 6 %) samples. Of the three tests, diagnostic accuracy of protein estimation (1 + or more on reagent strip) was best for detection of CSF proteins greater than 30 mg/dL [sensitivity 98. 1 % (95 % CI 90. 1 - 100 %); specificity 57. 1 % (95 % CI 34 - 78. 2 %) ], with AUC of 0. 97. Sensitivity and specificity for 2 + on reagent strip and CSF protein > 100 mg/dL were 92. 6 % (95 % CI 75. 1 - 99. 1) and 87. 5 % (95 % CI 74. 8 - 95. 3), respectively, with AUC of 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 92 - 1. 01). Leukocyte esterase positivity by test strip had a sensitivity of 85. 2 (95 % CI 66. 3 - 95. 8 %) and specificity of 89. 6 (95 % CI 77. 3 - 96. 5 %) for detection of CSF granulocytes of more than 10 /mm 3.
