25|$|England's first innings was {{dominated}} by Ian Botham's 138 off 174 balls. He was especially severe on Australian Bowler Merv Hughes, playing in only his second Test. Important also were the return to form of Gower (51) and Captain Gatting (61). A rain-shortened first day meant that Australia was 1-33 by the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 3. Australia's first innings was effectively ended by Kent seamer Graham Dilley, although all the bowlers were effective in either taking wickets or restricting runs. Geoff Marsh continued his good form from the previous tour match, scoring 56 in 205 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Calendar is an {{organizing}} {{system to}} calculate {{the time for a}} certain period. By convention, the day is the smallest unit of the calendar, while the measurement part <b>of</b> a <b>day</b> using timing systems (hours, minutes, and seconds). Some calendar systems refers to an astronomical cycle, follow the rules anyway. The concept <b>of</b> <b>day</b> used by most people on earth is the concept <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> where the day begins at midnight and the day started on line within 1800 of the City of Greenwich. This qualitative study intends to analyze the determination <b>of</b> <b>days</b> in the Hijriyah calendar. The main problem is the disagreement about the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> and where the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> begins. In contrast to the international community in general, Muslims have several criteria to determine where and when the day begins in Islam. There are three opinions about the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>day.</b> First, the dawn as a benchmark <b>of</b> the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day.</b> Second, the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> occurs when the setting sun.

25|$|The 1st Test started slowly, with England scoring just 160 {{runs in the}} 80 overs {{that were}} managed before rain curtailed the day's play. None of the four wickets taken during the day were for more than 40 runs, leaving Joe Root (25) and Jonny Bairstow (3) at the crease overnight. The pair added another 32 runs at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 2 before the loss of Root's wicket in the 16th over of the day brought about a batting collapse; England went from 192/5 to 232 all out {{in the space of}} just under 18 overs, and none of the last five batsmen reached double figures.|$|E
25|$|Michael Clarke {{returned}} to the crease at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Day</b> 2 with a back brace, {{and put on a}} 51-run partnership with Steve Smith, before a rain delay left Smith stranded just 2 runs short of a century. The rain consistently fell and lunch was taken early. The players returned after lunch and Smith brought up his century in the first ball. Play was delayed once again just 2 overs later. Play resumed again and Clarke reached his own century as the pair quickly added another 50 before yet another rain delay. Play continued and more quick runs were added as Smith reached 150. Clarke then was dismissed by Karn Sharma for 128 and stumps were called just one over later because of bad light. Shami, Aaron and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.|$|E
25|$|The opening fixture between Mid West Rhinos and Matabeleland Tuskers was {{interrupted}} at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> three with a strike by the players. The protest {{was led by}} domestic players, as {{they had not been}} paid in November. Matabeleland Tuskers forfeited the second innings of the match, and therefore Mid West Rhinos won the game. The second round of fixtures, originally scheduled to start on 5 January 2017, were postponed as some players still had not been paid. On 12 January 2017 Zimbabwe Cricket announced that the competition had been postponed again, with a scheduled restart in mid-February. The next day, Zimbabwe Cricket issued a press release stating that all players had now been paid and that the tournament would restart on 17 January 2017. However, both fixtures scheduled to start on this date were abandoned due to rain.|$|E

25|$|Australia captain Michael Clarke {{declared}} {{overnight and}} sent India in to bat at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Day</b> 3. Shikhar Dhawan made a brisk start but was bowled by Ryan Harris for 25. Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara {{put on an}} 81-run partnership before Mitchell Johnson dismissed Vijay caught behind (53). India reached lunch at a solid 2/119. Pujara and Kohli continued their partnership after lunch and put on another 81-run stand until Pujara was bowled by Nathan Lyon for 73. Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane saw out a late onslaught from Lyon to be 3/223 at tea. Rahane pushed on after tea, but was caught off his gloves for 62. Rohit Sharma came in and helped push them towards 400 as Kohli brought up his 2nd century at Adelaide Oval. Kohli (115) was eventually dismissed with 4 overs remaining in the day. Wriddhiman Saha and Sharma successfully saw India to 5/369 at stumps.|$|E
25|$|England added just 25 more {{runs for}} their last two wickets at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Day</b> 2, Hilfenhaus {{trapping}} Anderson LBW for 0 {{in the second}} over of the day (ending his 54 innings sequence without a duck), before dismissing Broad for 37. Shane Watson and Simon Katich took Australia to 66/0 before rain forced lunch to be taken three minutes early, with the resumption of play delayed until almost 14:30. After lunch the Australian openers lasted just two overs {{before the start of}} a massive Broad-inspired batting collapse. First to fall was Watson, LBW on 34, then Ricky Ponting was deceived by a cutter from Broad and played onto his own stumps for just eight runs. Michaels Hussey and Clarke were next to go, Hussey LBW for a duck, before Clarke was caught low at short extra cover by Jonathan Trott. After a spell in which Broad took four wickets for just eight runs, Swann returned to the attack and immediately took the wicket of Marcus North, although replays subsequently showed that the Australian number 6 got an inside edge to the ball before it struck his pad. Katich reached his half-century in the 37th over of the innings, but was out the very next ball, caught by Alastair Cook at short leg. Broad completed his five-wicket haul in the 39th over, bowling Brad Haddin to give him wicket-to-wicket figures of 5/19 and leave only the Australian bowlers to dismiss. Swann took the next two wickets – albeit that of Stuart Clark was given incorrectly – leaving it to Flintoff to bowl Hilfenhaus and end the Australian innings for 160 runs. The English openers returned to the crease and put on 27 before Cook edged North to first slip for just nine. Mitchell Johnson then combined well with Simon Katich at short leg for the next two wickets, Katich catching Bell low before Johnson thumped a bouncer into Collingwood, looping the ball up for Katich to catch easily, leaving the home side at 39/3. Nevertheless, Strauss and Trott recovered well to take England into the third day at 58/3.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients seen as 'extras' (or 'fit-ins') {{are usually}} given {{less time for}} their {{problems}} than those in pre-booked appointments. Consequently, long queues of 'extras' should be avoided. AIM: To determine whether a predictable relationship exists {{between the number of}} available appointments at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> and the number of extra patients who must be fitted in. This might be used to help plan a practice appointment system. METHOD: Numbers of available appointments at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> and numbers <b>of</b> 'extras' seen were recorded prospectively in 1995 and 1997 in one group general practice. Minimum numbers of available appointments at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day,</b> below which undesirably large numbers of extra patients could be predicted, were determined using logistic regression applied to the 1995 data. Predictive values of the minimum numbers calculated for 1995, in terms of predicting undesirable numbers of 'extras', were then determined when applied to the 1997 data. RESULTS: Numbers of extra patients seen correlated negatively with available appointments at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> for all <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the week, with coefficients ranging from - 0. 66 to - 0. 80. Minimum numbers of available appointments below which undesirably large numbers of extras could be predicted were 26 for Mondays and four for the other week-days. When applied to 1997 data, these minimum numbers gave positive and negative predictive values of 76 % and 82 % respectively, similar to their values for 1995, despite increases in patient attendance and changes in the day-to-day pattern of surgery provision between the two years. CONCLUSION: A predictable relationship exists between the number of available appointments at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>day</b> and the number of extras who must be fitted in, which may be used to help plan the appointment system for some years ahead, at least in this relatively stable suburban practice...|$|R
