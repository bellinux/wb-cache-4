40|$|This report {{describes}} the geology of 1 :lO 000 sheets SK 31 NW (Swadlincote) and SK 21 NE (Church Gresley). The combined area (hereafter {{referred to as}} the 'district') falls mainly within the 1 : 50 000 Geological Sheet 141 (Loughborough), and partly within Geological Sheets 155 (Coalville), 154 (Lichfield) and 140 (Burton). The district was first geologically surveyed at 1 :lO 560 -scale by E Hull between 1850 and 1860, and published as part of the Old Series One-inch geological sheets 62 E and 63 W. The primary survey of the district was carried out by C Fox-Strangways in 1892 - 1896 and published on the Derbyshire (DY) sixinch County Series Sheets DY 59, 60, 61, 62, 63 and Leicestershire (L) Sheets L 15 and 22 (detailed sheet compilations are given on the accompanying 1 :lO 000 maps). The One-inch to one-mile New <b>Series</b> <b>Geological</b> Sheet 141 (Loughborough) was published in 1904; an accompanying memoir was also produced (Fox-Strangways, 1905). Following amendments to the Coal Measures by G H Mitchell, shown on separate copies of the six-inch County Series Sheets, a revised one-inch sheet was published in 1950. Sheet SK 31 NW was resurveyed south of gridline 3181 at 1 :lO 560 -scale by B C Worssam in 1967 - 70. The same worker carried out a more extensive re-survey of Sheet SK 21 NE, to the south of gridline 3165 and west of gridline 3270. The mapping was completed at 1 :lO 000 -scale by J N Carney in 1995, under the direction of T J Charsley (Regional Geologist).

The drift deposits were not represented on these maps. Clement Reid resurveyed the area on the six-inch to one-mile scale (1 : 10, 560) in 1893, and his results were incorporated in New Series One-Inch Geological Sheet 329 (Bournemouth), published in 1895 in both Solid and Drift editions, and in the accompanying memoir (Reid, 1898). A second edition of this memoir was produced by H J 0 White, and was published in 1917. White re-examined much of the ground, but the published maps remained unaltered. In 1983 the Institute of Geological Sciences (now British Geological Survey) was commissioned by the Department of the Environment (contract PECD 7 / 1 / 0103 - 149 / 82) to provide new 1 : 10, 000 geological maps of the Poole-Bournemouth area. This contract comprises the survey of ten 1 : 10, 000 sheets, and parts of four others, (Figure 1) over three years, to form {{a basis for the}} planning of urban and industrial development, and the safeguarding of mineral and water resources.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a method for}} automatically constructing, visualizing and describing a large class of models, useful for forecasting and finding structure in domains such as time <b>series,</b> <b>geological</b> formations, and physical dynamics. These models, based on Gaussian processes, can capture many types of statistical structure, such as periodicity, changepoints, additivity, and symmetries. Such structure can be encoded through kernels, which have historically been hand-chosen by experts. We show how to automate this task, creating a system that explores an open-ended space of models and reports the structures discovered. To automatically construct Gaussian process models, we search over sums and products of kernels, maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood. We show how any model in this class can be automatically decomposed into qualitatively different parts, and how each component can be visualized and described through text. We combine these results into a procedure that, given a dataset, automatically constructs a model along with a detailed report containing plots and generated text that illustrate the structure discovered in the data. The introductory chapters contain a tutorial showing how to express many types of structure through kernels, and how adding and multiplying different kernels combines their properties. Examples also show how symmetric kernels can produce priors over topological manifolds such as cylinders, toruses, and Möbius strips, {{as well as their}} higher-dimensional generalizations. This thesis also explores several extensions to Gaussian process models. First, building on existing work that relates Gaussian processes and neural nets, we analyze natural extensions of these models to deep kernels and deep Gaussian processes. Second, we examine additive Gaussian processes, showing their relation to the regularization method of dropout. Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet process to produce the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering model having nonparametric cluster shapes, and a corresponding latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable parametric form.

40|$|Abstract Background The role of Pleistocene glacial {{oscillations}} {{in current}} biodiversity and distribution patterns varies with latitude, physical topology and population life history and {{has long been}} a topic of discussion. However, there had been little phylogeographical research in south China, where the geophysical complexity is associated with great biodiversity. A bird endemic in Southeast Asia, the Grey-cheeked Fulvetta, Alcippe morrisonia, has been reported to show deep genetic divergences among its seven subspecies. In the present study, we investigated the phylogeography of A. morrisonia to explore its population structure and evolutionary history, in order to gain insight into the effect of geological events on the speciation and diversity of birds endemic in south China. Results Mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (Cytb) and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) were represented by 1236 nucleotide sites from 151 individuals from 29 localities. Phylogenetic analysis showed seven monophyletic clades congruent with the geographically separated groups, which were identified as major sources of molecular variance (90. 92 %) by AMOVA. TCS analysis revealed four disconnected networks, and that no haplotype was shared among the geographical groups. The common ancestor of these populations was dated to 11. 6 Mya and several divergence events were estimated along the population evolutionary history. Isolation by distance was inferred by NCPA to be responsible for the current intra-population genetic pattern and gene flow among geographical groups was interrupted. A late Pleistocene demographic expansion was detected in the eastern geographical groups, while the expansion time (0. 2 – 0. 4 Mya) was earlier than the Last Glacial Maximum. Conclusion It is proposed that the complicated topology preserves high genetic diversity and ancient lineages for geographical groups of A. morrisonia in China mainland and its two major islands, and restricts gene exchange during climate oscillations. Isolation by distance seems to be an important factor of genetic structure formation within geographical populations. Although glacial influence to population fluctuation was observed in late Pleistocene, it seems that populations in eastern China were more susceptible to climate change, and all geographical groups were growing stably through the Last Glacial Maximum. Coalescence analysis suggested that the ancestor of A. morrisonia might {{be traced back to the}} late Miocene, and the current phylogeographical structure of A. morrisonia is more likely to be attributable to a <b>series</b> <b>geological</b> events than to Pleistocene glacial cycles. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the geology over the karstification is obvious. Practically, every paper concerning a karstic zone put in evidence {{the role played by}} the geological factors for the karst initiation, evolution or the functioning of karst. Our aim in this study is not to confirm what is already known. We intend to identify the karst peculiarities induced by the geological factors. To do that, we can recognize a peculiarity by comparing it with a reference model, which represent the standard. In the karst terrains, with their great variety, finding such real model seems to be impossible. In turn we can use a theoretical model. There is another difficulty: the choice of the model, because, practically every karstological school have his own model. In what concerning us, we consider the karst like a geodynamic system. This concept is very closed to the functional model of Mangin (1975, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1994). In fact, the essence of the geodynamic systems is to consider the continuous relation between the morphology and the functioning in his evolution. The morphology can be considered like the spatial structure that assures the system functioning. The next step was to choose between the karst categories defined by the model. The main criterion applied in this model is the kind of energy, which assures the karst functioning. So, we choose the gravitational karst, which means the karst where the water flowing is due to the gravitational force. Hereafter, depending on the complexity of the criteria system we can arrive even to identify the individual karsts. Viewing the aim of this study, we preferred to make a comparison, not just referring to the model. So, we will refer to two karstic zones. The main raison to doing so is that the comparison will allow outlining the peculiarities of each zone, not only referring to the model but also referring one to the other one. In this manner we can identify the factors that are behind these peculiarities and how they acted to impose that. To assure a meaningful sense of the comparison, we must impose some conditions to our chose. So, the two zones present similarities in what concern the geostructural environment. Both of them are developed in folded areas with an evident well-developed tectonics. In both zones, the karstified carbonate series cover the same age interval: Jurassic. Cretaceous. Also, from a geomorphologic point of view the zones correspond to low high mountains (not exceeding 1700 m of altitude). There is a notion that makes a sense for all. karstological schools. : the karstic massif. Why? Because all the karstologists need to place and refer their works in rapport with a spatial unit: the karstic massif. It is not obvious all the time to defining the limits of the karstic massif. They can be geomorphologic, geologic or functional limits (Goran, 2001). Important is that the karstic massif is the coherent spatial unit which show a certain homogeneity from a geomorphologic, geological or functional point of view. The two zones that we will compare represent two karstic massifs: the Arbas massif (Haute Garonne, France) and the Obarsia- Closani. Piatra Mare massif (Gorj. Méhédintzi, Romania). The both massifs will be treated in the same manner. First, we will present the geology: carbonate <b>series,</b> <b>geological</b> structures and tectonics. This will allow us to have a first image of the potentially geologically factors. The next step will concern the analysis of the karst features on both massifs. We will regard the morphology and the functioning too. So, {{we will be able to}} have an image over the karsts type, his functioning and development, and, finally, over the evolutionary state of the karsts. At this point, important is to identify the geological elements, which, at the massif scale, have favored the karst developing and, mainly, which imposed the karst peculiarity. Finally, we can compare the two massifs. Starting to compare the karst features, we will be able to find the similarities and, more important, the dissimilarities from the geological point of view. In the second chapter we will try to follow the relationship between the geology and the karst at an intermediate scale, called outcrop or intra-karstic scale. From a spatial point of view, this scale is in the range of meters. One of the ways left to say something more objective about the karst morphology is to increase the objectivity of our analysis and interpretations. Quantifying the morphology and applying the mathematical analysis methods can make this. We tried to apply this new methods to analyze the cave walls morphology. In this category, one peculiar morphology was intensively studied: the scallops and flutes. By their properties the scallops are of great interest for our study, so, we present the basic problems and the main results regarding this morphology. In several caves from Romania and France, from the two studied areas, developed in different geological situations, horizontal profiles of the walls were measured. In order to make a comparison, a profile in a limestone quarry was measured too. The obtained data series were analyzed with the classical method of signal treatment (spectral analysis) and other new methods (fractal and wavelets analysis). All profiles show two different fractal dimensions that testify for relief developed at two different scales. For the small scale, the poor fractal dimension put in evidence the evolution of the wall morphology under sub-aerial conditions. The more developed morphologies (scallops) have the greatest fractal dimensions. The spectral analysis shows the existence of some pseudo-periodicities. The log-log representations of the spectral densities make the difference between the cave profiles and the quarry measured profile. Since the quarry profile shows a pure Brownian character, the cave profiles are typical for a persistent fractionally Brownian character, which means that the existent variations are interdependent ones of others. For the scales between 3 and 7 cm, the slopes of the log-log representations allow us to make the analogy with the Kolmogorov model of the turbulence. For the small scale, the profiles are characteristic to a white noise. At this scale, even if the information exists, she cannot be interpreted because of the noise. The wavelets analysis comes to reinforce the observations already made: the cave profiles consist in a hierarchy of morphological structures developed at different scales and interdependent ones of others. All this observations allow us to conclude that the studied morphologies of the cave walls show the {{influence of}} a multi-scale morphogenetic process- the water flow. The original relief, depending on the geological factors, is fashioned by the flow, which arrive to integrate the initial pseudo-structures into an hierarchy of inter-dependent morphological structures. In addition, the used methods can put in evidence the influence of different morphogenetic processes. Finally, some remarks regarding the morphogenesis of the cave walls are made. We arrive in the third chapter at the microscopic scale - that is to consider the {{influence of the}} rock petrography on the main karstification process – the limestone dissolution. Resuming the existing studies in this research field, we can outline the following facts: in nature, the dissolution is associated with a segregation process, the micritic fabrics are more easily attacked than the sparitic ones, an heterogeneous petrography favors the alteration process. We can see that there is a relationship between the rock petrography and the dissolution process. In this relation we have a quantifiable variable – the dissolution, and a nominative one – the petrography. In order to make a comparison and to say something more explicit about this relationship, we will try to quantify the nominative variable. The main idea in our thinking is to consider the limestone like a monomineral rock. Accepting that, the great varieties of the limestone derive from the micrite/sparite ratio and the spatial distribution of these elements. Their optical properties make possible the recognition of the rock petrography on images or photos realized in tons of gray. They were used two types of images: one obtained directly on the thin sections (real surface - 1 cm 2) and an other one obtained from the microscope made photos on the same thin sections (real surface – 1 mm 2). These images were treated by means of some special software (image treatment, GIS system, 3 d-representation) in order to obtain a series of numerical variables, which allow, as large as possible, a quantitative description of the rock petrography. They were obtained 16 variables. The multivariable analysis (analysis of principals components) allow us to see what variables are important in defining the different analyzed rocks and how to discriminate and regroup different rocks petrography. In order to have a more complete description of each rock, chemical compositions analysis were made and the content in CaO and MgO were added in the multivariable analysis. To obtain the second member of the relation petrography – dissolution, we conceived a setup for the dissolution experience: 6 limestone tablets were exposed to the water flow during a long period time, in the same hydrodynamic conditions. For each experience we tested two different hydrodynamic conditions. The first experience was made at the Mangalia Laboratory (Romania) during 86 days, and the second one was made in the Moulis Cave (The Subterranean Laboratory, France) during 148 days. The standard tablets were different for the two experiences, and they come from the same blocks from which we made the thin sections. The samples come from the Arbas Massif (France) and Obarsia Closani – Piatra Mare Massif (Romania). The quantitative variable – the dissolution rate – is estimated, for each rock type, as percent of the weight loss from the initial weight of the standard tablet during the dissolution experience. The relationship between the petrography and the dissolution is analyzed by means of the already mentioned multivariable analysis, where the percent of weight loss is added to the already used petrography variables. La karstologie représente une discipline nouvelle dans le contexte des sciences de la terre. La paternité a été réclamée au cours du temps par la géographie, la géologie, la climatologie, l'hydrogéologie. En fonction de l'intérêt accordé à certains aspects du karst, chacune de ces disciplines s'arroge des droits, plus ou moins justifiés, sur la karstologie. Pour quelqu'un qui vient d'une autre d'école il n'est ne pas toujours facile d'intégrer deux approches différentes. Le compromis ne peut être trouvé que si on abandonne tout parti pris. C'est cette position d'impartialité qui permet de mieux juger quels sont les arguments pour ou contre de chaque partie et d'intégrer le tout dans une vision d'ensemble pour réconcilier les différents aspects. C'est le cas de cette étude. Démarré sur une position orientée vers la morphologie, on s'est aperçu assez vite de la rigueur de l'approche fonctionnelle développée au sein du Laboratoire du Moulis. Les nombreux exemples étudiés, qui font le sujet d'autant d'ouvrages publiés, montrent la réalité physique de cette approche. Il est de plus en plus accepté à l'heure actuelle que le karst ait une fonctionnalité spécifique, que cette fonctionnalité consiste dans un drainage souterrain auto organisé et que la morphologie karstique peut être assimilée à la structure spatiale qui assure ce type de fonctionnement. Tout cela est le résultat de la karstification, qui représente l'action simultanée de deux processus intimement liés : l'écoulement de l'eau et la dissolution. A partir de cette base, le but de l'étude est de voir comment et jusqu'au quel point la géologie influence la karstification. Pour répondre à ces questions, tout le long de cette étude il a été tenu compte des deux principes. D'abord, le principe de la réalité. Ainsi, la relation géologie – karstification a été toujours cherchée à partir de cas réels. Cela a permis d'assurer une certaine objectivité des observations même si une généralisation n'était pas possible dans tous les cas. Le second principe est celui de la quantification. La relation géologie – karst est traitée, souvent, d'une façon descriptive, ce qui induit une appréciation qualitative du phénomène. L'interprétation qualitative peut être, souvent, atteint par un subjectivisme qui, même si involontaire, va fausser les résultats de la démarche scientifique. Pour éviter cela, là où il a été possible on a choisi la quantification des phénomènes. Cette opération a permis l'acquisition de données numériques qui ont pu être traitées ensuite à l'aide d'outils mathématiques. Avec cette démarche, on assure un caractère beaucoup plus rigoureux pour les interprétations. Enfin, la structure de cette étude a été imposée par le caractère multiéchelles de la géologie. En relation avec le karst, on peut décrire la géologie comme l'ensemble de toutes les propriétés structurales, tectoniques, lithologiques et pétrographiques du substrat. En partant de la structure géologique jusqu'à la pétrographie on voit que les plages d'échelles spatiales sont très étalées. Comme la karstification intervient à toutes les échelles, une réponse complète sur la relation géologie – karstification devrait prendre en compte cette relation à toutes les échelles. C'est la raison pour laquelle on a choisi d'étudier cette relation à trois échelles spatiales différentes. La structure de l'étude va suivre ces trois échelles. Même si les trois chapitres paraissent assez indépendants, la liaison entre eux est assurée par le fait qu'ils traitent tous de la même problématique : la relation géologie – karstification. Bien sûr, en fonction de l'échelle, les facteurs géologiques qui entrent en jeu sont différents. De même, étant donnés les particularités de chaque échelle, on a choisi les méthodes les plus appropriées pour l'étude de cette relation. Ainsi, le premier chapitre va regarder l'influence de la géologie à l ‘échelle du massif. Deux massifs karstiques ont été choisis : le massif d'Obarsia-Closani – Piatra Mare (Roumanie) et le massif d'Arbas (France). Les deux massifs vont être traités de la même manière. Après une présentation concise de la situation géologique, on va essayer de caractériser de façon la plus complète possible le karst développé sur chaque massif. On prend en compte la structure du karst (l'exokarst et l'endokarst) ainsi que le fonctionnement. Un sous chapitre à part est dédié à l'étude des plans de drainage et à l'interprétation de leur distribution par rapport aux structures fonctionnelles du karst. Pour chaque massif, on essaye de mettre en évidence le rôle joué par les facteurs géologiques pour la mise en place du karst. Finalement, la comparaison entre les deux cas étudiés va permettre de tirer certaines conclusions sur la relation géologie – karstification à l'échelle du massif. Suivant la logique de l'étude, le deuxième chapitre est consacré à la relation géologie – karstification à l'échelle de l'affleurement. A ce niveau, on a choisi d'analyser la morphologie des parois de grottes. Les grottes sont d'anciennes structures fonctionnelles du karst. Donc, les parois de grottes vont rendre compte dans une certaine mesure du fonctionnement du karst à cette échelle. Si les facteurs géologiques, qui apparaissent à ce niveau, jouent un rôle par rapport à la karstification, cette influence doit se retrouver sur la morphologie des parois. La morphologie est quantifier à partir des profils en 1 D. Ces profils ont été mesurés dans des grottes situées aussi bien en Roumanie qu'en France, dans des situations géologiques très différentes et avec une diversité fonctionnelle et évolutive évidente. Autant que possible, on a voulu couvrir une diversité morphologique la plus large possible. Dans un but de comparaison, un profil n'ayant pas subi de karstification a été mesuré dans une carrière. Les données sont traitées par l'intermédiaire de l'analyse fractale, spectrale, représentations en log-log des spectres, analyse en ondelettes continues et multirésolution. L'interprétation des résultats fournis par ces analyses va permettre de tirer certaines conclusions sur la relation géologie – karstification à l'échelle de l'affleurement. Le dernier chapitre est réservé à l'échelle microscopique. A ce niveau les paramètres géologiques qui peuvent intervenir sur la karstification sont de nature pétrographique. Donc, on se propose de regarder de plus prés, la relation entre la pétrographie des roches calcaires et la dissolution. Dans cette relation on dispose d'une variable quantifiable – le taux de dissolution – et une variable qualitative – la pétrographie. Toujours dans le but d'avoir une interprétation plus rigoureuse, il est proposé une méthode de quantification de la pétrographie des roches calcaires à partir des images en tons de gris. Ensuite, les variables utilisées pour la quantification sont analysées pour vérifier la justesse de la méthode proposée. Le taux de dissolution est obtenu à partir d'expériences de dissolution, menées sur les mêmes échantillons pour lesquelles a été quantifiée la pétrographie, dans des conditions hydrodynamiques différentes. Une dernière analyse est réalisée à partir des variables pétrographiques auxquelles on ajoute les taux de dissolution. Les résultats de cette analyse vont permettre de conclure sur la relation géologie – karstologie à l'échelle microscopique. Finalement, en rappelant les résultats obtenus à chaque niveau d'échelle il est possible d'essayer de les intégrer dans une vision d'ensemble sur le karst et la karstification...|$|E
