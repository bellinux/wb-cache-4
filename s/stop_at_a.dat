5|$|At {{the airport}} bar, Brian gets very drunk and, when Stewie comes to {{retrieve}} him, their plane tickets are stolen. They <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rundown motel, where Stewie tries calling home, but fails {{because he believes}} his phone number is 867-5309. The next day, they have to escape and hotwire a car because their credit card was rejected. To get home, Stewie and Brian masquerade as crop dusters to steal a plane, which they immediately destroy.|$|E

Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully, while traveling to a conference with two other FBI agents, <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> roadblock and join a nearby investigation of attacks by an unidentified predator.|$|E

5|$|The station serves several bus routes. Feeder line 55 to Lillo Terrasse to Nydalen {{passes by}} Storo. Lines 23 and 24 along Ring 3 from Lysaker to Simensbråten, and Brynseng to Fornebu stops at Storo. So does line 56 from Torshov to Solemskogen, and line 58 from Helsfyr to Nydalen. Most of the buses <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> stop {{located on the}} {{motorway}} Ring 3.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1998 and was opened on July 18, 2009, {{as part of}} the inaugural Link line, after five years of tunnel boring and station construction. It consists of a single island platform, divided into two sections by the twin bores of the Beacon Hill Tunnel; four high-speed elevators ferry passengers from the platform to the surface entrance. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Beacon Hill Station is also served by two King County Metro buses that <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> pair of sheltered bus stops on Beacon Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E

5|$|Outraged by his wife's escapades and the mayor's {{threat of}} {{personal}} violence, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court and revokes Delta's charter. To take their minds off this action, Otter, Boon, Flounder, and Pinto go {{on a road}} trip. Otter is successful in picking up four young women from Emily Dickinson College as dates {{for himself and his}} Delta brothers. He elicits sympathy by posing as the fiancé of a young woman at the college who died in a recent kiln explosion. They <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> roadhouse bar where Day's band is performing, not realizing it has an exclusively African-American clientele. A couple of hulking patrons intimidate the Deltas and they quickly exit, smashing up Flounder's borrowed car and leaving their dates behind.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her {{paraplegic}} brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), {{travel with}} three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), {{to visit the}} grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{learns that}} the {{lockdown}} population is infected with an exceedingly deadly contagion, finding {{a pile of}} body bags stored for incineration in the prison's boiler room. Scully cuts open Torrance's body bag and examines his corpse, but Dr. Osbourne, {{a member of the}} CDC team, tries to stop her. A pustule on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> gas station, where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the gas station, telling him that the contagion could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E

5|$|There {{was only}} one public {{pre-season}} friendly on 13 August, which saw the club's first team take on the reserves; it ended with a surprise 4–2 victory for the reserves, Roland Lewis scoring a hat-trick. Pre-season training consisted primarily of assistant manager Ken Fish leading a marathon running session from Burslem to Hanley and back to Burslem following a <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> pub for a half-pint of shandy. After returning to the ground Fish would organise a practise game. The fitness work was actually crucial to the team's success, as Steele was {{ahead of his time}} in that he insisted that wide players should defend when the opposition were on the ball, in order to support the defence. Superstition was of great importance to Steele, who ensured that the team rigidly stuck their pre-match rituals such as the intricacies of kit layout and the order in which players entered the pitch.|$|E
5|$|When {{the gunmen}} <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> restaurant, Lou phones the police. They arrive and {{exchange}} gunfire. One suspect is killed {{while the other}} manages to escape in his SUV. The police give chase with Lou and Rick tailing and recording. After the gunman's SUV crashes, Lou urges Rick to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Rick through the glass and tries to escape but is shot by police. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who has leverage over him. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates {{a story about the}} men in the SUV following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying, but cannot prove it. Lou hires a team of interns and buys new vans to expand his business.|$|E
5|$|While in the {{car with}} Mace, Lenny plays the disc the contact gave him and watches Iris being brutally raped and murdered by an {{attacker}} at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, Lenny and Mace take the disc to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> safe position on the circuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{attack on}} Hammersmith Bridge encouraged the RIRA leadership to launch further attacks in Northern Ireland. On 19 June 2000 a bomb {{was found in}} the grounds of Hillsborough Castle, home of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson. On 30 June a bomb exploded on the Dublin-to-Belfast railway line near the village of Meigh in County Armagh. The explosion damaged the tracks, and caused disruption to train services. On 9 July a car bomb damaged buildings in Stewartstown, County Tyrone including an RUC station, and on 10 August an attack in Derry was thwarted by the RUC after a van containing a 500lb bomb failed to <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> police checkpoint. Following a car chase the bombers escaped across the Irish border, and the Irish Army carried out a controlled explosion on the bomb after the van was found abandoned in County Donegal. On 13 September two 80lb bombs were planted at the Magilligan army camp in County Londonderry, one of which was planted in a wooden hut and partially exploded when a soldier {{opened the door to the}} hut. The second bomb was found during a follow-up search and made safe by bomb disposal experts. On 11 November the RUC and British Army prevented a mortar attack after stopping a van near Derrylin, County Fermanagh, and the RUC prevented a further attack on 13 January 2001 when an 1100lb bomb was found in Armagh — the largest bomb found in several years according to the RUC.|$|E
