On 8 May 1933, Gandhi began a 21-day fast of <b>self-purification</b> and launched a one-year campaign to help the Harijan movement. This {{new campaign}} was not universally embraced within the Dalit community. Ambedkar and his allies felt Gandhi was being paternalistic and was undermining Dalit political rights. Ambedkar described him as [...] "devious and untrustworthy". He accused Gandhi as someone who wished to retain the caste system. Ambedkar and Gandhi debated their ideas and concerns, where both tried to persuade each other.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{picked it}} as one of Rebel Hearts best songs, calling it [...] "an expert {{evocation}} of her folktronica Y2K." [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone agreed, noting that [...] "Avicii helps Madonna revive the strums-and-beats vibe of 2000's Music."

[...] Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound considered [...] "Devil Pray" [...] one of Madonna's best release in years and its chorus as [...] "one of her strongest in decades". She praised [...] "Madonna's voice [...] is pitch-shifted into a ghostly echo— and unlike those 'Bitch' beats, the production slides in perfectly. It's one hell of a song about getting fucked up on every molecule imaginable, but it's also heavy with the longing for <b>self-purification</b> and direction." [...] The New York Times also shared this view, noting that the song [...] "showcase some of Madonna's best singing in years." [...] Saeed Saeed of The National felt that the song was similar to The Animals' version of [...] "The House of the Rising Sun" [...] and praised it for being a better country-dance song than Madonna's cover of Don McLean's [...] "American Pie".|$|E

2500|$|The {{process of}} <b>self-purification</b> is often {{compared}} to smelting gold, which is heated repeatedly in fire {{to remove any}} impurities. Deussen thus explains the term is as follows: [...] "Tapanam (austerity) is burning pain-suffering or ascetic self-sacrifice; Nṛsiṁha-tapanam thus means ascetic self-surrender to Nṛsiṁha. Therefore Nṛsiṁha-tapanīya Upanishad is [...] "the doctrine concerning the ascetic surrender to Nṛsiṁha." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buechner's {{work has}} been praised highly by many reviewers of books, with the {{distinct}} exception of his second novel, The Season's Difference, which was universally panned by critics and remains his biggest commercial flop. His later novels, including the Book of Bebb series and Godric, received hearty praise; in his 1980 review of Godric, Benjamin DeMott summed up a host of positive reviews, saying [...] "All on his own, Mr. Buechner has managed to reinvent projects of <b>self-purification</b> and of faith as piquant matter for contemporary fiction, producing in a single decade a quintet of books {{each of which is}} individual in concerns and knowledge, and notable for literary finish." [...] In 1982, author Reynolds Price greeted Buechner's The Sacred Journey as [...] "a rich new vein for Buechner– a kind of detective autobiography" [...] and [...] "he result is a short but fascinating and, in its own terms, beautifully successful experiment." ...|$|E

Its central motif is the psychological and philosophical explanation of spiritual symbols, with believers instructed to perform acts of <b>self-purification</b> and renewal.

So important is this notion of purity in Theravada Buddhism that the famed Buddhist monk and commentator, Buddhaghosa, composed a central thesis on dhamma (Buddhism) called The Path of Purity (Visuddhi-magga).|$|E

50|$|Shaivas or Shaivites {{are those}} who {{primarily}} worship Shiva as the supreme god, both immanent and transcendent.

To Shaivites, Shiva is both with and without form; he is the Supreme Dancer, Nataraja; and is linga, without beginning or end. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Saivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering India with ashen faces performing <b>self-purification</b> rituals. They worship in the temple and practice yoga, striving to be one with Siva within.|$|E

The prodigious growth of the freshwater marine plant is likely a <b>self-purification</b> mechanism. Others disagree, believing the type of duckweed to be native to Florida and Texas and thus the infestation is a result of its having been transported by ship.|$|E
