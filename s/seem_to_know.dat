25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George who <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how}} to {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

500|$|Ultima Underworld uses {{two-dimensional}} sprites for characters, {{but also}} features 3D objects, {{as the team}} believed that it [...] "had to do 3D objects {{in order to have}} reasonable visuals". The game uses physics to calculate the motion of thrown objects. During the game's alpha testing phase, part of the programming team worked to create a smooth lighting model. The game's advanced technology caused the engine to run slowly, and its system requirements were extremely high. Doug Church later downplayed the importance of the game's technology, stating that technological advancement [...] "is somewhat inevitable in our field ... sadly, as an industry we <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> much less about design, and how to continue to extend and grow design capabilities". Instead, he claimed that Ultima Underworlds most important achievement was its incorporation of simulation elements into a role-playing game.|$|E

Tom Stempel for Slant Magazine said 30 Rock was [...] "smart enough" [...] not to make Claire resemble Aniston's former television character, Rachel, from Friends. Further in his review, Stempel said that Claire was a [...] "great choice of character" [...] for Aniston to play, and praised her for knocking the role [...] "out of the park." [...] Kerrie Murphy for The Australian was equally positive noting that Aniston fits in smoothly as Liz's former roommate. Murphy added, [...] "Not only is it a reminder that Aniston is a gifted comic actor [...] With her, the show's regular cast easily hold their own." ...|$|E

Hernandez criticized the film for its portrayal of Cubans. Hernandez wrote, [...] "The main problem here was the accents. The characters {{were supposed to be}} Cuban, but, with the exception of salsa star Celia Cruz, none sounded it." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized Glimcher's direction, writing in his review, [...] "...when it comes to directing dramatic sequences, he is on his own and lacking in resources to make what drama there is come to a coherent or meaningful point." ...|$|E

Montreal Gazette editor T'cha Dunlevy simply described it as [...] "a raunchy flip of the bird to haters". HitFix writer Melinda Newman called it a [...] "shape-shifting" [...] and compared Aguilera to Gwen Stefani [...] "as she adopts a patois". Annie Zaleschi of The A.V. Club was mixed, naming it a [...] "bitter '90s alt-rock crossed with M.I.A.'s antagonistic attitude; it should be an angry kiss-off. Instead, cringe-inducing lyrics sap its ire". For Michael Gallucci of PopCrush, the song [...] "dips back to the bubblegum pop of Aguilera's debut for the verses, but pumps a ton of distortion into her voice during the refrains. 'Circles' doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what kind of song it wants it to be, so it settles for two not very good ones".|$|E
500|$|The {{final round}} of {{negotiations}} started at the royal kraal {{on the morning of}} 30 October. The talks took place at an indaba between the izinDuna and Rudd's party; the king himself did not attend, but was nearby. The izinDuna pressed Rudd and his companions as to where exactly they planned to mine, to which they replied that they wanted rights covering [...] "the whole country". When the izinDuna demurred, Thompson insisted, [...] "No, we must have Mashonaland, and right up to the Zambezi as well—in fact, the whole country". According to Thompson's account, this provoked confusion among the izinDuna, who did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where these places were. [...] "The Zambezi must be there", said one, incorrectly pointing south (rather than north). The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through [...] "procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance", in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel-Jones, until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave. The izinDuna were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to please stay and continue, which they did. It was then agreed that inDuna Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's progress to the king.|$|E
500|$|Foley has {{praised the}} group's musical style on several occasions. He {{described}} the concept as innovative, {{as the music}} [...] "is not nursery rhyme, it actually has a top 40 essence to it but the lyrics are for kids." [...] He suggested this musical appeal for all ages {{as a reason for}} the group having a large teenage and adult fanbase. He cited the Wiggles as an influence of Hi-5, however he said that the respective groups have different [...] "styles of music". Hi-5 has been successful internationally. Foley explained how kids are universal and [...] "love to hear music", suggesting that the music is part of how international audiences connect to the group. Robinson stated the cast were encouraged to write their own music for the group, which all of the original members did, and by 2015 said she still receives occasional royalty cheques for her work. Original member of the Wiggles, and classical musician, Phillip Wilcher declared that Hi-5 [...] "successfully explore the essential components that come together to make music"; he detailed how the educational appeal [...] "seems to happen gently and [...] seem so at one with their audience of young folk...

[...] The review continued, [...] "In these straitjacketed settings, Lewis' considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren't given sufficient room to fully emerge."

Another review observed, [...] "Lewis seems to be [...] on her way to a more definitive musical existence [...] but she doesn’t quite <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> yet." [...] Acid Tongue was also slated for its [...] "hip-hop-like roster of unnecessary cameos. Zooey Deschanel and M.

John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode felt more like a statement by the writer regarding animal rights than an episode of [...] The plot doesn’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> which direction it wants to explore, and ultimately, elements of the episode contradict each other." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. The two wrote that, despite the episode having [...] "rare anger" [...] and a [...] "genuine passion behind" [...] its conservation message, the entry was not [...] "a very good story". Shearman and Pearson called the plot [...] "so confusing that all that impact [...] soon dissipates." [...] The plot for [...] "Fearful Symmetry" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Tiger, Tiger.|$|E
500|$|The Australian Billy Midwinter {{had played}} for Gloucestershire in 1877 and, as luck or the fixture list would have it, {{he was at}} Lord's on 20 June to {{represent}} the Australians against Middlesex. Midwinter was at net practice when he saw W. G. and E. M. Grace, accompanied by James Bush, approaching. They argued that he was under contractual obligation to play for Gloucestershire if required and Grace demanded that he accompany them to The Oval at once. One source says that Midwinter was still under a contractual obligation to Gloucestershire and that the Australian press had reported this before the team embarked. Midwinter's reaction to Grace's demand is unknown but Tom Horan later wrote that Midwinter [...] "did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his own mind for two minutes together". Whether he was in agreement or not, Midwinter did go to The Oval with the Graces. They were pursued by Conway, Gregory and Boyle who caught them at The Oval gates where a furious altercation ensued in front of bystanders. In another account, the incident is dismissed as [...] "an amusing little quarrel". The argument was serious enough and was fuelled by a long-standing [...] "antagonism" [...] between Grace and Conway which dated back to Grace's 1873 visit to Australia. At one point, Grace called the Australians [...] "a damned lot of sneaks", though he later apologised {{in a letter to}} Gregory. In the end, Grace got his way and Midwinter stayed with Gloucestershire {{for the rest of the}} season, although he did not play for the county against the Australians in September, due to a hand injury.|$|E

500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? How are things in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that, in her final {{meeting with the president}} in 1986, Reagan did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E
500|$|... "Exposé" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. Lindelof {{admitted that}} the episode [...] "created a varying degree of fan reaction", with some fans even describing it as [...] "filler".

I think it's entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren't super-narratively, you know, propelled." [...] Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode [...] "was a complete waste of time", and that although he [...] "wanted Nikki and Paulo to die", he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think [...] "Exposé" [...] "will do much to change anyone's minds" [...] about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters. Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] for Lost. New York Magazine put [...] "Exposé" [...] at the top of its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes". However, TV Guides Matt Roush very much praised the episode for [...] "weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons", Roush {{went on to say that}} [...] "Exposé" [...] was [...] "a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what they're doing after all." [...] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, [...] "their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television".

500|$|Ayane's {{gameplay}} {{abilities in}} other games were regarded more variably. In the DOA Xtreme and Paradise beach volleyball games, Ayane has excellent technique and jump abilities, {{at the cost}} of poor defence, power and speed. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Ayane is [...] "not exactly who you want to spike at the net or try to blow past blocks, but she's excellent at long spikes, digging, and soft dinks." [...] As such, Ayane is most effective as a support, but she should not be paired with Kasumi due to their rivalry; to partner with each other, Ayane and Kasumi need convincing by gift-giving. In Ninja Gaiden Σ 2, Ayane's attacks (many of her Fuma Kodachi combos resemble her combos from Dead or Alive) and finishing moves are far faster than these of Ryu, but the player has to learn to dodge much more as she has worse blocking abilities. The official guide to this game by Prima's Bryan Dawson states that Ayane's short range and limited attack power [...] "make her the worst choice of the three new characters for almost every mission" [...] and [...] "her only saving graces" [...] are a powerful ninpo spell and deadly Flash Kunai projectiles. In addition, if controlled by the console in the co-op mode, the character [...] "doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what to do in any situation." [...] Mitch Dyer of IGN opined that a vastly improved Ayane from Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is [...] "a damn fine addition" [...] to the game, where she is [...] "just as capable as Ryu Hayabusa" [...] with her [...] "quick and vicious" [...] melee attacks and explosive kunai projectiles, adding that she is [...] "functionally similar to Hayabusa in terms of combos and skills, complete with a screen-clearing special move." [...] Similarly, Retro Gamer described her simply as [...] "a nimbler version of Ryu." [...] David Lynch of X360 wrote all the [...] "girls" [...] of Razor's Edge (Ayane, Kasumi and Momiji) became [...] "just as deadly" [...] in it as Ryu Hayabusa has been through the Ninja Gaiden series. In Fatal Frame, unlike the protagonists of the game, Ayane can not permanently defeat ghosts and her strategy relies on evasion.|$|E
