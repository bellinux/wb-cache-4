40|$|The years 1880 - 1914 were a time {{of intense}} {{experimentation}} in the visual arts. Representative conventions became variable, and artists deliberately departed from a concept of depiction considered as physical resemblance or photographic similarity. Visual representations progressed toward a conceptualization of figures and objects that transcended perceptual data, and the rendering of pictorial objects turned into an experiment involving complex visualization processes. This paper explores the interplay between artistic and <b>scientific</b> <b>representative</b> practices between 1880 and 1914. I argue that science and technology acted as substantial challenges upon the concept of resemblance in art and that the rhythm of scientific and technological discoveries {{at the turn of}} the 20 th century paralleled a shift from a notion of similarity to one of homomorphism in the conceptualization of pictorial representation. Homomorphism denotes representations which dispense with a point-to-point correspondence between depicted objects and perceptual data. I developed the concept from a scholarly study of Charles S. Peirce’s pragmatic account of representation, and in particular his theory of iconicity. Peirce defined iconic signs as “partaking in the character of the object” (CP 4. 531), that is, as preserving the same relational structure as their object. A theory of iconicity as homomorphism successfully exemplifies representative relations based on structure preservation. Applied to 20 th century representative practice, homomorphism offers a plausible explanation for representations in which a considerable conceptual effort is required, independently of a point-to-point correspondence between depicted objects and perceptual data. Using four case studies - the photographer Alfred Stieglitz and the painters André Derain, Max Weber and Pablo Picasso - I argue that representative practice between 1880 and 1914 was strongly informed by experimental scientific practices and that the shift from figurative to conceptual representation in art was triggered by a more significant theoretical shift involving representation as a general philosophical notion. Rather than a normative quest for the necessary and sufficient conditions for representation, I will propose a pragmatic evaluation of the means and strategies through which artists and scientists devise perspicuous and useful representations of the world. My analysis of the correlations between artistic and scientific representations {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century aims to fulfill a twofold purpose. From a historical viewpoint, it draws significant parallels between the experimental aspects of representative practices in art and science considered as ways of exploring natural phenomena and intervening upon them. From a philosophical viewpoint, my goal is to propose a novel epistemological framework to assess how the shift in the conceptualization of representations affected subsequent styles of knowing and experimental practices in art and science. Ultimately, by combining the relative merits of historical and philosophical accounts of representation, I will argue for the advantages and desirability of a philosophically informed history of representative practice...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} how the transnational tobacco industry has collaborated with local Asian tobacco monopolies and companies {{to promote a}} scientific and regulatory agenda. Methods: Analysis of previously secret tobacco industry documents. Results: Transnational tobacco companies began aggressively entering the Asia market in the 1980 s, and the current tobacco industry in Asia {{is a mix of}} transnational and local monopolies or private companies. Tobacco industry documents demonstrate that, in 1996, Philip Morris led an organisation of <b>scientific</b> <b>representatives</b> from different tobacco companies called the Asian Regional Tobacco Industry Science Team (ARTIST), whose membership grew to include monopolies from Korea, China, Thailand, and Taiwan and a company from Indonesia. ARTIST was initially a vehicle for PM's strategies against anticipated calls for global smoke-free areas from a World Health Organization secondhand smoke study. ARTIST evolved through 2001 into a forum to present scientific and regulatory issues faced primarily by Philip Morris and other transnational tobacco companies. Philip Morris' goal for the organisation became to reach the external scientific and public health community and relators in Asia. Conclusion: The Asian tobacco industry has changed from an environment of invasion by transnational tobacco companies to an environment of participation with Philip Morris' initiated activities. With this, participation, tobacco control efforts in Asia face new challenges as Philip Morris promotes and integrates its scientific and regulatory agenda into the local Asian tobacco industry. As the local Asian tobacco monopolies and companies can have direct links with their governments, future implementation tobacco control may be at odds with national priorities.

40|$|The {{development}} of science studies {{has an important}} message for political theory. This message {{has not yet been}} fully articulated.

To the political representatives (elected by humans) should be added the <b>scientific</b> <b>representatives</b> (spokespersons of nonhumans).

Then the article explains how to interpret the shift to "nonmodernism, " that is, a historical period when the two branches of politics get together again. What ties us all together? What is the cement, the glue, that makes us a group? Why is there a society instead of a disorderly mob? Conversely, why are we all not tied together? Why do there appear to be disorderly mobs, crowds, and masses? How is it that the same social links may weaken, strengthen, or disappear altogether, as we shift from the village to the city, from parish to market forces, from nation-state to multinational? How can society be made more coherent, more organic, or, on the contrary, more contradictory, less consensual? How can society be improved? In brief, what is the nature and function of the social link? What are the historical transfor-mations of social links? Can social links be modified so that human society becomes better?

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{institutional}} analysis {{has been in}} the focus of economic science since 1980 until now. It began as a criticism of old institutionalism, later developed as the neoinstitutional economic theory, an original direction of economic thought, that due to its identical methodology, represents specific (partial) extension of the neoclassical theory. Later a new French institutionalism as a criticism of neoinstitutional economic theory and the neoclassical one-sided and abstract rationality and appropriate treatment of methodoligical individualism appeared. These directions are formaly and conceptualy different, but they have some essential similarities, primarily related to ideological terms. Economy of conventions is one of the modern economic science courses. It is part of a broad intellectual movement, based on discussions of economists, sociologists, historians, psychologists and other social <b>scientific</b> <b>representatives.</b> It is a heterogeneous intellectual movement, trying to overcome the basic principles of neoclassical economics, especially the alleged existence of market equilibrium (which implies an optimal resource allocation and pricing in the conditions of ideal market) as well as rational behavior of economic agents (who optimize their economic activities in order to draw maximum benefit). So, one can {{say that this is a}} specific critique of neo-liberal notions of autonomy and even the dominance of economic factors in relation to the impact of social, political and other factors. This paper explains some important elements, indicating that the consensus theory and economy of conventions, despite the indisputable originality, has its role model in neo-institutional economics theory. The relationship between these respectable economic theories, their similarities and disciplinary demarcation lines have been defined. Its hypothesis is that these directions, despite many formal and conceptual differences, have enough similarities to imply the conclusion that neo-institutional economic theory in some parts can be viewed as a role model in relation to the economy of conventions...|$|R
