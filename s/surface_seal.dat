50|$|Surface {{contamination}} of wells in the United States is typically {{controlled by the}} use of a <b>surface</b> <b>seal.</b> A large hole is drilled to a predetermined depth or to a confining formation (clay or bedrock, for example), and then a smaller hole for the well is completed from that point forward. The well is typically cased from the surface down into the smaller hole with a casing that is the same diameter as that hole. The annular space between the large bore hole and the smaller casing is filled with bentonite clay, concrete, or other sealant material. This creates an impermeable seal from the surface to the next confining layer that keeps contaminants from traveling down the outer sidewalls of the casing or borehole and into the aquifer. In addition, wells are typically capped with either an engineered well cap or seal that vents air through a screen into the well, but keeps insects, small animals, and unauthorized persons from accessing the well.|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was designed to}} assess the impact of <b>surface</b> <b>seal</b> development on herbicide loss from a clay soil. The influence of surface sealing on herbicide loss through vertical macropores and lateral throughflow pathways was of particular interest. Losses of the phenylurea herbicide, isoproturon, increased from 0. 025 % to 0. 5 % of the total applied under sealed compared with unsealed conditions, as a result of two different mechanisms. First, an increased flow rate through the A horizon under the wetter, sealed conditions resulted in earlier initiation of, and hence a greater volume of, throughflow containing isoproturon in the lysimeters. Second, increased concentrations of isoproturon in macropore and throughflow under the sealed treatments were attributed to the physical and chemical characteristics of the <b>surface</b> <b>seal.</b> Localized reductions in infiltration capacity, changes in soil composition, and decrease in diffusion depth of herbicide within the <b>surface</b> <b>seal</b> are presented as possible mechanisms by which herbicide losses from the sealed soil lysimeters were enhanced...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of different slope gradients, rain intensities and particle size distributions on aggregate breakdown and IR to describe the formation of <b>surface</b> <b>seal.</b> To address this issue, 60 experiments were carried out in a 35 × 30 × 10 cm detachment tray using a rainfall simulator. By sieving a sandy loam soil, two sub-samples with different maximum aggregate sizes of 2 mm (D max 2 mm) and 4. 75 mm (D max 4. 75 mm) were prepared. The soils were exposed to two different rain intensities (57 and 80 mm h − 1) on several slopes (0. 5, 2. 5, 5, 10 and 20 %) each at three replicates. The result showed that for all slope gradients and rain intensities, the most fraction percentages in soils D max 2 and D max 4. 75 mm were in the finest size classes of 0. 02 and 0. 043 mm, respectively. The soil containing finer aggregates exhibited higher transportability of pre-detached material than the soil containing larger aggregates. Also, IR increased with increasing slope gradient, rain intensity and aggregate size under unsteady state conditions because of less development of <b>surface</b> <b>seal.</b> However, under steady state conditions, no significant relationship was found between slope and IR.

40|$|International audienceSoil and <b>surface</b> <b>seal</b> {{hydraulic}} properties {{were determined}} from simulated rainfall experiments by the inverse method {{applied to the}} Richards equation. Measurements used for the estimation include the soil water pressure head versus time at two distances from the soil surface, the transient infiltration rate at the soil surface and the drainage rates {{at the bottom of}} the soil profile. Seal properties were evaluated using a model that simulates changes in the seal bulk density with respect to time and space. Uncertainties, correlations and sensitivities of the soil and seal parameters were quantified to evaluate the accuracy of the model estimation and to compare the information content of each measurement type to parameter estimations. It appears that the uncertainties related to three seal parameter estimations, namely the parameter related to the dynamics of seal formation, the modelled seal thickness and the initial bulk density, were larger than 50 % of the parameter values, because of the low sensitivity of the model to them and their multiple correlations. In addition to seal hydraulic parameter estimation, bulk density profiles of the soil surface were measured after the rainfall simulations using the X-ray method. The exponential-decay shape assumed in the soil <b>surface</b> <b>seal</b> model was found to correctly reproduce the measured distribution of bulk density with depth. However, the measurements showed a less developed seal than that suggested by the bulk density profile estimated from rainfall experiments. Finally, bulk density measurements were used as given input parameters of the model. Setting the initial bulk density and its maximal change over time at the measured values greatly decreased the seal parameter uncertainties. The method proposed could be used to improve the experimental design used to quantify the seal's hydraulic properties using inverse techniques...|$|E

40|$|Cavity {{formation}} {{resulting from}} the water-entry of solid objects {{has been the subject}} of extensive research owing to its practical relevance in naval, military, industrial, sports and biological applications. The cavity formed by an impacting hydrophobic sphere normally seals at two places, one below (deep seal) and the other above the water surface (<b>surface</b> <b>seal).</b> For Froude numbers, the air flow into the resulting cavity is strong enough to suck the splash crown above the surface and disrupt the cavity dynamics before it deep seals. In this research work we eliminate surface seals by means of a novel practice of using cone splash-guards and examine the undisturbed transient cavity dynamics by impact of hydrophobic spheres for Froude numbers ranging. This enabled the measurement of extremely accurate pinch-off heights, pinch-off times, radial cavity collapse rates, and jet speeds in an extended range of Froude numbers compared to the previous work of Duclaux et al. (2007). Results in the extended regime were in remarkable agreement with the theoretical prediction of scaled pinch-off depth, and experimentally derived pinch-off time for. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of confinement on cavity formation by varying the cross-sectional area of the tank of liquid. In conjunction with <b>surface</b> <b>seal</b> elimination we observed the formation of multiple pinch-off points where a maximum of four deep seals were obtained in a sequential order for the Froude number range investigated. The presence of an elongated cavity beneath the first pinch-off point 5 resulted in evident "kinks" primarily related to the greatly diminished air pressure at the necking region caused by supersonic air flows (Gekle et al. 2010). Such flows passing through second pinch-offs were also found to choke the cavities beneath the first pinch- off depths causing radial expansion and hence disappearance of downward jets...|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{identifying}} {{the influence of}} soil surface roughness from small to large aggregates (random roughness) on runoff and soil loss and to investigate the interaction with soil <b>surface</b> <b>seal</b> formation. Bulk samples of a silty clay loam soil were sieved to four aggregate-size classes of 3 to 12, 12 to 20, 20 to 45, 45 to 100 mm, and packed in soil trays set at a 5 % slope. Rainfall simulations using an oscillating nozzle simulator were conducted for 90 min at an average rainfall intensity of 50. 2 mm h(- 1). Soil surface roughness was measured using an instantaneous profile laser scanner and surface sealing was studied by macroscopic analysis of epoxy impregnated soil samples. The rainfall simulations revealed longer times to initiate runoff with increasing soil surface roughness. For random roughness levels up to 6 mm, a decrease in final runoff rate with increasing roughness was observed. This {{can be attributed to}} a decreased breakdown of the larger roughness elements on rougher surfaces, thus keeping infiltration rate high. For a random roughness larger than 6 mm, a greater final runoff rate was observed. This was caused by the creation of a thick depositional seal in the concentrated flow areas, thus lowering the infiltration rates. Analysis of impregnated soil sample blocks confirmed the formation of a structural <b>surface</b> <b>seal</b> on smooth surfaces, whereas thick depositional seals were visible in the depressional areas of rougher surfaces. Therefore, from our observations it can be learned that soil surface roughness as formed by the presence of different aggregate sizes reduces runoff but that its effect diminishes due to aggregate breakdown and the formation of thick depositional seals in the case of rough soil surfaces. Sediment concentration increased with increasing soil surface roughness, due to runoff concentration in flow paths. Nevertheless, final soil loss rates were comparable for all soil roughness categories, indicating that random roughness is only important in influencing runoff rates and the time to initiate runoff, but not in influencing sediment export through soil loss rates...|$|E

Soil <b>surface</b> <b>sealing</b> is a frequent phenomenon in dry environments.

Simulated mean soil moisture at the respective layers corresponding to both the ground validation probe and the radar beam’s typical effective penetration depth were considered. A cyclic pattern was found in which, as compared to an unsealed profile, the seal layer intensifies the bias in validation during rainfall events and substantially reduces it during subsequent drying periods. The analysis of this cyclic pattern showed that, accounting for soil moisture dynamics at the soil surface, the optimal time for soil sampling following a rainfall event is a few hours {{in the case of an}} unsealed system and a few days in the case of a <b>sealed</b> one. <b>Surface</b> <b>sealing</b> was found to increase the temporal stability of soil moisture.
