40|$|Historically, <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> {{have played}} a very {{important}} role in the provision of schooling in Australia. Numerically, using an enrolment of 200 or less, <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> represent approximately 45 % of the schools in Australia. Population growth and the consequences of this, in particular for food production, water and energy, mean that the significance of <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> is likely to increase into the future, because many <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> are in rural areas where the ‘basics for life’ are produced, managed or extracted. This in turn has implications for how <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> are valued and resourced by governments and policy-makers. Research undertaken in 2010 is used to identify potential major improvement in the preparation and support of leaders for <b>small</b> <b>schools,</b> given the importance of leadership to the effectiveness and impact of schooling...|$|R

5|$|Though {{the events}} finally {{stabilized}} during the 2000–01 season, the USAD administration changed dramatically that {{year when the}} program's executive director, James Alvino, resigned. Alvino had written a religious article that had been included in that year's Super Quiz Resource Guide. His critics and the USAD Board regarded the inclusion as a conflict of interest, as the material was a persuasive essay that heavily pushed Alvino's point of view. The season was also significant {{in that it was}} the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and <b>small</b> <b>school</b> champions to the national competition. (Small schools are currently classified as those schools with fewer than 650 students.) However, this practice was short-lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season. Instead, a <b>small</b> <b>school</b> e-Nationals was introduced during the 2005–06 school year. The medium school e-Nationals was established two years later for those schools with between 650 and 1,300 students. In 2010, California Academic Decathlon announced that a large school e-Nationals would be held for the second-highest performing school in each state.|$|E

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>schools</b> are {{an icon of}} New Zealand’s {{schooling}} system, {{but little}} attention has been focused on them outside the context of rural education. This historical study addresses the relationship between administrators and <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> in New Zealand to examine the part of <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> in the gradual centralisation of education. It examines how a centre-periphery framework contributes {{to an understanding of the}} relationship between the educational State and schools within the context of the relationship between the Auckland Education Board and <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> between 1877 and 1914. It suggests that systemic factors apart from peripheral geographical location contributed to tensions caused by the persistent numerical domination by <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> of the educational landscape. It proposes that <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> were gradually relegated to the periphery as part of the growth of central government within a nationalising discourse of uniformity and efficiency...|$|R

5|$|The {{appearance}} of features from The Art of War in other historical texts {{is considered to}} be proof of his historicity and authorship. Certain strategic concepts, such as terrain classification, are attributed to Sun Tzu. Their use in other works such as The Methods of the Sima is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority. According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name. It is argued that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a <b>small</b> <b>school</b> of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin. These descendants or students may have revised or expanded upon certain points in the original text.|$|E
