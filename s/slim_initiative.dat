40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is {{representation}} of companies {{in the light of the}} first EC-directive on company law. This directive was adopted as long ago as 1968 but it is still a current directive. Recently (september/october 1999) the SLIM (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) working group has presented recommendations for the simplification of the first and also the second EC-directive. The purpose of the <b>SLIM</b> <b>initiative</b> is not to harmonise regulation further, butt to slim it down. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|E
40|$|Reform of EU {{regulatory}} {{policy has been}} guided by two distinct policy streams {{in the wake of}} the legislative explosion of the Single Market program. Whereas the principle of subsidiary gave rise to a program of legislative review, concerns as to the competitiveness of European business also prompted greater attention towards legislative and administrative simplification. The paper argues that these reform movements have failed to bring about a radical, horizontal change to regulatory culture. Rather, the political forces which have been unleashed have been mediated by the institutional (organisational, procedural and normative) structure of EU governance. An institutionalist approach is taken to argue that institutional structures mediate political forces even when the object of the force is the institutional structure itself. The European Commission's Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market (<b>SLIM)</b> <b>initiative</b> and changes to Commission standard operating procedures are used as case studies for the institutionalist approach...|$|E
40|$|Mucin- 1 kidney disease, {{previously}} described as medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 (MCKD 1, OMIM 174000), is an autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease recently {{shown to be}} caused by a single-base insertion within the variable number tandem repeat region of the MUC 1 gene. Because of variable age of disease onset and often subtle signs and symptoms, clinical diagnosis of mucin- 1 kidney disease and differentiation from other forms of hereditary kidney disease have been difficult. The causal insertion resides in a variable number tandem repeat region with high GC content, which has made detection by standard next-generation sequencing impossible to date. The inherently difficult nature of this mutation required an alternative method for routine detection and clinical diagnosis of the disease. We therefore developed and validated a mass spectrometry–based probe extension assay with a series of internal controls to detect the insertion event using 24 previously characterized positive samples from patients with mucin- 1 kidney disease and 24 control samples known to be wild type for the variant. Validation results indicate an accurate and reliable test for clinically establishing the molecular diagnosis of mucin- 1 kidney disease with 100 % sensitivity and specificity across 275 tests called.

His contributions played a part in the establishment of the Society for Less Investigative Medicine (<b>SLIM),</b> an <b>initiative</b> formed to combat the excessive commercial practices prevalent in India.

50|$|Renaults were {{somewhat}} successful on both road and track, including the 1984 Espace launch, which was Europe's first multi-purpose vehicle, {{a dozen years}} before any competitor. However, Renault was losing a billion francs a month totaling 12.5 billion in 1984. The government intervened and Georges Besse was installed as chairman; he set about cutting costs dramatically, selling many of Renault's non-core assets (Volvo stake, Gitane, Eurocar and Renix), withdrawing almost entirely from motorsports and laying off many employees. This halved the deficit by 1986, but Besse was murdered by the communist terrorist group Action Directe in November 1986. He was replaced by Raymond Lévy, who continued Besse's <b>initiatives,</b> <b>slimming</b> the company enough {{that by the end}} of 1987, Renault was more or less financially stable. However, while Besse was convinced that Renault needed a presence in the North American market and wanted to push forward with restructuring American Motors, Lévy, facing domestic losses from Renault at home, and losses from American Motors in the United States, along with the political climate that led to Besse's assassination, decided to sell American Motors to Chrysler that same year.|$|R
