40|$|With the {{development}} of industrialized steel construction, new constructive elements have been brought {{not only to the}} market, but to the everyday construction site as well and, in this way professionals and users have questioned their efficiency. In respect to vibrations in floors, what can be detected is that floor structures are thinner and a decrease of the mass in the horizontal <b>closing</b> <b>panels</b> and the utilization of new materials and systems have led them to have lower natural frequencies, and so are nearer to the frequencies produced by walking. This decrease of mass of the <b>closing</b> <b>panels</b> also lead to a considerable weakness in terms of acoustical insulation, which can cause unfavorable conditions and discomfort. Thus, it becomes necessary to do detailed studies of the efficiency of the vibration and acoustical performance of the new systems to obtain the characterization and the qualification parameters in order to optimize their use. This study does a comparative evaluation of some kinds of horizontal and vertical closing systems in respect to the vibrational and acoustical insulation performance...|$|R

5000|$|Social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, WordPress and Blogspot, {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in democratic deliberations. The role of social media in e-democracy has been an emerging area for e-democracy, as well as related technological developments, such as argument maps and eventually, the semantic web. Another related development consists in combining the open communication of social networking with the structured communication of <b>closed</b> <b>panels</b> including experts and/or policy-makers, such as for example through modified versions of the Delphi method (HyperDelphi) to combine the open communication of self-organized virtual communities with the structured communication of <b>closed</b> <b>panels,</b> including members of the policy-community. [...] This approach addresses the question of how, in electronic democracy, to reconcile distributed knowledge and self-organized memories with critical control, responsibility and decision. The social networking entry point, for example, is within the citizens' environment, and the engagement is on the citizens' terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networks as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples of state usage {{can be found at}} The Official Commonwealth of Virginia Homepage, where citizens can find Google tools and open social forums. Those are seen as important stepping stones in the maturation of the concept of e-democracy.|$|R
500|$|The strip had no {{continuity}} or recurring characters, but {{a recurring}} theme: a character has a nightmare or other bizarre dream, usually after eating a Welsh rarebit—a cheese-on-toast dish. [...] The character awakens in the <b>closing</b> <b>panel</b> and regrets having eaten the rarebit. [...] The dreams often reveal unflattering {{sides of the}} dreamers' psyches—their phobias, hypocrisies, discomforts, and dark fantasies. [...] This was in great contrast to the colorful fantasy dreams in McCay's signature strip Little Nemo, which he began in 1905. [...] Whereas children were Nemos target audience, McCay aimed Rarebit Fiend at adults.|$|R
