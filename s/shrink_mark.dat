40|$|ABSTRACT: Flexible {{polyurethane}} foam is often molded directly into preheated tools for foaming reaction which expands {{to fill the}} mold cavity. The foam that is directly {{in contact with the}} mold surface cures as the foam skin. Parts frequently have surface defects ranging from <b>shrink</b> <b>marks,</b> to voids, to mottling, and knit lines. There are many possible causes such as applying {{too much or too little}} release agent, or mold surface not cleaned and conditioned as required before the foaming process. Uneven mold temperatures are also suspected to be a cause of surface defects, especially in high-resilience (HR) cold-cure {{polyurethane foam}} systems. A specially designed mold capable of maintaining tight temperature tolerance is built to produce foam samples at varying temperatures. The effects of mold surface temperature on the foam surface texture are studied and analyzed. The effect of processing temperature on the macro and micro surface texture is examined. It is shown that the processing temperature has a significant effect on the foam surface texture. Three-dimensional topographical analysis of foam surface texture has discovered a trend from samples produced at varying temperatures from 30 to 80 C.

After 23 hrs. the quadrifids and bifids {{in all three}} specimens abounded with minute, hyaline, spherical masses; {{and some of their}} primordial utricles were a little shrunk. Three bisected bladders were also irrigated with a fresh infusion of raw meat; and to my surprise the quadrifids in one of them appeared, after 23 hrs., finely granular, with their primordial utricles somewhat <b>shrunk</b> and <b>marked</b> with thickened yellowish specks; so that they had been acted on {{in the same manner as}} by the putrid infusion or by the salts of ammonia.

50|$|Players have {{a limited}} number of life marks (a default setting of three) and one mark is taken away for every hit of damage they take and {{whenever}} the timer runs out. A one-half mark is taken away for accidentally shooting a civilian in certain situations, but several one-half marks can be earned (even above the default amount) by covering allied squad members in other situations. When the life marks drop to zero or below, the game is over. Different from most Time Crisis games, clear warnings are given when an enemy has locked-on and is about to attack, usually {{in the form of a}} <b>shrinking</b> crosshair <b>mark</b> around an enemy's gun, or a yellow triangle around flying projectiles. As the player keeps progressing without taking damage, the warning time shrinks and projectiles travel faster, forcing the player to defend much more quickly and efficiently to avoid damage while moving forward, much like the Virtua Cop series.|$|R
40|$|Widespread {{recognition}} that economic inequality {{has been growing}} for forty years {{in most of the}} developed world, and in fact has tended to grow across most of the history of modern economies, shows that the period 1945 - 1973, when inequality of wealth and income <b>shrank,</b> was a <b>marked</b> anomaly in historical experience. At the time, however, the anomalous period of equality seemed to vindicate a long history of optimism about economic life: that growth would overcome meaningful scarcity and usher in an egalitarian and humanistic period that could almost qualify as post-economic. This has not been the experience of the last four decades. In this intellectual history of the anomalous period, we trace the main lines of that optimism and its undoing...|$|R

The phase {{was obtained from the}} elements in sealed Ta ampoules by annealing at 650 degrees C for 5 days. Samples were investigated by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, solid-state NMR, microstructure and chemical analysis. The substitution of Ge by Li atoms causes a <b>marked</b> <b>shrinking</b> of the lattice parameter. Studies by Li- 7 NMR confirmed the presence of Li in the clathrate phase and the Na- 23 and Cs- 133 NMR spectra consistently showed distinct changes as compared to the ternary Na (16) Cs- 8 Ge- 136. The SEDOR technique revealed a distance between Li and Cs atoms in agreement with the result of crystal structure refinement, indicating Li substitution at site 96 g. The distinct Knight shift of all NMR signals implies metallic behaviour of the clathrate phase, measurements of the magnetic susceptibility indicate diamagnetic behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Sustained drug {{delivery}} requires {{the use of}} multifunctional devices with enhanced properties. These properties include responsiveness to external stimuli (such as temperature, pH, ionic strength), ability to deliver suitably designed ligands to specific receptors, enhanced bioadhesion to cells, and cytocompatibility. Microgels represent one of such multifunctional {{drug delivery}} devices. Recently, we described the fabrication of a stable colloidal aqueous suspension of cytocompatible microgel spheres based on a poly(vinyl alcohol) /poly(methacrylate-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) network (Ghugare, S. Mozetic, P. Paradossi, G. Biomacromolecules 2009, 10, 1589). These microgel spheres undergo an entropy-driven volume phase transition around the physiological temperature, this phase transition being driven by the incorporation of NiPAAm residues in the network. In that study, the microgel was loaded with the anticancer drug doxorubicin. As the microgel <b>shrank,</b> a <b>marked</b> increase in the amount of doxorubicin released was noted. Indeed, dynamic light scattering measurements showed the diameter reduction to be about 50 %. In the present paper, we focus on some fundamental issues regarding modifications of the hydrogel architecture at a nanoscopic level {{as well as of the}} diffusive behavior of water associated with the polymer network around the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). Sieving and size exclusion effects were studied by laser scanning confocal microscopy with the microgel exposed to fluorescent probes with different molecular weights. Confocal microscopy observations at room temperature and at 40 degrees C (i. e., below and above the VPTT) provided an evaluation of the variation of the average pore size (from 5 nm to less than 3 nm). Using quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) with the IRIS spectrometer at ISIS, UK, the diffusive behavior of water molecules closely associated to the polymer network around the VPTT was investigated. A clear change in the values of diffusion coefficient of bound water was observed at the transition temperature. In addition, the local dynamics of the polymer itself was probed using the QENS spectrometer SPHERES at FRM II, Germany. For this study, the microgel was swollen in D(2) O. An average characteristic distance of about 5 A for the localized chain motions was evaluated from the elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF) and from the Q-dependence of the Lorentzian width...|$|R
40|$|In clays and clayey soil of {{different}} composition, {{the capacity for}} absorbing gas-works-specific and environmentally relevant hydrocarbons and associated microstructure changes were investigated by means of column and batch experiments. Striking differences were observed both as to the absorption capacity and absorption behaviour of the clays and the investigated hydrocarbons, which testifies {{to the complexity of}} the subject. Contact of water-saturated clays with non-polar hydrocarbons entailed <b>marked</b> <b>shrinking</b> with increasing contamination of the soil samples. The sensitivity of clays increases as the cation exchange capacity of the dominant clay mineral decreases. Owing to the contraction of the contact water film of the clay. (orig. /EF) An verschieden zusammengesetzten Tonen und tonigen Boeden wurde unter Verwendung von Saeulen- und Batchversuchen das Adsorptionsvermoegen gegenueber gaswerksspezifischen und umweltrelevanten Kohlenwasserstoffen und die damit verbundenen Mikrogefuegeaenderungen untersucht. Dabei zeigten sich deutliche Unterschiede, sowohl in der Adsorptionskapazitaet, wie auch in dem Adsorptionsverhalten der Tone bzw. der untersuchten Kohlenwasserstoffe und belegt die Komplexitaet des Themenbereiches. Der Kontakt wassergesaettigter Tone mit unpolaren Kohlenwasserstoffen fuehrte zu einer deutlichen Schrumpfung mit steigender Kontamination der Bodenproben. Die Empfindlichkeit der Tone steigt mit abnehmender Kationenaustauschkapazitaet des dominierenden Tonmineralgehaltes. Durch die Kontraktion des Haftwasserfilmes der Tonminerale werden bevorzugte Wegigkeiten in Form von Schrumpfrissen und Makroporen geoeffnet. Die Durchlaessigkeit steigt sprunghaft auf sehr hohe Werte an, die Konvektion dominiert den Prozess.
