50|$|The most {{commonly}} used instruments for cord cutting include a <b>sickle,</b> <b>knife,</b> bamboo stick, and razor. These instruments are rarely washed thoroughly before and after being implemented. If placental delivery is not occurring, some methods used to remove the placenta include procedures that require internal manipulation. This can be anything from pulling on the umbilical cord to inducing choking or vomiting in the mother. Once the placenta is removed and cut, mustard oil and turmeric are often used for cord dressing. Depending on the ethnic backgrounds, different customs are applied for the disposal of the placenta. Some believe that if the placenta touches the soil, or if an animal eats the placenta, the child will fall ill. So many tend to bury the placenta or throw it into thick bamboo bushes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Community {{creative}} industry {{based on}} metal as {{the raw material}} recently has been growing rapidly, for example manufacturing of farming equipment such as hoe, <b>sickle,</b> <b>knife,</b> or others household equipment. The capacities of these creative industries are depended on ability of industry in providing raw material and ability in adopting technology. The higher adopting technology, then industry will have much opportunity to compete in global market. Even though these industries have ability to compete in global market, most of these creative industries have not understand about the mapping of technology adoption developed. This condition make them difficult in determining strategy of short term or long term business development. This condition will affect to profit that will be earned. In this research, there will be survey to five metal industries by using questionnaire, those are: (A) Technometric, that is assessment of sophistication of technoware, humanware, inforware, and organware. The weighting of each component is determined by {{state of the art}} rating, while normalization and calculation of total contribution are by making map of relation of each component. (B) data compilation of pair weighted comparative, consistency ratio of each respondent, and geometric average calculation. Data processing is using "pairwise comparison" approach.

2500|$|The {{influence}} of the Carmelite missionaries became stronger after a visit by the Portuguese Friar Victoriano Pimentel in 1702. Pimentel discovered quickly that the Amazonians were interested in metal tools and other trade goods {{and that they could}} be persuaded to abandon the Jesuits by offerings of [...] "hatchets, <b>sickles,</b> <b>knives,</b> fishhooks, pins, needles, ribbons, mirrors, reliquaries, rings and pieces of wire for their earrings." ...|$|R
50|$|Village farmers {{typically}} sow in {{concentric circles}} around the farm. Hedges surround the farm to keep away animals. Farming tools are typically simple hoes, <b>sickles,</b> <b>knives,</b> and machetes. Farmland is burnt during the dry season, then crops are planted at the first rains. These farms can be quite extensive, as in the Mandara Mountains area. Here, farms climb up the mountain slopes in terraces {{held in place by}} stones.|$|R

5000|$|By 1640, {{with the}} {{dissolution}} of the Iberian Union, the Spanish were expelled by inhabitants of Cedros. As the story goes, masked and armed residents of Cedros with pitchforks, <b>sickles,</b> <b>knives</b> and hoes, ordered the local residents to collect their clothing and leave the parish. Driving them towards Horta, the Cedrenses accompanied the Spanish as far as Alto da Ribeirinha (in the neighboring parish of Ribeirinha). As they returned from the expulsion, the inhabitants discovered many of the Spanish clothing lying along the route. From there on, the area became known as Espalhafatos which literally means [...] "scattered suits", referring to the ornamented clothing found scattered along the route.|$|R

'We {{must not}} forget the gallant part taken in this affair by the two {{divisions}} of the Rozadores irregulars, who were provided with <b>sickles,</b> <b>knives,</b> and other weapons by the armoury of La Laguna. One division of forty peasants was placed under the Marquess del Prado and the Viscount de Buenpaso, who both, though not military men, hastened to the town when the attack was no longer doubtful. The other body of thirty-five men was committed to Don Simon de Lara, already mentioned amongst the wounded. In {{the heat of the}} affair and the darkness of night the first division was somewhat scattered as it entered the streets leading to the Barranco Santo (watercourse), where the Canarian battalion was attacking the English as they landed. The Marquess, after escaping the enemy, who for half an hour surrounded without recognising him, and expecting instant death, attempted to cross the small square of Santo Domingo to the Plaza of the Citadel. He was prevented from so doing by the voices of the attacking party posted in the little place. He therefore retired to {{the upper part of the}} town, and took post on the Convent-flank. The Viscount marched his men to the square of the Citadel, where they were detained by Lieutenant Jorva to reinforce the post and to withdraw a field-gun that had been dangerously placed in the street of San Josef.|$|R

In general terms, chipped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in all pre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the tool stone is usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.|$|R
25|$|M. oleifera can be {{cultivated}} for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for {{oil extraction}} and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation. Harvest is done manually with <b>knives,</b> <b>sickles,</b> and stabs with hooks attached. Pollarding, coppicing and lopping or pruning are recommended to promote branching, increase production and facilitate harvesting.|$|R
50|$|Funerary {{practices}} {{continued the}} Bronze Age tradition of burning corpses and placing the remains in urns, {{a characteristic of}} the Urnfield culture. During the previous centuries, influences from the Central European La Tène culture spread to Scandinavia from north-western Germany, and there are finds from this period from all the provinces of southern Scandinavia. Archaeologists have found swords, shield bosses, spearheads, scissors, <b>sickles,</b> pincers, <b>knives,</b> needles, buckles, kettles, etc. from this time. Bronze continued {{to be used for}} torcs and kettles, the style of which were continuous from the Bronze Age. Some of the most prominent finds from the pre-Roman Iron Age in northern Europe are the Gundestrup cauldron and the Dejbjerg wagons, two four-wheeled wagons of wood with bronze parts.|$|R
25|$|The Yaz culture (or Yaz-depe, Yaz Depe, Yaz Tepe) was {{an early}} Iron Age culture of Margiana, Bactria and Sogdia (ca. 1500–1000 BC). It emerges {{at the top of}} late Bronze Age sites (BMAC), {{sometimes}} as stone towers and sizeable houses associated with irrigation systems. Ceramics were mostly hand-made, but there was increasing use of wheel-thrown ware. There have been found bronze or iron arrowheads, also iron <b>sickles</b> or carpet <b>knives</b> among other artifacts.|$|R
50|$|Initially iron was {{valuable}} {{and was used}} for decoration. The oldest objects were needles, but swords and sickles are found as well. Bronze continued to be used during the whole period but was mostly used for decoration. The traditions were a continuity from the Nordic Bronze Age, but there were strong influences from the Hallstatt culture in Central Europe. They continued with the Urnfield culture tradition of burning corpses and placing the remains in urns. During the last centuries, influences from the Central European La Tène culture spread to Scandinavia from northwestern Germany, and there are finds from this period from all the provinces of southern Scandinavia. From this time archaeologists have found swords, shieldbosses, spearheads, scissors, <b>sickles,</b> pincers, <b>knives,</b> needles, buckles, kettles, etc. Bronze continued {{to be used for}} torques and kettles, the style of which were a continuity from the Bronze Age.

In the film, Agni Shridhar narrates the preview as story of Kotwal Ramachandra era (1975) coincidentally with {{declaration}} of emergency by Indira Gandhi, which led to grooming of M. P. Jayaraj as the uncrowned don of Bangalore mostly working with <b>Knives,</b> <b>Sickles,</b> Machetes for terrorising people. Eventually he seems to have got jailed for contempt of court for 10 years. When he returns in 1985, after the death of Indira Gandhi he finds Kotwal Ramachandra to have taken his spot.

The boline is often confused or mislabelled the [...] "white-handled knife", a completely different magical blade. In fact, a boline was more similar to a <b>sickle</b> than a <b>knife</b> and thus would have made chopping herbs very difficult (the boline was, however, handy for harvesting herbs).

50|$|The Tagar {{culture was}} preceded by the Karasuk culture. The Tagars have been {{described}} by archaeologists as exhibiting pronounced Europoid features. They {{are believed to have}} belonged to the Scythian circle. They lived in timber dwellings heated by clay ovens and large hearths. Some settlements were surrounded by fortifications. They made a living by raising livestock, predominantly large horned livestock and horses, goats and sheep. Harvest was collected with bronze <b>sickles</b> and reaping <b>knives.</b> The Tagar produced animal art motifs (Scythian art) very similar to the Scythians of southern European Russia. Perhaps the most striking feature of the culture are huge royal kurgans fenced by stone plaques, with four vertical stelae marking the corners. The Tagar culture was succeeded by the Tashtyk culture.|$|R
40|$|In some Hispanic Celtic cemeteries {{there are}} grave good with {{elements}} of daily life. Pieces related with home and productive and / or economic activities. They are {{objects in the}} tombs associated with weapons and / or items of clothing together into packages that accompanied the deceased to the afterlife. Among those related to home we include trivets, grills or barbecues, whose presence in funerary objects is interpreted in relation with the celebration of funeral feasts. They are elements still sporadic appearance in the Celtiberian territory. They are also documented tools to agricultural, livestock and craft economic activities, in Celtiberian areas. Their presence is also poor, but offers a varied repertoire, including <b>sickles,</b> pruning <b>knives,</b> axes, scissors and awls or punches.

2500|$|People supplicated God and saints for {{protection}} against those calamities, {{but they also}} resorted to magic practices. There was a widespread practice of [...] "cutting" [...] clouds and hail {{by means of an}} axe, scythe, <b>sickle,</b> hoe, or <b>knife.</b> Noticing the approach of a hail cloud, farmers would stand in their house yard and wave toward it with one of those implements, or place it with the blade turned toward the cloud. Some chased hail away by firing from rifles or small simple mortars called prangija. They also tried to propitiate the bringer of the elements, as in the custom of placing a dining table with bread and salt on it in the yard. The table could have been used for [...] "cutting" [...] as well, for which purpose it was placed with its legs directed skywards; the same was done with tripods. In other practices farmers used objects that had been part of annual festivities and family observances, counting on the protective influence of the sacred power with which these objects were consequently imbued. Some of the customs were performed only by women, others only by men, and still others by men and women together. The gender could depend on what object was used, e.g., the scythe was seen as a masculine tool and the sickle as a feminine one, but there were practices for which the gender was irrelevant.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} two burials from the Kuban basin region {{excavated}} in Pashkovsky burial mound no. 2 belonging to Maeotian Pashkovskoe ancient settlement. The burials {{were made in}} catacombs of similar construction and orientation. The narrow grave entrances and grave chambers are situated in-line. The grave chambers of the catacombs adjoin one other that probably {{was the reason for}} plunder of a little earlier burial no. 2. There were the complete horse skeleton, the cow skull and the sheep chap in the grave entrance ofthe catacomb no. 2. A skeleton of a man (about 50 years old) was in extended supine position diagonally across the grave chamber, his scull had SSW orientation. Grave goods found near the buried man include the gray-clay bowl and the mug-jar, the iron spearhead, the long sword and the dagger, the bit with wheel-shaped cheek-pieces, the <b>sickle,</b> the <b>knives</b> and the shoe buckles, the glass bead, the chalk rock bead, the bronze buckle and fibula. The catacomb no. 2 plundered in ancient times situated north-ward of the first one, the southern border of the grave chamber is partially cutted by catacomb no. 1. In the grave entrance of the catacomb no. 1 there were the remains of the horse skeleton and the sheep skull. Grave goods scattered in grave chamber included the gray-clay bowl, pieces of chalk, the bronze ring, fragments of the iron buckle, rod, hasp, silver temple ring, bronze escutcheon for the box lock, the iron snap-up loop and fragments of silver flacon with a cover. Late Sarmatian burial rites and grave goods give evidence of the belonging these burials to spokesmen of the equestrian order.

40|$|The {{study of}} the use-wear marks on the Neolithic reaping knives {{from the site of}} Egolzwil 3 (Switzerland, late fifth {{millennium}} cal BC) shows that these tools were used to reap cereals by cutting the stems near the ground. The stems were gathered together using the pointed distal end, held in the free hand and cut with the flint blade, in what we term a two-stage reaping method. These types of <b>sickles</b> or reaping <b>knives</b> are found at Neolithic sites in the northern Mediterranean (centre and north of the Iberian Peninsula, Provence in France and continental Italy) from the mid-sixth millennium, {{in the context of the}} early Neolithic Cardial Culture, and lasted until the early fourth millennium. Within the tradition of twostage reaping knives, the Egolzwil type would have been adapted to reaping at a low height in very dense cereal fields. These tools show that the Neolithic groups in the Swiss central plain belonged to the circle of northern Mediterranean farming technical traditions, in their northernmost expression, in contact with the groups in south Germany who reaped with curved sickles whose flint elements were inserted obliquely. This study was carried out thanks to the collaboration of the Museum of Zürich and Archaeological Centre of Lucerne Canton.

50|$|The first {{settlement}} {{within the}} limits of present-day Carmona rose about 4500 years ago and spread across the plateau, the people preferring to occupy the higher elevations and slopes of the hills that dominate the fertile plain of the Corbones and the terraces that descend gradually to the Guadalquivir. There is evidence of Chalcolithic remains at the Alcázar de Arriba (Alcázar del Rey Don Pedro), in the Barranquillo and Picacho barrios, and much more diffusely, in the San Blas neighborhood.As of 2012, there were no clear archaeological data to provide information about the ancient village, such as its physical configuration and economy, since documented remains are scarce and widely scattered. Excavations in a building plot on the street Calle Dolores Quintanilla have yielded some information about the earliest history of Carmona; apparently the town was formed by the merger of hut houses and granaries. The huts were circular, about 2-2.5 m in diameter and partially excavated in the rock with an elevation formed by a small plinth of stone and covered with branches plastered with mud. The silos next to the huts were circular, with a flared or truncated cone profile; these were also excavated in rock, and used to store grain. Following their usage-life, these underground structures were gradually filled with debris, including tools such as handmade ceramics, <b>sickle</b> blades and <b>knives</b> carved of stone, awls made of bone, and remnants of copper smelting slag, along with numerous bones of animals that served as food.|$|R
40|$|U radu se raspravlja o postojanju običaja polaganja kovanica u kasnosrednjovjekovne i ranonovovjekovne grobove na prostoru sjeverne Hrvatske i simboličnom značenju toga novca. Osim putem arheoloških nalaza, ovo pitanje se pokušava rasvijetliti i na temelju etnološke literature. This paper {{focuses on}} the custom of {{enclosing}} coins in the graves of the deceased on late mediaeval and early modern cemeteries in northern Croatia. The main problem encountered while studying this custom {{is the lack of}} multidisciplinary research of the cemeteries of the mentioned time period and especially the lack of high quality publications. The discoveries from the graves can mainly be divided into three categories: 1. parts of traditional costumes, 2. jewellery and 3. objects tied to religious beliefs. The last category can further be divided into two groups. One group would consist of devotionals (crosses, rosaries, medallions of saints [...] .) which were relatively frequent in early modern graves and depict the personal religiousness of the deceased within the regular Catholic system. The other group consists of objects which can be linked to superstitious or popular beliefs which were maintained parallel with the official religion. This group of symbolic objects is comprised of scissors, <b>knives,</b> <b>sickles,</b> locks, keys, animal teeth and coins. Regardless of the Christian (mainly Catholic) ban of enclosing contributions in graves, coins can be found in many cemeteries from this time period. Coins are commonly connected to the Greek myth about Haron in archaeological literature. The ethnological data, which is much closer to the observed graves in terms of time and culture, gives a much more diverse range of reasons for the monetary contributions - so the deceased can pay for their house, to pay for peace on Earth, to pay for their space, to prevent them from becoming a vampire, to not return, to not leave empty handed, to be paid out, to pay out for the remaining estate or cattle so the deceased would not pull it with them. The coins also served as a reward for paying for the transport, crossing the river, transport to the island of the Blessed, for paying off space or a house in the other world or so that the deceased can pay off his sins. Within the Christian context, as we can see, money and other objects which are occasionally included get a new purpose and serve as a help to the deceased in the passage from life to death and on their journey through purgatory and renewed life during Judgment Day. Based on the archaeological and ethnological data, we can therefore cite several reasons for enclosing coins in a grave on late mediaeval and early modern graves: 1. coins ended up in the grave by accident. 2. coins were placed in the grave next to the deceased on purpose. In this case, the coins had a symbolic role and served {{for the protection of the}} living from the deceased or for numerous necessities the deceased may have had in the other world. 3. coins served as decoration, they were placed in the grave because they were sewn onto clothing or repurposed for jewellery 4. coins which are the personal ownership of the deceased. They were placed into the grave as part of a sack on a belt or sewn/hidden in the clothing of the deceased. 5. other reasons which cannot be interpreted to date...|$|R
