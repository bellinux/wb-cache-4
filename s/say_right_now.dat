If any of them get stuck, you go around yourself and guarantee their credit with the butchers and grocers. And you trim down that pay-roll accordingly.

5000|$|Methos {{is portrayed}} as having a dry sense of humor, a pessimistic view on life, a witty repertoire, and a {{somewhat}} loyal devotion to his friends. He's also very untrusting of people, has been accused by others as putting himself first, as being arrogant, and as being manipulative. When in conversations with both Duncan and Richie, his manner is often {{comparable to that of}} a sarcastic old man (who hasn't managed to die yet), with his tendency to be right being rather annoying to his friends. Ironically, Methos looks younger than most Immortals in the series, being physically stuck at ca. 25-35, causing his mannerisms to clash with his appearance. He has also the habit of saying [...] "yes" [...] after each sentence if he wants to emphasize whatever he is <b>saying</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Methos is a method actor, being able to completely become whatever identity he has taken on at the time, but is able to switch to a far darker tone within a moment, surprising most people, and making them unsure of what to think of the [...] "old man".|$|R
5000|$|Jamaican singer Grace Jones {{recorded}} a reggae re-imagining {{of the song}} on her 1980 album Warm Leatherette.

5000|$|On {{the first}} {{overtime}} attempt with two laps to go, Kyle Busch tried for {{the inside of}} Bowman going into the first turn, but Bowman went down to block him and got sideways. This put him at an awkward angle going into the turn and resulted in him inadvertently [...] "punting" [...] Kenseth out of the groove and into the wall, bringing out the ninth caution. “Is there anything I can do or <b>say</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> to make it better?” Kenseth asked after the race. “The only thing I can do or <b>say</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is make things worse, so really I’m just trying not to do that.” He added that feeling disappointment [...] "would put it lightly. It finished our season. Five minutes before that, it looked like {{we were going to}} have a chance to go race for a championship." [...] Busch took the blame for what happened afterwards saying [...] "I guess I wrecked a teammate. I feel horrible about it … Right now, it feels really (expletive), but tomorrow it might feel a lot better. … The 20 should have been the Gibbs car to (advance)." [...] Logano after the race said he [...] "saw Kyle getting a run on him and I was like, 'Oh, boy! I knew Kyle was going to go three wide, and he has to. He's racing for a championship. That's the desperation that sets in." [...] He was also scored as the race leader.|$|E
5000|$|After {{studying}} the images, National Geographic senior editor John Echave said, [...] "They are interesting anomalies, but that's {{as much as}} anyone can <b>say</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> but I'm no expert on sonar and until we are able to actually go down there and see, {{it will be difficult to}} characterize them." [...] Professor of oceanography Robert Ballard was quoted as saying, [...] "That's too deep, I'd be surprised if it was human. You have to ask yourself, how did it get there? I've looked at a lot of sonar images in my life, and it can be sort of like looking at an ink blot -- people can sometimes see what they want to see. I'll just wait for a bit more data." ...|$|E

5000|$|Van Gogh {{describes}} Jeanne Trabuc as a [...] "washed-out {{kind of a}} woman, and unhappy, resigned {{creature of}} little consequence and so insignificant that I have a great desire to paint this dusty blade of grade.

He declared that traditional influence in a modern government was out of place. On a separate issue, he said that traditional objections to interracial marriage were an obstacle to peace and stability in Fiji.|$|E
