500|$|Foss {{is named}} by English Heritage as the {{principal}} advocate for [...] "Redemore" [...] as the battle site. He suggests the name is derived from [...] "Hreod Mor", an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means [...] "reedy marshland". Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes [...] "Redemore" [...] was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of Dadlington, and {{was close to the}} Fenn Lanes, a Roman road running east to west across the region. [...] Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield. [...] Williams dismisses the notion of [...] "Redmore" [...] as a specific location, saying that the term refers to a large area of reddish soil; Foss argues that Williams's sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records. [...] Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by William Hutton's 1788 The Battle of Bosworth-Field, which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill {{on the north side of}} the River <b>Sence.</b> [...] Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, Raphael Holinshed's 1577 Chronicle. Holinshed wrote, [...] "King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest." [...] Foss believes that Hutton mistook [...] "field" [...] to mean [...] "field of battle", thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill.

60|$|Wise. You say well, and I {{will add}} {{a word or}} two more to what I have said: Repentance, as it is not {{produced}} without a sight and <b>sence</b> of sin, so every sight and <b>sence</b> of sin cannot produce it: I mean, every sight and <b>sence</b> of sin cannot {160c} produce that Repentance, that is Repentance unto salvation; repentance never to be repented of. For it is yet fresh before us, that Mr. Badman had a sight and <b>sence</b> of sin, in that fit of sickness that he had before, but it dyed without procuring any such godly fruit; as was manifest by his so soon returning with the Dog to his Vomit. Many people think also that Repentance stands in Confession of sin only, but they are very much mistaken: For Repentance, as was said before, is a being sorry for, and a turning from transgression to God by Jesus Christ. Now, if this be true, that every sight and <b>sence</b> of sin will not produce Repentance, then Repentance cannot be produced there where there is no sight and <b>sence</b> of sin. That every sight and <b>sence</b> of sin will not produce repentance, to wit, the godly repentance that we are speaking of, is manifest in Cain, Pharaoh, Saul and Judas, who all of them had <b>sence,</b> great <b>sence</b> of sin, but none of them repentance unto life.|$|E

During the Canaries expedition (circa 1586), to beguile the tedium of his voyage, he composed his prose tale of Rosalynde, Euphues Golden Legacie, which, printed in 1590, afterwards furnished {{the story of}} Shakespeare's As You Like It. The novel, which in its turn owes some, though no very considerable, debt to the medieval Tale of Gamelyn (unwarrantably appended to the fragmentary Cookes Tale in certain manuscripts of Geoffrey Chaucer's works), is written in the euphuistic manner, but decidedly attractive both by its plot and by the situations arising from it. It has been frequently reprinted. Before starting on his second expedition he had published a historical romance, The History of Robert, Second Duke of Normandy, surnamed Robert the Devil; and he left behind him for publication Catharos Diogenes in his Singularity, a discourse on the immorality of Athens (London).

40|$|Conjectures {{about the}} Cretaceous and post−Cretaceous verte− brate faunas of Madagascar are {{generally}} {{based on the}} fact that these faunas display similarities to those of South America, and that Africa lacks taxa that are common to Madagascar and South America. In order to account for this distribution, two ways of dispersal bypassing Africa have been proposed. Averianov et al.

This challenges the southern route Krause et al.

Obviously, this debate implies that the role of Africa as an inter− vening landmass between Madagascar and either Laurasia or Gond− wanan areas is ruled out. In my opinion, this means that the absence of numerous taxa in Africa (more specifically, taxa present in South America and Madagascar, but lacking in Africa) represents true ab− <b>sences</b> (these taxa never entered Africa), not an artefact (these taxa are lacking in Africa because they have not been recovered yet).

40|$|Cognitive {{skills of}} dogs {{is a very}} complex and broad topic. They {{consists}} of some distinctive parts which have to be studied deeply and as a consequence to interconnect the pieces of knowledge. To begin with, we start our analyses with the anatomical and physiological aspect of the dog´s brain function and its particular <b>sences</b> which are cruicial for learning about the world and its understanding. We continue with the processing of the gained stimuli. For the dog {{to be able to use}} their gained knowledge for further life, they necessarilly have to be able to remember them. This is why we touch the boundary to the memory part. The proper learning and motivation themselves are one of the biggest issues. It is the motivation which leads the dog to the learning. Certainly, domestication and cooperation with the dog´s new partner - man - has had a great influence on the cognitive skills during the evolution. The dog had to learn to differenciate the human signals as well as to read in the human face. We could perfectly point out on the wide range of differences in the bahaviour understanding of wolves and comtemporary domesticated dogs. While studying the cognitive skills of dogs we are facing a complex and wide sets of test which are to clarify dog´s thinking and problem solving. Based on those tests, the dog is seen as a very intellingent and at the same time independent creature, which understands very quickly and which can handle many sitiations in a flexible and complex way. The dog can also use its experience for their benefit. Cognitive dysfunction Syndrom by dogs is a distinctive chapter. Of course, the biggest influence on the dysfunction to come clear and be displayed is the age of the dog. After their 8 years the efficiency and life standard deteriorate drastically. It is necesarry to determine and detect such dysfunction and start to compensate it. Either by suitable and appropriate medical cure or by regular trainings with the owners. The truth is that the majority of owners still do not pay full attention to the worsing condition of their dog. What is more, they do not know about it nor do they have motivation and taste fot testing in veterinary premises. As a matter of fact, it is important to bring the education there, especially to the owners of older dogs...|$|R
