40|$|SUMMARY: We {{are proposing}} interpretive {{guidance}} for management regarding its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. The interpretive guidance sets forth an approach by which management can conduct a top-down, risk-based evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. The proposed guidance {{is intended to}} assist companies of all sizes to complete their annual evaluation in an effective and efficient manner and it provides guidance {{on a number of}} areas commonly cited as concerns over the past two years. In addition, we are proposing an amendment <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rules</b> requiring management’s annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting {{to make it clear that}} an evaluation that complies with the interpretive guidance is one way to satisfy those rules. Further, we are proposing an amendment <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> revise the requirements regarding the auditor’s attestation report on the assessment of internal control over financial reporting...|$|R
