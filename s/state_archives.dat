5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of <b>state</b> <b>archives,</b> and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{issues of}} the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser are {{maintained}} by four known institutions. The American Antiquarian Society Newspaper Project in Worcester, Massachusetts, maintains a 1852 issue of the newspaper; West Virginia University Libraries in Morgantown, West Virginia, maintain issues dating from 1852, 1853, 1856, 1857, and 1859; the West Virginia <b>State</b> <b>Archives</b> in Charleston, West Virginia, maintain an issue dated July 5, 1851; and the Duke University Libraries in Durham, North Carolina, maintain issues dating between 1858 and 1861. The Library of Virginia in Richmond, Virginia also maintains microforms of {{issues of the}} Virginia Argus dating from 1852, 1853, 1856, 1857, and 1859.|$|E
5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over {{limited access to}} Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state law passed in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the <b>state</b> <b>archives.</b> Many records were published on the state archives' Web site in early 2005.|$|E

5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage. These remains were apparently forgotten in the Russian <b>State</b> <b>Archives</b> until 1993, when they were re-found. In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the skull fragment, which Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler's. According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and {{the examination of the}} sutures where the skull plates come together placed her age at less than 40 years old. The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2015 it was {{announced}} that the remains of Maria and Alexei, which had been in storage in the <b>state</b> <b>archives</b> for 8 years, are to be buried alongside their family on October 15, 2015. However, the Russian Government has given the Russian Orthodox Church permission to do one last DNA test of the two Romanov children against DNA from a blood stained cloth from their great-grandfather Emperor Alexander II, who was killed by a bomb and their aunt Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna.|$|E
5|$|The Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu (<b>State</b> <b>Archives</b> of Wolfenbüttel, 6 Urk 11) is the dower {{document}} for the Byzantine princess Theophanu. Written in Latin, {{the document}} {{was created in the}} Early Middle Ages after the marriage of Theophanu to Emperor Otto II in 972, which made her the Holy Roman Empress. The document was prepared by Otto II and exemplifies an instance of political and cultural contact between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. It serves as an example of Ottonian Renaissance art, and the calligraphy of the manuscript has led it to be {{regarded as one of the}} most beautiful diplomatic documents of the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document. It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the document was transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the document was transferred to the <b>State</b> <b>Archives</b> of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|The J. W. Long Law Library has 296,000 volumes and {{microform}} equivalents, {{which include}} {{both state and}} federal primary law sources, as well as treatises, periodicals and other secondary legal sources. The three-story structure {{is attached to the}} Collins Legal Center and contains study rooms, video rooms, conference rooms, and computer labs, and it is staffed by reference librarians. Additionally, it has special collections in tax law, public international law, and labor law, and it is a Selective Federal Government Documents Depository. Members of the public may access the library when the library is staffed by librarians. Law students also have access to Willamette University's Mark O. Hatfield Library, the Oregon Supreme Court Law Library, the Oregon State Library, and the Oregon <b>State</b> <b>Archives.</b>|$|E
5|$|MD 70 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 450 (College Avenue) in downtown Annapolis. This intersection {{is next to}} Government House, the residence of the Governor of Maryland, and one block north of the Maryland State House. MD 70 heads northwest for two blocks as Bladen Street, a four-lane divided boulevard that passes between state office buildings, including the offices {{of members of the}} Maryland General Assembly. At Calvert Street, the highway's name changes to Roscoe Rowe Boulevard. A two-lane ramp splits from southbound MD 70 just south of {{the southern end of the}} highway's bridge over College Creek, the point at which maintenance responsibility changes from the city of Annapolis to the state. The highway passes between several sets of government offices, including the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Maryland <b>State</b> <b>Archives,</b> leading up to its intersection with MD 435 (Taylor Avenue). MD 70 passes to the east of Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium before crossing Weems Creek and leaving the city of Annapolis. The highway meets US 50 and US 301 (John Hanson Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Beyond the interchange, MD 70 curves to the west and intersects Bestgate Road and Tidewater Colony Drive; the latter street leads to the historic home Howard's Inheritance. The highway continues along Bestgate Road and becomes a four-lane road with a center turn lane before reaching its northern terminus at an arbitrary point west of Compton Drive and Willie Drive. Bestgate Road continues west as a county highway toward the Annapolis Mall in the center of Parole.|$|E
