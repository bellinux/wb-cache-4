2500|$|At the time, {{solar panels}} were not {{practical}} at Jupiter's {{distance from the}} Sun; the spacecraft would have needed a minimum of [...] of panels. Chemical batteries would likewise be prohibitively large due to technological limitations. The solution was two radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) which powered the spacecraft through the radioactive decay of plutonium-238. The heat emitted by this decay was converted into electricity through the solid-state <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effect.</b> This provided a reliable and long-lasting source of electricity unaffected by the cold environment and high-radiation fields in the Jovian system.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{investigate}} the spin-dependent thermoelectric effects of parallel-coupled double quantum dots embedded in an AB interferometer, {{in which the}} RSOI in each QD is considered by introducing a spin-dependent phase factor in the linewidth matrix elements. Due to the quantum destructive interference, an asymmetrical transmission node {{can be observed in}} the transmission spectrum {{in the absence of the}} RSOI. Using an inversion asymmetrical interface electric field, the RSOI can be introduced in the QDs. The asymmetrical transmission node splits into two spin-dependent asymmetrical transmission nodes in the transmission spectrum and, as a consequence, results in the enhancement of the spin-dependent <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effects</b> near the spin-dependent asymmetrical transmission nodes. We also examine the evolution of spin-dependent <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effects</b> from a symmetrical parallel geometry to a configuration in series. The asymmetrical couplings between QDs and non-ferromagnetic electrodes induce the enhancement of spin-dependent <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effects</b> in the vicinity of spin-dependent asymmetrical transmission nodes. Although the spin-dependent <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effects</b> in the AB interferometer have not been realized experimentally so far, our theoretical study provides a better way to enhance spin-dependent <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effects</b> in the AB interferometer in the absence of the ferromagnetic materials.|$|R

Due to the interplay between the quantum destructive interference and RSOI in the QDs, an asymmetrical transmission node {{can be observed in}} the transmission spectrum {{in the absence of the}} RSOI. Using an inversion asymmetrical interface electric field, we can induce the RSOI in the QDs. We find that the asymmetrical transmission node splits into two spin-dependent asymmetrical transmission nodes in the transmission spectrum, which induces that the spin-dependent <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effects</b> are enhanced strongly at different energy regimes. We also examine the evolution of spin-dependent <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effects</b> from a symmetrical parallel geometry to a configuration in series.

50|$|Note {{that the}} voltage shift {{expressed}} by the <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effect</b> cannot be measured directly, since the measured voltage (by attaching a voltmeter) contains an additional voltage contribution, due to the temperature gradient and <b>Seebeck</b> <b>effect</b> in the measurement leads.
