5|$|While {{the initial}} <b>steer</b> torque and <b>steer</b> angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained <b>steer</b> angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained <b>steer</b> torque required to maintain that <b>steer</b> angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained <b>steer</b> angle and sustained <b>steer</b> torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E

40|$|A feedlot {{demonstration}} utilizing Encore®, a new longterm implant product, {{was completed}} at the Allee Demonstration Farm at Newell, Iowa in 1999. Seventyone <b>steers</b> (697 lbs.) were allotted by weight and hide color and {{assigned to one}} of three treatments: 1) Encore® (43. 9 mg estradiol = E) on day 0; 2) Encore® plus Component® TS (140 mg trenbolone acetate = ETS 0) on day 0; or 3) Encore® on day 0 followed by Component® TS (ETS 100) on day 100. Due to wide standard deviation in the weight of <b>steers</b> {{at the beginning of the}} demonstration, cattle were harvested in two groups. Approximately half of each treatment group was sorted by visual appraisal as to market readiness. Statistical interactions existed within treatment group between first and second harvest dates, therefore data were split and analyzed accordingly. In the first harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had higher marbling scores than ETS 100 <b>steers,</b> and lower average daily gain than E <b>steers</b> and ETS 100 <b>steers.</b> In the second harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had more fat at the 12 th/ 13 rib than ETS 100 <b>steers,</b> but did not differ from E <b>steers.</b> Marbling scores were also higher for ETS 0 <b>steers</b> than either ETS 100 or E <b>steers</b> in the second harvest group. Pooled data reveal that ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had higher marbling scores than ETS 100 <b>steers</b> and tended to have higher marbling scores than E <b>steers.</b> First harvest E and ETS 100 <b>steers</b> had greater average daily gain than ETS 0 <b>steers.</b> In the second harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had heavier final ending weights than E <b>steers</b> but did not differ from ETS 100 <b>steers.</b> Final ending weights, rib eye area, fat thickness at the 12 th/ 13 th rib, KPH fat, and calculated yield grades did not differ among treatment groups in the pooled data...|$|R

5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to <b>steer</b> {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also <b>steer</b> to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, <b>steer</b> angle, and <b>steer</b> rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to <b>steer</b> the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also <b>steer</b> to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the growth {{performances}} and carcass characteristics of tropical-breed <b>steers</b> reared in 2 contrasted feeding systems (indoor vs. pasture) and slaughtered at different ages (early vs. late). A total of 309 Creole <b>steers</b> (growing at an initial BW of 173 +/- 3 kg and an initial age of 252 +/- 4 d) were used over a continuous 12 -yr study. Indoor <b>steers</b> were housed in a cattle shed, fed fresh-cut grass plus concentrate, and slaughtered at 14. 5 or 17. 1 +/- 0. 1 mo of age. Pasture <b>steers</b> were pasture grazed without supplemental feed, and slaughtered at 17. 6 and 21. 2 +/- 0. 1 mo of age. Indoor-fed <b>steers</b> had a greater ADG (786 vs. 517 +/- 29 g. d(- 1); P < 0. 0001) and more carcass fat (164 vs. 145 +/- 4. 5 g. kg(- 1); P = 0. 001) than pasture-fed <b>steers.</b> Late-slaughtered <b>steers</b> had decreased ADG (630 vs. 673 +/- 27 g. d(- 1); P = 0. 001) but greater dressing percentages (hot dressing percentage = 55. 7 vs. 54. 7 +/- 0. 34 %; chilled dressing percentage = 54. 5 vs. 53. 4 +/- 0. 34 %; P < 0. 0001) than early-slaughtered <b>steers.</b> The interaction between feeding system and slaughter age was significant for carcass tissue composition.
