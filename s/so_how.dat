5|$|The time {{at which}} Penda became king is uncertain, {{as are the}} circumstances. Another Mercian king, Cearl, is {{mentioned}} by Bede as ruling {{at the same time}} as the Northumbrian king Æthelfrith, in the early part of the 7th century. Whether Penda immediately succeeded Cearl is unknown, and it is also unclear whether they were related, and if <b>so</b> <b>how</b> closely; Henry of Huntingdon, writing in the 12th century, claimed that Cearl was a kinsman of Pybba. It is also possible that Cearl and Penda were dynastic rivals.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

So Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh came back like the flesh of a little child.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> {{is it possible to}} speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E

25|$|Many modern {{historical}} {{scholars have}} focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah. A vital question is whether it is composed of sources which date from its editor's lifetime, and to what extent is it composed of earlier, or later sources. Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and in what ways do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism? Can these early sources be identified, and if <b>so,</b> <b>how?</b> In response to these questions, modern scholars have adopted a number of different approaches.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{ran into}} a problem with his theory that the mind plays a part in {{producing}} objective knowledge. Intuitions and categories are entirely disparate, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> can they interact? Kant's solution is the (transcendental) schema: a priori principles by which the transcendental imagination connects concepts with intuitions through time. All the principles are temporally bound, for if a concept is purely a priori, as the categories are, then they must apply for all times. Hence there are principles such as substance is that which endures through time, and the cause must always be prior to the effect.|$|E
25|$|The four major, largely {{independent}} underpinnings {{that the}} nuclear winter concept has {{and continues to}} receive criticism over, are regarded as: firstly, would cities readily firestorm, and if <b>so</b> <b>how</b> much soot would be generated. Secondly, atmospheric longevity; would the quantities of soot assumed in the models remain in the atmosphere {{for as long as}} projected or would far more soot precipitate as black rain much sooner. Third, timing of events; how realistic is it to start the firestorms or war modelling in late spring or summer, which almost all US-Soviet winter papers assume, so as to depict the maximum possible cooling results. Lastly, the issue of darkness or opacity; how much light-blocking effect the assumed quality of the soot reaching the atmosphere would have.|$|E

25|$|All of {{this would}} go to waste however, when Henry VI died of a fever in Messina on 28 September 1197. Following his death many of the higher ranking nobles {{abandoned}} the crusade to protect their interests in the Holy Roman Empire. When civil war broke out shortly after, the crusade found itself leaderless and in 1198 the crusaders retreated back to Tyre and sailed for home. The result was that the crusade had the detrimental effect of destroying Byzantium's dignity and wealth whilst failing to assist her against the Turks. It must be said however that the Byzantines after 1180 entertained no serious plans to reclaim Anatolia from the Turks, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> much territory Henry VI or his predecessor Frederick I seized may have been of little consequence in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Even though conversations occur between, and are {{influenced}} by, others, the roles Dasein takes up, the behaviors he comports, and the choices he makes are still his own. For example, self-as-student {{is just one}} role, or voice, that emerges toward the foreground within Dasein when he is learning in an environment such as school, while self-as-teacher is a diametrically opposed role, or voice, that emerges into the foreground when he is teaching (causing the self-as-student role, or voice, to recede into the background); but, Dasein still chooses to take up these roles or not, and if <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> to carry them out. These roles are termed voices {{because they are the}} voices Dasein take up when dialoguing with others: e.g. a student dialogues with his teacher with the voice of being a student.|$|E
