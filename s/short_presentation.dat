25|$|Planck {{sent this}} result to Rubens, who {{compared}} {{it with his}} and Kurlbaum's observational data {{and found that it}} fitted for all wavelengths remarkably well. On 19 October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum briefly reported the fit to the data, and Planck added a <b>short</b> <b>presentation</b> to give a theoretical sketch to account for his formula. Within a week, Rubens and Kurlbaum gave a fuller report of their measurements confirming Planck's law. Their technique for spectral resolution of the longer wavelength radiation was called the residual ray method. The rays were repeatedly reflected from polished crystal surfaces, and the rays that made it {{all the way through the}} process were 'residual', and were of wavelengths preferentially reflected by crystals of suitably specific materials.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{also the}} subject of {{subliminal}} priming (Nisbett & Ross, 1980), in which a stimulus is perceived outside of conscious awareness. [...] For example, in an experiment, half of a class was presented {{with a picture of}} a boy holding a birthday cake, while the other half was presented with a different picture of the same boy holding a birthday cake. The sole difference between the two was that in the first picture the boy had a mischievous facial expression, while in the second he conveyed an innocent smile. The photos were presented in a flash of 100 ms, then another picture was presented to both groups with the boy smiling. Results were that the first group described him as devilish and naughty, and the second group depicted him as angelic and kind. Due to the <b>short</b> <b>presentation</b> of the pictures, the subjects were not consciously aware {{of the nature of the}} original photos and when presented with them afterwards, participants were surprised.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE To {{identify}} the factors {{responsible for the}} poor validity {{of the most common}} aniseikonia tests, which involve size comparisons of red-green stimuli presented haploscopically. METHODS Aniseikonia was induced by afocal size lenses placed before one eye. Observers compared the sizes of semicircles presented haploscopically via color filters. The main factor under study was viewing mode (free viewing versus <b>short</b> <b>presentations</b> under central fixation). To eliminate response bias, a three-response format allowed observers to respond if the left, the right, or neither semicircle appeared larger than the other. To control decisional (criterion) bias, measurements were taken with the lens-magnified stimulus placed on the left and on the right. To control for size-color illusions, measurements were made with color filters in both arrangements before the eyes and under binocular vision (without color filters). RESULTS Free viewing resulted in a systematic underestimation of lens-induced aniseikonia that was absent with <b>short</b> <b>presentations.</b> Significant size-color illusions and decisional biases were found that would be mistaken for aniseikonia unless appropriate action is taken. CONCLUSIONS To improve their validity, aniseikonia tests should use <b>short</b> <b>presentations</b> and include control conditions to prevent contamination from decisional/response biases. If anaglyphs are used, presence of size-color illusions must be checked for. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE We identified optimal conditions for administration of aniseikonia tests and appropriate action for differential diagnosis of aniseikonia in the presence of response biases or size-color illusions. Our study has clinical implications for aniseikonia management...|$|R
