She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E

She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could hear some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.|$|E

Anne was now in full control of her children, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been vying for since their birth. As the younger brother of the king, Philippe was addressed as le Petit Monsieur, since his uncle Gaston, who had also been the younger brother of a French king, was still alive.

Starkey is equivocal about his mother, describing her as both [...] "wonderful", in that she helped develop his ambition, and [...] "monstrous", intellectually frustrated and living through her son. [...] "She was a wonderful but also very frightening parent. Finally, she was a Pygmalion. [...] She wanted a creature, she wanted <b>something</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made."
