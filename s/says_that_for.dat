500|$|The lens {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] It has a bulb-like aspherical lens, similar to notable wide-angle and fisheye lenses {{such as the}} Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED, Nikon AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm f/2.8G ED, or Tokina AT-X 107 DX AF 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 fisheye lens. Because of the shape of front element, it is not compatible with many filters, including UV filters, but the frontal exposure is rectified by a petal-shaped lens hood element. Because the lens has a permanent lens hood affixed, {{it comes with a}} friction-fit aluminum element, variously described as a sleeve, ring or shroud, that surrounds the hood to enable the placement of a front cap on the lens. PC Magazine Jim Fisher says the lens is relatively large and heavy; A reviewer at photozone.de <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a wide-angle lens the dimensions are unusually narrow but long.|$|E

[...] He observes that [...] "Most of the best engravings include a figure, incident or building which draws the viewer's eye beyond and behind the animal profile in the foreground.

500|$|Charles Hartshorne and Norman Malcolm are {{primarily}} responsible for introducing modal versions of the argument into the contemporary debate. Both claimed that Anselm had {{two versions of the}} ontological argument, the second of which was a modal logic version. According to James Harris, this version is represented by Malcolm thus:If it [...] can be conceived at all it must exist. For no one who denies or doubts the existence of a being a greater than which is inconceivable, denies or doubts that if it did exist its nonexistence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be impossible. For otherwise {{it would not be a}} being a greater than which cannot be conceived. But as to whatever can be conceived but does not exist: if it were to exist its nonexistence either in reality or in the understanding would be possible. Therefore, if a being a greater than which cannot be conceived, can even be conceived, it must exist.Hartshorne <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> Anselm, [...] "necessary existence is a superior manner of existence to ordinary, contingent existence and that ordinary, contingent existence is a defect." [...] For Hartshorne, both Hume and Kant focused only upon whether what exists is greater than what does not exist. However, [...] "Anselm's point is that what exists and cannot not exist is greater than that which exists and can not exist." [...] This avoids the question of whether or not existence is a predicate.|$|E
