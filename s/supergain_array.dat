40|$|Abstract- The {{formation}} of a linear array is introduced in [1]. When all of the element fields are in phase, we obtained a main beam with its maximum directivity. The phenomenon in which a linear array {{be able to have}} a gain which is higher than the maximum directivity of the normal linear array called superdirectivity [2, 3, 4]. In this paper, we study the {{formation of}} a <b>supergain</b> <b>array</b> and its application in Radar, some simulations are given to illustrate the array performance and some remark conclusions are given.

40|$|Abstract — The theory, {{computer}} simulations, {{and experimental}} measurements are presented for electrically small two-element <b>supergain</b> <b>arrays</b> with near optimal endfire gains of 7 dB. We {{show how the}} difficulties of narrow tolerances, large mismatches, low radiation efficiencies, and reduced scattering of electrically small parasitic elements are overcome by using electrically small resonant antennas as the elements in both separately driven and singly driven (parasitic) two-element electrically small <b>supergain</b> endfire <b>arrays.</b> Although rapidly increasing narrow tolerances prevent the practical realization of the maximum theoretically possible endfire gain of electrically small arrays with many elements, the theory and preliminary numerical simulations indicate that near maximum supergains are also achievable in practice for electrically small arrays with three (and possibly more) resonant elements if the decreasing bandwidth with increasing number of elements can be tolerated.
