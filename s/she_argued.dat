5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead to sour {{relations}} with the family. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> with the Grand Duchess Vittoria over precedence, and with Grand Duke Ferdinando over her spending. Her spending habits not only spelled conflict with the Grand Duke, but made her unpopular with the Florentines. This was compounded by her unseemly conduct, such as the two grooms who frequented her chamber at all hours.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} of pornography, which <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> was linked to rape and other forms of violence against women. Her views were widely criticized by liberal feminists and others. At the same time, she maintained a dialogue with political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E

Tannen (1987) describes the importance of repetition in conversation to meaning-making. She examined the functions of repetition in conversation. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that repetition serves four functions; production, connection, comprehension, and interaction. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that repetition enables a speaker to produce language in a more efficient, less energy-draining way (p. 581). <b>She</b> also <b>argue...</b>|$|R

5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{married his}} last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543. A {{reformer}} at heart, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> with Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following {{the fall of}} Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. In 1543, an Act of Parliament put {{them back in the}} line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.|$|E
5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> that women {{would be able to}} become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and to the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E

5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} {{greatest}} impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked to act as if class were irrelevant, but <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E

50|$|Jutta Meischner relocates the Missorium of Theodosius to the 5th century AD, to {{the year}} 421. <b>She</b> <b>argues,</b> that the emperor is Theodosius II, flanked by Honorius {{to the right and}} Valentinian III to the left. Meischner {{constitutes}} this interpretation by describing the Missorium as a work of distinctive style, quality of execution and workmanship seen in exemplary examples of Western Roman Empire. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that features like these are not consistent with the era of Theodosius I.|$|R
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

50|$|Arguing against {{suggested}} {{similarities between}} FGM and dieting or body shaping, philosopher Martha Nussbaum writes that a key {{difference is that}} FGM is mostly conducted on children using physical force.

40|$|In this Article, Professor Burns {{addresses}} {{the rise of}} economic efficiency in antitrust jurisprudence. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that the theory is incomplete in that it fails to address “noneconomic” concerns, such as dealer fairness, intraband competition, and business ethics, which society wishes addressed.

In addition, <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> that the public regards the economic efficiency theory as out of touch with reality as evidenced by the vocal opposition of sophisticated consumer groups to modern Chicago-School-influenced antitrust jurisprudence.
