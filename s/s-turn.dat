5000|$|The Cross: After showing {{lessons that}} the drivers {{have been getting}} (including {{parallel}} parking, three-point turns and <b>S-turns),</b> the drivers have to put these techniques to the test in this challenge, by turning a 1999 Volvo V70 a full 360 degrees in a tight, cross-shaped space formed by concrete barriers and blocks, with a further challenge added by the car being a European left-hand drive model. Daniella is unnerved by this left-hand drive car, and the resulting stress causes her to perform poorly, hitting the car 22 times during the challenge. Krystal ejects Steven from the car early in her run rather than handle his criticisms, and finishes with only 13 hits, but Andrew notes {{that she could have}} done a lot better if she didn't have such a cavalier attitude toward driving. While Tyler finishes with 15 hits, Andrew judges his performance to be even worse than Daniella's, as all of his hits were with much more force, and he did more damage to the car. While Lou {{is the only one of}} the drivers who correctly plans how to do the challenge (by using <b>S-turns),</b> she has difficulty actually doing so and finishes with 20 hits, while taking longer to finish than the other three drivers combined; while Andrew notes that her performance left a lot to be desired, he still considers her the safest of the remaining drivers and the one most likely to graduate this episode.|$|R

50|$|The Head-to-Head <b>S-Turn</b> Challenge - In this challenge, {{using two}} Plymouth Horizons, contestants must use the <b>S-turn</b> to {{navigate}} in reverse into {{the centre of}} a spiral course - before switching positions with the other car and going back out in reverse towards the other car's starting spot. Ben and Tab make up the first heat. Tab picks up the <b>S-turn</b> right away, and reaches the centre without hitting anything, but for Ben, it takes longer for the lesson to take hold. Once the two pass each other, though, Ben pulls ahead and finishes ahead of Tab, who exhibits some mild road rage in frustration in the second half. Afiya takes on Lauri in the second heat. Lauri had never understood this before this lesson, but she finishes the course without hitting anything and ahead of Afiya. Afiya is unusually focused in her run, but her performance quickly degrades on the way out. The third match-up involves Aaron facing off against head driving instructor Peter. By the time Peter reaches the centre, Aaron must be slowly guided by Lee to the centre, having forgotten the lesson almost immediately. Andrew gets into the car to remind Aaron of {{how to do the}} <b>S-Turn,</b> and he goes through the second half unassisted without hitting anything. Shirley and Sly make up the final heat. Sly picks up the lesson quickly, but he barely gets moving. Both proceed to exceed the hit count of the other contestants combined before reaching the centre. Shirley gives up before reaching the centre, and it takes Sly 90 minutes to reach the centre.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: ATF 4 plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{cellular}} response to stress. The E 3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF â-TrCP protein responsible for ATF 4 degradation by the proteasome, binds to ATF 4 through a DpSGXXXpS phosphorylation motif, which is similar but not identical to the DpSGXXpS motif found in most other substrates of â-TrCP. NMR studies were performed on the free and bound forms of a peptide derived from this ATF 4 motif that enabled the elucidation of the conformation of the ligand complexed to the â-TrCP protein and its binding mode. Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR allowed the study of competition for binding to â-TrCP, between the phosphorylation motifs of ATF 4 and â-catenin, to characterize the ATF 4 binding epitope. Docking protocols were performed using the crystal structure of the â-catenin-â-TrCP complex as a template and NMR results of the ATF 4 -â-TrCP complex. In agreement with the STD results, in order to bind to â-TrCP, the ATF 4 DpSGIXXpSXE motif required the association of two negatively charged areas, in addition to the hydrophobic interaction in the â-TrCP central channel. Docking studies showed that the ATF 4 DpSGIXXpSXE motif fits the binding pocket of â-TrCP through an <b>S-turning</b> conformation. The distance between the two phosphate groups is 17. 8 Å, which matched the corresponding distance 17. 1 Å for the other extended DpSGXXpS motif in the â-TrCP receptor model.

Ricciardo closed the gap to Button that lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the fastest overall lap time of the race during the 39th lap, completing a circuit of one minute and 51.600 seconds. DRS was disabled on lap 41 because weather conditions continued to deteriorate. Visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover; drivers were dazzled by lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to pass Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. He passed Button at the hairpin to move into fourth position on the 42nd lap, and Button made a pit stop for full wet tyres.

40|$|Small {{sailboat}} kinetics {{are significantly}} affected by bodyweight {{motions of the}} sailor. Highly dynamic motions of the boat lead to unsteady aerodynamics around the sail. These unsteady flows are studied using a two-part approach. First, on-the-water tests in a modified Laser sailboat capture {{the motion of the}} boat and sail. Subsequently, these characteristic motions are the basis for towing tank experiments exploring fundamental 2 D flows around representative sail sections. The “Sail-Flicking”, “S-Turn”, and “Roll-Tacking” kinetic techniques are explored in depth. Each technique is used by racing sailors to improve the performance during specific portions of a race and are most effective in select wind conditions. Sail Flicking consists of repeated small amplitude sail pulses which increase straight-line speed in upwind and cross-wind sailing. In the 2 D case, a vortex pair is shed during each individual “flick”. The benefit in driving force is maximized at apparent wind angles near 45 °. Sail Flicking effectiveness scales with the non-dimensional parameters reduced frequency and heave-to-chord ratio, making the technique most effective in light wind. The <b>S-Turning</b> technique uses coordinated turns, rolls, and sail adjustments while sailing downwind. It is named after the boat's “S” shaped path through the water. On-the-water tests show a measurable increase in downwind Velocity Made Good, VMG, while laboratory experiments indicate constructive interaction between the sail and vortices shed during each motion period. Sailboats tack back and forth to make progress into the wind. During a Roll-Tack, sailors allow the boat to reach a high heel angle during the turn. An aggressive bodyweight shift then rolls the boat upright, sweeping the sail through the air and increasing driving force. On-the-water tests show that Roll-Tacking in light wind increases windward VMG relative to straight-line sailing and relative to tacks which do not roll the boat. 2 D laboratory experiments representing a slice of the sail show the formation of a strong vortex pair associated with a six fold increase in driving force. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|R
5000|$|The Cross: As usual, this {{challenge}} requires the drivers to use <b>S-turns</b> to gradually turn their vehicle 360 degrees in a cross {{made up of}} concrete Jersey barriers and blocks. For this year's incarnation of the challenge however, they will be using a much larger vehicle: a Wayne Lifeguard bus made up {{to look like a}} train. Jillian is the first to take the challenge, and immediately demands that Mitchell guide her throughout. He initially refuses, which leads to yet another argument between the couple, but eventually she gets through the first corner, guided {{every step of the way}} by him. Andrew quickly cottons onto this and drags Mitchell off the bus, after which Jillian's confidence (and thereby her run as a whole) quickly falls apart. While this is happening, both Andrew and Shyamala note that while Jillian is arguably the most technically competent driver ever to be a contestant on the show, her nerves are proving a seemingly insurmountable problem. Sholom starts his run by adjusting his mirrors, but not only does it incorrectly (meaning that he can't see his own vehicle), he fails to actually use them; his run predictably proves to be a complete disaster, with both Andrew and Cam expressing amazement that Sholom ever got a driving licence. Polly turns out not to even know how to properly steer in reverse, and her run doesn't go any better than Sholom's. During her run, Renee has Jacque stand outside the bus and tell her how close she is to the barriers, which Andrew considers to be acceptable since Renee is still making her own decisions. She subsequently gets through with only a few minor scrapes, posting by far the best performance in {{this challenge}}. After this, it's revealed firstly that Polly and Sholom are now also getting the same public driving lessons that Jillian and Renee have been getting, and also that Renee is now able to drive by herself on the highway.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether field-based and/or laboratory-based {{assessments}} are valid tools for predicting key performance characteristics of skating in competitive-level female hockey players. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Twenty-three female ice hockey players aged 15 - 25 years (body mass: 66. 1 ± 6. 3 kg; height: 169. 5 ± 5. 5 cm), with 10. 6 ± 3. 2 years playing experience volunteered to participate in the study. The field-based assessments included 20 m sprint, squat jump, countermovement jump, 30 -second repeated jump test, standing long jump, single-leg standing long jump, 20 m shuttle run test, isometric leg pull, one-repetition maximum bench press, and one-repetition maximum squats. The laboratory-based assessments included body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), maximal aerobic power, and isokinetic strength (Biodex). The on-ice tests included agility cornering <b>s-turn,</b> cone agility skate, transition agility skate, and modified repeat skate sprint. Data were analyzed using stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between key performance characteristics of skating and the predictor variables. RESULTS: Regression models (adj R (2)) for the on-ice variables ranged from 0. 244 to 0. 663 for the field-based assessments and from 0. 136 to 0. 420 for the laboratory-based assessments. Single-leg tests were the strongest predictors for key performance characteristics of skating. Single leg standing long jump alone explained 57. 1 %, 38. 1 %, and 29. 1 % of the variance in skating time during transition agility skate, agility cornering <b>s-turn,</b> and modified repeat skate sprint, respectively. Isokinetic peak torque in the quadriceps at 90 ° explained 42. 0 % and 32. 2 % of the variance in skating time during agility cornering <b>s-turn</b> and modified repeat skate sprint, respectively. CONCLUSION: Field-based assessments, particularly single-leg tests, are an adequate substitute to more expensive and time-consuming laboratory assessments if the purpose is to gain knowledge about key performance characteristics of skating...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Metal cations {{represent}} {{key elements}} of RNA structure and function. In the Neurospora VS ribozyme, metal cations play diverse roles; they are important for substrate recognition, formation of the active site, and shifting the pKa’s of two key nucleobases {{that contribute to the}} general acid− base mechanism. Recently, we determined the NMR structure of the A 730 loop of the VS ribozyme active site (SLVI) that contributes the general acid (A 756) in the enzymatic mechanism of the cleavage reaction. Our studies showed that magnesium (Mg 2 +) ions are essential to stabilize the formation of the <b>S-turn</b> motif within the A 730 loop that exposes the A 756 nucleobase for catalysis. In this article, we extend these NMR investigations by precisely mapping the Mg 2 +-ion binding sites using manganese-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancement and cadmium-induced chemical-shift perturbation of phosphorothioate RNAs. These experiments identify five Mg 2 +-ion binding sites within SLVI. Four Mg 2 + ions in SLVI are associated with known RNA structural motifs, including the G−U wobble pair and the GNRA tetraloop, and our studies reveal novel insights about Mg 2 + ion binding to these RNA motifs. Interestingly, one Mg 2 + ion is specifically associated with the <b>S-turn</b> motif, confirming its structural role in the folding of the A 730 loop. This Mg 2 + ion is likely important for formation of the active site and may play an indirec...|$|E

The laboratory-based assessments included body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), maximal aerobic power, and isokinetic strength (Biodex). The on-ice tests included agility cornering <b>s-turn,</b> cone agility skate, transition agility skate, and modified repeat skate sprint. Data were analyzed using stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between key performance characteristics of skating and the predictor variables. Results: Regression models (adj R 2) for the on-ice variables ranged from 0. 244 to 0. 663 for the field-based assessments and from 0. 136 to 0. 420 for the laboratory-based assessments. Single-leg tests were the strongest predictors for key performance characteristics of skating. Single leg standing long jump alone explained 57. 1 %, 38. 1 %, and 29. 1 % of the variance in skating time during transition agility skate, agility cornering <b>s-turn,</b> and modified repeat skate sprint, respectively. Isokinetic peak torque in the quadriceps at 90 ° explained 42. 0 % and 32. 2 % of the variance in skating time during agility cornering <b>s-turn</b> and modified repeat skate sprint, respectively. Conclusion: Field-based assessments, particularly single-leg tests, are an adequate substitute to more expensive and time-consuming laboratory assessments if the purpose is to gain knowledge about key performance characteristics of skating.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of two contrasting G-seat cueing schemes. The G-seat, an aircraft simulation subsystem, creates aircraft acceleration cues via seat contour changes. Of the two cueing schemes tested, one was designed to create skin pressure cues {{and the other was}} designed to create body position cues. Each cueing scheme was tested and evaluated subjectively by five pilots regarding its ability to cue the appropriate accelerations in each of four simple maneuvers: a pullout, a pushover, an <b>S-turn</b> maneuver, and a thrusting maneuver. A divergence of pilot opinion occurred, revealing that the perception and acceptance of G-seat stimuli is a highly individualistic phenomena. The creation of one acceptable G-seat cueing scheme was, therefore, deemed to be quite difficult...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicrojets {{are used}} to control the {{internal}} flow to improve the performance of an ultra-compact serpentine inlet. A highly offset serpentine inlet with length-to-diameter ratio of 2. 5 is designed and static tests are conducted to analyze the internal flow characteristics in terms of pressure recovery, distortion and flow separation. Flow separation is encountered in the second <b>S-turn,</b> and two strong counter-rotating vortices are formed at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP) face which occupy {{a quarter of the}} outlet area and result in severe pressure loss and distortion. A flow control model employing a row of microjets in the second turn is designed based on the internal flow characteristics and simplified CFD simulations. Flow control tests are conducted to verify the control effectiveness and understand the characteristics as a function of inlet throat Mach number, injection mass flow ratio, jet Mach number and momentum coefficient. At all test Mach numbers, microjet flow control (MFC) effectively improves the recovery and reduces the distortion intensity. Between inlet throat Mach number 0. 2 and 0. 5, the strong flow separation in the second <b>S-turn</b> is suppressed at an optimum jet flow ratio of less than 0. 65 %, resulting in a maximum improvement of 4 % for pressure recovery coefficient and a maximum decrease of 75 % for circumferential distortion intensity at cruise. However, in order to suppress the flow separation, the injection rate should retain in an effective range. When the injection rate is higher than this range, the flow is degraded and the distortion contour is changed from 90 ° circumferential distortion pattern to 180 ° circumferential distortion pattern. Detailed data analysis shows that this optimum flow ratio depends on inlet throat Mach number and the momentum coefficient affects the control effectiveness in a dual stepping manner...|$|E
