40|$|Pre-concentration and {{determination}} of Zn (II) across a ligand assisted pseudo <b>stirbar</b> hollow fiber solid/liquid phase microextraction method in water samples has been investigated. All detections {{were carried out}} by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). The method involves microextraction and pre-concentration of Zn (II) on the pseudo stir bar hollow fiber. Then desorption has been done using suitable solvent containing suitable ligand as complexing agent. The optimized conditions were obtained. The relationship between the peak current and concentration was linear over the range of 0. 05 – 500  ng mL− 1. The limit of detection was 0. 015  ng mL− 1. Under the optimized conditions, the pre-concentration factor is 5140. The applicability of the developed technique was evaluated by application to spiked, environmental water samples...|$|E
40|$|An initial {{review of}} {{research}} targeting applications of solid phase microextraction for organometallic speciation, published in 2001, encompassed literature {{from the early}} days of solid phase microextraction up to June 2000. In this article, the reader will find a compilation and discussion of relevant literature published from June 2000 to December 2004. Because of the maturity of the technique, only a brief overview of the measurement principles is presented. The major thrust of the article highlights applications of solid phase microextraction to the fields of elemental and organometallic analyses. In contrast to the earlier review, applications related to the determination of phosphorus-, sulfur-, bromine-, chlorine- and iodine-containing compounds have also been included for those cases where the target of the determination is the element or a specific molecule containing the element for which atomic spectroscopy has been advocated as a detection technique. Additionally, other microextraction techniques are also considered, including <b>stirbar</b> sorptive extraction and single droplet microextraction. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{state-of-the-art}} of {{gas chromatography}} coupled with {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (GC-ICP MS) is comprehensively reviewed. Particular attention {{is given to the}} recent advances in ICP MS detection including: GC-ICP interface designs; low power plasmas; and alternative mass analyzers (time-of-flight, double-focussing single collector, double-focussing and collision cell single-focussing multicollectors). On the level of sample preparation for speciation analysis by GC-ICP MS, new derivatization reagents and advances in extraction techniques, such as capillary purge-and-trap, solid phase microextraction and <b>stirbar</b> solid phase extraction are discussed. The increasing role of organometallic species labeled with stable isotopes for the detection of sources of errors during sample preparation and for isotope dilution quantification is highlighted. Applications of GC-ICP MS to the analysis of real-world samples are summarized with a focus on the areas which particularly benefit from the high ICP MS detection sensitivity and tolerance to sample matrix. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|A double {{infusion}} {{flow system}} and particle sizing technique {{were developed to}} study the effect of time and shear rate on adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation in Poiseuille flow. Citrated platelet-rich plasma, PRP, and 2 microM ADP were simultaneously infused into a 40 -microliters cylindrical mixing chamber at a fixed flow ratio, PRP/ADP = 9 : 1. After rapid mixing by a rotating magnetic <b>stirbar,</b> the platelet suspension flowed through 1. 19 or 0. 76 mm i. d. polyethylene tubing for mean transit times, t, from 0. 1 to 86 s, over a range of mean tube shear rate, G, from 41. 9 to 1, 000 s- 1. Known volumes of suspension were collected into 0. 5 % buffered glutaraldehyde, and all particles in the volume range 1 - 10 (5) microns 3 were counted and sized using a model ZM particle counter (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL) and a logarithmic amplifier. The decrease in the single platelet concentration served as an overall index of aggregation. The decrease in the total particle concentration was {{used to calculate the}} collision capture efficiency during the early stages of aggregation, and aggregate growth was followed by changes in the volume fraction of particles of successively increasing size. Preliminary results demonstrate that both collision efficiency and particle volume fraction reveal important aspects of the aggregation process not indicated by changes in the single platelet concentration alone...|$|E
40|$|Unless {{otherwise}} specified, all {{reactions were}} carried out in oven-dried (> 120 ˚C) glassware equipped with a Teflon ® coated magnetic <b>stirbar</b> and a rubber septum under a positive pressure of nitrogen or argon. Air- or moisture-sensitive reagents were transferred to the reaction vessel under positive pressure of nitrogen or argon via syringe or stainless steel cannula. Reactions were run at room temperature (20 - 25 ˚C) unless otherwise noted in the experimental procedure, and reported reaction temperatures refer to the external temperatures measured for the bath in which the reaction vessel was immersed. Elevated temperatures of less than 170 ˚C were obtained {{through the use of}} a silicone oil bath, while a sand bath equipped with a thermometer in physical contact with the reaction vessel was used for temperatures in excess of 170 ˚C. Microwave reactions were performed using a Smith Synthesizer Workstation manufactured by Personal Chemistry (now Biotage), which employed variable wattage delivery (maximum 300 W) to automate heating and maintenance of the desired reaction temperature inside the sealed microwave cavity. For reactions run below room temperature, the term “- 78 ˚C ” refers to a bath of acetone and dry ice, “- 40 ˚C ” refers to a slurry of acetonitrile and dry ice, and “ 0 ˚C ” refers to an ice-water bath. Intermediate temperatures were obtained by the careful addition of dry ice to an acetone bath at periodic intervals to maintain the desire...|$|E

Frontenac (Vitis spp. MN 1047) is a new, cold-hardy red wine grape {{that is currently}} the most-planted grape cultivar {{in much of the}} Upper Midwest. Though typically described as having notes of cherry, black currant and spice, the volatile characteristics of Frontenac wine have not been investigated, and no structured evaluation of common sensory characteristics has been performed. To develop a standard set of aroma descriptors that characterize red Frontenac table wines, descriptive analysis was performed on six products. Thirteen sensory descriptors were developed and defined with reference standards; correlation plots indicated that attributes were discrete and not redundant. All 13 attribute descriptors were useful for describing and/or distinguishing between red Frontenac table wines. In order to determine odor active compounds, eight Frontenac table wines were evaluated using <b>stirbar</b> sorptive extraction (SBSE) combined with concurrent gas chromatography-olfactometry/ mass spectrometry (GCO/MS). Twenty-four volatiles perceived by panelists were identified via mass spectra comparison, and included five alcohols, fourteen esters, one lactone, two acids and two volatile phenols. Twenty-four of these were confirmed with LRI comparisons in separate GC/MS analyses using a C 6 to C 16 carbon ladder, and 23 were quantified in runs using a known concentration of internal standard. Analyses of wines produced from V. riparia clone # 89, a parent of Frontenac, identified 16 volatiles common to Frontenac wines. Tentative identification, via GC/MS, of Frontenac juice with two days of skin contact suggested that four volatiles found in the wine may originate in the fruit...|$|E
