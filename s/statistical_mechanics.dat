5|$|The {{connection}} between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces {{is described by}} detailed treatment with <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics.</b> In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.|$|E
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics,</b> where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics,</b> causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} career, Teller made {{contributions}} to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (the Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller effects), and surface physics. His extension of Fermi's theory of beta decay (in {{the form of}} the so-called Gamow–Teller transitions) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory. The Jahn–Teller effect and the BET theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry. Teller also made contributions to Thomas–Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E

An {{important}} subbranch known as non-equilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{deals with the}} issue of microscopically modelling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat. Unlike with equilibrium, there is no exact formalism that applies to non-equilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> in general, and so this branch of <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> remains an active area of theoretical research.|$|E

25|$|This {{provides}} an indirect avenue for obtaining numbers such as ohmic conductivity and thermal conductivity by extracting results from equilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Since equilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> is mathematically well defined and (in some cases) more amenable for calculations, the fluctuation-dissipation connection {{can be a}} convenient shortcut for calculations in near-equilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> is {{commonly}} used to explain the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems. This branch of <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics,</b> which treats and extends classical thermodynamics, is known as statistical thermodynamics or equilibrium <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Microscopic mechanical laws do not contain concepts such as temperature, heat, or entropy; however, <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> shows how these concepts arise from the natural uncertainty {{about the state of}} a system when that system is prepared in practice. The benefit of using <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> is that it provides exact methods to connect thermodynamic quantities (such as heat capacity) to microscopic behaviour, whereas, in classical thermodynamics, the only available option would be to just measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials. <b>Statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> also makes it possible to extend the laws of thermodynamics to cases which are not considered in classical thermodynamics, such as microscopic systems and other mechanical systems with few degrees of freedom.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{ordinary}} mechanics only {{considers the}} behaviour {{of a single}} state, <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics</b> introduces the statistical ensemble, which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The statistical ensemble is a probability distribution over all possible states of the system. In classical <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics,</b> the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a single phase point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a phase space with canonical coordinates. In quantum <b>statistical</b> <b>mechanics,</b> the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states, and can be compactly summarized as a density matrix.|$|E
