5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of Chancery, where such documents usually originated. These were sealed with the Great <b>Seal</b> <b>of</b> the King until at least 1338, along with the <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> the justices; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with the <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas, allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king. The court stood {{on an equal footing}} with the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of the}} Common Pleas would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E

5|$|Two large tomb stelae made {{of granite}} {{were found at}} his burial site. Their shape is unusual and they appear {{unfinished}} and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately, but the reasons are unknown. A cylinder <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a cartouche and gives the epithet Merj-netjeru ("beloved of the gods"). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists {{to the conclusion that}} the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> the same material shows Peribsen's name without a cartouche, but with the royal title Nisut-Bity ("king of Lower- and Upper Egypt") instead.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, King Ludwig I {{granted the}} city its old {{coat of arms}} again {{in the form of}} large and small crests. These {{embodied}} the small crest <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> 1304 and the large one of 1323. The 1835 coat of arms had a blue background, though this was later corrected to argent under Ludwig II in 1865. The background was rarely changed. One example of its occurrence, however, was when or was used in the 16th century instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully {{sovereign}} from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great <b>Seal</b> <b>of</b> Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great <b>Seal</b> <b>of</b> Canada for Elizabeth II, where the title has been redefined as Queen of Canada. These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.|$|E
5|$|King Arthur was {{assigned}} many different arms, {{but from the}} 13th century, he was most commonly given three gold crowns on an azure field (Loomis 1938, 38). In a 1394 manuscript depicting the Nine Worthies, Arthur is shown holding a flag with three gold crowns (Neubecker, 172). The reason for the triple-crown symbol is unknown, but it was associated with other pre-Norman kings, with the <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> Magnus II of Sweden, with the relics of the Three Wise Men in Cologne (which led to the three crowns in the <b>seal</b> <b>of</b> the University of Cologne), and with the grants of Edward I of England to towns which were symbolized by three crowns in the towns' arms. The number of crowns increased to eleven, thirteen and even thirty at times (Brault, 44–46).|$|E
