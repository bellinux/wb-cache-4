As countries developed and economic activity became more market-oriented, governments sourced revenue frorn broader, more efficient tax bases. But trade taxes remained, with protection of domestic import-competing activity, rather than revenue, becoming their primary motivation. This shift of motivation also facilitated the <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> alternative <b>policies,</b> quantitative restrictions for example, which would limit import competition without necessarily generating revenue...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{model of}} {{probabilistic}} voting, we analyse the impact of aid on the political equilibrium in the recipient country or region. We consider two kinds of politicians: the benevolent one is interested in promoting social welfare whereas {{the other one is}} clientelistic, his only goal being to maximize his chances of being elected. We find that the impact of aid on the political equilibrium and therefore on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>policy</b> (using the utilitarian social welfare as a benchmark) in the recipient country ultimately depends on the value of the elasticity of marginal consumption, which governs how the sensitivity of voters to a clientelistic allocation of resources (over a socially optimal one) varies with the level of consumption. When the elasticity is low, the probability that the clientelistic politician be elected increases and the expected policy outcome gets further away from the socially desirable policy set. This case <b>of</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> quality by aid can help to explain the poor performance of conditionality in improving policy. Perhaps more surprising is the opposite case, which arises for high values of the elasticity of marginal utility: an increase in aid worsens the clientelistic candidate’s election prospects and thus improves the expected policy set. aid; clientelism; voting...|$|R

40|$|There is some {{quantitative}} {{evidence on}} the volume <b>of</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> traditionally qualified supervisors in industry by more highly qualified staff, but very {{little is known about}} which forms substitution takes, the basic conditions facilitating substitution policies and the company goals associated with it as well as the consequences <b>of</b> this <b>policy.</b> This study has tried to address this gap, drawing on case study research in the UK, France and Germany. Substitution in this context is defined as the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> recruiting higher qualified younger employees without substantial work experience into supervisory and management positions in production and maintenance (in short: industrial supervisor positions), that would previously have been filled with semi-skilled or skilled workers, promoted after many years of service. Three case studies in two industries (mechanical engineering and the chemical industry) were conducted {{in each of the three}} countries covered. A comparison of the case study features with the national contexts revealed that the German case studies are more of an exception to national development than the UK and French ones. In the UK, qualitative evidence and other indicators suggest that substitution in the UK is much more advanced than in France and Germany. Substitution policies seem to have a certain tradition in France. However, in Germany there are a number of features restricting the extent <b>of</b> <b>substitution.</b> The effect <b>of</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>policies</b> on the employees concerned and the resultant problems for companies are examined. The consequences <b>of</b> the <b>substitution</b> <b>policy</b> seem ambivalent for the highly qualified industrial supervisors, fairly irrespective of the country and the company investigated.

40|$|Motivated by the ABO {{issue of}} the blood bank system, in which the {{portions}} stored have constant shelf life, we consider two subsystems of perishable inventory. The two Perishable Inventory Subsystems-PIS A and PIS B, are correlated to each other through a one-way <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> demands. Specifically, the input streams and the demand streams applied to each subsystem are four Poisson processes, which are independent of one another. However, if the shelf of PIS A (blood of type O) is empty of items, an arriving demand of type A is unsatisfied, since demand of type A cannot be satisfied by an item of type B (blood portions of type AB), but if the shelf of PIS B is empty of items, an arriving demand of type B is applied to PIS A, since demands of type B can be satisfied by both types. This one-way <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> the issuing <b>policy</b> generates for PIS A a modulated Poisson demand process operating in a two-state non-Markovian environment. The performance analysis of PIS B is known from previous work. Thus, {{in this study we}} focus on the marginal performance analysis of PIS A. Based on a fluid formulation and a Markovian approximation for the one-way substitution demand process, we develop a unified approach to efficiently and accurately approximate the performance of the PIS A. The effectiveness of the approach is investigated by extensive numerical experiments...|$|R

It is enough to observe that after a decade of federally enforced nondiscrimination in employment, minorities are still twice as likely as whites not to have jobs.

Minorities continue to occupy a disproportionately low percentage of the more attractive positions. The employment situation of women in relation to white males is similarly bleak.

40|$|This Paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} monetary aggregates in modern macroeconomic models of the New Keynesian type. The focus is on possible developments of these models that are suggested by the monetarist literature, and that in addition seem justified empirically. Both the relation between money and inflation, and between money and aggregate demand, are considered. Regarding the first relation, {{it is argued that}} both the mean and the dynamics of inflation in present-day models are governed by money growth. This relationship arises from a conventional aggregate-demand channel; an emphasis on the link between monetary aggregates and inflation in no way requires a direct channel connecting money and inflation. The relevance of money for aggregate demand, in turn, lies not via real balance effects (or any other justification for money {{in the structure of the}} IS equation), but on money’s ability to serve as a proxy for the various <b>substitution</b> effects <b>of</b> monetary <b>policy</b> that exist when many asset prices matter for aggregate demand.
