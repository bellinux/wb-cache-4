40|$|Linking {{the power}} and {{transport}} sectors—Part 1 ” describes the general principle of “sector coupling” (SC), develops a working definition intended of the concept to be of utility to the international scientific community, contains a literature review that {{provides an overview of}} relevant scientific papers on this topic and conducts a rudimentary analysis of the linking of {{the power and}} transport sectors on a worldwide, EU and German level. The aim of this follow-on paper is to outline an approach to the modelling of SC. Therefore, a study of Germany as a case study was conducted. This study assumes a high share of renewable energy sources (RES) contributing to the grid and significant proportion of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) in the year 2050, along with a dedicated hydrogen pipeline grid to meet hydrogen demand. To construct a model of this nature, the model environment “METIS” (models for energy transformation and integration systems) we developed will be described in more detail in this paper. Within this framework, a detailed model of the power and transport sector in Germany will be presented in this paper and the rationale behind its assumptions described. Furthermore, an intensive result analysis for the power <b>surplus,</b> <b>utilization</b> of electrolysis, hydrogen pipeline and economic considerations has been conducted to show the potential outcomes of modelling SC. It is hoped that this will serve as a basis for researchers to apply this framework in future to models and analysis with an international focus...|$|E

The {{relationship between the}} available capacity and the inventory needed to meet customer requirements with a pre-defined service level is modeled. Furthermore, the total cost for both capacity and inventory is minimized and it is shown that, assuming negligible change-over times, the double of the surplus inventory cost has to be equal to the excess capacity cost to ensure minimum total cost.

40|$|Abstract. Cooling water <b>surplus</b> heat <b>utilization</b> by {{lithium bromide}} {{absorption}} heat pump is a significant measure of energy saving in thermal power plants, however, lithium bromide corrosion on tubes seriously affects the reliability of heat pump absorbers. Through weight loss methods and electrochemical polarization methods, corrosion resistance of copper tube and five types of stainless steel tubes 304, 316 L, 436 L, 444 and 445 J 2 have been studied under absorber conditions. The results reveal that the corrosion resistance of five types of stainless steel tubes is significantly better than copper tubes in 62 wt- % LiBr solution, and the corrosion resistance {{of the order of}} tubes is 316 L> 445 J 2 ≈ 444 > 304 ≈ 436 L>>TP 2.

40|$|Infrastructure as {{a service}} with {{desktops}} (DIaaS) based on the extensible mark-up language (XML) is herein proposed to utilize surplus resources. DIaaS is a traditional surplus-resource integrated management technology. It {{is designed to provide}} fast work distribution and computing services based on user service requests as well as storage services through desktop-based distributed computing and storage resource integration. DIaaS includes a nondisruptive resource service and an auto-scalable scheme to enhance the availability and scalability of intra-cloud computing resources. A performance evaluation of the proposed scheme measured the clustering performance time for <b>surplus</b> resource <b>utilization.</b> The results showed improvement in computing and storage services in a connection of at least two computers compared to the traditional method for high-availability measurement of nondisruptive services. Furthermore, an artificial server error environment was used to create a clustering delay for computing and storage services and for nondisruptive services. It was compared to the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) ...|$|R
40|$|In the Nordic {{day-ahead}} electricity market zonal pricing or {{market splitting}} {{is used for}} relieving congestion between a predetermined set of price areas. This congestion management method represents an aggregation of individual connection points into price areas, and flows in the actual electricity network are only partially represented in the market clearing. Because of several strained situations in the power system during 2009 and 2010, changes in the congestion management method are under consideration by the Norwegian regulator NVE. We discuss three different congestion management methods – nodal pricing, and optimal and simplified zonal pricing. Four hourly cases from 2010 are used to illustrate the effects of different congestion management methods on prices, <b>surpluses</b> and network <b>utilization...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{stochastic}} programming model for investments in thermal generation capacity {{to study the}} impact of demand response (DR) at high wind penetration levels. The investment model combines continuous operational constraints and wind scenarios to represent the implications of wind variability and uncertainty at the operational level. DR is represented in terms of linear price-responsive demand functions. A numerical case study based on load and wind profiles of Illinois is constructed with 20 candidate generating units of various types. Numerical results show the impact of DR on both investment and operational decisions. We also propose a model in which DR provides operating reserves and discuss its impact on lowering the total capacity needed in the system. We observe that a relatively small amount of DR capacity is sufficient to enhance the system reliability. When compared to the case with no DR, a modest level of DR results in less wind curtailment and better satisfaction of reserve requirements, as well as improvements in both the social <b>surplus</b> and generator <b>utilization,</b> as measured by capacity factors...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedRadio {{spectrum}} {{is a fundamental}} input in communications technology and the allocation of spectrum has gained ever increasing importance with technological advances. In this dissertation we start by recoupling the accurate scientific definition and progression of spectrum with the economic and policy analysis of spectrum. We then identify and provide insights to the current valuation, allocation and management problems in spectrum equipped with this improved understanding. We go on to provide consumer surplus estimates for unlicensed spectrum that had been overlooked in the literature and show that the consumer <b>surplus</b> from the <b>utilization</b> of unlicensed {{spectrum is}} commensurate with that of licensed spectrum found in previous studies. To assess the possible negative effects of excessive entry under unlicensed allocations, we continue with {{a model of a}} communications device market whereby the allocation of spectrum determines the technological environment, the competitive environment and consequently the quality and the variety of the devices in the market. We then go on to simulate the welfare consequences of instituting the alternative management regimes. We conclude that the regime choice has to be thoroughly informed by the preference and technology structure and the optimal allocation must be an interior solution with a finely tuned mix of the two regimes...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian {{merchandise}} trade surplus increased rather modestly in 1978 and 1979 {{given that the}} depreciation of the real exchange rate since 1977 had considerably reinforced our competitive position. With the aid of an econometric model, we try to measure the respective contributions of the factors influencing the {{merchandise trade}} balance during that period. Our partial equilibrium simulations reveal that the depreciation of the Canadian dollar, both in nominal and real terms, substantially improved the merchandise trade <b>surplus.</b> High capacity <b>utilization</b> rates in Canada had a substantial impact on the trade balance through a large increase of imports, especially imports of producers' equipment, and through a significant reduction of exports of manufactured goods other than automotive products. Excluding the automobile sector, which has experienced a "structural" change in the United States, cyclical divergences {{between the two countries}} did not influence substantially the evolution of the merchandise trade account over that period. The rapid improvement of the terms of trade in 1979 strongly contributed to the increase of the nominal merchandise trade surplus. Our simulations show that the rise in the prices of certain primary commodities relative to the U. S. prices of manufactured goods was an important factor behind the stronger terms of trade...|$|R
40|$|Instead of {{continuously}} adapting current {{dairy farming}} systems {{according to the}} ruling legal instruments, exploring strategic development options for the farming system {{with a focus on}} the final environmental goals may provide better perspectives for farm continuation. To identify promising options, the dairy farming model was developed. The model describes options of different intensities for producing feed in the field, for processing or buying feed and for converting feed into milk. The combinations of different intensities result in different types of income levels, different nutrient emissions into the ecosystem and different abilities to manage the landscape. The model reconciles economic objectives (maximizing income per ha) with ecological objectives (minimizing nutrient leakages and maximizing landscape values). The multiple-objective model is in turn fed by other models, such as technical coefficient generators for grass, maize and fodder beets. The dairy farming model is applied to assess the type of farming systems that meet environmental policy objectives and analyse the perspectives of dairy farming on sandy soils in the Netherlands. It is shown that many different dairy farming systems are possible meeting the environmental goals (maximum 34 kg N leached, 30 kg N volatilized and a P surplus below 2. 2 kg ha¿ 1), with a range in environmental and economic performance. The scenario selected depends on the preference of the stakeholder. General characteristics are low N application rates on grazed grassland, associated with the restriction on nitrate leaching, animals housed in low-emission stables, associated with the restriction on ammonia volatilization, and a substantial part of the concentrates produced in the region, associated with the restriction on P <b>surplus.</b> Production and <b>utilization</b> of hay is an option to reduce N excretion by the animals. Regional or on-farm concentrate production is economically only attractive if land is in surplus under pressure of environmental goals...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{utilization}} of a medicine, {{both before and}} after patent expiration, {{is one of the key}} determinants of its long-run value to society, as consumer and producer <b>surplus</b> accumulate as <b>utilization</b> occurs. However, while utilization during the years of patent protection is followed fairly closely, usage after that is generally not, as multiple manufacturers are usually involved in the production and sale of generic alternatives. Since utilization beyond patent expiration is poorly understood, we selected a random sample of 60 drugs and assessed their long-term, post-patent use during the period of generic competition. METHODS: At five-year intervals beginning with the year generic competition began (YGCB), we estimated the U. S. {{utilization of}} each drug (including all generic and branded formulations) based on the number of prescriptions dispensed as projected by the National Prescription Audit (1964 to 2006) conducted by IMS. These estimates were then compared to each medicine's baseline utilization, defined as the drug's usage during the last full year of patent protection one year prior to the year generic competition began (YGCB- 1). The absolute utilization levels were converted into relative utilization levels, whereby a measure of 1. 0 indicates that utilization in that year was equal to utilization in the baseline year. RESULTS: Many drugs continued to be prescribed long after patent protection ended. Even after excluding one medicine that had unusually high utilization 15 to 30 years after generic competition began, relative utilization averaged between 0. 64 and 0. 99 for the 5 -year intervals starting with YGCB+ 5 and ending with YGCB+ 30. This was true even though several of the medicines were available over-the-counter (OTC) during some of those years and we did not have data reflecting OTC utilization. After excluding those OTC years (to focus on medicines that had more complete data), relative utilization averaged between 0. 88 and 1. 15. CONCLUSION: Many medicines continue to be used far beyond their period of patent protection, somewhat countering the view that newer drugs quickly replace older ones. This extended, post-patent utilization can yield additional surplus for society that is over and above the surplus generated during the period of patent protection. ...|$|R
