5|$|Just {{after its}} {{intersection}} with the PIP, the road intersects two former Rockland County Routes (CR106A & CR69). Also, {{at this point}} CR106 enters the village limits of <b>Stony</b> Point, and becomes a , highway with extra lanes in some places. The highway intersects CR108, CR47, and CR33 as Central Drive. CR106 {{comes to an end}} shortly after these intersections at US9W and US202 in downtown <b>Stony</b> Point, about a mile west from the Hudson River and the <b>Stony</b> Point Marina.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>stony</b> corals {{extend their}} tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take {{correspondingly}} larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many <b>stony</b> corals also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few <b>stony</b> corals, this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean <b>stony</b> corals are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stony</b> corals first {{appeared}} in the Middle Triassic, but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose corals of the Paleozoic is currently unresolved. In modern times <b>stony</b> corals numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.|$|E

5000|$|The 1930s saw an {{expansion}} of the ABA’s professional development activities led by Harold <b>Stonier,</b> ABA’s executive from 1937 to 1952. <b>Stonier</b> founded the ABA Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University in 1935 with 220 students. [...] The school later moved to Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and in 2007, the Graduate School was named after <b>Stonier.</b> ABA launched other professional development programs in the years that followed, including for bank marketers, compliance officers, trust bankers, and commercial lenders.|$|R

5|$|By 1933, NY17A was {{extended}} eastward along NY210 to Southfields, completing the alternate loop of NY17, while NY210 was realigned on its east end by 1938 to end at US9W in <b>Stony</b> Point. Instead of following Willow Point Road, the highway remained on modern Gate Hill Road to {{the vicinity of}} <b>Stony</b> Point, where it entered the hamlet on Main Street. It was rerouted again between 1968 and 1973 to bypass Main Street to the south on Central Drive.|$|E
5|$|Corals {{predominantly}} reproduce sexually. About 25% of hermatypic corals (<b>stony</b> corals) form single sex (gonochoristic) colonies, {{while the}} rest are hermaphroditic.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Marburger left USC {{to become}} the third {{president}} of the State University of New York at <b>Stony</b> Brook on Long Island, New York.

5|$|The polyps of <b>stony</b> corals have {{six-fold}} symmetry {{while those}} of soft corals have eight. The mouth of each polyp {{is surrounded by}} a ring of tentacles. In <b>stony</b> corals these are cylindrical and taper to a point, but in soft corals they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules. In some tropical species these are reduced to mere stubs and in some they are fused to give a paddle-like appearance. In most corals, the tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch plankton and other small organisms. Shallow water species of both <b>stony</b> and soft corals can be zooxanthellate, the corals supplementing their plankton diet with the products of photosynthesis produced by these symbionts. The polyps interconnect by a complex and well-developed system of gastrovascular canals, allowing significant sharing of nutrients and symbionts.|$|E
5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called <b>Stony</b> Brook. The road the army took followed <b>Stony</b> Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E

5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no <b>stony</b> {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both <b>stony</b> and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with <b>stony</b> corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E

5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood, and the cones of common medlars. The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, muskmelon, and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild <b>stony</b> olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild <b>stony</b> olives, mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E
