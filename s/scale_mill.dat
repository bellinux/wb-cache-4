40|$|In {{recent decades}} layered natural and {{synthetic}} clay minerals {{have been used}} in a multitude of applications including rheology modifiers, functional additives for polymers, coatings, cosmetics and even medical device components. To aid in optimisation of performance and study of biological impacts, it would be most advantageous to have a series of well-defined nano-sized clay particles of the same chemistry with controlled aspect ratio. To date previous studies into milled materials have limited analysis by advanced microscopic techniques, and have also not correlated the impact of processing the materials at laboratory versus pilot/commercial scales. In this study semi-synthetic Na+ fluoromica was exposed to high-energy milling using lab scale and commercial scale milling systems, using several configurations and separated into size fractions using centrifugation. These fractions were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) which were employed to characterise the differences in morphology, particle size and structural changes between the unmilled and milled samples to fully assess the impacts of scale and energy on the process. The effect of a small lab-scale batch mill and a larger semi-commercial <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> connected to a continuous flow reservoir was compared. The microscopy results showed that the particle size was reduced significantly after high-energy milling using both batch and continuous mill configurations on the lab <b>scale</b> <b>mill,</b> and in addition highly reproducible results were obtained using the larger mill. FTIR spectra revealed that no significant fluoromica crystalline structural changes were detected. Finally, DLS, SEM and TEM techniques were compared in order to identify the most reliable method for determining particle size distribution, and we propose that SEM has more advantages when it comes to characterising clay platelets. Furthermore, according to the SEM results, the larger semi-commercial <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> resulted in a greater size reduction, which is consistent with existing concepts and theory of horizontal bead mill scale up.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsScale {{build up}} {{is one of}} the leading reasons for {{production}} decline in oilfields worldwide. Scale can be formed whenever water is produced; either by direct precipitation from the water that occurs naturally in the reservoir rocks, or as a result of produced water becoming oversaturated with scale components when two incompatible waters are mixed downhole. The two most common scales formed in an oilfield are calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. Scale can be found in the reservoir, along the wellbore and in the surface process system. There are various methods for controlling scale. The methods shall either prevent scale formation or remove scale that has already occurred. Scale inhibition and choosing the correct injection fluid are two methods for preventing scale formation. Removal of scale can be divided into chemical dissolution and mechanical removal. For chemical dissolution, the alternative is to bullhead the well with chemicals to remove the scale. Mechanical removal includes the use of different equipment e. g. brushes, broaches, string shots and milling. This thesis focuses especially on mechanical wireline milling for removal of scale. Due to this, the wireline rig-up equipment for both platforms and riserless well intervention vessels, has been presented. Wireline milling is a mechanical method which uses a special tool string with a milling bit in the end, to remove <b>scale.</b> Four <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> case histories from the Smørbukk field in the Norwegian Sea has been studied. They were all performed from a riserless well intervention vessel. Different plots with measurements from one of the case histories, taken during the milling operation have been looked into. The plots contain different measurements such as head tension, current and wireline tension and are plotted against time. The objective of the thesis has been trying to locate parts of the execution of <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operations that can be improved. Some of the key findings were: -	When carrying out a <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operation; as much as possible information about the scale, and other well conditions, should be obtained before the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> start. This can be information about the scale type, where it is located, and the length and thickness of the scale restrictions. Other important information is temperature, pressure and fluid in the well. This information can make the choice of equipment easier and reduce the risk for something going wrong during the operation. To obtain information about the scale restrictions, a caliper can be run in well. -	The weight on bit should be controlled carefully throughout the milling operation. The correct weight on bit is crucial to avoid stalling out with the bit. The consequence of stalling with the bit is no progress in the <b>scale</b> <b>milling,</b> and maybe the need for pulling out of hole with the tool string. -	The removal of scale cuttings is very important during a milling operation. If the cuttings are not sufficiently removed, there will be an accumulation of cuttings around the mill bit and no progress in the milling. -	Real time measurement taken during the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> is important for having optimal control over the operation. -	In wells with challenging well conditions, like high temperature and high pressure, pre-testing of equipment for real well conditions, may be important for optimizing the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operation. This can be a good measure to prevent equipment failures and short circuits during the milling operation and decrease the need for tripping in and out of hole more than planned for. -	The effect that acid has on scale is difficult to conclude based on these case histories and should be further investigated. -	The overall experience from the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operations emphasizes the need for a detailed planning of milling operations. Experience, equipment limitations and the different aspects of a milling operation should be thoroughly addressed before one start to <b>mill</b> the <b>scale.</b> This may help to reduce the number of problems during the milling operation...|$|R

40|$|The present general {{trend of}} palm oil mills in Malaysia has turned towards large <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> processing.

40|$|Most DEM {{analyses}} of ball and stirred mills reported {{to date have}} considered only media motion and its interaction with the mill lifter configuration. For SAG mills, a large fraction of the feed material can already be well represented in DEM models.

The C-MIS code is now sufficiently powerful to allow inclusion of ore particles within a short periodic section of a small pilot (or large lab) <b>scale</b> <b>mill.</b> This provides the opportunity {{to better understand the}} effect of media on the interstitial bed of powder and of the powder on the media.

40|$|Applying DEM to {{prediction}} of tumbling mill performance is challenging because several different modes of breakage {{are active in}} the process. As our knowledge of breakage and computational capacity improve, it is worth revisiting previous simulation tasks which did not produce a satisfactorily realistic description of a measured process. At SAG 2006, we reported the simulated and measured outcomes of treating a well characterised ore in a 1. 2 m diameter mill. This well instrumented, pilot <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> at the University of KwaZulu-Natal has been combined with some new approaches to ore testing to allow different modes of breakage to be tested. The mill design allows the rate of generation of fine material to be measured in close to real time for autogenous and SAG mill charges. The updated simulation model estimates mass loss with particle evolution and embeds the cumulative damage and breakage. To more clearly delineate the effects {{of different types of}} breakage, surface wear has not been included in these simulations. The simulated results are compared with the measured results. The cumulative damage model is more realistic for SAG operation but is inadequate for AG. Hence, any realistic model must incorporate several breakage mechanisms.

40|$|The {{grinding}} {{efficiency of}} semi autogenous milling or ball milling {{depends on the}} tumbling motion of the total charge within the mill. Utilization of this tumbling motion for efficient breakage of particles depends on the conditions inside the mill. However, any kind of monitoring device to measure the conditions inside the mill shell during operation is virtually impossible due to the severe environment presented by the tumbling charge. An instrumented grinding ball, which {{is capable of surviving}} a few hours and transmitting the impacts it experiences, is proposed here. The spectrum of impacts collected over 100 revolutions of the mills presents the signature of the grinding environment inside mill. This signature could be effectively used to optimize the milling performance by investigating this signature's relation to mill product size, mill throughput, make-up ball size, mill speed, liner profile and ball addition rates. At the same time, it {{can also be used to}} design balls and liner systems that can survive longer in the mill. The technological advances made in electronics and communication makes this leap in instrumentation certainly viable. Hence, the instrumented grinding ball offers the ability to qualitatively observe and optimize the milling environment. An instrumented load cell package that can measure the force of impacts inside the grinding chamber of a mill is developed here. The signal from the instrumented load cell package is interpreted in terms of a histogram termed as an impact spectrum which is a plot of the number of impacts at a specific energy level against the energy. It reflects on the average force regime of the mill. The instrumented load cell package was calibrated against the ultra fast load cell which has been unanimously accepted as a standard to measure single breakage events. The load cell package was successfully used to produce impact spectra in an 8. 5 inch lab <b>scale</b> <b>mill.</b> The mill speed and the ball size were varied to study their effect on the impact spectra. A good correlation was found between the process variables and the impact spectra. The load cell package was then used in a 16 inch pilot <b>scale</b> <b>mill.</b> The mill speed, ball size, and mill filling were varied here and a consistent trend between these variables and impact spectra was observed. With a better understanding developed from the initial tests, the design of the load cell package was significantly changed to eliminate noise. With the new design, the impact spectra were re-determined in the 16 inch pilot mill varying the process variables - ball size, mill speed, and mill filling. Finally, it is successfully shown that a change in the operating variables of a mill can be seen in the impact spectra and that this concept can be successfully developed to monitor the grinding operation of industrial mills. To adapt it to industrial level it is mandatory to make the load cell package wireless. A design of a wireless circuit that is capable of transferring data at the required speed of 1000 kbps was also developed and tested at Cortez Gold Mines (CGM), Nevada...|$|E

40|$|The {{patterns}} of rock comminution within tumbling mills, {{as well as}} the nature of forces, are of significant practical importance. Discrete element modelling (DEM) has been used to analyse the pattern of specific energy applied to rock, in terms of spatial distribution within a pilot AG/SAG mill. We also analysed in some detail the nature of the forces, which may result in rock comminution. In order to examine the distribution of energy applied within the mill, the DEM models were compared with measured particle mass losses, in small scale AG and SAG mill experiments. The intensity of contact stresses was estimated using the Hertz theory of elastic contacts. The results indicate {{that in the case of}} the AG mill, the highest intensity stresses and strains are likely to occur deep within the charge, and close to the base. This effect is probably more pronounced for large AG mills. In the SAG mill case, the impacts of the steel balls on the surface of the charge are likely to be the most potent. In both cases, the spatial pattern of medium-to-high energy collisions is affected by the rotational speed of the mill. Based on an assumed damage threshold for rock, in terms of specific energy introduced per single collision, the spatial pattern of productive collisions within each charge was estimated and compared with rates of mass loss. We also investigated the nature of the comminution process within AG vs. SAG mill, in order to explain the observed differences in energy utilisation efficiency, between two types of milling. All experiments were performed using a laboratory <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> of 1. 19 m diameter and 0. 31 m length, equipped with 14 square section lifters of height 40 mm. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that the distribution of the impact energy is affected by the number of lifters, lifter height, mill speed and mill filling.

While 2 D codes complete a typical industrial simulation in the order of hours, 3 D codes require computing times in the order of days to weeks on a typical multi-threaded desktop computer. A newly developed and recently introduced 3 D DEM simulation environment is BLAZE-DEM that utilizes the Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) via the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. Utilizing the parallelism of the GPU a 3 D {{simulation of}} an industrial mill with four million particles takes 1 h to simulate one second (20 FPS) on a GTX 880 laptop GPU. This new performance level may allow 3 D simulations to become a routine task for mill designers and researchers. This paper makes two notable extensions to the BLAZE-DEM environment. Firstly, the sphere-face contact is extended to include a GPU efficient sphere-edge contact strategy. Secondly, the world representation is extended by an efficient representation of convex geometrical primitives that can be combined to form non-convex world boundaries that drastically enhances the efficiency of particle world contact. In addition to these extensions this paper verifies and validates our GPU code by comparing charge profiles and power draw obtained using the CPU based code Millsoft and pilot scale experiments. Finally, we conclude with plant <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> simulations. University of Utah. NVIDIA Corporation. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{territory}} of Sassari province analyzing the pedo-climatic conditions and chemical and sensory characteristics of cv Bosana monovarietal olive oil, {{one of the most}} widespread cultivar of Sardinia. As a first step a morpho-pedological land characterization was performed with the support of GIS (Geographical Information System, ArcView 3. 2 - ESRI). Iso-elevation curves map was obtained from the Geo-portal of the Region of Sardinia and elaborated to produce a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from which morphometric maps of altitude, slope and orientation of territory (field aspect) were processed with the spatial analysis tool. Furthermore a soil characterization was made using the Sardinia Region’s maps. As a result, the province of Sassari has been divided in three macro areas (Alghero, Sassari and Ittiri) and in each of them three olive groves has been selected in which to perform the fruits harvest. Olive fruits were manually harvested at three different stages of ripeness in each area (Alghero, Ittiri and Sassari). The olive oil production was carried out using a low <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> in order to standardize all the technological parameters during the oil extraction. As a second step, chemical characterization was performed, considering indices of quality based on the EU Regulation, fatty acids profile, pigments profile, total phenols content, phenolic profile. A sensory characterization was also performed by the “ASSAM panel”. The data obtained were analyzed using one and two way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tuckey test to investigate the effect of the geographical origin and the influence of ripeness on the olive oil characteristics. The different content in some fatty acids, in antheraxanthin, in α and β+γ tochopherols and in vanillic acid observed in the oil samples is attributable to the production area, while the total phenol content, the other phenolic compounds and organoleptic profiles are not able to discriminate the production area. Significant differences between the three areas under study were not found for the trend of maturation; thus it was possible to conclude that the mesoclimatic differences of the three macro area were not strong enough to influence the ripening trend...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{combustion}} {{has increasingly}} {{been used in}} pulverised fuel coal fired power stations {{as a way of}} addressing a wide range of emissions reduction targets. The reuse of existing equipment such as coal mills is essential to minimise the costs of conversion. However the fundamental fracture mechanics involved in biomass comminution are completely different to coal. Thus a thorough knowledge of the comminution properties of all biomass types in coal and biomass mills is necessary in order to minimise operational issues and to optimise milling and combustion. This thesis provides extensive novel characterisation on densified biomass before and after milling. The study analysed 9 densified biomasses, 2 non-densified biomasses, and a sample coal in five different mills; planetary ball mill, Hardgrove Grindability Index testing mill, Bond Work Index ball mill, cutting mill, and a ring-roller mill. Milling was found to have little impact on particle shape, even when an order of magnitude change in particle size was observed. Particle shape is inherent to the particles which comprise a pellet, and is determined by the pre-densified comminution processes. Milling had little impact on compositional particles of herbaceous or wood pellets. Olive cake had the most spherical of all the materials. Thermal pre-treatments of woody biomass not only saw a significant improvement in grindability in all mills, but also enhanced shape factors. The Hardgrove Grindability Index is a poor indicator of the grindability of biomass. The Bond Work Index can be used to analyse the choking potential of biomass pellets prior to full <b>scale</b> <b>mill</b> trials. To optimise milling in coal mills, biomass pellets should be composed of particles close to the required size so that only the pellet comminution stage occurs. The milling behaviour of densified biomass in a laboratory scale ring-roller mill with dynamic classification was investigated for the first time. The milling studies showed that knowledge of a materials critical particle size for comminution through compression is essential to understand its milling behaviour in different mills. The results presented in this thesis not only provide new insight and addresses significant gaps in knowledge, they also provide useful and practical guidance for addressing operational issues such as mill choking, as well as ways to optimise biomass comminution in laboratory and full scale mills, such as mill classifier optimisation based on real particle characteristics...|$|E
