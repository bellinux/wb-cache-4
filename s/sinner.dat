5|$|The Life of a Great <b>Sinner</b> (Житие великого грешника) (December 1869 – January 1870): an {{unfinished}} novel and poem. Written between December 1869 and January 1870, it was abandoned until some elements {{were incorporated into}} A Raw Youth. Similar parts of The Life of a Great <b>Sinner</b> were also indicated in The Possessed and The Brothers Karamazov.|$|E
5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a <b>sinner</b> {{and you are a}} <b>sinner</b> all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... [FIRST. Who {{are brought}} in?] The first is quickly answered--"Christ Jesus {{came into the}} world to save sinners," [...] Jewish <b>sinners,</b> Gentile <b>sinners,</b> old <b>sinners,</b> young <b>sinners,</b> great <b>sinners,</b> the chiefest of <b>sinners.</b> Publicans and harlots--that is, whores, cheaters, and exactors--shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven (1 Tim 1:15; Rom 5:7-11; 1 Cor 6:9,11; Matt 21:31). [...] "For I come not," [...] saith Christ, [...] "to call the righteous, but <b>sinners</b> to repentance" [...] (Mark 2:17).|$|R
6000|$|... [THIRD.] By this {{doctrine}} <b>sinners,</b> as <b>sinners,</b> {{are encouraged to}} come to God for mercy, for the curse due to sin is {{taken out of the}} way. I speak now to <b>sinners</b> that are awake, and see themselves <b>sinners.</b>|$|R
25|$|Jeoseung is {{ruled by}} the ten Underworld gods, the Yeoldaewang. The Yeoldaewang offer {{different}} punishments; Jingang shreds <b>sinners</b> to pieces, Sogan burns <b>sinners</b> in an iron pot, Songye whips <b>sinners</b> and exiles them, and Ogan offers the blessed fire to withstand the cold and makes <b>sinners</b> pass naked through his icy realm. Yeomyeo rips the tongues of those who earned money through interest, Bingshin hurls <b>sinners</b> in a pit full of lizards, spiders, and snakes, Taesan grinds the flesh of <b>sinners</b> inside a barn, and Paengdeung shreds <b>sinners</b> with a saw. Those who are destroyed in Paengdeung's realm must reincarnate into the twelve beasts. Doshi undresses <b>sinners,</b> hangs them on a tree, and hits them ruthlessly, and Yeolsi sends the blessed into the village of Sang, located in Mt.Seokhyo, and sends <b>sinners</b> into a dark realm {{where there is no}} light.|$|R
5|$|And, it is {{a mistake}} to think, that the most {{hardened}} <b>sinner,</b> who oweth his possessions or titles to any such wicked arts of thieving, can have true peace of mind, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, and amid the cries of ruined widows and orphans.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its release, the album had the second-biggest sales week for 2013, behind Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience. Magna Carta Holy Grails debut marked the first time in Billboards history when four {{different}} rap albums have consecutively spent weeks at number one, after Kanye West's Yeezus, Wale's The Gifted and J. Cole's Born <b>Sinner.</b> Magna Carta Holy Grail also became Jay-Z's 13th studio album in a row to top the Billboard 200, extending his record for the most chart-toppers by a solo act in Billboards history.|$|E
5|$|Ben Daniels (born David T Daniels on 10 June 1964) is an English actor.

I will {{conclude}} with this, that his love may be known in many degrees of it, by {{that sort of}} <b>sinners</b> whose salvation he most rejoiceth in, and that is, in the salvation of the <b>sinners</b> that are of the biggest size: Great <b>sinners,</b> Jerusalem <b>sinners,</b> Samaritan <b>sinners,</b> publican <b>sinners.</b> I might urge moreover, how he hath proportioned invitations, promises and examples of his love, for the encouragement and support of those whose souls would trust in him: By which also great degrees of his love may be understood. But we will come now to the third thing that was propounded.|$|R

50|$|Our Lady of Laus {{asked for}} <b>sinners</b> to do penance, a chapel of Eucharistic adoration {{to be built}} so Jesus could convert <b>sinners,</b> and a house for priests to be built so the priests could {{administer}} the sacraments to <b>sinners.</b>|$|R
5|$|Kalasutra (thread of Time/Death): The Bhagavata Purana assigns this hell to {{a murderer}} of a brahmin (the Hindu priestly caste), while the Devi Bhagavata Purana allocates {{it for a}} person who disrespects his parents, elders, {{ancestors}} or brahmins. This realm is made entirely of copper and extremely hot, heated by fire from below and the red hot sun from above. Here, the <b>sinner</b> burns from within by hunger and thirst and the smouldering heat outside, whether he sleeps, sits, stands or runs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many of the horror stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper <b>Sinner,</b> an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E

5|$|Byard {{moved to}} New York City {{in the early}} 1960s. His first {{recording}} as a leader, the solo piano Blues for Smoke, was recorded there on December 16, 1960 (but not released in the United States until 1988). Also in 1960, Byard first played with the bassist Charles Mingus. He recorded extensively with Mingus in the period 1962–64 (including on the important albums on Impulse! Records – Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus and The Black Saint and the <b>Sinner</b> Lady), and toured Europe with him in 1964. Byard also made recordings as a sideman between 1960 and 1966 with Eric Dolphy, Booker Ervin, Roland Kirk, and Rivers. His performance on Dolphy's Outward Bound put Byard {{at the forefront of}} modern jazz.|$|E
5|$|Daniels won the Best Supporting Actor {{award at}} the Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers' Choice Theatre Awards and the 25th Laurence Olivier Awards in 2001 for his {{performance}} in the Arthur Miller play All My Sons. He was first nominated for the latter award earlier in his career, in 1991, for his performance as murderer Richard Loeb in the play Never the <b>Sinner</b> at the Playhouse Theatre. In 2008, Daniels fulfilled a lifetime ambition {{when he made his}} Broadway début, headlining as the Vicomte de Valmont in a revival of Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The show opened on 1 May 2008. Daniels was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for his role.|$|E
5|$|In a four-part series {{published}} between April and August 1995, Brock {{returns to}} New York City in prusuit of supervillain Carnage after learning about Carnage Unleashed, {{a video game}} based on Carnage's rampage in Maximum Carnage (1993). Carnage discovers a method of transporting his symbiote through phone lines, which he uses to hack computers and attack people playing the game. He escapes from the Ravencroft asylum and kidnaps his caregiver, Dr. Pazzo. Venom confronts Carnage in cyberspace, before Pazzo douses Carnage in flammable liquid and sets him ablaze. Venom saves Carnage from dying, reasoning that death is what he wants. A subplot has Brock meeting Kirstin, a young musician. When Brock accidentally paralyzes her boyfriend Clive, Kirstin asks her mother to avenge him; this storyline continues in Venom: <b>Sinner</b> Takes All.|$|E
60|$|But, as I told you, {{this is not}} all; these Jerusalem <b>sinners</b> {{must have}} this offer again and again; {{every one of them}} must be offered it over and over. Christ would not take their first {{rejection}} for a denial, nor their second repulse for a denial; but he will have grace offered once, and twice, and thrice, to these Jerusalem <b>sinners.</b> Is not this amazing grace? Christ will not be put off. These are the <b>sinners</b> that are <b>sinners</b> indeed. They are <b>sinners</b> of the biggest sort; consequently such as Christ can, if they convert and be saved, best serve his ends and designs upon. Of which more anon.|$|R

5|$|The {{sound of}} Japanese bands Earthshaker, Loudness, Anthem and other minor groups was also {{influenced}} by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums. The Japanese band Bow Wow even transferred to England {{to be part of}} the British metal scene. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France and Spain promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately. Acts like Accept, Grave Digger, <b>Sinner</b> and Warlock from Germany, E.F. Band from Sweden, Mercyful Fate from Denmark, Killer and Ostrogoth from Belgium, Picture and Bodine from the Netherlands, Trust and Nightmare from France, and Barón Rojo and Ángeles del Infierno from Spain, formed between 1978 and 1982 and were heavily influenced by the sound of the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch Roadrunner Records or with the Belgian Mausoleum Records, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.|$|E
5|$|Zappa {{attempted}} {{to earn a}} living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with {{a new version of the}} Blackouts. Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films The World's Greatest <b>Sinner</b> (1962) and Run Home Slow (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer Timothy Carey and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records. The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot. Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album The Lost Episodes (1996).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night <b>sinner</b> and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a <b>sinner</b> bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{also had}} {{experience}} with the indulgences connected to All Saints' Church, Wittenberg. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences {{and the way they}} cheapened grace rather than requiring true repentance. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel's indulgences, claimed that they no longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel had said about indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the penitent had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant <b>sinner</b> would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God's righteousness and desired the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the Ninety-five Theses. He composed a Treatise on Indulgences, apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church leaders on the subject by letter, including his superior , Bishop of Brandenburg, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the Theses to Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg.|$|E
