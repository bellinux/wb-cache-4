5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.|$|E
5|$|The {{stricken}} airliner crashed onto Mount Bliss in the San Gabriel Mountains at {{an elevation}} of approximately , where {{the bulk of the}} wreckage landed in a gorge. Fire department officials sent search and rescue helicopters to the crash site, but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the crash site, a number of them intact and still <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> their seats. News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E

25|$|Inexpensive, {{very simple}} packs that combine the {{drawstring}} and <b>straps</b> <b>into</b> {{a single piece}} of cloth or webbing are occasionally sold for use at sporting events and the like. Some high-end retailers (notably Apple Stores) use a similar design for their shopping bags as well.|$|R
5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Biryukova {{parked the}} car {{on the side of the}} road and left Sky <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> his car seat inside while she took Maile to find assistance. An hour later, she reached a Chevron station a mile (1.6km) north of where she parked. Instead of buying gas or having someone bring it to her car, she called a friend, who gave her a ride back to her car.|$|E
25|$|The {{first test}} {{subjects}} were human cadavers. They {{were used to}} obtain fundamental information about the human body's ability to withstand the crushing and tearing forces typically experienced in a high-speed accident. To such an end, steel ball bearings were dropped on skulls, and bodies were dumped down unused elevator shafts onto steel plates. Cadavers fitted with crude accelerometers were <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> automobiles and subjected to head-on collisions and vehicle rollovers.|$|E
60|$|Ben spoke {{without looking}} up, and {{affected}} {{to be very}} busy buckling a <b>strap</b> <b>into</b> Sanch's collar, for the two were so seldom parted that the dog always rebelled. It was a mistake on Ben's part, for while his eyes were on his work Bab's were devouring the bill which Sam still held, and her suspicions were aroused by the boys' faces.|$|R
5000|$|Invented in {{the early}} 19th century, the tramp chair was a cage made of bent and riveted metal <b>strapping</b> <b>into</b> {{the shape of a}} chair. An {{individual}} could be placed inside the chair and locked up securely, the chair thus acting as a jail cell, particularly in towns too small to build a jail. It was sometimes placed on a wheeled platform so it could be moved around easily.|$|R

"It wouldn't be fun if you didn't {{have any}} folks {{to take care}} of you," [...] began Ben, thoughtfully looking about the {{familiar}} place where the men were now feeding the animals, setting their refreshment tables, or lounging on the hay to get such rest as they could before the evening entertainment. Suddenly he started, gave a long look, then turned to Bab, and thrusting Sancho's <b>strap</b> <b>into</b> her hand, said, hastily: ...|$|R
25|$|The ball is <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> {{the mouth}} behind the teeth, with the straps {{going around the}} head to secure it in place. They are used {{as a sign of}} control by the dominant. If the ball is very large, it may be {{difficult}} to insert behind the teeth or to remove it. The wearer can still be heard, but it renders their speech completely unintelligible, distorts their facial features, and causes drooling if the wearer attempts to talk.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} the Ronde's narrow and badly {{surfaced}} hills came close to tragedy when Danish rider Jesper Skibby was hit from behind by an official's car and fell onto a roadside bank, still <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> his pedals. The official's car then tried to pass him and ran over Skibby's back wheel, narrowly missing his leg. The race official continued to the finish, where he was met by angry spectators throwing mud, cups and stones at his car. The incident overshadowed the victory of Claude Criquielion, the first French-speaking Belgian winner of the Tour of Flanders.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{resulted in}} the first fatality on a spacecraft in flight since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The survival of pilot Peter Siebold also {{marks the first time}} in history that anyone has survived the destruction of a spacecraft during a flight when others on board have died. Investigators are trying to determine how Siebold managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet, an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. On November 7, Siebold told investigators that the aircraft broke up around him. He was still <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> his seat. He released the straps and his parachute later deployed automatically. Siebold was not wearing a pressure suit during the flight.|$|E
5000|$|The find {{consisted}} of a large Roman bronze vessel with a handle, a situla, which held a large gold torc, four Roman wine cups resembling modern tastevins, a bronze strainer and two bronze bells. The hoard was from about 100 AD and all the objects were exceptionally well preserved. On {{the handle of the}} situla were stamps reading [...] "TOR, CANNIMASUIT, (P CI)PI POLYB and IPI(?)". The two bells were tied together with leather <b>straps</b> <b>into</b> a rattle.|$|R
50|$|At {{the talent}} show, Marc the magician tricks Giles <b>into</b> <b>strapping</b> himself <b>into</b> a guillotine, {{supposedly}} a magic prop. Buffy, Xander and Willow rush to rescue Giles, and with Sid's help they kill Marc—who was the demon all along. Sid finishes the demon by driving a knife through its heart and collapses as his soul is {{freed from the}} dummy.|$|R
60|$|Another {{tremendous}} {{section of}} the glacier rumbled earthward. The wind whipped in at the open doorway, bulging out {{the sides of the}} tent till it swayed like a huge bladder at its guy ropes. The smoke swirled about them, and the sleet drove sharply into their flesh. Tommy pulled the flaps together hastily, and returned to his tearful task at the fire-box. Dick Humphries threw the mended pack <b>straps</b> <b>into</b> a corner and lighted his pipe. Even Molly was for the moment persuaded.|$|R
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E
25|$|Kym Barrett, costume designer, {{said that}} she defined the {{characters}} and their environment by their costume. For example, Reeves' office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled, and out of place. Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, {{and be able to}} work the wires while <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> the harnesses. For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character. For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film JFK.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the rocket had also {{dislodged}} two of the 1000-lb AN-M65 bombs, which fell to the deck, and lay in the pool of burning fuel between White's aircraft and that of Lieutenant Commander John McCain. Damage Control Team No. 8 swung into action immediately, and Chief Gerald Farrier, recognizing the risk, and {{without the benefit of}} protective clothing, immediately smothered the bombs with a PKP fire extinguisher in an effort to delay the fuel fire spreading for long enough to allow the pilots to escape. The pilots, still <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> their aircraft, were immediately aware that a disaster was unfolding, but only some were able to escape in time. McCain, pilot of A-4 Skyhawk side No. 416, next to White's, {{was among the first to}} notice the flames, and escaped by scrambling down the nose of his A-4 and jumping off the refueling probe shortly before the explosions began.|$|E

60|$|All this time, Mr. Winkle, {{with his}} face and hands blue with the cold, had been forcing a gimlet into the sole of his feet, and putting his skates on, with the points behind, and getting the <b>straps</b> <b>into</b> a very {{complicated}} and entangled state, {{with the assistance of}} Mr. Snodgrass, who knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo. At length, however, with the assistance of Mr. Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet.|$|R
5000|$|Bamboo {{scaffolding}} {{is widely}} used in Hong Kong, with nylon <b>straps</b> tied <b>into</b> knots as couplers. [...] In India, bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used, with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair (coir).|$|R
25|$|In response, the RAF readied all Tempests and Spitfires {{to attack}} any IAF {{aircraft}} they encountered and bomb IAF airfields. British {{troops in the}} Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. The Royal Navy was also placed on high alert. At Hatzor Airbase, the general consensus among the pilots, most of whom had flown with or alongside the RAF during World War II, was that the RAF would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots to go without retaliation, and would probably attack the base at dawn the next day. That night, in anticipation of an impending British attack, some pilots decided not to offer any resistance and left the base, while others prepared their Spitfires and were <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> the cockpits at dawn, preparing to repel a retaliatory airstrike. However, despite pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, British commanders refused to authorize any retaliatory strikes.|$|E
25|$|One of Houdini's {{most popular}} {{publicity}} stunts {{was to have}} himself <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane. Houdini would then make his escape {{in full view of}} the assembled crowd. In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt. Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper. In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the New York subway. After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket. Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds. There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape. Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA. After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary. The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named Randolph Osborne Douglas (March 31, 1895– December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at Sheffield's Empire Theatre.|$|E
500|$|At {{the rifle}} range Lody was <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> a chair. He refused {{to have his}} eyes bandaged, as he wished to die with his eyes open. A few moments later the {{inhabitants}} of the Tower heard [...] "the muffled sound of a single volley". His body was taken away to be buried in an unmarked grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow. The War Office issued a terse announcement of the execution a few days later on 10 November: [...] "Sentence is duly confirmed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Recorded in Port Coquitlam, BC, and {{released}} 11 August 2009 when {{the band was}} established in Toronto, Paint's debut album Can You Hear Me? was automatically praised as [...] "5 STARS: in your face, but not overpowering, melodic but still harsh, well-crafted but not over-perfected... heartbreaking yet uplifting.... an underlying sense of sonic maturity and strong lyrical insight... well-developed and layered...retain(s) the attractive simplicity of a great rock album," [...] {{as well as an}} [...] "alt-rock relic spiritually scraping the ’90s, done with so much audacity and seismic guitar crunch one can’t help but <b>strap</b> <b>into</b> their time machine... this Toronto quartet wisely keep the sound big, but the anthemic denouements concise." ...|$|R

500|$|From February 1942, the RAN {{played a}} {{critical}} role in resupplying Australian and Dutch commandos on Timor. Voyager was not the only loss during the campaign. On 1 December 1942, [...] was attacked by thirteen Japanese aircraft while attempting to land Dutch soldiers off Betano, Portuguese Timor. Armidale sank with the loss of 40 of her crew and 60 Dutch personnel. During the engagement, Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean operated an Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun and was wounded by strafing Japanese planes, he went down with the ship, still <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> the gun and still shooting at the attacking aircraft.|$|E
500|$|At 1:00pm EST (1800 GMT) on January 27, first Grissom, then Chaffee, and White {{entered the}} Command Module fully pressure-suited, and were <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> their seats and {{hooked up to}} the spacecraft's oxygen and {{communication}} systems. Grissom immediately noticed a strange odor in the air circulating through his suit which he compared to [...] "sour buttermilk", and the simulated countdown was held at 1:20pm, while air samples were taken. No cause of the odor could be found, and the countdown was resumed at 2:42pm. The accident investigation found this odor not {{to be related to the}} fire.|$|E
500|$|One {{thing that}} was not seen at the time by the public was Shepard's pre-launch [...] "emergency". [...] Because the entire journey was only {{expected}} to take fifteen minutes, Shepard's suit {{did not have any}} provision for elimination of bodily wastes. After being <b>strapped</b> <b>into</b> the capsule's seat, launch delays kept him in that suit for eight hours; Shepard's endurance gave out before launch, and he was forced to empty his bladder into the suit, which shorted out the medical sensors attached to it to track the astronaut's condition in flight. [...] After Shepard's flight, NASA called in the space suit's manufacturer, B. F. Goodrich, and by the time of John Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 orbital flight the following year, a liquid waste collection feature had been built into the suit.|$|E
5000|$|From {{receiving}} notification from North Bay to scramble, the jet fighters {{had to be}} airborne {{within five}} minutes. Under certain conditions, 15 minutes or even one hour was permitted, but five minutes was the norm. To meet this requirement, jet fighters were positioned at air force bases across Canada and in Maine, fully fuelled and fully armed, 24 hours a day/seven days per week. They, and their pilots, were housed in special Quick Reaction Alert hangars (abbreviated [...] "QRA") {{at the end of}} runways. When North Bay contacted an air base for a scramble, simultaneously air traffic control on that base would halt and/or move aside all activity on the airfield. The fighter pilots would <b>strap</b> <b>into</b> and start their jets and the QRA's doors opened, then the jets would taxi out to the runway and take off.|$|R
