40|$|Common {{practice}} {{for managing the}} credit risk of lending portfolios is to calculate maximum loss within the "value at risk" framework. Most financial institutions use largescale Monte Carlo simulations to do this. However, such simulations may impose heavy calculation loads. This paper proposes a simplified method that approximates maximum loss with minimal simulation burden. Our method divides a portfolio into sub-portfolios at each credit rating level and calculates the maximum loss of each <b>sub-portfolio.</b> We assume that the sub-portfolio's structure provokes little fluctuation in the ratio between the maximum loss and the standard deviation. We therefore begin with a <b>sub-portfolio</b> in which each exposure is of the same amount (a homogeneous <b>sub-portfolio).</b> Simple calculations provide the standard deviation for both the heterogeneous <b>sub-portfolio</b> whose risk is to be measured and the homogeneous subportfolio. The maximum loss for the homogeneous <b>sub-portfolio</b> {{can be obtained by}} using an [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic multi-portfolio default model for consistent and arbitragefree pricing synthetic CDO tranches that reference a bespoke portfolio. In order to incorporate standard tranche price information, {{we assume that}} the bespoke portfolio has name overlapping with some index portfolios. Dividing the total portfolio (parent) into non-overlapping sub-portfolios (children), and assuming homogeneity for both the parent and the children, we use a top-down dynamic default intensity model for the parent, and specify the conditional probability of default in the children given imminent default in the parent. We consider two fundamental cases which are building blocks of more complex applications: (a) the parent is an index and the bespoke is a child; and (b) the bespoke is the parent that contains one or more indices as children. When the parent is the index, the parent default process is uniquely determined independent of the children, and the child conditional default probability distribution is calibrated to the spreads of the children. When the bespoke is the parent and one or more children are indexes, we simultaneously calibrate the parent default intensity model and the child default probability to the standard tranches and child portfolio spreads. The model is designed to establish consistency between the pricing of standard tranches and the pricing of bespoke tranches. Application may include Portfolio enlargement where the bespoke tranche references a “global ” portfolio that contains “regional ” indexes as <b>sub-portfolio.</b> For example, tranches referencing CDX.

40|$|Fund {{investments}} are {{very popular in}} Sweden. However, we have the impression that despite this popularity, the average fund investor in Sweden does not {{pay much attention to}} the importance and possible link of fund’s asset composition features (e. g. Asset class, Holdings, and Geo-exposure) to fund’s performance. Instead, S/he relies on factors such as fees, risk levels, historical performance, etc. in her/his investment decisions. Similarly, academic studies mainly focus on attributes such as funds fees, size, and manager’s skill to explain fund’s performance. Thus there are limited premier academic studies on the relationship between fund’s performance and its asset composition features. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate possible causal relationship between the performances of funds with their assets composition features. We study the whole population of 346 Swedish listed mutual funds older than five years for the period 2009 - 2013. The results of the study provides the investors and analysts with additional decision-making and investment-analysis tools to assist them in making more informed judgment on funds and their expected returns. The results are also useful for fund managers to improve their strategies by refining the combinations of their funds’ asset composition attributes in order to improve the absolute risk-adjusted performance of their funds. Our research philosophy has been based on positivism and objectivism along with functionalist paradigm and we have applied deductive approach to test the theories. We have used quantitative method and collected the funds’ data from public business databases and chosen Jensen’s alpha and Treynor ratio as funds’ risk-adjusted performance measures. We performed Correlation tests and Regression with robust techniques on our data to answer the research question from three aspects, namely asset class (equity, bond, and mixed assets); geo-exposures (Sweden, Global, Europe, and Nordic) and Top-ten holdings’ measures (asset concentration and Treynor of each fund’s passive top-ten <b>sub-portfolio).</b> We conclude that correlations between funds’ risk-adjusted performance and assets composition features are likely to exist. Stronger correlations are observed between the explanatory measures and fund’s relative risk-adjusted performance (fund’s Treynor) as compared to fund’s absolute risk adjusted performance (fund’s Jensen’s alpha). Asset concentration in top-ten holdings and bond asset class are more likely to be in casual relationship with fund’s risk-adjusted performance, whereas Treynor ratio of top-ten holdings’ passive <b>sub-portfolio</b> as well as fund’s geo-exposure do not seem to have strong explanatory power for funds’ absolute performance...|$|E
40|$|Various {{concepts}} {{appeared in}} the existing literature to evaluate the risk exposure of a financial or insurance firm/subsidiary/line of business due to the occurrence of some extreme scenarios. Many of those concepts, such as Marginal Expected Shortfall or Tail Conditional Expectation, are simply some conditional expectations that evaluate the risk in adverse scenarios and are useful for signaling to a decision-maker the poor performance of its risk portfolio or to identify which <b>sub-portfolio</b> is likely to exhibit a massive downside risk. We investigate the latter risk {{under the assumption that}} it is measured via a coherent risk measure, which obviously generalizes the idea of only taking the expectation of the downside risk. Multiple examples are given and our numerical illustrations show how the asymptotic approximations can be used in the capital allocation exercise. We have concluded that the expectation of the downside risk does not fairly take into account the individual risk contribution when allocating the VaR-based regulatory capital, and thus, more conservative risk measurements are recommended. Finally, we have found that more conservative risk measurements do not improve the fairness of the cost of capital allocation when the uncertainty with parameter estimation is present, even at a very high level...|$|E

Although there is a growing theoretical and empirical liter a-ture on liquidity effects in fixed income markets there is no clear answer how to measure liquidity and whether liquidity is priced in the market at all. Our empirical analysis is based on an unique data set containing individual bond data from six major EMU government bond markets allowing us to compare yield curves est imated for subportfolios which are formed with respect to different potential liquidity measures. In a second procedure liquidity meas-ures are collected on the single bond level and estimated pricing errors given some reference yield curve are regressed against these liquidity vari ables. This enables us to conduct formal tests on the pricing impact of liquidity measures. The results indicate that the bench mark property and the number of contributors are the most promising liquidity proxies which have significant results in most countries. The results do not support the hypothesis that other l i-quidity measures under consideration like the on-t h e-run property, the issue size, and bid- ask spread related measures have a persistent price impact.

40|$|The {{situation}} {{of a limited}} availability of historical data is frequently encountered in portfolio risk estimation, especially in credit risk estimation. This makes it difficult, for example, to find statistically significant temporal structures in the data on the single asset level. By contrast, {{there is often a}} broader availability of cross-sectional data, i. e. a large number of assets in the portfolio. This paper proposes a stochastic dynamic model which takes this situation into account. The modelling framework is based on multivariate elliptical processes which model portfolio risk via <b>sub-portfolio</b> specific volatility indices called portfolio risk drivers. The dynamics of the risk drivers are modelled by multiplicative error models (MEMs) -as introduced by Engle [Engle, R. F., 2002. New frontiers for ARCH models. J. Appl. Econom. 17, 425 - 446]-or by traditional ARMA models. The model is calibrated to Moody's KMV Credit Monitor asset returns (also known as firm-value returns) given on a monthly basis for 756 listed European companies at 115 time points from 1996 to 2005. This database is used by financial institutions to assess the credit quality of firms. The proposed risk drivers capture the volatility structure of asset returns in different industry sectors. A characteristic cyclical as well as a seasonal temporal structure of the risk drivers is found across all industry sectors. In addition, each risk driver exhibits idiosyncratic developments. We also identify correlations between the risk drivers and selected macroeconomic variables. These findings may improve the estimation of risk measures such as the (portfolio) Value at Risk. The proposed methods are general and can be applied to any series of multivariate asset or equity returns in finance and insurance.

" Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory {{leads us to}} diversify our portfolio to achieve the highest Sharp ratio. Fama-French's Three-Factor Model links the asset's characteristics to the risk-return profile and further advances the portfolio theory. However, in practice, due to uncertainty and lack of data, none of those theories gets implemented {{in a way that}} can help construct a complex portfolio and generate portfolio optimization strategies. Especially for the Commercial Real Estate Industry, investors face challenges in long-term data collection and a tremendous amount of data processing. In 2009, Michael W. Brandt, Pedro Santa-Clara, and Rossen Valkanov explored a new approach that fundamentally improves the portfolio optimization methodology. They modeled the portfolio weight in each asset {{as a function of the}} asset's characteristics and the associated capital market conditions. The coefficients of this function are found by optimizing the investor's average utility of the portfolio's return over the sample period. This approach is computationally simple, and can be easily modified to include more asset characteristics and capital market variables. In a later study, Alberto Plazzi, Walter Torous, and Rossen Valkanov applied Brandt, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov's methodology to optimize commercial real estate portfolios, and explored several techniques in commercial real estate portfolio management. This thesis follows Plazzi, Torous and Valkanov's research framework, applies the methodology to a specific real estate investment fund, and proposes several innovations to further explore the application of this theory in real estate fund management. First, I propose to rebalance the portfolio annually because real estate transactions are less frequent compared with other types of assets, such as stocks or bonds. Second, I construct sub-portfolios by property type and region because the <b>sub-portfolio</b> optimization can provide practical suggestions to specific asset managers in charge of a specific type of property or a specific region. Finally, I include capital market indicators, such as the Chicago Fed National Activity Index and Liquidity Metrics. These innovations use academic research to inform practice, thus providing asset managers practical suggestions to guide wealth allocation across different commercial properties, and to take advantage of movements in expected returns arising from the changing macroeconomic conditions. by Yanjia Liu.
