50|$|Ephestia elutella, the cacao <b>moth,</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>moth</b> or {{warehouse}} moth, {{is a small}} moth of {{the family}} Pyralidae. It is probably native to Europe, but has been transported widely, even to Australia. A subspecies is E. e. pterogrisella.|$|R
50|$|Setomorpha rutella (tropical <b>tobacco</b> <b>moth)</b> is a moth of the Tineidae family.

40|$|Among {{the insect}} species causing infestations and serious damages to stored commodities, the {{cigarette}} beetle, Lasiodermaserricorne (F.) and the <b>tobacco</b> <b>moth,</b> Ephestiaelutella (Hübner) {{are the major}} pests of both raw and manufactured tobacco. Post-harvest tobacco control is achieved through sanitation, insect monitoring, and fumigation with phosphine. However, insect resistance to phosphine and control failures have been reported, and increasing regulatory pressure is being exerted on fumigants. Biological control agents such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) appear to be environmentally sound and potentially viable alternatives to chemical control. Bt is a bacterium that produces insecticidal crystal proteins during the sporulation phase and has been, for more than 40 years, the microorganism of choice for the biocontrol of phytophagous insect pests. It produces insecticidal crystal proteins that display specific activity against certain orders of insects and become active upon ingestion by the insect. Our laboratory has conducted extensive research and worldwide surveys to evaluate the presence of Bt in <b>stored</b> <b>tobacco</b> and has confirmed previous findings indicating that Bt may be {{considered part of the}} naturally occurring phylloplanemicroflora. Several Bt strains were isolated from tobacco and characterized by DNA and protein profiling. The insecticidal activity of selected strains and of two commercial products against the larvae of L. serricorne was determined by diet incorporation assays. Moreover, the stability of Bt spores and crystal proteins on cured tobacco leaves was assessed over a storage period of time of 30 months. Cigarette prototypes were made with Bt-treated tobacco. Standard cigarette and smoke evaluations did not show any significant difference between the test and control cigarettes. Although the tested Bt strains and products did not yield satisfactory levels of mortality at the required times and doses, the experimental results summarized in the present review indicate that B. thuringiensishas potential for the control of the cigarette beetle. The integration of conventional control approaches with novel systems based on biological agents with different modes of action should offer new avenues for the effective management of <b>stored</b> <b>tobacco</b> pests in line with integrated pest management (IPM) concepts...|$|R

50|$|Anna Levinson has {{collaborated with}} {{national}} and international research teams like those of Wittko Francke, Christoph Reichmuth, Kenji Mori, Robert M.

These traps were eventually patented in numerous countries and are routinely used until now. They significantly {{reduce the number of}} insecticidal treatments required in the storage environment.

40|$|Lasioderma serricorne (F.) and Ephestia elutella (Hb.) are {{the most}} serious pests of <b>stored</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Mainly are the larvae that feed on the product, may {{contaminate}} it with their excreta and cause damage on tobacco and allergic responses. The present work evaluated cigarette beetles and tobacco moths’ populations from the tobacco fields to the processing factories in Portugal using pheromone traps. Density, dispersion, risk assessment and the efficacy of making decisions based on economic thresholds were evaluated. For L. serricorne, the efficacy of mass-trapping using pheromone traps was studied. Sequential sampling for risk assessment was developed for processed tobacco and in a cigarette factory. These studies pretended to contribute for the integrated pest management of <b>stored</b> <b>tobacco</b> and also for the stored products in general, as the methodologies applied, with some adaptations, {{can be used for}} other pests and stored products...|$|R
