40|$|A cooler {{consisting}} of a sorption compressor with a Joule-Thomson (JT) cold stage has several advantages. These coolers have no moving parts which is attractive {{for a variety of}} reasons. Unfortunately, the efficiency of sorption-based JT coolers is in many cases relatively small. This paper presents a thermodn. description of the compressor and the cold stage sep. Their efficiencies are optimized individually. Besides, an optimization of the total cooler is performed. Furthermore, the thermodn. impact of design changes to improve these efficiencies is discussed. The efficiency of the sorption compressor can be increased significantly by incorporating two-stage compression. The efficiency of the cold stage can largely be increased by precooling. Generally, a TE cooler is used for this purpose. Two-stage compression opens the opportunity to integrate a JT precooler into the cold stage that is driven by the pressure difference created by the second compression stage. Also an addnl. sorption cooler can be used for this purpose. A case study is performed for nitrogen as the working gas and both Saran and Maxsorb as the adsorbent. Four cooler configurations are thermodynamically compared. In this study, the cooler efficiency increases by a factor of 3 by the application of two-stage compression compared to <b>single-stage</b> <b>compression.</b> Another factor of 3 is obtained by using an internal JT precooler. Incorporating an external sorption cooler as a precooler gives a further improvement with nearly a factor of 2, resulting in a 17 times larger efficiency compared to <b>single-stage</b> <b>compression.</b> Depending on the configuration, a Saran-based cooler has a 1. 5 - 2 times better efficiency than a cooler operating with Maxsorb.

These systems typically consist of many different components, each component may be produced by a different manufacturer. The operational data provided by the different manufacturers for each component is used by system designers to specify installation and operational procedures of the system. Often times, the optimum control of an individual piece of equipment results in sub-optimal system performance due to unforeseen interactions between the different system components. It is important to identify and monitor key parameters of the system, such as power consumption and refrigeration effect, in order to optimize the performance. The efforts of this research focused on modeling an operating, ammonia vapor compression, refrigeration system serving a two-temperature food storage and distribution facility located near Milwaukee, WI. This system utilized a combination of both single-screw and reciprocating compressors operating under <b>single-stage</b> <b>compression,</b> an evaporative condenser, and both liquid overfeed and direct expansion evaporators. The model was verified with experimental data recorded from the system and then used to identify alternative designs and operating techniques that lead to optimum system performance. Changes in system operation such as variable frequency (VFD) or multi-speed motor control on condenser and evaporator fans, head pressure control, refrigerant temperature control, and aspects of load sharing between compressors were investigated. Also, the performance of several alternative system designs was investigated.

This thesis develops a steady state model of a reciprocating, <b>single-stage,</b> vapor <b>compression</b> chiller, based on thermodynamic principles and the ASHRAE HVAC- 1 primary toolkit model, to predict and diagnose the behavior of the chiller. The characteristics of the chiller are identified by measuring certain parameters.

A model-based approach is followed for chiller fault detection and diagnosis. The model generates residues by comparing the output of the chiller model with that of the same model albeit with some faults embedded. A nonzero residue indicates the presence of a fault. Various neuro-based classification techniques such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (grid partition and subtractive clustering) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are evaluated, culminating in fault identification and isolation by an ANN system, batch trained with a fault matrix using the Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm, on a feed-forward back propagation network.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a conceptual design of a next-generation pulsed-power accelerator that is optimized for megajoule-class dynamic-material-physics experiments. Sufficient electrical energy is delivered by the accelerator to a physics load to achieve—within centimeter-scale samples—material pressures as high as 1  TPa. The accelerator design {{is based on an}} architecture that is founded on three concepts: <b>single-stage</b> electrical-pulse <b>compression,</b> impedance matching, and transit-time-isolated drive circuits. The prime power source of the accelerator consists of 600 independent impedance-matched Marx generators. Each Marx comprises eight 5. 8 -GW bricks connected electrically in series, and generates a 100 -ns 46 -GW electrical-power pulse. A 450 -ns-long water-insulated coaxial-transmission-line impedance transformer transports the power generated by each Marx to a system of twelve 2. 5 -m-radius water-insulated conical transmission lines. The conical lines are connected electrically in parallel at a 66 -cm radius by a water-insulated 45 -post sextuple-post-hole convolute. The convolute sums the electrical currents at the outputs of the conical lines, and delivers the combined current to a single solid-dielectric-insulated radial transmission line. The radial line in turn transmits the combined current to the load. Since much of the accelerator is water insulated, we refer to it as Neptune. Neptune is 40  m in diameter, stores 4. 8  MJ of electrical energy in its Marx capacitors, and generates 28  TW of peak electrical power. Since the Marxes are transit-time isolated from each other for 900  ns, they can be triggered at different times to construct–over an interval as long as 1 [*][*]μs–the specific load-current time history required for a given experiment. Neptune delivers 1  MJ and 20  MA in a 380 -ns current pulse to an 18 -mΩ load; hence Neptune is a megajoule-class 20 -MA arbitrary waveform generator.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} (LT, - 35 °C to - 50 °C) and ultra {{low temperature}} (ULT, - 50 °C to - 100 °C) refrigeration {{is required in}} the life sciences industry for the production and storage of biological systems. The minimum practical storage temperature of a simple, single-stage refrigeration system is - 30 °C, and this is incapable of meeting the requirements of biotechnology applications. Current LT and ULT refrigeration systems utilize cascade systems, which are combinations of single-stage refrigeration systems operating at successively lower temperatures. Because they use multiple compressors, cascade systems have higher capital and operating costs than simple <b>single-stage</b> vapor <b>compression</b> refrigeration systems. Equipment operating costs of LT and ULT refrigeration contribute significantly to the operating costs of biotechnology companies and therefore motivate the development of lower cost, higher performance refrigeration systems. One approach to achieving greater efficiency {{is the development of}} single compressor systems that utilize a refrigerant mixture and a condensing separator. After compression, the refrigerants are separated and follow refrigeration cycles similar in working temperature and pressure to cascade systems to achieve the desired temperature and heat load capacity. The refrigerant mixture streams are combined at the suction side of the compressor and compressed again to complete the cycle. This concept has the benefit of using a single compressor to reach low temperatures rather than the multiple compressors used in cascade systems. This work addresses the modeling, analysis and testing of a single compressor mixed refrigerant system (MRS) for low temperature applications. A model will be developed using first and second law principles of thermodynamics to calculate the refrigeration capacity, power consumption, coefficient of performance (COP), and second law efficiency.

The designs {{are based on}} an accelerator architecture that is founded on two concepts: <b>single-stage</b> electrical-pulse <b>compression</b> and impedance matching [Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 10, 030401 (2007) ]. The prime power source of each machine consists of 90 linear-transformer-driver (LTD) modules. Each module comprises LTD cavities connected electrically in series, {{each of which is}} powered by 5 -GW LTD bricks connected electrically in parallel. (A brick comprises a single switch and two capacitors in series.) Six water-insulated radial-transmission-line impedance transformers transport the power generated by the modules to a six-level vacuum-insulator stack. The stack serves as the accelerator’s water-vacuum interface. The stack is connected to six conical outer magnetically insulated vacuum transmission lines (MITLs), which are joined in parallel at a 10 -cm radius by a triple-post-hole vacuum convolute. The convolute sums the electrical currents at the outputs of the six outer MITLs, and delivers the combined current to a single short inner MITL. The inner MITL transmits the combined current to the accelerator’s physics-package load. Z 300 is 35  m in diameter and stores 48  MJ of electrical energy in its LTD capacitors. The accelerator generates 320  TW of electrical power at the output of the LTD system, and delivers 48  MA in 154  ns to a magnetized-liner inertial-fusion (MagLIF) target [Phys. Plasmas 17, 056303 (2010) ]. The peak electrical power at the MagLIF target is 870  TW, which is the highest power throughout the accelerator. Power amplification is accomplished by the centrally located vacuum section, which serves as an intermediate inductive-energy-storage device. The principal goal of Z 300 is to achieve thermonuclear ignition; i. e., a fusion yield that exceeds the energy transmitted by the accelerator to the liner. 2 D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations suggest Z 300 will deliver 4. 3  MJ to the liner, and achieve a yield on the order of 18  MJ. Z 800 is 52  m in diameter and stores 130  MJ. This accelerator generates 890  TW at the output of its LTD system, and delivers 65  MA in 113  ns to a MagLIF target.

One of the approaches to combat these issues {{is the use of}} thermally driven solid sorption compression with non-ozone depleting refrigerant. In this context, the research work presented in this thesis is devoted to a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis and development of a laboratory model of an activated carbon+ HFC 134 a adsorption refrigeration system. The cooling load catered to by the laboratory model is 2 - 5 W, mainly for thermal management of electronics. A complete thermodynamic analysis is carried out for the desorption temperatures varying from 75 to 90 oC, evaporating temperatures from - 20 to 15 oC and adsorption/condensing temperatures from 25 to 40 oC. A program on MatLab platform is developed for theoretical modeling. A new concept of thermal compression uptake efficiency (u) which is analogous to volumetric efficiency of a positive displacement compressor is introduced to consider the effect of void volume. The thesis also covers an investigation of two-stage and hybrid (thermal+ mechanical) cycle compression systems. It is possible to identify the conditions under which a two-stage gives a better performance than a single-stage one. It also shows that hybrid cycle system gives the best performance and saves ~ 40 % of power compared to operation under the same conditions run with a <b>single-stage</b> mechanical <b>compression</b> refrigeration system. A heat transfer analysis of the thermal compressor is carried out to evaluate non-uniformities in bed temperature. As a part of it, the thermal conductivity of the bed under adsorbed state has been calculated. A laboratory model of activated carbon+ HFC 134 a adsorption refrigeration system is fabricated to meet a 2 - 5 Watts cooling load based on the results from theoretical calculations. Experimental results show a fair match in the trends for the COP with analysis. The main aim of the research was to examine how effective the adsorption refrigeration system is in reducing the temperature rise of the heater used to simulate the electronic component. The heater that would have stabilized at 81, 97, 103 and 112 oC without any cooling for heat inputs of 3, 4, 4. 4 and 4. 9 W, respectively, would attain a cyclic steady state around 24, 26, 28, 31 oC. The influence of cycle time on the performance of the systems is also investigated. It is concluded that an activated carbon+ HFC 134 a adsorption refrigeration system can be a good supplement to conventional compression refrigeration systems. In situations where heat recovery imminent this system could be a good choice.

40|$|Industrial {{waste heat}} often {{contains}} {{large amounts of}} useable energy that cannot be utilized in its current form, {{and has to be}} used together with a waste heating technology to become useful. With increasing energy prices and carbon taxes, efficient use of energy is increasingly important to be able to reduce the net energy consumption and the emissions of greenhouse gases. This thesis aims at finding suitable, environmentally friendly and high efficiency heat pump solutions for waste heat recovery. This is done for a case where heat is extracted from the flue gas of a natural gas boiler, and used by a heat pump to produce hot water for washing purposes. It is important to have a reliable, efficient and long lasting heat pump, that can provide the desired heat and temperature to show their potential and to further increase their market share. A review of recent literature was conducted, giving an overview of recent developments in the field. A <b>single-stage</b> vapor <b>compression</b> cycle was chosen to solve the case, and suitable components were found. Simulation models were developed to investigate the performance of the heat pump using R 600, R 600 a and R 1234 ze(Z) at different operating conditions. The results of the simulations were then used to do economic evaluations of the heat pump in regards to investment and annual costs. The costs of choosing a heat pump over a natural gas boiler were also investigated. The results from the simulations shows the importance of reducing the losses in the heat pump cycle, especially in the evaporator. By increasing the evaporation temperature, thus the area of the heat exchanger, resulted in a significantly lower pressure drop. This reduced the work input in addition to reduce the required compressor volume and condenser size. R 1234 ze(Z) achieved the highest COP equal to 3, 8 and the lowest annual cost of 325 000 NOK/year resulting in a pay-off time of 3, 3 years when compared to a natural gas boiler. R 600 achieved higher performance than R 600 a. The operational costs were the biggest contributor to the annual costs, optimizing the operating conditions for the compressor are therefore of significant importance. This is especially important when the difference in electricity and natural gas prices are large, {{to be able to be}} a competitive heating solution. Heat pumps have the potential to reduce the energy consumption in industrial heating processes and at the same time being a profitable investment, even in markets where the electricity prices are a lot higher than fossil alternatives. However, the importance of optimizing the cycle is increasingly important when the electricity prices are high. A heat pump might cost less to operate yearly than a natural gas boiler, but if the savings are minimal the additional cost might make it in an unprofitable investment. It is therefore important to do economic evaluations when considering to invest in a heat pump solution. Further work should investigate further improvements to the heat pump cycle. Such as using flooded evaporators, optimizing the suction gas heat exchanger and finding the optimal operating conditions. The required safety measures for the selected refrigerants should also be looked into and how they affect the investment costs...|$|R
