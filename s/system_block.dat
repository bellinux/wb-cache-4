25|$|Patient {{focus in}} the {{curriculum}} begins on day one, {{in the introduction to}} being a physician course. Students interview patients about their experience of illness and experiences with their physicians, and they visit community settings to develop an understanding of their roles as medical professionals. Medical interviewing and physical examination courses follow, along with exercises examining the many facets of physician life—in society, ethical settings, and at the patient bedside. Throughout the first two years, students apply their new skills in local practices and hospitals one afternoon per week. The basic science block runs through three-fourths of the first year and provides language and concepts that underlie the scientific basis of medical practice. Organ <b>system</b> <b>block</b> courses integrate physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and patient with concurrent courses in the patient care and patient, physician and society blocks. Weekly discussions, patient interviews, and examination of hospitalized patients reinforce essential clinical skills.|$|E

We are surrounded by all types of interconnected, dynamic systems: ecosystems, financial markets, business processes, and social systems.

In this thesis I present <b>System</b> <b>Blocks,</b> a new learning technology that facilitates hands-on modeling and simulation of dynamic behavior. <b>System</b> <b>Blocks,</b> by making processes visible and manipulable, can help people learn about the core concepts of <b>systems.</b> <b>System</b> <b>Blocks</b> provide multiple representations of system behavior (using lights, sounds, and graphs), in order to support multiple learning styles and more playful explorations of dynamic processes. I report on an exploratory study I conducted with ten 5 th grade students and five preschool students.

A set of computationally enhanced blocks, made of wood and electronics, <b>System</b> <b>Blocks</b> can assist K- 6 educators to teach the complex concepts of system dynamics and causalities. Learning to understand dynamic systems is an essential step in understanding the world around us. However, learning it at university, high school or even middle school level might be too late. By this age children have already developed their own models of how the world works. In this paper we will show how a set of physical objects {{can be used as a}} modeling and simulation tool, merging hands-on tinkering with computer simulation.
