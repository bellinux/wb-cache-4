The methodology is explained through a case study, the Thumbpod- 2 portable embedded fingerprint authenticator.

This allows <b>shielding</b> <b>off</b> of unwanted sidechannel information leaks at the protocol, software, or hardware level. We discuss how the ThumbPod- 2 design is partitioned into a side-channel-free implementation, and how a codesign environment called GEZEL is used to validate this partitioning process at each abstraction level.

40|$|The {{calculated}} values of Earth's inclinations {{during the cold}} events in the 500 kyr climate record of Devils Hole show a correlation: they cluster in the regions around 1 and 2 degrees. The Devils Hole record has been chosen, since it was dated by absolute methods. Other climate records covering the same period also have a reduced number of cold events between the two regions. The correlation lends support to the proposal of R. A. Muller and G. J.

30|$|Apparently, {{the curing}} {{compound}} will initially inhibit the photocatalytic reaction, most likely {{because it is}} <b>shielding</b> <b>off</b> the active components from the pollutants in the air. Consequently, {{it is probable that}} the curing must disappear from the surface (normally after 1 – 2  months open to traffic and weathering) before the TiO 2 will reach its optimal air purifying performance. In case of a TiO 2 spray, this also means that it is best to apply the photocatalytic dispersion some time after the curing compound to have the best effect. Further measurements “on site” (see below) are planned to reveal the short and long term effect of the curing compound on the photocatalytic performance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Service {{applications}} in mobile environment with large potential users {{become more and}} more popular. However, there are some limitations and obstacles for service delivery in mobile environment because of the particularity of mobile network and limiting ability of mobile terminals. In order to improve the efficiency and performance of service delivery, this paper introduces a middleware-based approach for mobile service delivery. In this way, the workload of mobile terminal devices can be reduced and the heterogeneities of terminal platforms and network communication protocols can be <b>shielded</b> <b>off.</b> Platform-independent, favorable extensibility, strong flexibility and well-behaved security are the typical advantages of the mobile delivery approach. Moreover, it can provide user-centric services through building user profile, without worrying about the mobile network discontinuity and limited processing abilities of mobile terminal devices.
