40|$|A {{realistic}} {{description of}} soil-foundation interaction in offshore wind turbines (OWT) under environmental loading requires deep understanding, and modelling capabilities for, saturated soil behaviour in presence of cyclic loads and pore pressure effects. This research investigates the dynamic energy dissipation {{occurring in the}} soil under a tri-legged jacket-supported structure designed by SPT Offshore, the <b>Self</b> Installing <b>Wind</b> Turbine (SIWT). The foundation system is formed by a tripod of suction caissons, particularly advantageous in terms of installation performance.

A numerical study of the suction caisson response under cyclic vertical loading and moment has been carried out through a number of numerical simulations accounting for simplified, yet relevant, loading scenarios.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of controlling the}} flow actively through {{the walls of a}} transonic, porous wall wind tunnel in order to minimize wall interference effects on a test model is demonstrated. The method is based upon measuring the components of the disturbance velocity at discrete points along an imaginary surface in the flow field within the tunnel. A mathematical formulation of the flow field exterior to the surface including the boundary condition for unconfined flow, i. e., that all disturbance vanish at infinite, is used to determine if these measured velocity components are consistent with that boundary condition. If they are not, the theory provides a better approximation to the velocity component for unconfined flow, and the flow through the tunnel walls is readjusted iteratively until the measured quantities are consistent with unconfined flow. A brief review of theoretical methods is followed by a description of the Calspan <b>self</b> correcting <b>wind</b> tunnel design and operation, calibration with and without active wall control. Typical results obtained by approximating a conventional porous wall wind tunnel for an 0012 airfoil show that active wall control largely reproduces the correct shock wave position, eliminates wall interference of lift and drag, and reduces the interference effects on pitching moment to 10 %...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Self</b> <b>Winding</b> Clock Company (SWCC) {{was a major}} {{manufacturer}} of electromechanical clocks from 1886 until about 1970. The <b>Self</b> <b>Winding</b> Clock Company clock mechanisms were truly revolutionary because the spring that powers the clock was not wound by hand but with an electric motor. The SWCC of New York {{was one of the}} first companies in the United States to successfully employ electric energy to power a clock. The winding motor is attached to, and mounted below, the conventional clock works. The unique feature of their patented clock mechanism is the automatic rewinding of the main spring each hour by the small electric motor. A contact switch mounted on the clock's center shaft is activated after the clock has run for one hour and the main spring is rewound one revolution. This rewinding occurs each hour. The power for the motor is supplied by batteries and the batteries last about one year before needing to be replaced. This clock mechanism never needed to be wound by hand and this eliminated the concern that someone may forget to wind the clock. Hence the company name, The <b>Self</b> <b>Winding</b> Clock Company.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a resolution to}} the contradictory accounts {{of whether or not}} the Darrieus turbine can self-start. The paper builds on previous work proposing an analogy between the aerofoil in Darrieus motion and flapping-wing flow mechanisms. This analogy suggests that unsteadiness could be exploited to generate additional thrust and that this unsteady thrust generation is governed by rotor geometry. Rotors which do not exploit this unsteadiness will not self-start. To confirm the hypothesis, unsteady effects were measured and then incorporated into a time-stepping rotor analysis and compared to experimental data for <b>self</b> starting <b>wind</b> turbines. When unsteady effects were included the model was able to predict the correct starting behaviour. The fundamental physics of starting were also studied and parameters that govern the generation of unsteady thrust were explored: namely chord-to-diameter and blade aspect ratios. Further simulation showed that the Darrieus rotor is prone to be locked in a deadband where the thrust is not continuous around a blade rotation. This discrete thrust is caused by the large variation of incidence angle during start-up making the Darrieus blade ineffective during part of the rotation. The results show that unsteady thrust can be promoted through an appropriate selection of blade aspect and chord-to-diameter ratios, therefore self-starting rotors may be designed. A new definition of self-starting is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} systematic matrices operation derived from Kirchhoff s Node Law with {{the base of a}} simple two-coil inductor model to deduce leakage inductances of windings seen from the schematic point of view. This method provides a platform in calculating leakage inductances of complex transformer structures. Its robustness covers different kinds of concentric winding structures where by getting accurate values of mutual inductances between all combinations of winding elements in a pair-wise sense, accurate leakage inductances can be deduced through the matrices operation without any computational simulations. In essence, such operation reduces lots of difficult magnetic problems within a transformer into determination of mutual and <b>self</b> inductances of <b>winding</b> elements through a simple two-coil inductor model.

5000|$|The {{relationship}} between the two separate companies began with an agreement between <b>Self</b> <b>Winding</b> Clock Company and Western Union (WU) being entered into in June 1889. This agreement was for the transmission of time signals over Western Union telegraph lines to synchronize clocks made by <b>Self</b> <b>Winding</b> Clock Company. SWCC owned the clocks and WU installed and maintained them for a monthly fee, ranging from $1.25 to $2.00 per clock per month. SWCC was paid a percentage of the rental fee for providing clocks for the WU customers. [...] If the clock movements required major repairs, they were sent to a SWCC repair facility and a replacement movement was installed by WU at the customer location. The partnership between SWCC and WU ended in 1963 when, as part of a lawsuit settlement, WU purchased all the rental clocks from SWCC. By the late 1960s, the time-service business had run its course and ceased to be profitable. Most of the clocks were simply abandoned. These clocks are sought after by many clock collectors.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between landscape intensification, the abundance {{and diversity of}} pollinating insects, and their contributions to crop yield, quality, and market value are poorly studied, despite observed declines in wild and domesticated pollinators. Abundance and species richness of pollinating insects were estimated in ten fields of spring oilseed rape, Brassica napus var. SW Stratos (TM), located along a gradient of landscape compositions ranging from simple landscapes dominated by arable land to heterogeneous landscapes with extensive cover of semi-natural habitats. In each field, we assessed the contribution of wind and insect pollination to seed yield, seed quality (individual seed weight and oil and chlorophyll contents), and market value in a block experiment with four replicates and two treatments: (1) all flowers were accessible to insects, <b>self</b> and <b>wind</b> pollination, and (2) flowers enclosed in tulle net bags (mesh: 1 x 1 mm) were accessible only to <b>wind</b> and <b>self</b> pollination. Complex landscapes enhanced the overall abundance of wild insects {{as well as the}} abundance and species richness of hoverflies. This did not translate to a higher yield, probably due to consistent pollination by honey bees across all fields. However, the pollination experiment showed that insects increased seed weight per plant by 18 % and market value by 20 %. Seed quality was enhanced by insect pollination, rendering heavier seeds as well as higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents, clearly showing that insect pollination is required to reach high seed yield and quality in oilseed rape. Our study demonstrates considerable and previously underestimated contributions from pollinating insects to both the yield and the market value of oilseed rape...|$|R
40|$|Mixed-pollination {{systems may}} allow plants to achieve stable seed {{production}} when unpredictable conditions cause {{variation in the}} relative success of different pollination modes. We studied variation in time (two years) and space (in five populations, three from an island and two from mainland) in the pollination mode of Buxus balearica, an ambophilous (i. e. pollinated by wind and insects) and selfing species distributed in the Mediterranean Basin, by means of direct observations and experimental manipulations (bagging with different material). The relative importance of each pollination mode differed among populations; however, levels of <b>selfing</b> and <b>wind</b> pollination were similar between island and mainland. Flowers of B. balearica were visited only by generalist insects, and species composition and abundance of flower visitors varied both in space and time. Frequency of insect visits to plants were not higher in mainland than island populations, although insects on the mainland were more diverse, visited a proportionally greater number of flowers, and remained longer on the plants than insects on the island. Frequency of insect visits was negatively correlated with flowering synchrony (all populations pooled) and was found to increase seed set {{in one of the}} mainland populations (that with highest frequency of insect visits and highest flower visitation rate). Fruit and seed mass were found to be not affected by pollination mode.

500|$|The {{sport of}} target rifle {{shooting}} {{is an option}} among those in the 3rd year and above, but only available {{to members of the}} CCF from 4th form. In the first and second years, there is an air rifle club, which teaches basics before moving onto [...] "rifles". From 3rd form students can join an afternoon shooting club in which they can practice smallbore. At this point being a member of CCF is not needed because CCF starts from 3rd form since the introduction of the EXAD program to 3rd formers. 3rd form students start of with grouping targets using sandbags then progress onto 5 bull and eventually 5 bull and country life style shooting using slings and jackets. However as of 2016/17 the number 8 cadet rifles are being brought out of service so 3rd form shooting has mostly been done using [...] "private" [...] Anschutz rifles. Normally students wouldn't start shooting these rifles until 4th form but due to the situation they have to use these rifles.Those individuals who have talent in smallbore then have the opportunity to shoot fullbore in the summer term during some weekends and even have the chance to take part in competitions such as schools meet or the L In 4th form During the first two terms they do smallbore shooting with 10 bull being the main focus. 10 Bull is done using the private rifles that are more expensive and more accurate than the number 8s. In the trinity term they do fullbore using the L81a2 cadet target rifle.Though they usually have smaller numbers during the summer due to logistical issues and the fact that other [...] "fun"games options are also available such as tennis and sailing. All fullbore shooting is done at Bisley either at Century where they shoot at 300, 500 and 600 yards, or Stickledown range where they can shoot up to 1200 yards though this rarely happens during practice and is instead reserved for the Imperial meeting. In 2017 the RGS entered a main VIII and two cadet pairs into the Schools Meet as well as 4 boys into the NRA Imperial and 2 boys into the Cadets Imperial a newer competition that started in 2016. The RGS also took part in many postal competitions such as the Country life and the Surrey 10 bull league competitions. Over the years the shooting team {{have had a lot of}} success, not only winning many smallbore competitions such as the Staniforth and the Country Life, but also winning the Ashburton at the Annual Schools Meeting held at Bisley, though this hasn't been done by the school for many years. Part of this success is down to the help of many Old Guildfordians and current teachers coaching and helping out those doing shooting at the RGS. Many senior boys also coach the younger students and encourage them to keep shooting as they progress through the school. Those in the team are taught by the Old Guildfordians and shooting masters how to self sight and even <b>self</b> <b>wind</b> coach so that they can take part in more individual competitions such as the Imperial.

40|$|In {{ecological}} communities, {{the proportion}} of plant species with different dispersal syndromes {{is known as the}} dispersal spectrum, which can result from different selective pressures such as climate. This is because variations in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and precipitation result in distinct flora and fauna among different sites. If climate conditions along an altitudinal range act as a strong direct or indirect selective pressure on dispersal syndromes, the dispersal spectrum among plant communities in different altitudes should be distinct. We organized the dispersal syndromes in five hierarchical levels according to the levels of detail in diaspore morphology and, consequently, different degrees of specificity to the dispersers. Then we identified, within each hierarchical level, the syndromes of tree species of four forest types of the Atlantic Rainforest along a 1200 m altitudinal range in Southeast Brazil. Among 327 species, we found two syndromes in the most general hierarchical level (abiotic and biotic dispersal), three in the following level (<b>wind,</b> <b>self</b> and animal), three in the intermediate level (barochory, autochory and endozoochory), two in the forth level (mammal and bird), and 12 syndromes in the most specific level, all of which were related to the morphology of diaspores dispersed by wind, autochory, mammals and birds. The dispersal spectrum in the five hierarchical levels was similar among the four forest types. Overall, the majority of species is dispersed by biotic agents, considered here as animals and the parent plant itself. Within biotic agents, the most important are animals, specifically birds. Most bird-dispersed species present drupoid diaspores. Our results indicate that the selective pressures on dispersal syndromes originated from climate conditions that vary with altitude are not strong, hence resulting in the same dispersal spectrum among the forest types...|$|R
40|$|Wind excited {{vibrations}} {{generated by}} the vortex shedding are very common in high-voltage overhead transmission lines. Although such vibrations are barely perceptible due to their low amplitudes (less than a conductor diameter), controlling them, however, is extremely important since they may lead to conductor fatigue. Mathematical models are therefore necessary for the computation of these vibrations, not only to evaluate the risk of potential damage to the transmission line but also for studying {{the efficiency of the}} damping measures. For single conductor transmission lines, the so-called energy-balance method gives fairly good results for the estimation of vibration amplitudes. However, the problem becomes more involved for the conductor bundles attached with different damping devices. A modified form of the energy-balance method is thus needed. This thesis presents a mathematical-mechanical model for modeling the vibrations of the conductor bundles with many spacer dampers and Stockbridge dampers, by considering subconductors as continuous systems. External damping devices are incorporated into the model by means of their complex impedance matrices. The presented model results in a smaller system matrix in comparison to what is obtained while modeling the conductor as a discrete system. This modeling procedure yields a complex non-polynomial transcendental eigen- value problem (TEVP). Solving such a TEVP is simple for smaller systems, e. g., for single conductor transmission lines. However, for a comparatively bigger system like the one in case of conductor bundles, it is a formidable task to obtain all the system eigenvalues in a certain frequency domain. The first goal of the presented thesis is to find eÂ±cient numerical methods for obtaining the solutions of TEVPs. Different numerical techniques are discussed and their results are compared. Newton's approach for the solution of the eigenvalue problem is found to be an eÂ±cient solution technique for obtaining the complex eigenvalues of a TEVP of the current type. After obtaining the complex eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the system, an energy balance principle is presented in order to obtain the actual vibration amplitudes in the subconductors. In energy balance the energy input from the wind is equated with the energy loss due to external damping and the conductor's <b>self</b> damping. <b>Wind</b> power input is normally obtained using data from the wind tunnel experiments or from the experiments carried out with transmission lines in the field, for laminar and turbulent wind speeds. Wind power input data is only available for single oscillating rods/cylinders, as obtaining such data via experiments for different configurations of multi-cylinders, is a difficult task. The second goal of the presented work is to numerically obtain the wind power input for the oscillating cylinders in a tandem arrangement. A finite-volume approach is used for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moving grids are used to incorporate the movements of the cylinders. Firstly, accuracy and feasibility of the numerical results are verified by solving the flow around a single cylinder, and comparing the obtained results with the available experimental data. For similar setups as used in the experiments from different researchers, numerical wind power input for a single oscillating cylinder is obtained. Good agreement with the experimental results is found. The numerical approach is subsequently further extended to obtain the wind power input for two oscillating cylinders in a tandem arrangement. A considerable difference between the wind power inputs for the downstream cylinder in a cylinder-tandem and for a single oscillating cylinder is observed. The newly obtained wind power input is utilized for the energy balancing in a bundled conductor benchmark problem, and results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{presented}} a study {{into the new}} construction method to build ice shells with pneumatic formwork, developed at the Institute for Structural Engineering of the Vienna University of Technology. Shells are natural, logical and functional load carrying systems. Additionally, for the load transfer of a uniformly distributed load, the shell structure is the perfect choice because mainly normal forces appear in the cross section. Although shell structures possess excellent load carrying system and make a great visual impact, only few shells have {{been built in the}} last decades. The main problem is the difficult, time-consuming and expensive production. Traditionally, shells are produced by means of complex formwork. Creating such formwork increases the construction time and affords additional material which cannot be reused after the shell has been completed. Ice as a construction material is either used as a decorative material on a supporting structure or it is applied in structures with very low stress states due to <b>self</b> weight and <b>wind</b> forces. Ice shells can be used in temporary architecture, as roof structures for sport and music events, or presentations and promotions of sale products. Moreover the translucent nature of ice, allows several possibilities to make attractive this structure. For instance the internal illumination of the ice shell during the night creates a luminous atmosphere in the surroundings. The new construction method consists of transforming an ice plate into an ice shell by means of a pneumatic formwork. The ice elements, with steel tendons inside, are cut form an initial ice plate. While air is inflating the pneumatic formwork the elements creep. When the pneumatic formwork is removed chains support the stress of each element. Afterwards a pull-chain system is used to lift the elements from the top of a wooden tower built at the centre. The elements are linked and we retire the tower and the chains, the ice shell is finished. Before building the ice shell in Obergurgl, Tyrol (Austria) we tested different experiments making ice beams in a temperature-controlled container in Vienna. Moreover we used finite element software, RFEM 4, to study and to compare the load configuration with the analytical solution. In Obergurgl the ice elements were creeping but we could not lift the elements into an ice shell. The night before lifting the pneumatic formwork had an air leak and the most of the elements were broken. But the problem was that the chains under the pneumatic formwork did not work rightly so the chains did not support the stress of the ice elements. Therefore the problem was the design. For further experiments we would change the design with the pneumatic formwork and the chains due to it is not a good solution. As many engineering experiments at this time did not end well but these construction method is in development and it has real possibilities nowadays in the market. Moreover with the work team at the Institute for Structural Engineering of the Vienna University of Technology they can get substantial progress in the construction field.
