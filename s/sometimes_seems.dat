25|$|A {{central theme}} {{in most of}} these tales is the {{difficulties}} of handling the new tolerance, open-mindedness and democratisation which are introduced by both the transition of society and by literature. Another theme is the conflict between the introverted and closed male nature and the vitality of the woman. Behind all this lies the classic naturalist theme of heritage and milieu against which man has to rebel without quite denying their existence. In his later works he <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to become a mixture of a castigator of society and a prophet of doom.|$|E
25|$|Bede's {{treatment}} of Chad is particularly problematic {{because he could}} not conceal that Chad departed from Roman practices in vital ways– not only before the Synod of Whitby, which Bede presents as a total victory for the Roman party and its norms, but even after it. However, Chad was the teacher of Bede's own teacher, Trumbert, so Bede has an obvious personal interest in rehabilitating him, to say nothing of his loyalty to the Northumbrian establishment, which not only supported him but had played a notable part in Christianising England. This may explain a number of gaps in Bede's account of Chad, and why Bede <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to attribute to Chad implausible motives. Chad lived at and through a watershed in relations between the Anglo-Saxons and the wider Europe. Bede constantly tries to elide the ambiguities of Chad's career, not always successfully.|$|E

[...] "Genetically identical" [...] does not mean altogether identical; this kind of cloning does not reproduce a living thing's memories or experiences, for example. [...] However, in discussions of Raëlianism, cloning <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to refer not only to reproductive cloning, but also reproductive human cloning plus mind and/or brain transfer, or to a process of making adult clones. [...] Raëlians take this even further and say that humanity can attain eternal life through the science of cloning.|$|E

[...] He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it [...] "gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a rough-hewn style that <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> more accidental than intentional" [...] but that it [...] "succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure because of them. Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{thematic}} {{content of}} heavy metal {{has long been}} a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, [...] "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates... a party without limits... he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic." [...] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are [...] "clearly misguided" [...] as these critics have [...] "overlook the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal [...] "an expressive mode [...] it <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat".|$|E
500|$|Juster {{says the}} book was rescued from the {{remainders}} table when Emily Maxwell wrote a strong review of it in The New Yorker. Maxwell wrote, [...] "As Pilgrim's Progress {{is concerned with the}} awakening of the sluggardly spirit, The Phantom Tollbooth is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind." [...] Hers was far from the only positive piece; children's author Ann McGovern reviewed it for The New York Times, writing [...] "Norton Juster's amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anyone old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of Alice in Wonderland and the pointed whimsy of The Wizard of Oz". John Crosby wrote for the New York Herald Tribune, [...] "In a world which <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to have gone mad, it is refreshing to pause and consider for a moment a book for children which contains a character called 'Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.' The name of the book is The Phantom Tollbooth and it was written by a bearded elf named Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, who is the cleverest of the young neurotics". Dissenting was the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, which in March 1962 deemed the book an [...] "intensive and extensive fantasy, heavily burdened with contrivance and whimsy".|$|E

500|$|The clean {{version of}} [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from music critics who noted the effective melding {{of the intense}} vocal delivery of Hilson with the rapid pace and banging beat of the song. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that all the five songs Hilson penned for No Boys Allowed, {{with the exception of}} the [...] "frantic electronic firework 'The Way You Love Me', are too featureless to make an impression." [...] Ben Hatliff of The New York Times commented that Hilson [...] "gets a certain energy out of bossiness" [...] on [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] which according to him, goes far for a mainstream female singer in its boasting and sexual hunger. He also added that [...] "it <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> as if it were not a man at all she wants to boss around but Rihanna." [...] Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Hilson moves [...] "to a gritted-teeth half-rapped, half-sung approach" [...] for [...] "The Way You Love Me". He went on complimenting the heavy beat of the song which according to him, matches the [...] "shouted vocals" [...] of the singer on the song. Andy Kellman of Allmusic called [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] the most emblematic track on No Boys Allowed. He praised the line [...] "I got the kinda lovin' that'll keep you off the streets" [...] and describing the song as rowdy and sexually direct, he concluded that it could be ideal for [...] "the soundtrack to a straight-to-DVD Showgirls sequel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another future tense {{is formed}} with -ka-, {{with the same}} tones as -dza-. It usually refers to events in the near future.

2500|$|Firstly, {{particularly}} in the Discourses on Livy, Machiavelli is unusual in the positive side he <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to describe in factionalism in republics. For example, quite early in the Discourses, (in Book I, chapter 4), a chapter title announces that the disunion of the plebs and senate in Rome [...] "kept Rome free." [...] That a community has different components whose interests must be balanced in any good regime is an idea with classical precedents, but Machiavelli's particularly extreme presentation {{is seen as a}} critical step towards the later political ideas of both a division of powers or checks and balances, ideas which lay behind the US constitution, as well as many other modern state constitutions.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{next film}} role was supervillain Poison Ivy in Batman & Robin (1997). Budgeted at over US$125 million, the film grossed a modest US$238 million internationally and was {{unanimously}} panned, with critics considering {{it one of}} the worst films of all time. However, Thurman's performance was largely highlighted; Houston Chronicle remarked that [...] "Thurman [...] <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to be doing Mae West by way of Jessica Rabbit", and a similar positive comparison was made by The New York Times: [...] "ike Mae West, she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen". She obtained a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Sci-fi Actress and was also nominated for Favourite Movie Actress at the Kids' Choice Awards.

2500|$|The poet Gunnar Ekelöf {{wrote about}} Torsten Billman: [...] "To those, who {{with the word}} art visualise large, magnificent, 'striking' canvases Torsten Billman doesn't have not much to offer. His art serves the simple, neglected, {{homeless}} of existence. It features the fellows from the Nippon and other ships, marked by the hard life in ports {{as well as on}} board. His art shows the interiors of East End bars, where you get acquainted with the dark side of life. His art however isn't any 'social' [...] art of the arrogant, placarding character there was so much of especially during the 1920's and 30's. It's social, not in attitude or trend, but with objectivity and revealing sharpness in the human portrayal that <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> almost brutal - repulsive, but sadly true. Yet it's, however always carried by compassion. Never by sentimentality. This involves a simple statement of: 'Such is man'. But from the ravaged features, and the gout-ridden limbs stiff from work there's still a notion emanating of how man should look like and could look like." ...|$|E

2500|$|Metaphorically {{centered}} around the title1, Orrery is a single story told from the inclusion of well over 70 poems written in different styles and divided into three main sections: 'Hours' (time), 'Apples' (memory), and 'Physics.' A prelude of sorts to The Invention of the Zero, Orrery poses {{the belief that the}} world is now being mechanically driven, but it presents the view in a different fashion. The book centers around a long poem based on his experience at an apple cider farm in Vermont; 'Apples.' To Kenney, the cider mill represents [...] "a relic of that pre-electrical world...A comprehensible world, in many ways...None of it seems to have left this farm, at any rate--...crippled dance steps, disassembled stories, half-hummed tunes, all common property--disintegration projects...with the confusion of common sense, as it <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems,</b> from the decay of the clockwork universe" [...] (Orrery ix, Kenney). It is that [...] "pre-electrical world" [...] that Kenney is seeking. Somewhere along the way, {{in the midst of a}} technologically advancing contemporary life, the unification of nature and time disintegrated to bits and pieces, remnants of a former mosaic, of a former sensibility.|$|E
2500|$|Though his {{theology}} was {{at first}} somewhat indefinite in phraseology, he undoubtedly gave a thorough adhesion to the Nicene Orthodoxy. Even if he did avoid the debatable term homoousios, he expressed its sense in many passages, which exclude equally Patripassianism, Sabellianism, and the formula [...] "there {{was a time when}} the Son was not" [...] attributed to Arius. In other points he takes the ordinary ground of the Eastern Fathers, as in the emphasis he lays on the freedom of the will, the autexousion (αὐτεξούσιον), and in his view of the nature of sin. To him sin is the consequence of freedom, not a natural condition. The body is not the cause, but the instrument of sin. The remedy for it is repentance, on which he insists. Like many of the Eastern Fathers, he focuses on high moral living as essential to true Christianity. His doctrine of the Resurrection is not quite so realistic as that of other Fathers; but his conception of the Church is decidedly empirical: the existing Church form is the true one, intended by Christ, the completion of the Church of the Old Testament. His interpretation of the Eucharist is disputed. If he <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to approach the symbolic view, at other times he comes very close to a strong realistic doctrine. The bread and wine are not mere elements, but the body and blood of Christ.|$|E
2500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} record a B+ and judged {{it to be}} more {{psychedelic}} than previous records by the group due {{to the influence of}} Danger Mouse; Anderson said the album [...] "sounds more like an extension of Burton's Broken Bells side project... than the follow-up to the Keys' muscular, arena-ready 2011 best-seller, El Camino." [...] Summarizing the album, he said, [...] "it's meticulously executed but slightly (and sleepily) monochromatic". Keith Cameron of Mojo rated the album three stars, criticizing the release for its [...] "diminishing returns" [...] and believing the duo [...] "eschewed a blank reiteration... with mixed results", but he still believed they [...] "know which notes to hit". Barry Nicolson of NME, scoring the album a six-out-of-ten, was critical of Danger Mouse's growing influence on the band, writing [...] "there's a nagging sense that their collaboration – beneficial though it's been for all involved – has run its course". Nicolson said that although he enjoyed parts of the album, [...] "it's a cruel irony that the heaviest hand in Dan Auerbach's warts-and-all confessional <b>sometimes</b> <b>seems</b> to belong to his producer". Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork echoed these sentiments, saying that Burton's [...] "reign of boredom continues here in typical fashion." [...] Fitzmaurice said the music [...] "sounds distant and subdued, a murky-sounding collection of '70s stoner-rock facsimiles and swirling gray tones that, for the most part, are indistinguishable". The review questioned [...] "how invested these guys actually are in the music they're making." ...|$|E
