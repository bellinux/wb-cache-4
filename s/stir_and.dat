25|$|The {{feeding method}} of tadpole shrimps {{is similar to}} that {{proposed}} for the ancestral crustacean. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The gnathobases (inward-facing lobes {{at the base of the}} leg) guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end of the leg) <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> lift the sediments. Fine silt particles and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called endopods at the end of the leg.|$|E

25|$|A body of {{research}} that caught the public interest to a great extent, was Coren's work on left-handedness. With his co-researchers, Diane F. Halpern, Clare Porac, and Alan Searleman he studied the causes and consequences of left-handedness. Specifically his research led him to believe that left-handedness could be a marker for various psychological and physical problems. The media became interested in this work when findings began to emerge indicating that left-handedness was often associated with difficult or stressful births. Research showing that left-handers were much more susceptible to accident-related injuries because the constructed world and most machinery and tools are designed for the safety and convenience of right-handers evoked {{a great deal of}} interest and press coverage. However the work that caused the largest <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> the most controversy was a series of studies in collaboration with Diane F. Halpern which showed that left-handers have shorter life spans, often dying younger because of accidents or problems associated with a compromised immune system (possibly a long-term consequence of birth stress related trauma). Although originally the source of much controversy, with confirming data coming from a number of other laboratories, these conclusions have become well enough accepted to appear in basic psychological textbooks. The discovery of a possible genetic basis of left-handedness suggests that there may be two types of left-handers, natural left-handers and a separate group who arrive at their left-handedness because of birth stress and are more susceptible to immune system related problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} {{dealt with the}} practice's {{financial}} troubles. Naomi reveals to Addison {{that they are in}} danger of losing the practice due to unpaid debt causing Addison to tell Sam. This in turn causes a shift within the practice making Addison the new boss. Adding to the drama was the competition of a new practice, Pacific Wellcare. This new practice, located within the same building as Oceanside Wellness, was run by Charlotte causing turmoil for her and Cooper. Another happening within this season is the dynamic between Sam and Naomi who by the finale realize they can no longer be friends as well as the deepening romantic relationship of Cooper and Charlotte. Addison was romantically linked with Kevin Nelson (played by David Sutcliffe), a police officer, but later realized their relationship was going nowhere. Towards the end of the season, Addison falls in love with cardiovascular surgeon Noah Barnes, who as it turns out, is married and is expecting his first child. Matters become more complicated when Addison realizes that Noah's wife is one of her patients. Archer Montgomery (Grant Show), Addison's playboy brother, also made sporadic appearances causing trouble for her and Naomi. Archer was found to be with an aggressive brain tumor which was later diagnosed as parasites. Addison sought the professional help of her ex-husband, neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). After Derek successfully saved Archer, Addison discovered Archer was back to his old tricks cheating on Naomi. Violet stirred some of her own drama when she began dating Sheldon (Brian Benben), who works for Pacific Wellcare, and Pete. During {{the latter half of the}} season, Violet was found to be pregnant although she did not know who the father of her baby was. Furthermore, Violet found herself and her unborn baby at the mercy of a psychotic patient bent on taking Violet's baby by any means necessary in the closing moments of the season finale. Meanwhile, Dell struggled with his own issues caused by his former girlfriend's drug habits and the fight for custody of his daughter Betsey. Some of the medical cases that caused a <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> tension among the doctors at Private Practice was the issue of abortion (a first for the practice), the sex reassignment of a newborn, the sexual activity of a 12-year-old, the switching of embryos for two mothers-to-be and a young couple who later discovered they were siblings.|$|E

It was doing Trescothick and his family no good at all. Representing your country is a source of huge pride, but there are far more important things in life". Fraser also wrote: [...] "It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick's mental illness began to <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> the opener has not played an overseas test since".|$|E

500|$|The {{disclosure}} of the deception in 1995, following investigations into the Ames case, led to a media <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> heavy congressional criticism. The Agency's Inspector General, Frederick Hitz, identified 12 CIA personnel he deemed responsible for the lapse, including three former directors; CIA Director John M. Deutch criticized seven of these employees, calling the affair [...] "a major intelligence failure". A damage assessment determined that the disinformation altered intelligence analyses of the Soviet (and later Russian) military {{towards the end of}} the Cold War, creating a false impression of Soviet strength; however, initial charges that the faulty reports led to billions of dollars' worth of Pentagon spending proved to be exaggerated. Regardless, the revelation further undermined the CIA's credibility in the wake of the Ames case.|$|E
500|$|DeBeck kept readers on {{the edges}} of their seats with {{uncertain}} suspense: sometimes Spark Plug actually won a race. [...] While DeBeck resisted at first, Hearst demanded a pretty girl be introduced into the strip. [...] DeBeck brought in Sweet Mama, which initially created a <b>stir,</b> <b>and</b> certain papers dropped the strip, but after the phrase swept the nation, the strip's popularity only increased. [...] Over the years, DeBeck was credited with introducing more neologisms and catchphrases, such as [...] "heebie-jeebies", [...] "", [...] "balls of fire" [...] and [...] "time's a-wastin'". [...] In 1923, Billy Rose penned a Tin Pan Alley pop hit called [...] "Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)". [...] A series of Barney Google live-action films starring Barney Hellum appeared in 1928 and 1929.|$|E
500|$|Ferdinand Lundberg was an iconoclastic {{journalist}} and writer {{who spent his}} career pillorying the American upper class over what he charged was its grip on the United States' economy. According to Lundberg, he quit {{his job as a}} reporter at the New York Herald Tribune to pen his first book, Imperial Hearst: A Social Biography, which was published in 1936. An unflattering look at the life and business of the publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, it ascribed to Hearst what the New York Times would later describe as [...] "fascist political ambitions ... abetted by an unholy alliance of big bankers". The book, whose foreword by Charles A. Beard said that Hearst would face [...] "oblivion in death", caused an immediate <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> was described by Foreign Affairs as [...] "an annihilating study of the newspaper magnate" [...] worthy of [...] "wide attention".|$|E

500|$|Wider artistic sentiments varied. Many, like, Alfred Stieglitz harboured mixed {{feelings}} over New York's skyscrapers, {{reflected in his}} famous 1903 portrait of the Gridiron building, and his 1910 work Old and New New York that contrasts the growing steel frame of the emerging Vanderbilt Hotel with the old low-rise blocks of the street below. Poets also wrote about the issues, the early Modernist Sadakichi Hartmann describing how [...] "from the city's <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> madd'ning roar" [...] the Flatiron's [...] "monstrous shape soars in massive flight". Artists such as Alvin Coburn and John Marin experimented with producing portraits of New York's skyscrapers, capturing {{the positive and negative}} aspects of the modern structures. In 1908 artist Harry Pettit produced a romantic interpretation of a future New York, filled with giant skyscrapers supporting aerial bridges and receiving dirigibles from around the globe.|$|E
500|$|Some of MacMillan's most sensational {{allegations}} {{concerned a}} six-week {{period in the}} spring of 1932 when she was filling in at the Brownlee household for an absent maid. [...] She said that she slept in the maid's room, one of three bedrooms {{on the second floor of}} Brownlee's house; a second room was occupied by Brownlee and his son Jack, and the third by Florence Brownlee and her son Alan. [...] During this six-week period, she claimed, she and Brownlee had had sex every night; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom, and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask the sound of her movement. [...] Once in the premier's room, they would have sex next to his sleeping son, taking care to be quiet. [...] She recounted how on one occasion Jack had seemed to <b>stir,</b> <b>and</b> Brownlee had turned on the light in the middle of intercourse to make sure that his son was all right.|$|E
500|$|Post release, Parasakthi was {{marred by}} {{numerous}} controversies, and was defined as [...] "one {{of the most controversial}} films in the history of Tamil cinema" [...] by Theodore Baskaran. It was accused of trying to portray Brahmins in poor light. Abuse of Hindu customs and religious practices evoked strong protests from the Hindu orthodoxy. Scenes like a priest attempting to rape a woman in a temple were found to be very provocative. The social elite and members of the then ruling Congress party demanded the film to be banned. The-then Chief Minister of Madras, C. Rajagopalachari was unhappy with the extremely provocative nature of the film, but allowed it to be screened. One of the reasons stated by them was the dialogue spoken by Ganesan's character, [...] "Just because you came around chanting names and offered flowers to the stone, would it become a god?", which was accused of [...] "mocking the audiences." [...] His reference to Goddess Parasakthi as a stone created a <b>stir,</b> <b>and</b> the word [...] "stone" [...] was eventually censored from the soundtrack. However, the given message was still [...] "clear and the impact viral." [...] The State Government requested the Union Government to reconsider the film certification, but they declined, due to a previous examination by a Madras intelligence officer, who stated: ...|$|E

500|$|What's Cooking? is an {{interactive}} cookbook and food preparation video game with recipes that each list preparation times, ingredients and courses. Recipes can be sorted by criteria such as dishes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, or vegetarian-only meals. After opening a recipe, an ingredient list is presented. Items {{on the list}} can be earmarked and added to a shopping list as a reminder to purchase in the future. A timer option is also available, which counts down from a specified time and makes an audible sound when it is done. Before doing any real cooking, a virtual representation of each step in the recipe is given on the screen that must be performed by the player. The Nintendo DS touchscreen and stylus are used to perform tasks such as whisking eggs, pouring sauces and cutting vegetables. Tutorials are also available to teach the player how to perform simple cooking preparation tasks. While cooking, the Nintendo DS responds to audible commands; saying [...] "next" [...] into the device's microphone will move the recipe {{on to the next}} step. One hundred recipes are included in the game, and players can create their own dishes in the game. Afterward, they can share them with others via Wi-Fi. In addition to the game's cooking aspects, What's Cooking? features challenges in which the player uses the stylus to chop, <b>stir,</b> <b>and</b> serve as quickly as possible.|$|E
500|$|According to critic Martha P. Nochimson, {{the film}} is an {{exploration}} of the place of anonymous breakdowns of social order in personal life. For the most part, questions of justice operate in the background of The Man From London, which foregrounds the perceptions and point of view of an accidental witness to the murder, who, like the viewer, has no connection with anyone involved. The film principally concerns the texture of the world of the protagonist Maloin as he experiences it ﬁrst hand: fog, light, shadow, skin, walls, ﬂoors, windows, sounds. These are much closer to Maloin than any broken laws involving strangers as in the killing at the dock. As distinct from the trope of crime functioning as a break from the boredom of the mundane for the Hitchcockian ordinary man [...] "excitingly" [...] caught up in it, the interjection of crime {{in the lives of the}} characters of The Man from London is a phantom occurrence for those burrowed into the center of the mundane details of their lives. In other words, Tarr's ﬁlm suggests the possibility that it is only on an abstract plane that murder committed by and on strangers causes a <b>stir</b> <b>and</b> demands an investigation. In this context, it is fitting that the investigation must be undertaken by a stranger, the man from London, since abstraction entails distancing from an enveloping context. Only the appearance of the man from London, Brown, impels Maloin to struggle with his de facto alienation, as an ordinary man, from moral principle, an alienation linked, counterintuitively, to the absence of desire in his daily grind.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Fahrenheit 451 {{was given}} [...] "third tier" [...] status by the Bay County School Board in Panama City, Florida, under then-superintendent Leonard Hall's new three-tier {{classification}} system.
