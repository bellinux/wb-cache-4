5|$|Several {{systems have}} been {{developed}} that map the IPA symbols to ASCII characters. Notable systems include Kirshenbaum, ARPABET, SAMPA, and X-SAMPA. The usage of mapping systems in on-line text has to some extent been adopted in the context input methods, allowing convenient keying of IPA characters that would be otherwise unavailable on <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> layouts.|$|E
5|$|Win32 console windows {{can now be}} resized {{without any}} restrictions, {{can be made to}} cover the full screen by {{pressing}} , and can use <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> shortcuts, such as those for cut, copy, and paste. Other features such as word wrap and transparency were also added. These functions can be disabled to revert to the legacy console, if needed.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, {{the newly}} {{established}} Central Language Board in Pakistan standardardised the typewriter keyboard. The new <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> also incorporated special characters of other provincial languages, such as Sindhi and Pushto. Languages spoken in Punjab and Balochistan could be easily accommodated within the Urdu characters.|$|E
5000|$|In the ASCII and Unicode {{character}} sets, {{this character}} is encoded {{by the number}} 26 (1A hex). <b>Standard</b> <b>keyboards</b> transmit this code when the [...] and [...] keys are pressed simultaneously (Ctrl+Z, by convention often described as ^Z).|$|R
5000|$|Phonetic names {{can often}} be used for Japanese typographic symbols not found on <b>standard</b> <b>keyboards.</b> For example, in some IMEs ～ can be entered as nami (wave) or kara (from) and an {{ellipsis}} (…) can be entered as tenten (point point).|$|R
40|$|Data-entry device held in {{one hand}} and {{operated}} with five fingers. Contains seven keys. Letters, numbers, punctuation, and cursor commands keyed into computer by pressing keys in various combinations. Device called "data egg" used where <b>standard</b> typewriter <b>keyboard</b> unusable or unavailable. Contains micro-processor and 32 -Kbyte memory. Captures text and transmits it to computer. Concept extended to computer mouse. Especially useful to handicapped or bedridden people who find it difficult or impossible to operate <b>standard</b> <b>keyboards...</b>|$|R
25|$|Handheld {{ergonomic}} keyboards {{are designed}} to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.|$|E
25|$|Several {{transliteration}} schemes/tools {{are used}} to type Kannada characters using a <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard.</b> These include Baraha (based on ITRANS), Pada Software and several internet tools like Google transliteration, Quillpad (predictive transliterator). Nudi, the Government of Karnataka's standard for Kannada Input, is a phonetic layout loosely based on transliteration.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Unicode-compliant Burmese fonts exist. The {{national}} <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> layout {{is known as}} the Myanmar3 layout, and it was published along with the Myanmar3 Unicode font. The layout, developed by the Myanmar Unicode and NLP Research Center, has a smart input system to cover the complex structures of Burmese and related scripts.|$|E
5000|$|In music theory, an enharmonic {{scale is}} [...] "an {{imaginary}} gradual progression by quarter tones" [...] or any [...] "musical scale proceeding by quarter tones". The enharmonic scale uses dieses (divisions) nonexistent on most <b>keyboards,</b> since modern <b>standard</b> <b>keyboards</b> have only half-tone dieses.|$|R

5000|$|Owing to the {{difficulty}} of entering diacritics like macrons or circumflexes with <b>standard</b> <b>keyboards</b> (as well as the ambiguity of ō, etc., which in Hepburn can represent either おう or おお) long vowels are almost universally entered following kana spelling rules; thus, kou for こう and koo for こお.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the development of}} computer fonts and <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> layout, there is still a lot of scope of research for the Burmese language, specifically for Natural Language Processing (NLP) areas like WordNet, Search Engine, development of parallel corpus for Burmese language as well as development of a formally standardized and dense domain-specific corpus of Burmese language.|$|E
25|$|Carillon {{music is}} {{typically}} written on two staves. Notes {{written in the}} bass clef are generally played by the feet. Notes written in the treble clef are played with the hands. Pedals range from the lowest note (the bourdon) and may continue up to two and half octaves. In the North American <b>Standard</b> <b>keyboard,</b> all notes can be played on the manual.|$|E
25|$|Although {{ubiquitous}} in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (’) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since {{it does not}} have its own key on a <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, many people {{do not know how to}} enter this character and instead use the typewriter apostrophe ('). The typewriter apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of Web publishing, the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the unusual}} {{character}} set, many programmers use special keyboards with APL keytops to write APL code. Although {{there are various}} ways to write APL code using only ASCII characters, in practice it is almost never done. (This may be thought to support Iverson's thesis about notation {{as a tool of}} thought.) Most if not all modern implementations use <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> layouts, with special mappings or input method editors to access non-ASCII characters. Historically, the APL font has been distinctive, with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols. Most vendors continue to display the APL character set in a custom font.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. IBM PC {{keyboard}} has 104 keys, {{while the}} PC keyboards for most {{other countries have}} 105 keys. In an operating system configured for a non-English language, the keys are placed differently. For example, keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release space for Ñ/ñ; similarly those for French or Portuguese may have a special key for the character Ç/ç. Keyboards designed for Japanese may have special keys to switch between Japanese and Latin scripts, and the character ¥ (Japanese yen or Chinese yuan currency symbol) instead of \ (backslash, which may {{be replaced by the}} former in some typefaces and codepages). Using a keyboard for alternative languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the key, because the <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> layouts do not even share similar characters of different languages.|$|E
25|$|Bösendorfer {{pioneered the}} {{extension}} of the typical 88-key keyboard, creating the Imperial Grand (Model 290), which has 97 keys (eight octaves). Ferruccio Busoni initially ordered this innovation in 1909 as part of a custom piano as he wanted to transcribe an organ piece that extended to the C below the <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard.</b> This innovation worked so well that this piano was added to regular product offerings and quickly became one of the world's most sought-after concert grands. Because of the 290's success, the extra strings were added to Bösendorfer's other line of instruments such as the 225 model, which has 92 keys. The extra keys, at the bass end of the keyboard, were originally hidden beneath a hinged panel mounted between the piano's conventional low A and the left-hand end-cheek to prevent their being struck accidentally during normal play; more recent models have omitted this device and simply have the upper surface of the extra natural keys finished in matte black instead of white to differentiate them from the standard 88.|$|E
30|$|In Experiment 1, {{we found}} that typing with 3 -D keys is {{accurate}} when typing in a regular order. However, this is very simple and differs from actual keyboard use. In Experiment 2, our objective was to compare typing accuracy between the 3 -D and <b>standard</b> <b>keyboards</b> when typing a series of characters.|$|R

25|$|Part of {{what makes}} the flapamba’s {{characteristic}} sound is the tuning; for instance, the resonators are not tuned to the bars as in other <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> percussion instruments. Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were {{getting out of the}} percussion rental business since Emil was dominating much of the work in town. Emil couldn't find any info on the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the softest mallets possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than twenty}} {{different}} keyboards {{have been laid}} out, to suit local needs to match the <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> for {{the country in which}} a laptop is intended. Around half of these have been manufactured for prototype machines. There are parts of the world which do not have a <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard</b> representing their language. As Negroponte states this is [...] "because there's no real commercial interest in making a keyboard". One example of where the OLPC has bridged this gap is in creating an Amharic keyboard for Ethiopia.|$|E
2500|$|Multifunctional {{keyboards}} {{provide additional}} function beyond the <b>standard</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Many are programmable, configurable computer keyboards and some control multiple PCs, workstations (incl.

Users have additional key functions {{as well as the}} standard functions and can typically use a single keyboard and mouse to access multiple sources.|$|E
