Fluid <b>secretion</b> occurred constantly around 60 microL/g-min, whereas amylase <b>secretion</b> exhibited an initial peak, followed by a rapid decrease to reach a plateau. Isoproterenol (Isop 1 microM) alone did not induce fluid <b>secretion</b> although it evoked amylase <b>secretion</b> as measured in isolated perfused acini. Addition of Isop during CCh stimulation evoked a rapid and large rise in amylase <b>secretion</b> accompanied by small increase in oxygen consumption. Morphological observations carried out by HR SEM and TEM revealed exocytotic profiles following Isop stimulation. CCh stimulation alone seldom showed exocytotic profiles, suggesting a low incidence of amylase <b>secretion</b> during copious fluid <b>secretion.</b> Combined stimulation of CCh and Isop induced both vacuolation and exocytosis along intercellular canaliculi.

40|$|Physiological stimuli {{from inside}} and outside the stomach {{coverage}} on gastric effector neurons that are the primary regulators of acid <b>secretion.</b> The effector neurons comprise cholinergic neurons and two types of non-cholinergic neurons: bombesin/GRP and VIP neurons. The neurons act directly on target cells or indirectly by regulating release of the hormone, gastrin, the stimulatory paracrine amine, histamine, and the inhibitory paracrine peptide, somatostatin. In the antrum, cholinergic and bombesin/GRP neurons activated by intraluminal proteins stimulate gastrin <b>secretion</b> directly and, in the case of cholinergic neurons, indirectly by eliminating the inhibitory influence of somatostatin (disinhibition). In turn, gastrin acts on adjacent somatostatin cells to restore the <b>secretion</b> of somatostatin. The dual paracrine circuit activated by antral neurons determines the magnitude of gastrin <b>secretion.</b> Low-level distention of the antrum activates, preferentially, VIP neurons that stimulate somatostatin <b>secretion</b> and thus inhibit gastrin <b>secretion.</b> Higher levels of distention activate predominantly cholinergic neurons that suppress antral somatostatin <b>secretion</b> and thus stimulate gastrin <b>secretion.</b> In the fundus, cholinergic neurons activated by distention or proteins stimulate acid <b>secretion</b> directly and indirectly by eliminating the inhibitory influence of somatostatin. The same stimuli activate bombesin/GRP and VIP neurons that stimulate somatostatin <b>secretion</b> and thus attenuate acid <b>secretion.</b> In addition, gastrin and fundic somatostatin influence acid <b>secretion</b> directly and indirectly by regulating histamine release.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} the flagellar-specific type III <b>secretion</b> system (T 3 SS) is the selective recognition of a few substrate proteins among the many thousand cytoplasmic proteins. <b>Secretion</b> substrates are divided into two specificity classes: early substrates secreted for hook-basal body (HBB) construction and late substrates secreted after HBB completion. <b>Secretion</b> was reported to require a disordered N-terminal <b>secretion</b> signal, mRNA <b>secretion</b> signals within the 5 '-untranslated region (5 '-UTR) and for late substrates, piloting proteins known as the T 3 S chaperones. Here, we utilized translational β-lactamase fusions to probe the <b>secretion</b> efficacy of the N-terminal <b>secretion</b> signal of fourteen secreted flagellar substrates in Salmonella enterica.

LcrG <b>secretion</b> has not been functionally analyzed and the relevance of LcrG <b>secretion</b> on LcrG function is unknown. Results An LcrG-GAL 4 AD chimera, originally constructed for two-hybrid analyses to analyze LcrG protein interactions, appeared to be not secreted but the LcrG-GAL 4 AD chimera retained the ability to regulate Yops <b>secretion.</b> This result led to further investigation to determine the significance of LcrG <b>secretion</b> on LcrG function. Additional analyses including deletion and substitution mutations of amino acids 2 – 6 in the N-terminus of LcrG were constructed to analyze LcrG <b>secretion</b> and LcrG's ability to control <b>secretion.</b> Some changes to the N-terminus of LcrG were found to not affect LcrG's <b>secretion</b> or LcrG's secretion-controlling activity.

40|$|Although {{the stomach}} is mainly {{known for its}} ability to secrete {{hydrochloric}} acid, there is increasing evidence that the gastric mucosa also secretes bicarbonate. A simple method for simultaneous measurement of gastric HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> and H+ <b>secretion</b> was developed from a two-component model of gastric <b>secretion.</b> The method, which is based upon gastric juice volume, H+ concentration, and osmolality, was validated both in vitro and in vivo. In 14 healthy human beings, basal gastric HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> averaged 2. 6 mmol/h (range, 0. 7 - 8. 7 mmol/h). Basal HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> was approximately 50 % of basal H+ <b>secretion</b> and there was a significant correlation between basal HCO- 3 and H+ <b>secretion</b> in individual subjects (r = 0. 79). HCO- 3 was secreted in basal nonparietal <b>secretion</b> at a concentration of approximately 90 mmol/liter. Intravenous pentagastrin infusion markedly stimulated H+ <b>secretion</b> but did not increase HCO- 3 <b>secretion.</b> During pentagastrin infusion, the cholinergic agonist, bethanechol, significantly augmented H+ <b>secretion</b> (from 20. 2 to 24. 7 mmol/h) and increased HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> (from 2. 2 to 4. 2 mmol/h). A prostaglandin E 2 analogue significantly reduced H+ <b>secretion</b> and increased HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> during pentagastrin infusion. The reduction in net gastric juice H+ output following prostaglandin E 2 was due more to H+ secretory inhibition than to HCO- 3 secretory stimulation. We conclude that the healthy human stomach actively secretes HCO- 3 and that gastric HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> can be influenced by cholinergic stimulation and by prostaglandin E 2...|$|R

Therefore, myricetin may be a potentially useful compound to increase epithelial Cl− <b>secretion</b> under cAMP-stimulated conditions.

Both isoproterenol and vasopressin (ADH) are known to stimulate adenylate cyclase in this epithelium; however, only isoproterenol stimulated net HCO- 3 <b>secretion.</b> The mechanism of cAMP-stimulated HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> was examined. If both HCO- 3 and H+ <b>secretion</b> were to occur simultaneously in tubules exhibiting net HCO- 3 <b>secretion,</b> cAMP might increase the net HCO- 3 secretory rate by inhibiting H+ <b>secretion,</b> by stimulating HCO- 3 <b>secretion,</b> or both. These possibilities were examined using basolateral addition of the disulfonic stilbene (4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonate (DIDS). In acidifying tubules from NH 4 Cl-loaded rabbits, DIDS eliminated HCO- 3 reabsorption, a result consistent with known effects of DIDS as an inhibitor of H+ <b>secretion.</b> In contrast, cAMP left acidification (H+ <b>secretion)</b> intact. DIDS applied to HCO- 3 secretory tubules failed to increase the HCO- 3 secretory rate, indicating minimal H+ <b>secretion</b> in HCO- 3 secreting tubules. Thus, inhibition of H+ <b>secretion</b> by cAMP could {{not account for the}} cAMP-induced stimulation of net HCO- 3 <b>secretion.</b> cAMP-stimulated HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> was reversibly eliminated by 0 Cl perfusate, whereas luminal DIDS had no effect. Bath amiloride (1 mM) failed to eliminate cAMP-stimulated HCO- 3 <b>secretion</b> when bath [Na+] was 145 mM or 5 mM. cAMP depolarized the transepithelial voltage. The collected fluid [HCO- 3] after cAMP could be accounted for by electrical driving forces, suggesting that cAMP stimulates passive HCO- 3 <b>secretion.</b> However, cAMP did not alter HCO- 3 permeability measured under conditions expected to inhibit transcellular HCO- 3 movement (0 Cl- solutions and bath DIDS). This measured HCO- 3 permeability was not high enough to account, by passive diffusion, for the HCO- 3 fluxes observed in Cl-containing solutions. We conclude the following: cAMP increased net HCO 3 - <b>secretion</b> by stimulating HCO 3 - <b>secretion</b> and not by inhibiting H+ secretion; this HCO 3 - <b>secretion</b> may have occurred by Cl-HCO 3 - exchange; Na+-H+ exchange appeared not {{to play a role in}} basolateral H+ extrusion under these conditions; and the stimulation of HCO 3 - <b>secretion</b> by isoproterenol, but not ADH, suggests the existence of separate cell cAMP pools or cellular heterogeneity in this cAMP response...|$|R
