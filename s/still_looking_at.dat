25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we are <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E
500|$|The SIII's HD Super AMOLED display {{measures}} [...] on the diagonal. With a 720×1280-pixel (720p) resolution, its 306 pixel {{per inch}} (PPI, {{a measure of}} pixel density) is a relatively high, which is accommodated by the removal {{one of the three}} subpixels—red, green and blue—in each pixel to create a PenTile matrix-display; consequently, it does not share the [...] "Plus" [...] suffix found on the SII's Super AMOLED Plus display. The glass used for the display is the damage-resistant corning Gorilla Glass 2, except for S3 Neo variant. The device's software includes a feature known as [...] "Smart Stay", which uses the device's front camera to detect whether the user's eyes are looking at the screen, and prevents the screen from automatically turning off while the user is <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{illustrations}} did not coordinate properly with Potter's text. She altered the drawing and wrote Warne, [...] "I {{have altered the}} oven as it will save a good many corrections. I did a good deal to the cat but she is <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the top one. I don't think it signifies as she talks about both ovens ... I don't think I have ever seriously considered {{the state of the}} pie but the book runs some risk of being over cooked if it goes on much longer! I am sorry about the little dog's nose. I saw it was too sharp. I think I have got it right. I was intending to explain the ovens by saying the middle handle is very stiff so that Duchess concludes it is a sham;–like the lowest. I think only two pages want changing; I think it will come right." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{finishing}} The Playboy, Brown felt {{guilt over}} <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Playmates and credits having {{come out in}} print with helping him overcome his shame. [...] While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown {{it is about the}} guilt he was made to feel for using the media. [...] Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. [...] Brown has objected to this interpretation—rather, he sees it as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women.|$|E
2500|$|Advertisement {{executive}} Jerry Della Femina {{said of the}} show, [...] "if anything, it's underplayed. There was {{a tremendous}} amount of drinking. Three-martini lunches were the norm ... while we were <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the menu, the third would arrive ... The only thing that saved us was that the clients and agencies that we were going back to drank as much as we did ... Bottles in desk drawers were not the exception but the rule".|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{is accused of}} having ignored warnings about fire safety in tower blocks. A former chief fire officer and secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, Ronnie King, said ministers stonewalled requests for meetings and efforts to tighten rules. He said that the then–housing minister Gavin Barwell, refused requests for meetings. King said: “We have had replies, but the replies were {{to the effect that}} you have met my predecessor [...] and {{there were a number of}} matters that we are looking at and we are <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it. (...) They always seem to need a significant loss of life before things are changed.” After six people were killed in the 2009 Lakanal House fire, the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider, and the Department for Communities and Local Government agreed to hold a review in 2013. In March 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group sent a letter to then–Minister for Communities Stephen Williams, which said in part: [...] After further correspondence, Williams replied: [...] Jeremy Corbyn has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all high-rise social housing.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kermode, in The Observer, labeled Pan's Labyrinth as {{the best}} film of 2006, {{describing}} it as [...] "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters". Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film [...] "works on so many levels {{that it seems to}} change shape even as you watch it", and Jim Emerson called the film [...] "a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children". Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery and put it on his Great Movies list on 27 August 2007; when he compiled his belated top ten films of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth was #1, with him stating [...] "But even in a good year I'm unable to see everything. And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was Pan's Labyrinth." [...] The New Yorkers Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it [...] "discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter...." ...|$|E
