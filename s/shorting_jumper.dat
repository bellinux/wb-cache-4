50|$|A Crossover dribble is a {{basketball}} maneuver {{in which a}} player dribbling the ball switches the ball rapidly from one hand to the other, {{to make a change}} in direction. In a typical example the player heads upcourt, dribbling the ball in (say) the left hand, then makes a wide step left with a good head fake. If the defender is deceived, the player can then switch to dribbling with the right hand and surpass the defender. The crossover can allow the player an open <b>short</b> <b>jumper</b> or a clear path to the basket.|$|R
40|$|Multipath {{interference}} in bend-insensitive optical fibers is experimentally evaluated in the 1300 nm wavelength range, describing how this phenomenon originates {{and how it}} can be measured by a setup based on a tunable laser. The characterization of bend-insensitive fibers from different manufacturers is presented; all the considered fibers exhibit a negligible effect in patchcords longer than 10 m, whereas jumpers with length ≤ 2 m can produce multipath interference at detrimental levels above - 30 dB. The phenomenon is even more evident in the cascade of offset-spliced <b>short</b> <b>jumpers</b> made of bend-insensitive fiber; preliminary results showed a large rise of the MPI when two or more jumpers are shortly spaced...|$|R
50|$|On many TEA2025-based boards, Creative used 47uF {{capacitors}} for the amplifiers {{inverting input}} DC decoupling (connecting the Feedback pins on the amplifiers pin-out), whereas the datasheet recommended 100uF units against {{an increase in}} low-pass cutoff. In addition, Creative installed 1 uF input decoupling capacitors on the TEA2025s inputs, which according to the datasheet should have been 0.22uF units and were only necessary when a volume control slider or knob was present, but were installed regardless if the volume knob was present. (These capacitors may be replaced with <b>short</b> <b>jumper</b> wires if no volume control slider or knob is present.) Finally, Creative used polarized capacitors where non-polarized capacitors should have been used.|$|R
50|$|With {{a tightly}} contested first quarter, the Intal-Escalona {{connection}} of the Eagles threatened {{to pull away}} at the second quarter, leading {{by as much as}} ten. In the third quarter, the Tigers stormed back, keeping in touch with the Blue Eagles. In the dying minutes of the fourth quarter, rookie sensation Jervy Cruz fouled out with 1:16 left; Evangelista, the almost-hero of Game 1, fouled out two minutes earlier. With a 64-59 Ateneo lead, Anthony Espiritu scored a three-pointer on the UST offense. Mark Canlas scored a put-back to tie the game. Intal missed a <b>short</b> <b>jumper</b> at the other end for force overtime.|$|R
50|$|The second {{overtime}} was {{a furious}} nip-and-tuck affair, with the lead changing hands 11 times. After Bob Dandridge hit {{a pair of}} free throws, Havlicek, who had nine of his team's 11 points in the period, hit a <b>short</b> <b>jumper</b> from the baseline and was fouled by Dandridge. Havlicek hit the foul shot to put the Celtics up 93-92. Then, the frenzied exchange of baskets occurred with neither team leading {{by more than a}} point. Abdul-Jabbar hit a skyhook, then Havlicek hit a jumper. Oscar Robertson then scored the next two Bucks baskets, sandwiching a Jo Jo White jumper. Then, Havlicek scored again.

2500|$|Jim Spanarkel's Senior Day game {{turned into}} one of the strangest afternoons in ACC {{basketball}} history as Duke held Carolina scoreless for a half before knocking off the No. 4-ranked Tar Heels 47–40. Dean Smith resorted to the four corners offense and the Tar Heels held the ball throughout the first half, but Duke led 7–0 as Spanarkel forced two turnovers, assisted on a basket to Mike Gminski and scored the last bucket of the half on a <b>short</b> <b>jumper.</b> (Smith later said, [...] "It should have been 2–0, or something like that, at the half.") Carolina's only two shots of the first half were air balls, that resulted in the first-ever chants of [...] "Air ball [...] [...] [...] Air ball!" [...] from the Cameron Crazies. Spanarkel added 15 points in the second half and finished with a game-high 17, hitting 8-of-9 field goal attempts. The win allowed Duke to tie North Carolina for the ACC regular season title.|$|R

50|$|The final {{home game}} for Matt Doherty, Michael Jordan, and Sam Perkins was a memorable one for Tar Heels fans. Carolina {{looked to be}} {{finished}} when Duke's Mark Alarie converted a three-point play with 20 seconds to go in regulation and the Tar Heels missed a jumper that would have tied the game. However, after the Blue Devils missed {{the front end of}} a one-and-one, Matt Doherty took the inbounds pass the length of the court and hit a 15-footer with one second left to force overtime. The teams traded baskets during the first overtime and headed for the second extra session tied at 79. Michael Jordan opened the second overtime with an ally oop and a free throw, but Johnny Dawkins cut the North Carolina lead to 82-81 with a <b>short</b> <b>jumper.</b> Duke would get only one more basket as Jordan and Sam Perkins carried the Tar Heels to the 96-83 final, and Carolina became the first ACC team in 10 years to go undefeated in conference play (14-0).

50|$|Duke {{struggled}} {{in its first}} season under Coach Mike Krzyzewski, going 17-13 overall and 6-8 in the ACC. However, the Blue Devils' regular-season finale was one to remember. On Senior Night, Duke's Gene Banks put on a tuxedo and threw roses to the crowd at Cameron Indoor Stadium before the game. Carolina controlled the game early, then went scoreless over a four-minute stretch {{of the second half}} to allow Duke to take a 46-45 lead late in regulation. The Tar Heels fought back to go up 50-49, and the teams traded baskets until two Sam Perkins free throws gave Carolina a 58-56 lead with two seconds to play. Duke inbounded to midcourt and called time out with one second left. Banks took the inbounds pass and nailed a jumper at the buzzer to force overtime. The Blue Devils took a 62-59 lead early in the extra session, but Carolina rallied to take a 65-64 lead on the strength of an Al Wood jumper and two free throws by Mike Pepper. Duke's Vince Taylor misfired on a <b>short</b> <b>jumper,</b> but Banks rebounded and banked home the game-winner with 19 seconds left. Banks led Duke with 25 points, while Perkins scored 24 for Carolina. Perkins also had 10 assists.|$|R

40|$|An amine-based {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and water vapor sorbent in pressure-swing regenerable beds has been {{developed}} by Hamilton Sundstrand and baselined for the Orion Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS).

In two previous years at this conference, reports were presented on extensive Johnson Space Center (JSC) testing of this technology in a sea-level pressure environment with simulated human metabolic loads.
