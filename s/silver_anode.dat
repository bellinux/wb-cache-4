40|$|The SBE 43 is a {{polarographic}} membrane {{oxygen sensor}} having a single output signal of 0 to + 5 volts, which {{is proportional to}} the temperature-compensated current flow occurring when oxygen is reacted inside the membrane. A Sea-Bird CTD that is equipped with an SBE 43 oxygen sensor records this voltage for later conversion to oxygen concentration using {{a modified version of the}} algorithm by Owens and Millard (1985). The SBE 43 determines dissolved oxygen concentration by counting the number of oxygen molecules per second (flux) that diffuse through the membrane from the ocean environment to the working electrode. At the working electrode (cathode), oxygen gas molecules are converted to hydroxyl ions (OH-) in a series of reaction steps where the electrode supplies four electrons per molecule to complete the reaction.

Consequently, the chemistry of the sensor electrolyte changes continuously as oxygen is measured, resulting in a slow but continuous loss of sensitivity that produces a continual, predictable drift in the sensor calibration with time.

The aim {{of this article is}} studying the alloying and optical properties of Cu-Ag nanoparticles prepared via DC arc discharge in water with two different experimental procedures. Arc discharge was ignited between two pure silver and copper electrodes and two types of sample productions were held. The first one was based on using copper and silver wire with 99. 99 % purity as an anode and cathode electrodes and at the same 3 mm diameter in each part by two different 40, 50 A current. Second one was using reversed sited electrodes. Optical properties, size and crystal structure of nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Field Emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively. SEM images show the nanoparticles are spherical with the average size of lower than 30 nm for all samples. XRD results shows there are some displacements in Bragg diffraction angles of silver XRD peaks which is due to the positioning of Cu atoms among silver atoms and synthesis of Ag-Cu alloy nanoparticles. However some Ag-Cu alloy peaks were also observed. In comparison with the optical extinctions of pure copper and silver nanoparticles the optical extinctions of samples have the characteristic optical extinction of Ag-Cu alloy nanoparticles with extinction peak due to surface plasmon resonance that was observed between silver and copper nanoparticles extinction peaks.

The formation rate of methacrolein increased linearly with the applied current, while no methacrolein was formed when dioxygen {{was used as the}} oxidant. This indicates that iso-butane is oxidized to methacrolein by oxygen species produced electrochemically at the gold-YSZ-gas-phase three-phase boundary. Electrochemical cell systems have been used successfully in catalytic oxidation reactions, such as ethene oxidation, 1 ethylben-zene oxidative dehydrogenation, 2 and methane oxidative cou-pling. 3 Most commonly, the cell is constructed with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the solid electrolyte, with electrodes, M and M', mounted on each side; when a potential is applied externally across the two electrodes, YSZ can serve as an oxygen pump where oxide ions are able to flow across the YSZ, via lattice anion vacancies. The oxygen flux is controlled by varying the applied electric potential. In the p(02), MIYSZIM', p'(03) system, molecular oxygen is reduced to oxide ions by 4 e transfer on the cathode sur-face, incorporated into and transported across the YSZ, and then reoxidized to molecular oxygen by a 4 e transfer on the anode sur-face. In oxidation chemistry, activation of molecular oxygen can be achieved by its reduction, leading to active species such as O, O, or O. 4 It is likely that these types of oxygen species are pro-duced on the anode surface during oxygen pumping through the cell, and can be used in catalytic oxidation reactions.

Migration of silver and formation of conductive filaments can cause short-circuit failures [23]. Singh et al.

They observed the formation of pores and cracks on the fuel side of the solid silver barrier. They suggested that dissociation and dissolution of H and O into silver and formation of steam cause development of pores in solid silver barriers. Using silver in SOFC cells and stacks has many benefits and for that reason many researchers are trying to improve SOFC performance using silver compounds. However, the incorporation of silver will affect the cell durability.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityMagnesium is {{the least}} dense {{engineering}} metal, with an excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio. Magnesium recycling is important for both economic and environmental reasons. This project demonstrates feasibility of a new environmentally friendly process for recycling partially oxidized magnesium scrap to produce very pure magnesium at low cost. It combines refining and solid oxide membrane (SOM) based oxide electrolysis in the same reactor. Magnesium and its oxide are dissolved in a molten flux. This is followed by argon-assisted evaporation of dissolved magnesium, which is subsequently condensed in a separate condenser. The molten flux acts as a selective medium for magnesium dissolution, but not aluminum or iron, and therefore the magnesium collected has high purity. Potentiodynamic scans are performed to monitor the magnesium content change in the scrap {{as well as in}} solution in the flux. The SOM electrolysis is employed in the refining system to enable electrolysis of the magnesium oxide dissolved in the flux from the partially oxidized scrap. During the SOM electrolysis, oxygen anions are transported out of the flux through a yttria stabilized zirconia membrane to a liquid <b>silver</b> <b>anode</b> where they are oxidized. Simultaneously, magnesium cations are transported through the flux to a steel cathode where they are reduced. The combination of refining and SOM electrolysis yields close to 100 % removal of magnesium metal from partially oxidized magnesium scrap. The magnesium recovered has a purity of 99. 6 w%. To produce pure oxygen it is critical to develop an inert anode current collector for use with the non-consumable liquid <b>silver</b> <b>anode.</b> In this work, an innovative inert anode current collector is successfully developed and used in SOM electrolysis experiments. The current collector employs a sintered strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Mn 03 -δ or LSM) bar, an Inconel alloy 601 rod, and a liquid silver contact in between. SOM electrolysis experiments with the new LSM-Inconel current collector are carried out and performance comparable to the state-of-the-art SOM electrolysis for Mg production employing the non-inert anode has been demonstrated. In both refining and SOM electrolysis, magnesium solubility in the flux plays an important role. High magnesium solubility in the flux facilitates refining. On the other hand, lower magnesium solubility benefits the SOM electrolysis. The dissolution of magnesium imparts electronic conductivity to the flux. The effects of the electronic conductivity of the flux on the SOM electrolysis performance are examined in detail through experiments and modeling. Methods for mitigating the negative attributes of the electronic conductivity during SOM electrolysis are presented...|$|E

In this study the effect of placing a <b>silver</b> <b>anode</b> in the root canal systems of theth was examined to establish a base for treatment of infected teeth. Pure silver wires {{were placed in the}} main canals of exracted human teeth (n= 26) whose roots were partly submerged in a lactated Ringer's solution. Seventeen microamperes of anadic direct current were applied to one group of silver wires (n= 15) for 4 days. Then the wires were removed and the roots of both group teeth were cut into six sections and demineralixed. Silver concentrations of the root sections and their bathing solutions were measured with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. In the anode group, the electrically activated silver concentrations (range, 1 - 30 µg/mL) exceeded the antibacterial levels (minimum inhibotry concentration 0. 1 µg/mL Ag) in all sections, particulary in the middle and lover sites of the root. The amount of anodic silver that leaked out of the root was found as to be 0. 4 ± 0. 2 µg/mL in the fluid medium. This was 10 to 100 -fold higher than that found in the nonactivated controls...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a nano-class TiO 2 /Ti {{thin-film}} electrode {{was made}} using the atmospheric pressure {{chemical vapor deposition}} (APCVD). The electrode was combined with an external circuit and anode bias to study the efficiencies of silver ions reduction and acetic acid decomposition. Results of SEM images and XRD patterns of the TiO 2 /Ti thin-film electrode surface show that the thin-film electrode made using the APCVD method can be as size as 30 nm with the TiO 2 photoelectric catalyst in anatase crystal form. More obvious agglomeration of TiO 2 particles was observed for shorter APCVD sprayed times. Results of the light response study show that the electrode has a rapid response time to 365 nm UV light to produce electricity with 7 mu A/cm(2) density. Additionally, results of the photocatalytic studies using the electrode combined with an external circuit in the photoelectrical catalytic studies to reduce silver ions reveal that with a reaction time of 180 min, the photocatalytic process will reduce 70 % of silver ions in high-concentrated solution (1000 mg/l as Ag) and 93 % silver ions in low-concentrated solution (108 mg/l as Ag). When the irradiation time is extended to 240 min, the silver reduction efficiency {{is as high as}} 99. 8 %. Higher solution pH is favorable to the photoelectrical reduction of <b>silver</b> while the <b>anode</b> bias does not benefit the silver reduction efficiency but favors the decomposition of acetic acid. However, the process decomposes less than 10 % of acetic acid. The external circuit will transmit the photo-generated electrons to the cathode surface thus reducing the combination of electron and holes at the anode surface. As the reduction of precious metals is concerned, the external circuit is capable of avoiding the metal deposition at the catalyst surface to cause catalyst poison or light shielding that are know to reduce the photo utilization efficiency.

30|$|Conventional {{light-emitting}} {{devices are}} usually constructed with {{the configuration of}} anode/hole-transporting layer (HTL)/active layer/electron-transporting layer (ETL)/metal cathode. Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most used material as HTL. However, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS {{can lead to the}} corrosion of the oxide anode; moreover, high-efficiency devices usually require highly active metals as the cathode, e.g., calcium or magnesium, which are easy to oxidize. In view of the above reasons, inverted light-emitting devices have been proposed and drawn increasing attention mainly due to higher stability compared with conventional ones. The usage of high work function metals such as gold (Au) or <b>silver</b> (Ag) as <b>anode</b> and air-stable metal oxide materials as carrier-transporting layers consequently prolongs lifetime of inverted-type devices. The architecture of inverted light-emitting devices is constructed with the configuration of cathode/ETL/active layer/HTL/metal anode [3, 4]. Many n-type metal oxide materials, including zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO 2), and tin dioxide have been used as ETL [5 – 7]. On the other hand, p-type materials such as vanadium oxide, nickel oxide, and tungsten trioxide (WO 3) can be utilized as HTL [8 – 10]. Taking TiO 2 as an example, it is a well-known semiconducting material that possesses high thermal stability, good electron-transporting property, large energy bandgap of 3.0 – 3.4  eV, and friendly to our living environment [11]. TiO 2 is normally a white solid; however, it can be transparent in thin film or in some nanostructured states. By changing the morphology of TiO 2, it is expected that the optical and/or electrical transporting properties of TiO 2 are also modified. In fact, nanostructured TiO 2 have been applied in many areas, such as ultraviolet photodetectors [12], OLEDs [13], organic solar cells [14], and photocatalytic water-splitting technology [15]. Morii et al. reported encapsulation-free hybrid organic/inorganic light-emitting diodes with the configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO 2 /F 8 BT/MoO 3 /Au [16], using TiO 2 as an electron injection layer (EIL) and MoO 3 as a hole injection layer (HIL). The device could be operated in air with a lower threshold voltage that provided similar luminance output compared with conventional devices using Ca/Al as cathode. Bolink et al. reported inverted light-emitting devices with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/Cs 2 CO 3 /super yellow PPV/MoO 3 /Au [17], using ZnO as an EIL and Cs 2 CO 3 as a hole-blocking layer. High luminance and current efficiency of 12, 000  cd/m 2 and 6.5  cd/A were achieved that is comparable with conventional devices. Park et al. proposed inverted light-emitting devices with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/Cs 2 CO 3 /F 8 BT/PEDOT:PSS/Ag [18]. The Cs 2 CO 3 layer was spin-cast into a thin film from its solution, not by thermal evaporation. A max luminance of 3399  cd/m 2 and max current efficiency of 0.81  cd/A around 14 – 16  V were obtained. Song et al. further modified a device structure with the configuration of FTO/ZnO/FPQ-Br/F 8 BT/MoO 3 /Au [19], using an ionic polyfluorene (PF) derivative FPQ-Br tethering Br− counterions as the wetting agent to improve contact between inorganic ZnO and organic F 8 BT. Wen et al. employed a self-assembled monolayer PEDA-TMS to modify TiO 2 surface for tuning its conduction band to match the energy level of high-yellow phenyl-substituted poly(para-phenylenevinylene) copolymer (HY-PPV). Inverted devices with the configuration of ITO/TiO 2 /PEDA-TMS/HY-PPV/MoO 3 /Au/Ag were fabricated, revealing much higher brightness of 3148  cd/m 2 than that of the bare TiO 2 device [20]. From literature survey, we notice that the above metal oxide materials were prepared and utilized as a thin film; TiO 2 nanorods has not been reported in the light-emitting area so far. In addition to TiO 2 and ZnO thin films, TiO 2 nanorods are regarded as a potential candidate for the construction of light-emitting devices based on the following reasons. As mentioned in the previous part, TiO 2 is a cheap, thermally stable, and non-toxic semiconducting material that is favorable for device fabrication and mass production. Moreover, nanorod-type TiO 2 can provide one-dimensional pathways for carrier transportation. This is particularly beneficial for electrons to enter the device and to improve recombination rate of carriers. The transmittance of TiO 2 in the visible region can also be tuned by experimental controls. From a scientific and industrial viewpoint, developing alternatives or new type of materials is an essential issue to expand the diversity of research instead of adopting limited materials.|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of L X-ray fluorescence (LXRF) to measure cortical bone lead directly, safely, rapidly, and noninvasively, {{the present study was}} undertaken to a) evaluate LXRF as a possible replacement for the CaNa 2 EDTA test; b) quantify lead in tibial cortical bones of mildly to moderately lead-toxic children before treatment; and c) quantify lead in tibial cortical bones of lead-toxic children sequentially following one to two courses of chelation therapy. The clinical research design was based upon a longitudinal assessment of 59 untreated lead-toxic children. At enrollment, if the blood lead (PbB) was 25 to 55 jg/dL and the erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) concentration was 2 35 glg/dL, LXRF measurement of tibial bone lead was carried out. One day later, each child underwent a CaNa 2 EDTA provocative test. If this test was positive, lead-toxic children were admitted to the hospital for 5 days of CaNa 2 EDTA therapy. These tests were repeated 6 weeks and 6 months after enrollment. Abatement of lead paint hazards was achieved in most apartments by the time of initial hospital discharge. The LXRF instrument consists of a low energy X-ray generator with a <b>silver</b> <b>anode,</b> a lithium-doped silicon detector, a polarizer of incident photons, and a multichannel X-ray analyzer. Partially polarized photons are directed at the subcutaneous, medial mid-tibial cortical bone. The LXRF spectrum...|$|E
