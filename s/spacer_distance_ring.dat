40|$|We {{describe}} a novel plasmonic hybrid nanostructure {{based on a}} silver island film covered with a dielectric silica layer. The thickness of the silica layer is varied from 0 to approximately 46 nm on a single sample, thus allowing for continuous variation of the interaction strength between plasmon excitations in the metallic film and the excited states of pigments comprising photosynthetic complexes used to probe this interaction. While the largest separation between the silver film and photosynthetic complexes provides fluorescence featuring mono-exponential decay, thinner silica <b>spacer</b> <b>distances</b> show bi-exponential decay. The intensity of the fast component, which is attributed to the emission of photosynthetic complexes coupled to plasmon excitations, strongly decreases {{as a function of}} the spacer thickness.

40|$|ABSTRACTGiven {{that the}} {{durability}} of structures {{is directly related to}} the thickness of the cover to reinforcement, it is essential to ensure minimum cover is achieved when building a structure. However, studies show that this is not always the case. One of the reasons for the this problem is the lack of indication, in structural projects, of the positioning of spacers. This situation is compounded by the lack of standards and regulations on the use of spacers (i. e. minimum quantities and required layout). This study assesses three different <b>spacer</b> <b>distances</b> and two different tying distances in order to examine the influence of these factors in the cover to reinforcement. To achieve so, three slabs were prepared in situ using different arrangements. After demoulding, cover thickness was determined using a digital covermeter.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} the oxidant CuCl 2 to study its effect on {{precursor}} protein import into chloroplasts and on the components involved. CuCl 2 reversibly oxidizes thiol groups, which in turn, can form disulfide bridges. Concentrations of 40 μM CuCl 2 almost completely inhibit precursor protein binding and subsequent translocation into chloroplasts. This inhibitory effect is reversible by a dithiothreitol treatment. Disulfide bridges, which form upon oxidation by CuCl 2, are build up intramolecular and intermolecular, if the thiol groups are in close vicinity to each other. CuCl 2 can thus {{be used as a}} thiol cleavable crosslinker without an additional <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> between the two targets. When purified outer envelope membranes were treated with CuCl 2, a hetero oligomeric complex is detected, consisting of OEP 86, OEP 75 and OEP 34, indicating the close vicinity and protein-protein interaction between polypeptides in situ, which are involved in protein translocation into chloroplasts...|$|R

40|$|Smartphone {{fluorescence}} microscopy has various applications in point-of-care (POC) testing and diagnostics, ranging from e. g., quantification of immunoassays, detection of microorganisms, to sensing of viruses. An important need in smartphone-based microscopy and sensing techniques {{is to improve}} the detection sensitivity to enable quantification of extremely low concentrations of target molecules. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to enhance the detection sensitivity of a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope by using surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) created by a thin metal-film. In this plasmonic design, the samples are placed on a silver-coated glass slide with a thin spacer, and excited by a laser-diode from the backside through a glass hemisphere, generating surface plasmon polaritons. We optimized this mobile SEF system by tuning the metal-film thickness, <b>spacer</b> <b>distance,</b> excitation angle and polarization, and achieved ~ 10 -fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity compared to a bare glass substrate, which enabled us to image single fluorescent particles as small as 50 [*]nm in diameter and single quantum-dots.

40|$|A {{particular}} interesting plasmonic {{system is}} that of metallic nanostructures interacting with metal films. As the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) behavior of gold nanostructures (Au NPs) {{on the top of}} a gold thin film is exquisitely sensitive to the <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> of the film-Au NPs, we investigate in the present work the influence of a few-layered graphene spacer on the LSPR behavior of the NPs. The idea is to evidence the role of few-layered graphene as one of the thinnest possible spacer. We first show that the coupling to the Au film induces a strong lowering at around 507 nm and sharpening of the main LSPR of the Au NPs. Moreover, a blue shift in the main LSP resonance of about 13 nm is observed in the presence of a few-layered graphene spacer when compared to the case where gold nanostructures are directly linked to a gold thin film. Numerical simulations suggest that this LSP mode is dipolar and that the hot spots of the electric field are pushed to the top corners of the NPs, which makes it very sensitive to surrounding medium optical index changes and thus appealing for sensing applications. A figure of merit of such a system (gold/graphene/Au NPs) is 2. 8, as compared to 2. 1 for gold/Au NPs. This represents a 33 % gain in sensitivity and opens-up new sensing strategies...|$|R

In this paper we show for the first time that a replicating vector can been used to express foreign genes other than antibiotic resistance genes in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Plasmids derived from the lactococcal vector pNZ 18 could introduce and maintain four different genes for many generations in A. laidlawii. One of these, encoding the dominant membrane lipoprotein spiralin from the mollicute Spiroplasma citri, was expressed; however, expression was weak, the signal peptide of spiralin was not cleaved and the protein was not covalently modified by fatty acids. This resulted in a hydrophilic character of spiralin and its cytoplasmic localization in A. laidlawii. To increase the expression of foreign genes, random A. laidlewii DNA fragments were cloned into a pNZl 8 -related plasmid and expression signals were selected using the Bacillus licheniformis a-amylase gene as a probe. Selection was done in Escherichia coli as well as directly in A. Iaidlawii. Active recombinants from E. coli were also able to express a-amylase activities and an enzyme of native size in A. laidlawii.

Hydrogen {{has the potential to be}} an alternative energy source, since it has higher energy content than petroleum.
