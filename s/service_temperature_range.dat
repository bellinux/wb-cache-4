Various properties, including mechanical, tribological, welding, and corrosion properties, of Al- 12 Si alloys fabricated via SLM have been extensively studied. However, all of these studies were carried out at ambient conditions.

The plasticity of these materials increases along with the size of the dimples on the fracture surface with increasing tensile test temperature. Moreover, the annealed Al- 12 Si alloy exhibits appreciable tensile properties when tested between 373 K and 473 K.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce fuel consumption, the weight of {{automobiles}} has to be reduced. Fiber reinforced polymers offer the potential to reach this aim because of their high stiffness to weight ratio. Additionally, the use of fiber reinforced polymers in automotive applications has to allow for an economic large-scale production. In this regard, long fiber reinforced thermoplastics made by direct processing offer both mechanical performance and processability in injection moulding and compression moulding. The work presented in this contribution deals with long glass fiber reinforced polypropylene directly processed in compression moulding (D-LFT). For the use in automotive applications both the temperature and the time dependency of the materials properties have to be investigated to fulfill performance requirements during crash or the demands of <b>service</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranging</b> from - 40 °C to 80 °C. To consider both the influence of temperature and time, quasistatic tensile tests {{have been carried out}} at different temperatures. These tests have been complemented by high speed tensile tests at different strain rates. As expected, the increase in strain rate results in an increase of the elastic modulus which correlates to an increase of the stiffness with decreasing <b>service</b> <b>temperature.</b> The results are in good accordance with results determined by dynamic mechanical analysis within the range of 0. 1 to 100 Hz. The experimental results from different testing methods were grouped and interpreted by using different time temperature shift approaches. In this regard, Williams-Landel-Ferry and Arrhenius approach based on kinetics have been used. As the theoretical shift factor follows an arctan function, an empirical approach was also taken into consideration. It could be shown that this approach describes best the time and temperature superposition for glass fiber reinforced polypropylene manufactured by D-LFT processing...|$|R

40|$|With {{the aid of}} a newly {{developed}} testing method, the flow behaviour of bitumens and polymer-modified bitumens was tested in tension retardation experiments with systematic variation of temperature and loading, and investigated for the purpose of ascertaining any connection with conventional viscosity features. The tension viscosities determined in tension retardation and relaxation experiments were tested for plausibility. It was also investigated whether the tension viscosity correlates with the shear viscosity determined by the Dekker method. The tension viscosity, which exhibits a high degree of temperature dependence, can be estimated for standard bitumens, but not however for polymer-modified bitumens, via the viscosity feature of ring and ball softening point and the penetration index.

Major problems in this application concern the wear of the coatings due to interactions with the hot glass and particularly the damage by stresses induced in the coatings by temperature varying from room <b>temperature</b> to the <b>service</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>ranging</b> up to 800 K and even higher. In the present study coatings of the Ti-Al-N system were deposited on steel, fused silica and silicon substrates in reactive sputtering processes by variation of the process parameters such as total pressure, substrate temperature, discharge power and distance between target and substrate. The film composition was systematically varied by applying different argon and nitrogen partial pressures during the deposition. The paper describes the effects of the deposition parameters and film composition on the residual stresses and the service behaviour of coatings. The coatings were investigated by optical and mechanical methods. By appropriate selection of the deposition parameters the film properties and the service behaviour of forming tools could be improved. Results on the service behaviour are discussed on the basis of glass-forming experiments at high temperatures. According to the achieved results the nitrogen content y in Ti-Al-N coatings was increased from y = 0. 75 to y = 2. 2 and the compressive film stress from 400 to 1500 MPa by increasing the number of collisions of sputtered TiAl species with nitrogen n(N 2) between 0. 2 and 1. 2 in d. c. triode sputtering at 0. 05 Pa total gas pressure.

40|$|State-of-the-art, high {{temperature}} polyimide matrix composites, reinforced with continuous graphite fibers {{are known to}} be susceptible to intraply cracking when thermally cycled over their useful <b>service</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b> It is believed that the transply cracking, in part, results from residual stresses caused by differences in coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between the polymer matrix and the reinforcement.

As an alternative to thermal cycling studies, a study of unbalanced crossply graphite fiber reinforcement composites was conducted to assess the effect of the composite ply layup and surface condition on the residual stresses that remain after the processing of these materials.

40|$|Segmented {{copolymers}} with short, glassy or crystalline hard segments and long, amorphous soft segments (multi-block copolymers) are thermoplastic elastomers (TPE’s). The hard segments form physical crosslinks for the amorphous (rubbery) soft segments. As a result, {{this type}} of materials combines elastomeric behavior with melt processability. Typical examples are the copolyetheresters based on poly(butylene terephthalate) and poly(tetramethyleneoxide) (PBT-PTMO, TPE-E) and the thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPE-U). The design and synthesis of copolyetheresteramides with uniform crystallizable bisesterdiamides as the hard segment is a new development. Bisesterdiamides of uniform length crystallize over their full length, resulting in fast and nearly complete crystallization. Consequently, the phase separation is good, leading to a polymer with a low glass transition temperature, a high melting temperature and a temperature independent rubbery plateau.

5000|$|Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, low-performance, the {{low-cost}} {{and most}} common {{material for the}} glue sticks (e.g., the light amber colored Thermogrip GS51, GS52, and GS53). They provide sufficient strength between 30 and 50 °C but are limited to use below 60-80 °C and have low creep resistance under load. The vinyl acetate monomer content is about 18-29 percent by weight of the polymer. High amounts of tackifiers and waxes are often used; an example composition is 30-40% of EVA copolymer (provides strength and toughness), 30-40% of tackifier resin (improves wetting and tack), 20-30% of wax (usually paraffin-based; reduces viscosity, alters setting speed, reduces cost), and 0.5-1% of stabilizers. Fillers can be added for special applications. Can be formulated for <b>service</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>ranging</b> from −40 to +80 °C, and for both short and long open times and {{a wide range of}} melt viscosities. High stability at elevated temperatures and resistance to ultraviolet radiation, which can be further enhanced with suitable stabilizers. High vinylacetate content can serve for formulating a hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive (HMPSA). EVA formulations are compatible with paraffin. EVA was the base for the original hot melt composition. The composition of the copolymer influences its properties; increased content of ethylene promotes adhesion to nonpolar substrates such as polyethylene, while increased content of vinyl acetate promotes adhesion to polar substrates such as paper. Higher ethylene content also increases mechanical strength, block resistance, and paraffin solubility. Higher vinyl acetate content provides higher flexibility, adhesion, hot tack, and better low-temperature performance. Adhesive grade EVA usually contains 14-35% vinyl acetate. Lower molecular weight chains provide lower melt viscosity, better wetting, and better adhesion to porous surfaces. Higher molecular weights provide better cohesion at elevated temperatures and better low-temperature behavior. Increased ratio of vinyl acetate lowers the crystallinity of the material, improves optical clarity, flexibility and toughness, and worsens resistance to solvents. EVA can be crosslinked by, e.g., peroxides, yielding a thermosetting material. EVAs can be compounded with aromatic hydrocarbon resins. Grafting butadiene to EVA improves its adhesion. Its dielectric properties are poor due to high content of polar groups, the dielectric loss is moderately high. Polypropylene HMAs are a better choice for high-frequency electronics. EVAs are optically clearer and more gas and vapor permeable than polyolefins. Nearly half of EVA HMAs is used in packaging applications. Cryogenic grinding of EVAs can provide small, water-dispersible particles for heat-seal applications. EVA can degrade primarily by loss of acetic acid and formation of a double bond in the chain, and by oxidative degradation. EVA can be compounded into a wide range of HMAs, from soft pressure-sensitive adhesives to rigid structural adhesives for furniture construction.|$|R

PP films coated with corn zein were obtained through a simple solvent casting method. Corn-zein with different amounts (5 % and 15 %) was dissolved in 70 % and 95 % aqueous ethanol solution at 50 oC, respectively. Solutions of corn-zein plasticized by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glycerol (GLY) with various levels (20 % and 50 %) were applied on corona-discharged-treated PP film. The resulting corn-zein coated PP films showed good appearance, flexibility and adhesion between the coating and the base film. The coated PP films showed a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in barrier (water and oxygen) properties and improvement in mechanical properties when coating formulation consisted of higher corn-zein content and lower amount of GLY as plasticizer. Furthermore, zein coating increased the <b>service</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> of the PP films, and promised good printability on the surface due to contact angle results.

We designed a canister that will hold the neutron source during the calibration process.

We calculated the equilibrium temperature change of the calibration neutron source when it is turned on and found that the temperature increases by 92. 6 +isi K, corresponding to a rise in the dielectric gel height of 1. 501 i. 9 cm. This temperature change is within the <b>service</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> of the dielectric gel; however, a more thermally conductive gel could still be used to reduce the temperature increase.

The latter was reproduced by the impact test on the specimens tempered at those temperatures. Four types of LDCF (LDCF 1 to 4) and four types of temper embrittlement (TE 1 to 4) were recognized. LDCF 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively appear in the same time-temperature ranges as those in which TE 1, 2, 3 and 4 arise. Common metallurgical causes of the LDCF and TE were discussed. LDCF 1, 2 and TE 1, 2 which arise in the short-term range, will be induced both {{by the loss of}} ductility in ferrite matrix and the segregation of impurities in grain boundaries. LDCF 3 and TE 3, which arises in the long-term range, will be induced by the segregation of impurities in grain boundaries. LDCF 4 and TE 4, which appears in the high <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> will be brought about by the coarsening of carbide particles in ferrite matrix...|$|R
