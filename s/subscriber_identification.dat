40|$|The most {{important}} tasks which currently {{associated with the}} automated control people's access to resources of information systems for voice, are: - Control of the remote access of banks clients and inquiry services subscribers to information resources and reference information bank systems using a phone or other similar device; - Permanent control of operators access to information resources of transport and energy ergatic systems during the execution of their duties. On the basis of analyzing {{the conditions of the}} application are developed the concepts of building two types of access control systems (ACS). Each of the applications ACS has its own specific characteristics that determine the requirements for the respective systems. The introduction of the concept of building control systems of remote access users to the information resources of banks will allow for a significant increase in functionality of the ACS compared to the existing ones due to the additional control of the emotional state (EmS) of a <b>subscriber</b> and <b>identification</b> of <b>subscribers</b> for their lack of "blacklists" and detect scams. Development of the concept of building access control for the second version of their application was aimed at carrying out authentication, EmS control, identification of operators by continuous speech and control over the degree of fatigue of operators by the parameters that characterize the state of the cardiovascular system. For each type of ACS presented proposals for the composition and construction of sub-systems and their constituent units, described the principles of operation of modules depending on the conditions which that characterize the area of application. A combination of different methods and approaches to building subsystems ACS (methods of wavelet transforms, cepstrum analysis, clustering, etc.), using artificial neural networks and algorithms that based on metrics allows to create an access control system with higher accuracy and speed comparing to existing systems, for use in various specific operating conditions. ???????? ????????? ? ????????? ????? ????????, ?????????? ? ???????????? ??????????????????? ???????? ??????? ????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ??????, ????????: ? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ? ????????? ?????????? ????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??? ??????? ???????????? ??????????; ? ???????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ???????????? ? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??? ????? ?????????????? ????????????. ? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ???? ????? ?????? ???????? ???????

40|$|Abstract. Despite a legal {{framework}} being {{in place for}} several years, the market share of qualified electronic signatures is disappointingly low. Mobile Signatures provide a new and promising opportunity for the deployment of an infrastructure for qualified electronic signatures. We analyzed two possible signing approaches (server based and client based signatures) and conclude that SIM-based signatures are the most secure and convenient solution. However, using the SIM-card as a secure signature creation device (SSCD) raises new challenges, because it would contain the user’s private key {{as well as the}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>identification.</b> Combining both functions in one card raises the question who will have the control over the keys and certificates. We propose a protocol called Certification on Demand (COD) that separates certification services from <b>subscriber</b> <b>identification</b> information and allows consumers to choose their appropriate certification services and service providers based on their needs. We also present some of the constraints that still have to be addressed before qualified mobile signatures are possible. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Integrated circuit {{cards or}} smart cards are now well-known. Applications such as {{electronic}} purses (cash units stored in cards), <b>subscriber</b> <b>identification</b> cards used in cellular telephone or access keys for pay-TV and information highways emerge {{in many places}} with millions of users. More services are required by applications providers and card holders. Mainly, new integrated circuit cards evolve towards non-predefined multi-purpose, open and multi-user applications. Today, operating systems implemented into integrated circuit cards cannot respond to these new trends. They have evolved from simple operating systems defining an hardware abstraction level up to file management systems or database management systems where the card behavior was defined once at the manufacturing level or by the card issuer. The needs for open and flexible card life cycle enabling to accommodate executable code loaded by different service providers require {{a new generation of}} smart cards.

It can be fairly and rapidly provided to the system, {{while at the same}} time remaining impractical to break the brute force attack. OTP algorithm powered with user’s unique identifications like International Mobile Equipment Identification and <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identification</b> Module; makes a finite alphanumeric token valid for a session and for a single use. PassText is an easy way of system authentication schema which enables the user not obligatory to memorize any difficult passwords or character combinations. Concatenation of these two schemas gives maximum security for authentications and almost impossible to break. We have also proposed a novel measure of security levels of many popular authentication schemas against the one we proposed...|$|E
40|$|Internet {{services}} in distributive organization are normally built {{on an open}} network environment. In the environment internet service provisioning cannot be expected executing in a single close organization [1]. Identity management in cross-organization becomes an issue for handling Internet service and distributive business process. The “identity ” in cross-organization web service is defined as global identity rather than private identity from client. Global identity searching table that registers all related service organization is the normal way we used to [2]. Through global identity searching table the target service organization can be looked up directly. For some business program, however, global identity is not necessary registered in specific service organization, e. g. IMSI (International Mobile <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identification)</b> registration in NP (Number Portability) Service [3], for instance. In NP Service each IMSI can be re-assigned to different mobile service provider if the IMSI apply the re-assignment. In the example about IMSI in NP service mentioned above, {{if there is an}} internet service will be executed according to identity management with IMSI, then it will be a challenge to find the organization for available IMSI in very short response time. To dynamically re-assign a IMSI in different mobile service provider, the traditional global identity searching table will not be practical due to frequently changing the registration of IMSI in different service provider. To give an intelligent searching model for cross-organization global identity management is a better way than a stati...|$|E
