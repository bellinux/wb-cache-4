5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces began {{surrounding}} the Pusan Perimeter {{from all sides}} {{in an attempt to}} envelop it. The 4th and 6th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver. The two divisions attempted to envelop the UN's left flank, but became extremely <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the process. They advanced on UN positions with armor and superior numbers, repeatedly pushing back U.S. and South Korean forces.|$|E

There are many temples around Thanjavur {{district}} of Tamil Nadu that are larger than these 3 temples even; one such is Thillai Nataraja Temple in Chidambaram <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 40 acres and truly a temple complex. The trustees of these temples have reportedly disputed the Guinness World Record.|$|E

The two divisions attempted to envelop the UN′s left flank, but became extremely <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the process. At the same time, the NK 5th and 12th Division pressured the South Koreans on the right flank. They advanced on UN positions with armor and superior numbers, repeatedly defeating U.S. and South Korean forces and forcing them further south. On 21 July, the NK 12th Division was ordered by the II North Korean Corps to capture P'ohang-dong by 26 July.|$|E

5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
5|$|Of the six {{divisions}} encamped on {{the western}} side of the Tennessee River in early April, only Lew Wallace's 3rd Division was at Crump's Landing; the remainder were farther south (upriver) at Pittsburg Landing. Grant developed a reputation during the war for being more concerned with his own plans than with those of the enemy. His encampment at Pittsburg Landing displayed his most consequential lack of such concern—his army was <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> bivouac style, with many of his men surrounding a small, log meetinghouse named Shiloh Church (Shiloh was a biblical city that served as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel), passing the time waiting for Buell's army with drills for his many raw troops without establishing entrenchments or other significant defensive measures.|$|E
5|$|Soleil's {{squadron}} departed Rochefort on {{the evening}} of 24 September, aiming to bypass Hood's squadron in the dark. However at 01:00 on 25 September, with the wind coming from the northeast, lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east. Hood's squadron was spread out, tacking southeast towards the Chassiron Lighthouse at Saint-Denis-d'Oléron with HMS Centaur in the centre, HMS Revenge to the east (or windward) and Monarch to the west. HMS Mars was also close by, {{with the rest of the}} squadron <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the rear. Hood's immediate reaction was that the sails must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line, and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation. Even as the signal was raised however, lookouts on Monarch identified the strangers as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders and raised a new signal ordering a general chase, confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{top three}} began to <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{the second half}} of the race, and by lap 54 Lewis Hamilton was leading Rosberg by 10.06 seconds, with Vettel a further 12.12 seconds behind Rosberg. However, due to Ferrari's earlier attempt to {{undercut}} Rosberg by pitting Vettel early, Räikkönen's tyres were 4 laps fresher than his teammate's, and he closed in on Vettel over the final stint. Having emerged from his final pit stop 4.84 seconds behind Vettel on lap 35, Räikkönen had closed the gap to 1.37 seconds by lap 54. However, the chance of a battle between the Ferrari teammates was extinguished after a transmission failure on Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso, who was stranded on the start/finish-straight, brought out the safety car for the final two laps, meaning that the race ended under safety car conditions.|$|E
5|$|The initial Australian dispositions around Isurava saw the {{depleted}} 39th <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> five entrenched company areas {{astride the}} track {{in between the}} northern and southern creeks that flowed into Eora Creek. Having left most of their entrenching equipment behind during the withdrawal from Deniki, the troops from the 39th had to dig-in with whatever they had at hand including steel helmets and bayonets. Their positions were constructed amidst an area of long grass, behind an abandoned garden, which offered good observation of the track heading towards Deniki. The 53rd Infantry Battalion was positioned further back at Alola, co-located with Potts' headquarters. A forward observation post had also been established on the Isurava ridgeline. The Australians maintained a patrol presence forward of their occupied areas. Throughout 24 and 25 August, as the Japanese force began pressing forward, patrols from the 53rd Infantry Battalion clashed with groups of Japanese in front of Isurava, {{and on the other side}} of Eora Creek around Missima. Potts, realising that Horii had launched a major attack, decided to deploy the 2/14th under Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key to Isurava, using the 39th to screen their movement. The 2/16th, under Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, was bought forward to Alola, where it would be held in reserve. By the time the 2/14th Battalion had deployed, the Japanese were able to field a force of between 3,000 and 5,000.|$|E

25|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{includes the}} wavefunction, so its wave packet solution implies {{the position of}} a (quantum) particle is fuzzily <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> wave fronts. On the contrary, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.|$|E

25|$|Before World War 2, little {{progress}} was made in wireless power transmission. Radio was developed for communication uses, but couldn't be used for power transmission {{due to the fact}} that the relatively low-frequency radio waves <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> all directions and little energy reached the receiver. In radio communication, at the receiver, an amplifier intensifies a weak signal using energy from another source. For power transmission, efficient transmission required transmitters that could generate higher-frequency microwaves, which can be focused in narrow beams towards a receiver.|$|E
25|$|Skillful use of {{couriers}} enabled these armies {{to maintain}} contact {{with each other}} and their leadership. Discipline was inculcated during a nerge (traditional hunt), as reported by Juvayni. These hunts were distinctive from hunts in other cultures where they were the equivalent to small unit actions. Mongol forces would <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a line, surround an entire region, and then drive all of the game within that area together. The goal was to let none of the animals escape and to slaughter them all.|$|E
25|$|Frequency (subcarrier) {{interleaving}} increases {{resistance to}} frequency-selective channel {{conditions such as}} fading. For example, when {{a part of the}} channel bandwidth fades, frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.|$|E
