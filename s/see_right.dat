5|$|The {{first full}} day of filming on June 23 was {{predominantly}} shot on the set representing {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could <b>see</b> <b>right</b> up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.|$|E

25|$|In an {{n-channel}} 'depletion-mode' device, {{a negative}} gate-to-source voltage causes a depletion region {{to expand in}} width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the active region expands to completely close the channel, {{the resistance of the}} channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch (<b>see</b> <b>right</b> figure, when there is very small current). This is called 'pinch-off', and the voltage at which it occurs is called the 'pinch-off voltage'. Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (<b>see</b> <b>right</b> figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large).|$|E

In the adult horse, Salmonella, Clostridium difficile, and Neorickettsia risticii (the causative agent of Potomac Horse Fever) are common causes of colitis. Antibiotics, which {{may lead to}} an altered and unhealthy microbiota, sand, grain overload, and toxins such as arsenic and cantharidin {{can also lead to}} colitis. Unfortunately, only 20–30% of acute colitis cases are able to be definitively diagnosed.

The gap suddenly fires, allowing the charged tank capacitor to discharge into the primary winding. Once the gap fires, the electrical behavior of either circuit is identical. Experiments have shown that neither circuit offers any marked performance advantage over the other.|$|E

Several women threw their young children on board at the last minute. What is known is that 1,684 passengers were registered when the train (unexpectedly) reached the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near Hannover on 9 July.|$|E

25|$|Early {{graphic art}} {{of all kinds}} often {{depicted}} Black characters in a stylized fashion, emphasizing certain physical features to form a recognizable racial caricature of Black faces. These features often included long unkempt hair, broad noses, enormous red-tinted lips, dark skin and ragged clothing reminiscent of those worn by Black slaves. These characters were also depicted as speaking accented English. In the early 20th century United States, these kinds of representations were seen frequently in newspaper comic strips and political cartoons, {{as well as in}} later comic magazines, and were also present in early cartoons by Disney and Looney Tunes. In comics, nameless Black bystanders (<b>see</b> <b>right)</b> and even some notable heroes and villains were developed in this style, including Ebony White, sidekick of The Spirit (see below) and Steamboat, valet of Billy Batson.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1980s, {{stations}} used {{a series}} of New Zealand call signs, consisting of a single digit and two letters (<b>see</b> <b>right).</b> In addition to YA National programme stations, YC Concert programme stations and {{a limited number of}} privately owned X stations, several stations were operated commercially by the government. In each region, the largest city was assigned a ZB station (1ZB Auckland, 2ZB Wellington, 3ZB Christchurch and 4ZB Dunedin) and a ZM music station (1ZM Auckland, 2ZM Wellington and 3ZM Christchurch). The Newstalk ZB and ZM brands continue to be used by The Radio Network. The second largest city was assigned a ZA station: 1ZA in Taupo, 2ZA in Palmerston North, 3ZA in Greymouth and 4ZA in Invercargill. In other towns and cities the final letter was assigned from the town or city name such as 4ZG in Gore and 1ZH in Hamilton. These ZA and other stations, also now owned by The Radio Network, have been rebranded as Classic Hits. 1YA, 2YK, 3AQ, 4YA were the first stations operating in the country's four main cities, and 5ZB was a mobile radio station broadcast in railway carriages during the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The above {{examples}} of mono-monostatic objects are necessarily inhomogeneous, that is, {{the density of}} their material varies across their body. The {{question of whether it}} is possible to construct a three-dimensional body which is mono-monostatic but also homogeneous and convex was raised by Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold in 1995. The requirement of being convex is essential as it is trivial to construct a mono-monostatic non-convex body (an example would be a ball with a cavity inside it). Convex means that any straight line between two points on a body lies inside the body, or, in other words, that the surface has no sunken regions but instead bulges outward (or is at least flat) at every point. It was already well known, from a geometrical and topological generalization of the classical four-vertex theorem, that a plane curve has at least four extrema of curvature, specifically, at least two local maxima and at least two local minima (<b>see</b> <b>right</b> figure), meaning that a (convex) mono-monostatic object does not exist in two dimensions. Whereas a common anticipation was that a three-dimensional body should also have at least four extrema, Arnold conjectured that this number could be smaller.|$|E
