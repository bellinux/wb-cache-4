Starting from a macroeconomic position sport {{is defined as}} consumer technology the development of which is regarded {{in the context of}} evolution theory using product cycle argument. Sports preferences and demand for sports activities microanalytically are explained by social milieu factors. Hypotheses are formulated how individual skills and talents on one hand and locational attributes on the other affect individual sports preferences and determine the prices for sports facilities. Sports for Economic Interests In view of widely advanced institutionalization and technology, modern sports have outgrown the spontaneity and improvisation of their origins: sporting goods (e. g. sports equipment and apparel) and <b>sporting</b> <b>services</b> (such as sports clubs and schools) as well as other services related to sports (fitness care and tourism) take up an ever-increasing part of production and consumption in our society.

This paper reports a research project which aimed to examine how, on the one hand, Muslims in two specific local contexts in the UK (Leicester in the East Midlands; Birmingham in the West Midlands) make sense of the relationship between their religious (Islamic) identities and sporting interests and, on the other, how local policy makers perceived and responded to the sporting needs of these Muslim communities. According to the 2001 census, Leicester and Birmingham represent, respectively, one of the most ethnically diverse areas in Britain and the domicile for one-third of the Muslim population in Britain. Interviews were undertaken with representatives of Muslim organizations, governmental and quasi-governmental sporting organizations, in both cities. Critical Discourse Analysis of interviewees’ responses reveal pluralistic views on a range of issues such as: the ‘‘(un) suitability’’ of the environment/space provided for, or accessed by, Muslims to practise sport; funding; gender equity; equity and social inclusion agenda versus cultural and religious diversities; and a resistance (on the part of policy makers) to target provision at faith groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} benefits of tourism can be modified and evaluated by means of several macroeconomic indicators, which include the number of jobs, the volume of domestic production, or gross added value initiated by the expenditure of visitors in the travel and tourism industry.

So expenditure of visitors indirectly affect the creation of domestic production, gross value added and number of jobs in other industries that supply inputs to the tourist trade establishments. To quantify the total, i. e. direct and indirect impact of visitors´ expenditures on the domestic economy selected multipliers can be used, which in case of their application in tourism measure the change for example of domestic production or gross added value in consequence of the change of visitors´ expenditures or spending on the goods of tourism...|$|E

40|$|This paper argues {{the case}} for {{increasing}} {{the focus on the}} "place" element of the marketing mix when marketing sport. The contention that marketing and promotional strategy decisions are largely determined by the capabilities and features of the sport facility is used to argue that "place" becomes the most important element of the marketing mix when marketing facility dependent <b>sport</b> <b>services.</b> "Place" is considered from three points of view: place as a temporal and spatial concept, place from an anthropological point of view, and, finally, place from the contemporary sport spectator's point of view. A refocused marketing mix for facility dependent <b>sport</b> <b>services</b> is presented. The refocused sport marketing mix is derived from the importance of the facility as an outlet for social interaction and, as a consequence, the use of services marketing techniques to maximise spectator enjoyment. Facility dependent <b>sport</b> <b>services</b> and those <b>sport</b> <b>services</b> not dependent on facilities are distinguished. A comparison illustrates the need for the place variable to be given a prominent position when marketing facility dependent <b>sport</b> <b>services.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This study, {{which is}} part of a wider {{research}} on the academic framework of sport management studies, will at-tempt to illustrate the evolution of the concept of <b>sport</b> <b>service</b> in this field. The research has been conducted using a corpus of definitions and explanatory material on the subject of <b>sport</b> <b>service</b> found in several Japanese publications related to sport management. The outcome of the study is summarized as follows. The term “sport service” has been widely used to refer to sport business ever since Udo first used the term “physical education service” in his 1970 book (Udo, 1970). In the late 1980 s, owing to the increasing devel-opment of <b>sport</b> industries, <b>sport</b> <b>service</b> {{came to be known as}} just one field within the wider sport industry, giving rise to the new concept of <b>sport</b> <b>service.</b> The success of the Japanese private sector’s involvement in sport industries led to a renewed interest in sport management and its related concepts as an academic discipline. As a result, the meaning of <b>sport</b> <b>service</b> shifted from the sport business itself to a market product offered by those businesses. If we focus on the con-cept of “service,” we see that although some sources defined <b>sport</b> <b>service</b> as a process in terms of an activi-ty-based approach, other sources based their use of the term on a characteristic-based approach, which ex-plains it as a product and the outcome of production. This illustrates the lack of an agreed conceptual definition. Moreover, attempts to organize the sport industry required consideration of the products produced by this in-dustry. Thus, the products generated by sport management came to be known as sport activities, and this recognition of sport activities as intangible assets led to them being considered as <b>sport</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
