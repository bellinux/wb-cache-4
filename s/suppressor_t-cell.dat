50|$|HLA DQ {{functions}} as a cell surface receptor for foreign or self antigens. The immune system surveys antigens for foreign pathogens when presented by MHC receptors (like HLA DQ). The MHC Class II antigens are found on antigen presenting cells (APC) (macrophages, dendritic cells, and B-lymphocytes). Normally, these APC 'present' class II receptor/antigens to a great many T-cells, each with unique T-cell receptor (TCR) variants. A few TCR variants that recognize these DQ/antigen complexes are on CD4 positive (CD4+) T-cells. These T-cells, called T-helper cells, can promote the amplification of B-cells which, in turn recognize a different portion of the same antigen. Alternatively, macrophages and other megalocytes consume cells by apoptotic signaling and present self-antigens. Self antigens, in the right context, form a <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> population that protects self tissues from immune attack or autoimmunity.|$|E

We demonstrate that loss of TcR alpha but not TcR beta mRNA was accompanied by the concomitant loss of suppressor bioactivity. Homologous transfection of TcR alpha cDNA into a TcR alpha- beta+ clone reconstituted both CD 3 -TcR expression and suppressor function. Furthermore, suppressor activity from TcR beta- variants was specifically absorbed by antigen and anti-TcR alpha antibodies, but not by anti-CD 3 or anti-TcR beta affinity columns. These data directly establish a role for the TcR alpha chain in <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> function and suggest that the TcR alpha chain is part of the antigen-specific TsF molecule...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of the immune system}} with its antigenic environment is governed in part by available recognition structures on its cellular elements, the T and B cells. The nature of the T-cell antigen receptor has recently been the subject of intense study. Evidence for V-gene products being involved in the cell surface T-cell receptor has primarily involved production of various anti-idiotypic antisera and investigation of their biological effects (1 - 4). Recently, we have utilized a different approach based on the genetic analysis of functional fine-specificity markers to provide evidence of VH control of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) l-reactive T-cell specificity in common with serum antibody against the same antigenic moiety (5). The {{purpose of the present study}} is to extend these observations to another functional class ofT cells, namely the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> population. The present experiments use three approaches to establish the idiotypic nature of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> antigen receptor.

T-cell-enriched suspensions collected 30 and 90 days into the infection (anergic donors) showed depressed transformation indexes after phytohemagglutinin and M. habana cytoplasmic protein antigen treatment in vitro. The corresponding B-cell mitogen (lipopolysaccharide) responses were not affected. Mixing experiments with T-cell-enriched suspensions from day- 90 M. habana-infected donors adoptively suppressed lymphocyte transformation by normal and day- 14 spleen cells. This effect could be ablated by anti-theta serum and complement treatment of the day- 90 cells, indicating that the lack of in vitro responsiveness to cytoplasmic protein antigen was mediated by a population of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> present in the heavily infected spleens. There was no evidence that similar cells were present in the spleens of the 14 -day-infected animals. <b>Suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> could be induced in vitro by exposure of day- 14 spleen cells to concanavalin A or M. habana cytoplasmic protein antigen before they were mixed with normal or day- 14 indicator splenic lymphocytes.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{condition was}} established in vivo for selectively eliminating hapten-reactive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity generated in mice primed with a para-azobenzoate (PAB) -mouse gamma globulin (MGG) -conjugate and treated with PAB-nonimmunogenic copolymer of D-amino acids (D- glutamic acid and D-lysine; D-GL). The elimination of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity with PAB-D-GL treatment from the mixed populations of hapten- reactive suppressor and helper T cells substantially increased apparent helper T-cell activity. Moreover, the inhibition of PAB-reactive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> generation by the pretreatment with PAB-D-GL before the PAB-MGG-priming increased the development of PAB-reactive helper T-cell activity. The analysis of hapten-specificity of helper T cells revealed that the reactivity of helper cells developed {{in the absence of}} suppressor T cells was more specific for primed PAB-determinants and their cross-reactivities to structurally related determinants such as meta-azobenzoate (MAB) significantly decreased, as compared with the helper T-cell population developed in the presence of suppressor T lymphocytes. In addition, those helper T cells generated in the absence of suppressor T cells were highly susceptible to tolerogenesis by PAB-D- GL. Similarly, the elimination of suppressor T lymphocytes also enhanced helper T-cell activity in a polyclonal fashion in the T-T cell interactions between benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) -reactive T cells and PAB- reactive T cells after immunization of mice with BPO-MGG-PAB. Thus inhibition of BPO-reactive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> development by the BPO-v-GL- pretreatment resulted in augmented generation of PAB-reactive helper T cells with higher susceptibility of tolerogenesis to PAB-D-GL. Thus, these results support the notion that suppressor T cells eventually suppress helper T-cell activity and indicate that the function of suppressor T cells related to helper T-cell development is to inhibit the increase in the specificity and apparent affinity of helper T cells in the primary immune response. The hapten-reactive suppressor and helper T lymphocytes are considered as a model system of T cells that regulate the immune response, and the potential applicability of this system to manipulating various T cell-mediated immune responses is discussed in this context...|$|E

To explore whether suppressor T cells regulate the heterogeneity of the anti-hapten response to Dnp conjugates of these polypeptides, various procedures aimed at reducing <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity were tested for their ability to alter the restricted isoelectric focusing spectrotypes. These procedures, such as adult thymectomy, administration of low doses of cyclophosphamide, and in vivo treatment with anti-I-J antisera, significantly increased the magnitude and heterogeneity of the anti-Dnp antibody response to Dnp-GLphi and Dnp-GLA in strains of mice that possessed responder Ir genes.

As to lymphocyte subsets, the proportions of CD 4 + cells had remained low, while those of CD 8 + cells high for a whole observation period after BMT. The changes of CD 4 + cells were caused by the decrease of suppressor-inducer T-cells (CD 4 + Leu 8 +). High proportion of CD 8 + cells was mainly associated with increased <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> (CD 8 + CD 11 +). Among natural killer (NK) cells, highly active NK cells (CD 16 + CD 57 -) markedly increased shortly after BMT, and gradually returned to normal.

The stimulation with DNP-MGG-PAB detected PAB-reactive helper T-cell activity, and this was measured by the increment of anti-DNP antibody responses of DNP-specific B cells in comparison with their responses in the presence of nonprimed normal cells. The PAB-reactive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity was detected in the above system by stimulation with DNP-KLH-PAB, and the activities were measured quantitatively by the reduction in anti-DNP antibody responses of DNP-specific B cells as compared with their responses in the presence of nonprimed normal cells. The T-cell nature of this hapten-reactive suppressor cell activity was established by its susceptibility to anti-Thy- 1 serum * Supported by grant-in-aids for Scientific Research from the Japanese government...|$|E
40|$|Normal {{mononuclear}} leukocytes were incubated with serum {{from patients}} with active {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) and healthy subjects and then studied on lymphoproliferative tests. Serum from SLE patients that contained an autoantibody to a subpopulation of thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes inhibited <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity induced with concanavalin A. These sera did not inhibit lymphoproliferative responses or suppression by monocytoid cells. Mitogen-activated suppressor cells were not inhibited with serum from SLE patients or healthy subjects lacking T-cell autoantibody.

40|$|Upon {{stimulation}} with anti-CD 3, <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> (Ts) hybridomas and homologous transfectants of T-cell receptor a (TCRalpha) cDNA in the T-cell hybridoma {{formed a}} 55 -kDa TCRalpha chain derivative that bound both the monoclonal anti-TCRalpha chain and polyclonal antibodies against glycosylation inhibiting factor (GIF). The peptide is a subunit of antigen-specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> factor (TsF), {{and is considered}} to be a posttranslationally-formed conjugate of TCRalpha chain with GIF peptide. The TCRalpha derivative is synthesized by the transfectant after stimulation with anti-CD 3, and not derived from TCR present on the cell surface. Stimulation of the stable homologous transfectants with anti-CD 3 induced translocation of the 13 -kDa GIF peptide into endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When a helper Ts hybridoma or a stable transfectant of the same TCRalpha cDNA in a helper cell-derived TCRalpha- clone was stimulated with anti-CD 3, translocation of GIF peptide was not detected, and these cells failed to secrete a TCRalpha derivative. However, further transfection of a chimeric cDNA encoding a procalcitonin-GIF fusion protein into the helper cell-derived stable transfectant of TCRalpha cDNA resulted in translocation of the GIF protein and formation of bioactive 55 -kDa GIF. The results indicated that translocation of GIF peptide through ER is unique for Ts cells, and that this process is essential for the formation/secretion of the soluble form derivative of TCRalpha chain by T cells...|$|E
40|$|Pretreatment of BALB/c mice with Corynebacterium parvum {{inhibited}} {{the induction}} of tolerance to the contact sensitizing agent 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene induced by intravenous injection of DNBSO 3. The suppressive effect on tolerance induction has further been analyzed by adoptive transfer experiments. Injection of C. parvum intraperitoneally (0. 7 – 2. 8 mg/mouse) before injection of the tolergen inhibited {{the generation of}} T-suppressor cells as shown by transfer of spleen cells from the tolerized donor to naive recipients. Pretreatment of the recipients of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> from tolerized animals with C. parvum also inhibited the function of these cells in the recipient animals. Time-kinetic experiments suggested {{that more than one}} mechanism appeared to be responsible for the tolerance induced by DNBSO 3; C. parvum (probably via activated macrophages) suppressed tolerance which is mediated by T-suppressor lymphocytes. These results suggest that T-suppressor lymphocytes may—similarly as T-helper cells—be modulated by an activated monocytic-phagocytic system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{effect of}} {{prostaglandin}} E 2 (PGE 2) on character-istics of splenic T-cells in tumor-bearing mice (TBM) was studied {{from the viewpoint}} of PGE 2 -mediated cell-recruitment system from the thymus to the spleen. The splenic T-cells of TBM enhanced tumor growth. In the TBM, the total number of thymocytes decreased, and the number of splenic T-cells concurrently in-creased. In adult thymectomized tumor bearers, these tumor growth-enhancing T-cells were absent in the spleen, and the number of splenic T-cells remained unchanged. Such <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> in the spleens of TBM may relate to recruitment of imma-ture T-cells from the thymus. The levels of PGE 2 in the plasma were depressed in the TBM. Replenishment by exogenous PGE 2 prevented both an increase in splenic T-cell population and an augmented generation of T-cells that had an enhancing effect on tumor growth. Our findings show that a low level of PGE 2 induce...|$|R
40|$|An {{impaired}} {{immune system}} and opportunistic infections are 2 main characteristics of the pathophysiology of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). This study therefore aimed at comparing immunophenotyping among healthy subjects (N= 35) and two subsets of CFS: patients with no Mycoplasma detected (N= 55) and patients with evidence of a Mycoplasma infection in their blood (N= 131). Immunophenotyping was performed using immunofluorescence with the appropriate combination of monoclonal antibodies. Mycoplasma detection (Myc. hominis, Myc. fermentans, Myc. pneumoniae and Myc. penetrans) was performed with forensic polymerase chain reaction on peripheral blood samples. Both patients groups presented with significantly elevated CD 25 + (activated) cells as compared to healthy volunteers. CFS patients without evidence of Mycoplasma infection had increased amounts of CD 5 + B-cells. Stepwise discriminant analysis indicated the number of activated cells, the number of memory CD 4 + cells {{and the percentage of}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> (lower in Mycoplasma+ patients as compared to Mycoplasma- patients) as the discriminant variables. A classifiaction tree, for predicting the presence of Mycoplasma species in CFS patients, was constructed. Taken together, these data confirm earlier reports on immun...|$|R
