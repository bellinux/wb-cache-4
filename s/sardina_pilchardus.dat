50|$|Fishing, {{including}} a seine fishery for pilchards (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus),</b> was {{a mainstay of}} the village's economy from at least the 16th century, there being a seine house recorded here in 1590. The village {{has been part of}} the Rashleigh family's Menabilly Estate from the late 16th century, and the estate built the half-moon quay in 1775 to help the seine netting company. The seine company was in decline in the 1870s and closed.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{types of}} fish {{comprise}} 75% of total {{catch in the}} Cap Blanc region (Mann & Lazier, 1996). Clupeids (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus,</b> the sardine, and Sardinella aurita) were the most abundant. S. pilchards dominate in the cooler northern waters while S. aurita are prevalent in warmer southern waters. Next most abundant were Jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and Redfish (Sparidae). Ansa-Emmin (1982) found that in 1974, the total fish landings reached 2.68 million tons. Nearly 1 million tons were Clupeidae with [...]67 million tons being sardines.|$|E

50|$|Fishing for sardela or sardina (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus)</b> on {{the coasts}} of Dalmatia and Istria began {{thousands}} of years ago. The region {{was part of the}} Roman Empire, then largely a Venetian dominion, and has always been sustained through fishing mainly sardines. All along the coast, many towns promote the age-old practice of fishing by lateen sail boats for tourism and on festival occasions. Today, industrial producers continue this tradition. Currently, the four factories of canned sardines are in Rovinj, Zadar, Postira, and Sali (the latter founded in 1905). Several famous dishes made with sardines include, for instance, komiška pogača (a pie with salted sardines and tomato sauce), saur or inšavor (sardines fried and then cooled, seasoned with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, black pepper and rosemary) and sardines roasted on stick from Sali, dugi otok.|$|E
50|$|There {{are more}} than 100 {{freshwater}} fish species, varying from the giant European catfish (in the Tagus International Natural Park) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes (along the western portion of country, for example). Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along {{the west coast of}} Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. Marine fish species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the sardine (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus),</b> tuna and Atlantic mackerel. Bioluminescent species are also well represented (including species in different colour spectrum and forms), like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe in some beaches.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two small}} coves {{to the east}} of, and {{sheltered}} by Gurnard's Head; Treen Cove and Rose-an-Hale Cove. In 1870 the Gurnard's Head seine fishery was worth an estimated £800 per year and employed twenty-four men with ten boats and two seines. The pilchards (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus)</b> were sold locally as fresh pilchards rather than salted and sold as fumadoes for the Mediterranean market. The Western Fishing Company was dissolved and their assets were auctioned on Monday, 28 June 1880. Included were the Account-house furniture, cellars, lofts and buildings used in the pilchard fishery {{as well as a}} launching platform in the cove. There were fourteen boats (senn boats, loaders and followers), a capstan, chain blocks and gear, large crane, stage and winch, 2 seans (seines nets), tuck net and stop net, circa 50 tons of French salt, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the representatives}} of science and {{commerce}} present had different views to Huxley. Their views were put forward by E. Ray Lankester, who summed up the scientific contributions in an essay on what we would now call ecology. He pointed out that [...] "it {{is a mistake to}} suppose that the place of fish removed from a particular fishing ground is immediately taken by some of the grand total of fish, which are so numerous in comparison with man's depredations as to make his operations in this respect insignificant...there is on the contrary evidence that shoal fish, like herrings, mackerel and pilchard (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus),</b> and ground-fish, such as soles and other flat-fishes, are really localised. If man removes a large proportion of these fish from the areas which they inhabit, the natural balance is upset and chiefly in so far as the production of young fish is concerned." [...] During this masterly address he went on to develop this theme and concluded with an appeal for the formation of a society to foster the study of marine life, both for its scientific interest and because of the need {{to know more about the}} life histories and habitats of food fishes. Professor Lankester envisaged that such a society would construct a laboratory close to the coast, with the building containing aquaria and apparatus for the circulation of seawater and, most importantly, laboratory accommodation for scientists. The appeal was answered by a group of eminent scientists, who resolved to form a society and build a laboratory on the British coast.|$|E

Mercury concentration in muscle and liver showed significant positive correlation with fish length (i. e. with age). The relative methylmercury concentration {{was high and}} constant in muscle (> 85 % MeHg), and was decreasing with age in liver (from 50 % to 20 %), which might reflect {{the existence of a}} slow demethylation process. From the geographic point of view, Hg concentration was similar in the northern and eastern areas (0. 32 µg g- 1 dw in muscle for Sardinella aurita, 0. 41 for <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus),</b> but significantly lower in the southern zone (0. 19 and 0. 26, respectively, median values).

40|$|Includes {{research}} findings and presentation. The {{aim of this}} paper was to compare the nutritional value of some low price fish (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus,</b> Engraulis encrasicholus, Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta, Mugil chepalus) to high price fish with high consumption rate (Sparus aurata, Merluccius merluccius, Dicentrarchus labrax). In general, the commercial values of several fish species in Greece was not always related with the nutritional value (proteins, lipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids). Despite the price differences, total lipid content is higher in eel (Anguilla anguilla) and grey mullet (Mugil chephalus), compared to other species. Moreover, concerning unsaturated fatty acid content, there are significant differences in favour of grey mullet and sardine (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus).</b> Differences in favour of eel are also reported for cholesterol, as well as differences in energy content in favour of eel and grey mullet. Absorption index for all species was higher than 0. 92. In conclusion, fish with very low price seem to have the same or higher nutritional and energy value, compared to highly priced fish...|$|E
40|$|Four {{seasonal}} {{surveys were}} {{carried out in the}} Gulf of Tunis between summer 2002 and spring 2003 to study the abundance and distribution of <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus</b> eggs and larvae in relation to environmental parameters. In the Gulf of Tunis, <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus</b> begins spawning in autumn (23 eggs/ 10 m²) and attains its peak in winter (257 eggs/ 10 m²) when the mean SST is lowest (13. 4 °C). Sardine reproduction seems to be triggered by the decrease in the SST. In winter, the main spawning areas were located to the south of Zembra Island and the north of Cape Bon. Larvae were more abundant in winter (38 larvae/ 10 m²), while lower densities were collected in autumn and spring (1 larva/ 10 m²). The highest abundance of larvae (288 larvae/ 10 m²) was recorded southwest of Zembra Island. Eggs and larvae were mainly concentrated in the relatively warmer and saltier waters with high zooplankton abundance and, inversely, with a low concentration of nitrate and chlorophyll a and a low diatom abundance...|$|E

40|$|Influence of season, lunar-tide {{cycle and}} tide on ichthyoplankton at the {{interface}} between Mondego estuary and the adjacent coast and on up-estuary transport was evaluated. Seasonal samples were collected at a fixed station {{at the mouth of}} the estuary during diel cycles, at neap and spring tides. Additionally, four sampling stations along the estuary were assessed. Pomatoschistus spp. was the main estuarine taxon, while <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus</b> and Parablennius pilicornis were the most important marine species. Ichthyoplankton entrance and transport along the estuary presented a seasonal pattern with higher densities during summer. Lunar-tide cycle also represented an important influence, structuring communities that reach the estuary and their subsequent distribution. Solea senegalensis and <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus</b> seemed to take advantage of spring tides to enter the estuary. S. pilchardus appear to be using tides to move upstream of the estuary. Ichthyoplankton entrance in the estuary seemed related to species spawning period, while its distribution within the estuary depends on in situ spawning and on the capacity of species to counteract currents and river flow. The present study provides a better understanding of ichthyoplankton dynamics at the interface of two coastal systems, reinforcing knowledge of the lunar-tide cycle influence on ichthyoplankton communities...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: In some routine {{studies of}} larval {{condition}} based on RNA:DNA ratios, heads and/or guts are removed for fur-ther age and feeding analysis. Also, during capture larvae are often found {{with their eyes}} missing. In this work we analysed tissues effects (muscle, head, eye, gut and the whole larvae) on RNA:DNA ratios from different species (<b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus,</b> Engraulis encrasicolus, Atherina presbyter and Paralichthys orbignyanus) in different developmental stages and from dif-ferent locations. For all species and development phases, it was shown that RNA:DNA ratios in the head were significantly lower than in muscle or gut. The comparison of RNA:DNA ratios of head with or without eyes did not show significant differences. In a comparison of results from muscle from two tail sections, RNA:DNA ratios were higher for the anterior sec-tion in <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus</b> and Engraulis encrasicolus larvae. Caution is needed when RNA:DNA ratios are compared with other studies employing different dissection protocols.

40|$|The {{immigrant}} S. commerson (Lac., 1802) represents {{more than}} 2 % of the total Egyptian catch and its distribution stretches from East to West along the Egyptian Mediterranean coast. The feeding habits of T. lepturus and S. commerson were investigated through stomach content analysis of specimens collected from Abu Qir Bay (Egypt) on a seasonal basis from November 1999 to January 2001 using daytime purse seines. The food content range of T. lepturus was wide, including Engraulis encrasicolus, Gobius spp., Sardinella aurita, <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus,</b> fish eggs, amphipods, copepods and shrimps. The main diet constituents of S. commerson included Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardinella aurita, <b>Sardina</b> <b>pilchardus</b> and shrimps. Seasonal variations of feeding activity indicated that food consumption was highest in spring to autumn for T. lepturus and in summer and autumn for S. commerson. The diet overlap in terms of number and weight between the two species was high. Food composition was related to fish size in both examined fishes. Small T. lepturus (less than 30 cm) fed mainly on crustaceans, while larger samples (more than 59 cm) fed only on fishes.
