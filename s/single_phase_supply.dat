5000|$|In a {{building}} with electricity it is normal for safety reasons to connect all metal {{objects such as}} pipes together to the mains earth to form an equipotential zone. This {{is done in the}} UK because many buildings are supplied with a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> cable where the neutral and earth conductors are combined. Close to the electricity meter this conductor is divided into two, the earth terminal and the wire going to the neutral busbar in the consumer unit. If the ground connection to the neutral is lost, all wiring and other objects tied to the neutral will be energized at the line voltage. Examples of articles that may be bonded include metallic water piping systems, gas piping, ducts for central heating and air conditioning systems, and exposed metal parts of buildings such as hand rails, stairs, ladders, platforms and floors.|$|E
5000|$|High-leg delta (also {{known as}} wild-leg, stinger leg, bastard leg, high-leg, orange-leg, or red-leg delta) {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} service connection for three-phase electric power installations. It is used when both single and three-phase power is desired to be supplied from a three phase transformer (or transformer bank). The three-phase power is connected in the delta configuration, and the center point of one phase is grounded. This creates both a split-phase <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> (L1 or L2 to neutral on diagram at right) and three-phase (L1-L2-L3 at right). It is called [...] "orange leg" [...] because when it is connected per the NEC, the high leg is marked with orange [...] "outer finish...or other effective means" [...] (usually tape). By convention, the high leg is usually set in the center (B phase) lug in the involved panel, regardless of the L1-L2-L3 designation at the transformer.|$|E

5000|$|In many European {{countries}} {{and other countries}} that use European systems, three phase service drops are often used for domestic residences. Using three phase power allows longer service drops to serve multiple residences, which is economical with the higher density of housing in Europe. Several slightly different voltage standards have been used: 220Y380, 230Y400 and 240Y415, with plans for future [...] "harmonization" [...] towards 230Y400. The service drop consists of three phase wires and a neutral wire which is grounded. Each phase wire provides around 230 V to loads connected {{between it and the}} neutral. Each of the phase wires carries 50 Hz alternating current which is 120° out of phase with the other two.Other countries, such as the UK and Republic of Ireland, generally provide a <b>single</b> <b>phase</b> and neutral per house, with every third house on the same phase.

40|$|A Smith Motor is a {{three phase}} {{induction}} motor that has shunt capacitors parallel to its induction coils.

Its limitation to operate properly for varying loads is its disadvantage. One way to solve this problem is to develop a control system that can change the capacitors to correspond with the different sets of loads.
