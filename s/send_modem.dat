At the same time, the receiving modem dropped the ACK packets being generated by the local computer's software, keeping the backchannel clear. Since the channel efficiency only became a major problem at speeds over 2400 bit/s, and modems able to run faster than that typically had significant processing power anyway, protocol spoofing was mostly associated with these higher speed systems.|$|R

Signal processors, such as four-phase modems, cannot change the DSR, but the modulation rate depends on the line modulation scheme, in accordance with Note 4. For example, in a 2400 bit/s 4-phase <b>sending</b> <b>modem,</b> the signaling rate is 2400 bit/s on the serial input side, but the modulation rate is only 1200 bauds on the 4-phase output side.|$|R

First, two pilot reference-phase rows (28-bits), then two speech vocoder rows (28-bits), and finally two more rows for the second speech vocoder frame (28-bits).

50|$|The 300 bit/s modems used audio {{frequency-shift}} keying to send data. In {{this system}} the stream of 1s and 0s in computer data is translated into sounds which can be easily sent on the phone lines. In the Bell 103 system, the originating <b>modem</b> <b>sends</b> 0s by playing a 1,070 Hz tone, and 1s at 1,270 Hz, with the answering modem transmitting its 0s on 2,025 Hz and 1s on 2,225 Hz. These frequencies were chosen carefully; {{they are in the}} range that suffers minimum distortion on the phone system and are not harmonics of each other.|$|R
50|$|Echo {{cancellation}} eliminated this problem. During {{the call}} setup and negotiation period, both <b>modems</b> <b>send</b> {{a series of}} unique tones and then listen for them to return through the phone system. They measure the total delay time and then set up a local delay loop to the same time. Once the connection is completed, they send their signals into the phone lines as normal, but also into the delay, which is inverted. The signal returning through the echo meets the inverted version coming from the delay line, and cancels out the echo. This allowed both modems to use the full spectrum available, doubling the speed.|$|R
50|$|A {{flurry of}} {{research}} activity ensued, and by 1990 the International Telecommunication Union had published modem {{standards for the}} first trellis-modulated modem at 14.4 kilobits/s (2,400 baud and 6 bits per symbol). Over {{the next several years}} further advances in encoding, plus a corresponding symbol rate increase from 2,400 to 3,429 baud, allowed modems to achieve rates up to 34.3 kilobits/s (limited by maximum power regulations to 33.8 kilobits/s). Today, the most common trellis-modulated V.34 modems use a 4-dimensional set partition—achieved by treating two two-dimensional symbols as a single lattice. This set uses 8, 16, or 32 state convolutional codes to squeeze the equivalent of 6 to 10 bits into each symbol the <b>modem</b> <b>sends</b> (for example, 2,400 baud × 8 bits/symbol = 19,200 bit/s).|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we experimented CCITT V. 42 bis MODEM by {{utilizing}} the voice line of the INMARSAT and the ordinate telephone line to send image data files as it costs more expensive to <b>send</b> by <b>MODEM</b> port speed 2400 bps. In this experiment we could only sent the experimental data by 4800 bps speed as INMARSAT did not work with 9600 bps. The throughput of MODEM port speed 4800 bps was 3. 5 ～ 4. 4 times faster for none compression files and 3. 7 ～ 6. 5 times faster for compression files than none protocol 2400 bps. The experiments on land voice line with 9600 bps were also 6. 8 ～ 7. 3 times faster for the former type of files and 7. 5 ～ 12. 7 times faster for the latter type of files. The cost of communication is inversely proportional to MODEM throughput. So, it is prefer to select 4800 bps with MODEM port speed for INMARSAT line and 9600 bps for land to land line to decrease the cost of communication. ﻿現在の陸上公衆回線で使用されているモデムの最高通信速度は 9600 bpsである。一般に 2 線式モデムでは,海事衛星においては 2400 bpsが使用されている。通信時間の短縮は,海事衛星では回線数が少なくラッシュ時,即時のアクセスが不能な時間帯を生じつつある。これらのことから限られた電波資源を有効に活用するためには短時間で大量のデータを処理する手法が必要である。今回のデータの伝送実験は,陸上局にパソコンホスト局を設置し実施した。海事衛星電話回線の質から見て当初予測した通り, 4800 bpsの速度が通信可能な上限で, 9600 bpsは使用できないことが確認できた。この 4800 bpsを用いた場合,通信コストは陸上回線間で約 1 / 4,陸船の海事衛星回線間で 1 / 2 以上節約されることになる。文字データについては,単純に計算しても 480 字/秒のデータをエラーフリーで陸船間で処理出来る。また,実際にはこの 3 倍程度の実効速度で伝送されるからTSS活用の際も焦燥感はないと思う。その他,陸上のホスト局と海上移動局の各種のデータ伝送が確実に実行できたことも今回の成果の一つであった...|$|R

The notional operating range of the acoustic modems used is 500 m. This research considers four candidate Seastar network protocols: Time division multiple access (TDMA) polling with and without Selective automatic repeat request (SRQ), and TDMA token ring with and without SRQ. The number of peripheral nodes, {{the layout of the}} nodes, and the noise level of the environment are modeled and evaluated, according to performance metrics, including data throughput, communications latency, and packet error rate. It was determined that in a low-noise environment, the token ring with SRQ protocol delivers the most throughput of data with the minimum number of dropped packets, while in high-noise conditions, polling with SRQ is preferred. In addition, if data throughput is not a priority, polling with SRQ is advantageous. Therefore, it is recommended that a switch be implemented for adaptively selecting the network protocol depending on the prevailing noise conditions and the critical performance metrics.

50|$|When a PPPoE-speaking DSL <b>modem</b> <b>sends</b> or {{receives}} Ethernet frames containing PPP + PPPoE payload {{across the}} Ethernet {{link to a}} router (or PPPoE-speaking single PC), PPP + PPPoE contributes an additional overhead of 8 bytes = 2 (PPP) + 6 (PPPoE) included within the payload of each Ethernet frame. This added overhead can mean that a reduced maximum length limit (so-called ‘MTU’ or ‘MRU’) of 1500 - 8 = 1492 bytes is imposed on (for example) IP packets sent or received, {{as opposed to the}} usual 1500-byte Ethernet frame payload length limit which applies to standard Ethernet networks. Some devices support RFC 4638, which allows negotiation for the use of non-standard Ethernet frames with a 1508-byte Ethernet payload, sometimes called ‘baby jumbo frames’, so allowing a full 1500-byte PPPoE payload. This capability is advantageous for many users in cases where companies receiving IP packets have (incorrectly) chosen to block all ICMP responses from exiting their network, a bad practice which prevents path MTU discovery from working correctly and which can cause problems for users accessing such networks if they have an MTU of less than 1500 bytes.|$|R
40|$|Following {{high winds}} on January 24, 2006, {{at least five}} people claimed to have seen or felt the {{superstructure}} of the Saylorville Reservoir Bridge in central Iowa moving both vertically and laterally. Since that time, the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) contracted with the Bridge Engineering Center at Iowa State University to design and install a monitoring system capable of providing notification of the occurrence of subsequent high winds.

Therefore, the Saylorville Reservoir Bridge was outfitted with an information management system to investigate the structural performance of the structure and the potential for safety risks.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and {{evaluate}} an algorithm using the weighted-majorization [10, 11] multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach for the localization of sparsely deployed sensors within the underwater environment. Based on extensive study of sensor localization in the radio frequency domain, the underpinning methodology can be broadly categorised into range-free and rangebased schemes [12]. Range-free schemes are effective in obtaining estimated positions for applications requiring limited accuracies but usually impose constraints on the flexibility of deployment. Range-based schemes are based upon the accurate measurements of Euclidean distances between the sensors, which can be derived from two-way ranging delays, time-of-arrivals, angles-of-arrival, or received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In the underwater environment, RSSI measurements are affected by multipaths and back-scattering especially in a shallow water environment such as in coastal waters or within a busy harbour. Also, acoustic modems generally operate within a frequency band that captures many external sources of noise, varying from shrimps [13] (in tropical waters) to breaking waves in a stormy weather [14], thus contributing to a high and fluctuating level of ambient noise. These factors can potentially lead to inconsistency in RSSI measurements. Similarly, measuring angles-of-arrival to a high accuracy may prove prohibitive unless every node is equipped with the necessary hydrophone array. The viable methods are therefore by using time-of-arrival measurements which require strict synchronization amongst all the nodes or by two-way ranging. The latter method requires no synchronization and operates by measuring the two-way propagation time assuming that the queried <b>modem</b> <b>sends</b> a reply packet after a fixed time-delay.|$|R
