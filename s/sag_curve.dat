The use of river quality model is very useful to predict the future condition using kinds of scenarios, so that the river environmental management can be formulated prior to the occurrence of pollution, environmental damage, or other disasters.

40|$|Incorporating {{safety in}} the design of a highway is one of the {{foremost}} duties of a design engineer. Design guidelines provide standards that help engineers include {{safety in the}} design of various geometric features. However, design guidelines are not frequently revised and do not accommodate for the frequent changes in vehicle design. One such example is the change in vehicle headlamps. These changes significantly impact the illuminance provided on the road and in turn the design formula. Roadway visibility is critical for nighttime driving. In the absence of roadway lighting, vehicle headlamps illuminate the road ahead of a vehicle. Sag vertical curve design depends on the available headlight sight distance provided by the 1 degree upward diverging headlamp beam. The <b>sag</b> <b>curve</b> design formulas were developed in the early 1940 s when sealed beam headlamps were predominant. However, headlamps have changed significantly and modern headlamps project less light above the horizontal axis. In this research, the difference in illuminance provided by sealed beam headlamps and modern headlamps was examined. For the theoretical analysis, three different sag curves were analyzed. On these curves, about 26 percent reduction in illuminance was observed at a distance equal to the stopping sight distance when comparing sealed beam to modern headlamps. A change in the headlamp divergence angle from 1. 0 degree to 0. 85 degree will provide the required illuminance on the road when using modern headlamps. A field study was performed to validate the theoretical calculations. It was observed that for modern headlamps, a divergence angle less than 1 degree and greater than 0. 5 degrees will provide illuminance values comparable to sealed beam headlamps. As a part of this research, a preliminary study, examining the impact of degraded headlamp lenses on the illuminance provided on sag vertical curves was conducted.

If the rectangular planes (the floating and transition spans) rotate relative to each other along hinge line DD’, the ends B and B’ of the wings will rise and the wings will rotate about their longitudinal edges, namely axes AB* and A’B’*, in order to maintain contact with the spans at points C and C'. As the wing ABC rotates, the arc will rotate about the chord line AB* so that it is no longer in the horizontal plane. The bearings that are placed along the arc, and the bearer bars that rest on them, will therefore move vertically. The bearer bars are free to slide transversely on the bearings through a limited distance, and the rails that rest on them adopt a vertically curved shape equal to the vertical component of the arc on the rotated wing. The bearings can be placed at any spacing on the wing, so any degree of support can be provided to the rails while forcing them to go through the desired vertical curvature. If the wings and bearer bars were infinitely stiff, the rails would be supported rigidly at each bearer bar and the vertical curve of the track would be the one defined by the rotated arc. In practice, they will have some flexibility, so the shape of the track will differ slightly from the idealized shape computed in the following sections.|$|R

Empirical observations show that, on freeways, traffic congestion often occurs at sags; actually, in some countries (e. g., Japan), sags {{are one of the most}} common types of freeway bottleneck. This thesis is the outcome of a research project funded by Toyota whose objective was to develop new concepts for traffic management at freeway sags based on a thorough understanding of the causes of congestion. The main scientific contributions of the thesis belong to the fields of traffic flow theory, modeling and control. The thesis contributes to the understanding of the causes of congestion at sags by analyzing empirical trajectory data and showing that the main cause is related to the fact that most drivers do not accelerate enough when they drive through this type of freeway sections. Also, the thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding and mathematical description of driving behavior on hilly freeways by proposing a new model that describes car-following behavior at sags more accurately than existing models. Furthermore, the thesis contributes to the field of traffic management by identifying new strategies to mitigate congestion at freeway sags. First, the thesis determines how vehicles equipped with in-car systems should ideally move at sags in order to minimize congestion by using an optimal control-based method. Second, the thesis proves the potential of mainline traffic flow control measures based on the use of variable speed limits by means of traffic simulation experiments. The findings and tools presented in the thesis can support policy makers, road authorities, traffic engineering and automotive companies in developing and evaluating specific traffic management measures to mitigate congestion at freeway sags.

40|$|Problem {{statement}} Sports teachers (and other users) often {{suffer from}} bad acoustics in sports halls. A survey revealed that most complaints are about tiredness, throat problems and hearing problems. Bad acoustics in sports halls are {{mainly caused by}} an uneven distribution of the sound absorbing material in a hall. Often, the roof absorbs most of the sound where the floor and walls up to 3 meter reflect most of the sound. This {{lower part of the}} walls needs to be strong, flat and hard to rebound balls. In this way, vertically reflected sound is being absorbed faster than horizontally reflected sound. This difference causes <b>sagging</b> Schroeder <b>curves</b> and therefore long reverberation times. Dutch standards for acoustics are mainly based on reverberation times, so <b>sagging</b> <b>curves</b> are unwanted. Besides the problem of the long reverberation times, another problem is found. Measurements show that sports halls constructed with stone-like materials absorb sound according to the expectations of the material properties. Sports halls constructed with perforated steel sound absorbing panels give different results. These panels seem to behave differently on sound absorption than expected. Especially low frequencies seem to be absorbed extremely well by the panels. The research question therefore is: ‘Why do perforated steel sound absorbing panels seem to behave differently in absorption coefficient in sports halls than expected from laboratory test results?’ Because this question is part of the larger subject ‘acoustics in sports halls’, it is necessary to investigate the acoustical behaviour of perforated steel panels for a broad demarcation of the subject. Approach In order to find an answer to the research question, two hypotheses are tested by measurements. The measurements are done in a laboratory and in a scale model. The results are analysed. The conclusions give insight in the sound absorbing behaviour of perforated steel sound absorbing panels. Besides that, the conclusions give guidelines to the design phase of this graduation project. Hypotheses: 1. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the shape of the panels causes sound absorption of parallel striking sound based on a phase shift principle. 2. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the backing construction has influence on the result. Laboratory measurements Absorption coefficient measurements are done in the reverberation room of the acoustical laboratory. Different samples of the roof structure are tested. By comparing the results, we get insight in the influence of different parts of the roof structure. Besides that, hypothesis one can be tested: the influence of the backing construction will become clear. Scale model measurements The scale model makes it possible to test the influence of different shaped roof structures in a small model. By using the same, reflecting material for all walls, we get insight in the influence of changes in roof shapes. Some of the roof structures are (partly) covered with a sound absorbing material to compare the results of those to the other variations. This research should give an answer to hypothesis two. Results The scale model measurement results show that profiled structures cause a considerable decrease in local sound pressure compared to a hard, flat surface. This decrease is largest for low frequencies. The surface with sound absorbing material on top causes the biggest decrease, which is caused by the sound absorption of the facing material. The ‘sound absorption by shape’ is caused by the phenomena of diffusion and interference. It is not visible in reverberation times (T 20), just in histograms and Schroeder curves. The laboratory measurements show that the influence of the thermal insulation layer; a part of the backing construction, is large on (low frequent) sound absorption. The rock wool panels give a high peak in the sound absorption graph for 100 Hz. This very good sound absorption is probably caused by the panel being its own panel-resonator and porous absorber in one. The influence of the ‘cannelurevulling’ is small, like the influence of the vapour barrier and different perforation degrees. Conclusions Perforated steel sound absorbing panels absorb more low frequent sound than expected. This good sound absorption is probably achieved by the profiled shape of the steel panels in combination with the backing thermal insulation. The profiled shape causes the effect of sound absorption caused by the effects of diffusion and interference. The backing construction absorbs {{a large part of the}} low frequent sound because the hard, stiff and heavy rock wool panels are probably a porous material and panel resonator in one. The research does not give strong guidelines to improve the roof structure. The gained knowledge is used in the design of a wall panel. The walls up to three meters are still the weakest link when talking about acoustics in sports halls. The designed panel should improve this situation.

The statistical analysis outcomes show that on the section at constant radius of the combined curves the V 85 is less or equal than that on the horizontal non-combined curves with the same radius. Results indicate that the suggestions by guidelines on the coordination of horizontal curves overlapping with crest and sag appear to be acceptable...|$|R
40|$|Several {{researches}} {{have pointed}} out that optical illusions may occur when the horizontal curve is combined with a vertical <b>curve.</b> Crest and <b>sag</b> combinations can cause a significant different driver’s behaviour compared to the behaviour adopted on the horizontal curves on flat grade. In particular the literature reports the hypothesis that horizontal curves appear sharper or flatter when overlapping with crest o <b>sag</b> vertical <b>curves,</b> respectively. This hypothesis was validated from studies on the visual perception of the road through the use of computer animation techniques. On the basis of these researches models were proposed to estimate the horizontal radius perceived on the combined curve {{as a function of the}} actual horizontal radius to evaluate the operating speed through 2 -D predicting models. A drawback of computer animation techniques though is that they are limited and not interactive. Interactive driving simulation systems, on the contrary, have high potentials for the analysis of the effects of the combined alignment. An experimental survey at the driving simulator of CRISS (Interuniversitary Research Center on Road Safety) was carried out in order to assess the driver’s behaviour on crest and sag combinations, compared to the behaviour on horizontal curve with the same radius but on flat grade. Two road alignments for the experiment were designed according to the technical Italian guidelines on the coordination of horizontal curves overlapping with vertical curves. One alignment had a flat longitudinal grade, the other had three crest combinations and three sag combinations but with the same horizontal alignment. The vertical grade on the approach tangent of each combined curve was flat in order to avoid the influence of the grade on driver’s behaviour. 35 drivers carried out two driving sessions at the simulator (one for each road alignment) during which the local speeds and the local lateral placement were recorded. On the crest combinations the result of statistical analysis of the speeds was entirely consistent with the hypothesis of perception on crest combinations: at beginning of the circular curve on the reference curves the speeds are greater than those on the correspondent crest combinations. Furthermore the outcomes of the unilateral Z-test showed that the differences between the speeds on reference curves and those on crest combinations tend to decrease as the curve radius increases. Also the influence of the crest vertical curve on the trajectory was clear: the mean deviations from the ideal trajectory at the beginning of the circular curve with radii medium and great were significantly higher on the crest combinations than the mean deviations recorded on the reference <b>curves.</b> On the <b>sag</b> combinations the speeds were not significantly higher (at 5...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author (1929) has calculated {{the order of}} death for organisms which are killed by the reaction of just one molecule in the cell, and also for organisms which require the reaction of 2, 3, 4 and more molecules before the cell is injured beyond recovery. It was shown that higher organisms follow the order of death as calculated for several reacting molecules, while bacteria, as a rule, follow the order computed for one reacting molecule per cell. This can be best illustrated graphically by plotting the logarithms of the survivors on a standard time scale where 100 units represent the time necessary to kill 99. 9 percent of the initial number of organisms. Fig. 1 shows a straight line when the reaction of one certain molecule in the organism causes its death; all other cases show {{a different type of}} curve, bulging out above the straight line. It has been further shown that the death rate of organisms computed from the formula 0. 434 K [...] _ 1 log _a t b (where a is the initial number of organisms, and b the number of survivors after the time t) is constant/or one reacting molecule, but increases steadily if more than one molecule reacts. While bacteria often show a constant death rate and a straight line survivor curve, it happens frequently that the death rate decreases and the survivor <b>curve</b> <b>sags</b> below the straight line (see dotted line in Fig. 1). Both these deviations indicate that this cannot be caused by more than one molecule reacting because the effect would have been just the opposite...|$|R
40|$|Deflectometry is a {{powerful}} metrology technique that uses off-the-shelf equipment to achieve nm-level accuracy measurement. This process is typically made by scanning lines of pixels or encoding the surface slopes information with phase using sinusoidal waves. Various measurement techniques exist, centroiding and phase-shifting being the most accepted, but their sensitivities vary with experimental conditions. We demonstrate solutions based on various parameters such as uncertainty or efficiency. The results are presented in a decision matrix and merit function. The parameters can be varied to represent various conditions. In particular, {{we are interested in}} using deflectometry in a context of fast, affordable and robust. Since none of the existing methods perform well under those parameters, we introduce a new method using binary patterns. Binary Pattern Deflectometry allows almost instant, simple and accurate slope retrieval, which is required for applications using mobile devices. We detail the theory of this new deflectometry method and the challenges of its implementation. Furthermore, the binary pattern method can also be combined with a classic phase-shifting method to eliminate the need of a complex unwrapping algorithm and retrieve the absolute phase, especially in cases like segmented optics where spatial algorithms have difficulties. Finally, whether it is used as a standalone or combined with phase-shifting, the binary patterns can, within seconds, calculate the slopes of any specular reflective surface. However there is no portable device to quickly measure eyeglasses, lenses, or mirrors. To complete the study, we present an entirely portable new deflectometry technique that runs on any Android™ smartphone with a front-facing camera. Our technique overcomes some specific issues of portable devices, like screen non-linearity or automatic gain control (AGC). We demonstrate our application by measuring an amateur telescope mirror and simulating the faulty Hubble Space Telescope primary mirror. In both cases, the application found the same amount of aberrations that were measured with an interferometer. Our technique can, in less than a minute, measure the <b>sag</b> errors of <b>curved</b> surfaces smaller than 50 nm RMS, simply using a smartphone...|$|R
