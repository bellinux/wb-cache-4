60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--I {{am having}} {{a good deal of}} trouble with Missouri matters, and I now sit down to write you {{particularly}} about it. One class of friends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in regard to arrests, banishments, and assessments. As usual in such cases, each questions the other's motives. On the one hand, it is insisted that Governor Gamble's unionism, at most, is not better than a <b>secondary</b> <b>spring</b> of action; that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand before Unionism with him. On the other hand, it is urged that arrests, banishments, and assessments are made more for private malice, revenge, and pecuniary interest than for the public good. This morning I was told, by a gentleman who I have no doubt believes what he says, that in one case of assessments for $10,000 the different persons who paid compared receipts, and found they had paid $30,000. If this be true, the inference is that the collecting agents pocketed the odd $20,000. And true or not in the instance, nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the making and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses. Doubtless the necessity for the making of the system in Missouri did exist, and whether it continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very important question. Some days ago Governor Gamble telegraphed me, asking that the assessments outside of St. Louis County might be suspended, as they already have been within it, and this morning all the members of Congress here from Missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same thing. Now, my belief is that Governor Gamble is an honest and true man, not less so than yourself; that you and he could confer together on this and other Missouri questions with great advantage to the public; that each knows something which the other does not; and that acting together you could about double your stock of pertinent information. May I not hope that you and he will attempt this? I could at once safely do (or you could safely do without me) whatever you and he agree upon. There is absolutely no reason why you should not agree.|$|E

5000|$|Cuneo has a {{temperate}} sub-continental climate, {{with cold}} winters and hot, dry summers.

The rainfall pattern {{is similar to}} that of Turin, with two maxima—one primary and one <b>secondary</b> (<b>spring</b> and autumn) and two minima (summer and winter).

40|$|The typical {{model of}} the damped {{mechanical}} oscillator is the simple spring, fixed at one end, with a mass attached to the other. Air resistance is assumed to provide a retarding force which {{is proportional to the}} object's velocity. The equation of motion is easily solved and the solution is often employed to describe a variety of physical phenomena. In this work, a different model of radiation damping is considered for the spring-mass system. The (primary) spring is considered to possess mass. Air resistance is neglected, but an infinitely long (secondary or radiation) spring is considered to be attached to the mass. Thus, if the mass is set in motion, the infinite spring is excited and energy is carried out of the system. The mechanical wave in the <b>secondary</b> <b>spring</b> is analogous to radiation, and is referred to as mechanical radiation. Thus, while the mathematics of this system is more involved than that of the traditional damped oscillator, the model provides a more realistic description of radiation damping. The damping factor and frequencies are calculated for various choices of system parameters. The results of the calculation are generally consistent with expectation. Damping is clearly exhibited, and the frequencies are lowered by the damping. Damping is more important for the lower modes...|$|E
40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{plays an}} {{increasingly}} {{important role in the}} global biogeochemical cycle of reactive nitrogen as well as in aerosol formation and climate. We present extensive and nearly continuous global ammonia measurements made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) from the Aqua satellite to identify and quantify major persistent and episodic sources as well as to characterize seasonality. We examine the 13 year period from September 2002 through August 2015 with a retrieval algorithm using an optimal estimation technique with a set of three, spatially and temporally uniform a priori profiles. Vertical profiles show good agreement (~ 5 – 15 %) between AIRS NH 3 and the in situ profiles from the winter 2013 DISCOVER-AQ field campaign in central California, despite the likely biases due to spatial resolution differences between the two instruments. AIRS captures the strongest consistent NH 3 emissions from the anthropogenic (agricultural) source regions, such as, South Asia (India/Pakistan), China, the US, parts of Europe, SE Asia (Thailand/Myanmar/Laos), the central portion of South America, as well as Western and Northern Africa. These correspond primarily to croplands with extensive animal feeding operations and fertilizer applications where a summer maximum and <b>secondary</b> <b>spring</b> maximum are reliably observable. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH) regular agricultural fires contribute to a spring maximum. Regions of strong episodic emissions include Russia and Alaska as well as parts of South America, Africa, and Indonesia. Biomass burning, especially wildfires, dominate these episodic NH 3 emissions...|$|E

40|$|We {{apply the}} Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) {{chemistry}} and transport model driven by NASA's MERRA assimilated meteorological data {{to simulate the}} seasonal variations in two radionuclide aerosol tracers (terrigenous 210 Pb and cosmogenic 7 Be) at the WMO-GAW station of Mt.  Cimone (44 ° 12 ′ N, 10 ° 42 ′ E; 2165  m a. s. l.; Italy), which is representative of free-tropospheric conditions most of the year, during 2005 with an aim to understand the roles of transport and precipitation scavenging processes in controlling their seasonality. The total precipitation field in the MERRA data set is evaluated with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) observations, and generally good agreement is found. The model reproduces reasonably the observed seasonal pattern of 210 Pb concentrations, characterized by a wintertime minimum due to lower 222 Rn emissions and weaker uplift from the boundary layer and summertime maxima resulting from strong convection over the continent. The observed seasonal behavior of 7 Be concentrations shows a winter minimum, a summer maximum, and a <b>secondary</b> <b>spring</b> maximum. The model captures the observed 7 Be pattern in winter–spring, which {{is linked to the}} larger stratospheric influence during spring. However, the model tends to underestimate the observed 7 Be concentrations in summer, partially due to the sensitivity to spatial sampling in the model. Model sensitivity experiments indicate a dominant role of precipitation scavenging (vs. dry deposition and convection) in controlling the seasonality of 210 Pb and 7 Be concentrations at Mt.  Cimone...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for singular weapon systems to fill multiple roles. A fire control group system is needed which provides a trigger that is adaptable for different uses on command {{by way of the}} safety selector. The device needs to be non-intrusive to normal function and operation of the firearm requiring no specialized training in its use. It should provide with a setting for a general combat use and a secondary setting for a designated marksman role. The proposed system interfaces with existing trigger groups by using a self-contained drop in module that counteracts the primary trigger spring while set to the second fire mode. By using a <b>secondary</b> <b>spring</b> to counteract the primary spring the end result is essentially a lower k value on trigger movement reducing the trigger pull weight. A survey of commonly available triggers shows a range of trigger pull values for combat triggers to be 5 - 7 lbf and marksman triggers to be 3. 5 - 5 lbf. From this data it is concluded that the module should provide a 1. 5 lbf reduction in trigger pull force when engaged in the second fire position. This provides a singular fire control group system that has the ability to serve in both a general combat and designated marksman role. The characteristics of the entire system may still be tailored to personal preference by the selection of the trigger group the device interfaces with...|$|E

The presented railway carriage model comprises of front and rear simple conventional bogies with two leading and trailing wheelets attached to each bogie. The railway carriage is modeled by 31 degrees of freedom which govern vertical displacement, lateral displacement, roll angle and yaw angle dynamic response of wheelset whereas vertical displacement, lateral displacement, roll angle, pitch angle and yaw angle dynamic response of carbody {{and each of the}} two bogies. Linear stiffness and damping parameters of longitudinal, lateral and vertical primary and secondary suspensions are provided to the railway carriage model.

40|$|This study investigates a novel {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} shock isolation. The questions considered are whether friction produces a better performance in terms of reduced response during a shock compared to viscous damping and a lower residual response after the shock. To gain physical insight, a single degree of freedom model with friction applied to the isolated mass is analysed. It serves as a benchmark to the performance of a two degree of freedom model where friction is applied to a secondary mass. The isolation system performance is then quantified. For the two degree of freedom system with an intermediate <b>secondary</b> <b>spring</b> which connects the primary and secondary mass, it is possible to obtain the reduction in the displacement response as good as the single degree of freedom system {{and at the same time}} smoother acceleration response compared to the single degree of freedom system. For the purpose of further improvement, a control strategy is introduced to switch on and off friction in both models depending on some response parameters and this is compared to the passive systems. This is the semi active control strategy where friction is changed within a cycle of vibration (discontinuous). The control strategy provides more displacement reduction to ensure the maximum displacement response is much smaller than the base input which cannot be obtained with the passive systems. The practical implementation and experimental validation is presented only for the first stage of the response during the shock. For the practical implementation of the switchable friction, an electromagnet is applied to separate the friction surfaces. Good agreement with the simple theoretical models for both passive and switchable systems is obtained. The reduced displacement and smooth acceleration response were obtained from the experiments with the system used to represent the two degree of freedom model. The issues and limitations in the practical implementation are identified and discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|A {{three year}} field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the role of soil inversion, cover crops and spring tillage methods for Palmer amaranth between-row (BR) and within-row (WR) management in glufosinate-resistant cotton. Main plots were two soil inversion treatments: fall inversion tillage (IT) and non-inversion tillage (NIT). Subplots were three cover treatments: crimson clover, cereal rye or none (i. e., winter fallow); and the sub subplots were four <b>secondary</b> <b>spring</b> tillage methods: disking followed by (fb) cultivator (DCU), disking fb chisel plow (DCH), disking fb disking (DD) and no tillage (NT). Averaged over years and soil inversion, the crimson clover produced maximum cover biomass (4390 kg ha&# 8722; 1) fb cereal rye (3698 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and winter fallow (777 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Two weeks after planting (WAP) and before the postemergence (POST) application, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were two- and four-times less, respectively, in IT than NIT. Further, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were reduced two-fold following crimson clover and cereal rye than following winter fallow at 2 WAP. Without IT, early season Palmer amaranth densities were 40 % less following DCU, DCH and DD, when compared with IT. Following IT, no spring tillage method improved Palmer amaranth control. The timely application of glufosinate + S-metolachlor POST tank mixture greatly improved Palmer amaranth control in both IT and NIT systems. The highest cotton yields were obtained with DD following cereal rye (2251 kg ha&# 8722; 1), DD following crimson clover (2213 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and DD following winter fallow (2153 kg ha&# 8722; 1). On average, IT cotton yields (2133 kg ha&# 8722; 1) were 21 % higher than NIT (1766 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Therefore, from an integrated weed management standpoint, an occasional fall IT could greatly reduce Palmer amaranth emergence on farms highly infested with glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth. In addition, a cereal rye or crimson clover cover crop can effectively reduce early season Palmer amaranth emergence in both IT and NIT systems. For effective and season-long control of Palmer amaranth, one or more POST applications of glufosinate + residual herbicide as tank mixture may be needed in a glufosinate-based cotton production system...|$|E

There is no difference statistically significant at the level (0. 50) between the average scores of the experimental group who were studying cognitive planning organizations and the average score of the control group who were studying in the usual way in achievement in the subject of the history of Arab-Islamic civilization. To validate these hypotheses the researcher conducted experiment lasted an entire semester, as has been the adoption of the following actions: Was chosen as the experimental design (with a partial seizure) of two unequal, one experimental and the other officer, a post test for collection and testing prior and subsequent to measure the tendency of history, and was limited this research to students fourth grade literary in (<b>secondary</b> <b>spring)</b> for girls of the General Directorate for Educational Babil province to be room for implementation search experience has been the school randomly selected and consisted of 84 female students from the fourth grade literary academic year (2015 - 2016 m), and by (42) students in both the experimental group who has studied the history using the teaching of cognitive organizations planning strategy, and the control group, which I studied history using the usual way. It has rewarded the two sets of research in some of the variables that might have an impact in the independent variable (chronological age measured in months - the collection {{of the students in the}} history of the half-year (2015 - 2016) - the former information Test in history -althesel school for parents - IQ test) as well as adjust the other variables for the safety research note that the researcher has taught two groups of research and identified scientific article last six doors, of a history book for fourth grade literary academic year (2015 - 2016) m, also identified behavioral objectives in the cognitive domain and numbered (115) target behaviorally, it was also prepared necessary for the two sets of search lesson plans (experimental and control), as for research tools researcher has prepared a test of the two sets of search are from (50), paragraph (40) items of multiple choice (10) paragraphs of type pans.

In light of these results the researcher concluded that cognitive organizations planning to adopt a strategy has a positive effect on achievement and the development tendency in history, and in the light of this, the researcher recommended several recommendations, including: - 1. The need for training courses in public Directorates of Education for teachers based on the employment of modern methods and strategies in the teaching of history, including cognitive organizations planning strategy that had proved effective. 2.
