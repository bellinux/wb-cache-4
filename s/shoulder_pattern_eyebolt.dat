40|$|It {{is being}} argued that Head and <b>Shoulders</b> {{technical}} price <b>pattern</b> although it occurs seldom {{it is worth}} to trust. In this Paper we use the Brownian motion to generate time series of different characteristics (drift, volatility) and we apply on them a matlab script for {{the identification of the}} head and <b>shoulders</b> <b>pattern.</b> After ensuring that the aforementioned technical pattern is being identified in random generated time series, we look for the profitability of the pattern through three different trading strategies. In a mechanism, like Brownian motion, of producing time series in a “random” way we should not expect to be able to forecast the further evolution of the price. On the beginning our results show that we come up to a fair game, which means that we cannot profit from the strategies used as a whole. Examining each strategy separately, looking at the way the variables, drift and volatility rate, affect the returns, and after taking into account general rules and principles of TA, the question we bring into discussion is whether investors selectively focus on specific profitable cases of the Head and <b>Shoulders</b> <b>pattern.</b> This results in the misleading conclusion that the pattern is seldom observed but profitable.

40|$|Starting from an adapted {{version of}} Osler and Chang (1995) methodology, this article empirically evaluates the {{profitability}} of investment strategies based on identification of the Head and <b>Shoulders</b> chart <b>pattern</b> in the Brazilian stock market. For that purpose, several investment strategies conditioned by {{the identification of the}} Head and <b>Shoulders</b> <b>pattern</b> (in its basic and inverted forms) by a computer algorithm in daily price series of 30 stocks from January 1994 to January 2009 were defined. Confidence intervals consistent with the null hypothesis that no strategies with positive returns can be based only on historical data were constructed using the Bootstrap sample inference technique in order to test the predictive power of each strategy. More specifically, the mean returns obtained by each strategy when applied to the stock’s price series were compared to those obtained by the same strategies when applied to 1. 000 artificial price series - for each stock - generated in a parametric manner, by an E-GARCH, and in a nonparametric one. Overall, our results show {{that it is possible to}} create strategies conditioned by the occurrence of Head and Shoulders, with positive returns, which indicates that these patterns can capture from stock historical prices some signals about their future price trend that makes possible to create profitable strategies. Nevertheless, the same conclusions are not valid for the pattern in its inverted form and when the effects of taxes and transaction costs are considered, depending on their magnitude, neither in its basic form. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Post-stroke {{shoulder}} pain is {{a common}} phenomenon in hemiplegia and impedes rehabilitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify a possible relationship between post-stroke shoulder pain, scapula resting position and shoulder motion. Methods: Shoulder kinematics of 27 patients after stroke (17 men) were compared with 10 healthy age-matched control subjects. Using an electromagnetic tracking device, the kinematics of both the contralateral and ipsilateral (i. e. paretic and non-paretic) arm during active and passive abduction and forward flexion were measured and expressed in Euler angles. Results: Scapular lateral rotation relative to the thorax was increased in patients with post-stroke shoulder pain compared with both patients without post-stroke shoulder pain and control subjects at rest as well as during arm abduction and forward flexion. Additionally, glenohumeral elevation was decreased in patients with post-stroke shoulder pain during passive abduction. No differences were found regarding scapula position (displacement relative to the thorax). Conclusion: In patients with post-stroke shoulder pain a particular kinematical <b>shoulder</b> <b>pattern</b> was established, characterized by enhanced scapular lateral rotation and diminished glenohumeral mobility. © 2008 The Authors.

40|$|The sole use {{of price}} and related summary {{statistics}} in a technical trading strategy is an anathema to weak-form market efficiency. In practice, however, traders actively use technical analysis to make investment decisions which makes this an important, but often neglected, area for study. This thesis includes four empirical chapters, which provide important {{evidence on the}} profitability of technical trading. The results from the detailed analysis undertaken in this thesis have broad relevance to both academics {{and those in the}} investment community. Existing research has been predominantly confined to evaluating basic technical trading rules, such as moving averages. Crucially, this ignores chart patterns. Widely employed by practitioners, such patterns form a vital part of technical analysis. As the most important price pattern, the head and <b>shoulders</b> <b>pattern</b> is subjected to detailed and thorough examination in this thesis. A significant contribution is made by evaluating formations recognised and used by traders, in sharp contrast to limited existing studies. Furthermore, a new method is developed to establish how quickly profits from a head and shoulders strategy decay, which has important implications for traders. Existing research has identified both reversal and relative strength effects in financial asset returns. A key separator between these two findings is the formation and holding time over which portfolios of winners and losers are evaluated. Motivated by this, a very large sample of ultra high-frequency data is used to investigate intraday momentum and reversal effects. As well as being an important contribution to research in this field, the results are, once again, of relevance to practitioners. The need for further research into technical analysis is clearly demonstrated by point and figure charting. Whilst traders have made consistent use of the technique for around a century, the amount of existing research is extremely small. Point and figure has attractive data filtering properties, clear trading rules and is particularly suited to intraday technical analysis. Again, using a very large sample of high-frequency data, a detailed evaluation of the profitability of a point and figure trading strategy is undertaken.

The haptic perception of force direction and magnitude has mostly been studied in discrimination tasks {{in the direction of}} gravity. In our study, the influence of physical force direction on haptic perception of force magnitude and direction was studied in the horizontal plane. Subjects estimated the direction and magnitude of a force exerted on their stationary hand. A significant anisotropy in perception of force magnitude and direction was found. Force direction data showed significant subject-dependent distortions at various physical directions. Normalized force magnitude data showed a consistent elliptical pattern, with its minor axis pointing roughly from the subject's hand to his/her <b>shoulder.</b> This <b>pattern</b> could be related to arm stiffness or manipulability patterns, which are also ellipse-shaped. These ellipses have an orientation consistent with the distortion measured in our study. So, forces in the direction of highest stiffness and lowest manipulability are perceived as being smaller. It therefore seems that humans possess a 'sense of effort' rather than a 'sense of force,' which may be more useful in everyday life. These results could be useful in the design of haptic devices. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The {{high demand}} {{on the upper}} {{extremity}} during manual wheelchair use contributes to a high prevalence of shoulder pathology in people with spinal cord injury. The overall purpose of this thesis was to investigate <b>shoulder</b> muscle recruitment <b>patterns</b> and wheelchair kinetics in able-bodied participants over a range of daily activities and mobility tasks requiring manual wheelchair propulsion. With a complete understanding of the muscle recruitment patterns, physiotherapists and wheelchair users can improve rehabilitation protocols and wheelchair propulsion performance to prevent shoulder pathology and maintain comfort during locomotion. Motor unit recruitment patterns were examined first during isometric and isotonic contractions to determine if spectral properties from EMG and MMG {{could be related to}} the different motor units in biceps brachii by using wavelet techniques coupled with principle component analysis. The results indicated that motor unit recruitment patterns can be indicated by the spectral properties of the EMG and MMG signals. EMG activity of 7 shoulder muscles was recorded with surface electrodes on 15 able-bodied participants over a range of manual wheelchair propulsion activities. Wavelet and principle component analysis was used to simultaneously decompose the signals into time and frequency domain. There are three main conclusions that can be drawn: 1) Uphill and faster speed (1. 6 m/s) propulsion required higher activity levels in the shoulder muscles and greater resultant joint force than did slow speed propulsion on the ergometer (0. 9 m/s), thus potentially resulting in shoulder pathology. 2) Prolonged wheelchair propulsion and greater muscle activity may result in fatigue and play a factor in the development of shoulder pain and pathology over time. 3) The instructed semicircular pattern has a positive effect on <b>shoulder</b> muscle recruitment <b>patterns.</b> Further investigations need to focus on a systematic integrated data collection and analysis of kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography (EMG) data from people with spinal cord injuries...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Shoulder {{impingement}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common presentations of shoulder joint problems 1. It appears to be caused by a reduction in the sub-acromial space as the humerus abducts between 60 o - 120 o – the 'painful arc'. Structures between the humeral head and the acromion are thus pinched causing pain and further pathology 2. Shoulder muscle activity can influence this joint space but it is unclear whether this is a cause or effect in impingement patients. This study aimed to observe muscle activation patterns in normal and impingement shoulder patients and determine if there were any significant differences. Method: 19 adult subjects were asked to perform shoulder abduction in their symptomatic arm and non-symptomatic. 10 of these subjects (age 47. 9 ± 11. 2) were screened for shoulder impingement, and 9 subjects (age 38. 9 ± 14. 3) had no history of shoulder pathology. Surface EMG was used to collect data for 6 shoulder muscles (Upper, middle and lower trapezius, serratus anterior, infraspinatus, middle deltoids) which was then filtered and fully rectified. Subjects performed 3 smooth unilateral abduction movements at a cadence of 16 beats of a metronome set at 60 bpm, and the mean of their results was recorded. T-tests were used to indicate any statistical significance in the data sets. Significance was set at P< 0. 05.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the assumption that}} <b>shoulder</b> kinematic <b>patterns</b> of the ipsilateral, nonparetic shoulder in hemiplegia are similar to kinematics recorded in a healthy population. Design: Case control study of {{a convenience sample of}} ten patients with hemiplegia due to stroke in the subacute phase compared with a control group of similar age. Three-dimensional positions of the scapula and humerus were measured and expressed in Euler angles as a function of active arm elevation in the frontal and sagittal plane and during passive humeral internal/external rotation at an elevation angle of 90 degrees in the frontal and sagittal plane. Results: Compared with controls, in the ipsilateral shoulder of patients, we found both a statistically significant diminished scapular protraction during elevation in the sagittal plane (35 ± 5 vs. 51 ± 8 degrees at 110 degrees of humeral elevation) and humeral external rotation during arm elevation in the frontal plane (51 ± 7 vs. 69 ± 14 degrees at 110 degrees of humeral elevation). Maximal passive humeral external rotation was found to be impaired in the frontal (64 ± 13 vs. 98 ± 14 degrees) and sagittal planes (65 ± 11 vs. 94 ± 12 degrees). In addition, there was significantly diminished anterior spinal tilt during humeral internal rotation (- 5 ± 10 vs. - 20 ± 9 degrees) and diminished posterior spinal tilt during external rotation in the frontal plane (- 14 ± 8 vs. - 3 ± 6 degrees). Maximal thoracohumeral elevation in patients was significantly impaired (126 ± 12 vs. 138 ± 8 degrees). Conclusion: Clear kinematic changes in the ipsilateral shoulder in patients with hemiplegia were found, indicating underlying alterations in muscle contraction patterns. The cause remains speculative. These results suggest that the ipsilateral shoulder should not be considered to function normally beforehand. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation range of motion in the dominant shoulders of baseball pitchers compared to their non-dominant arms. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} these changes {{may be the result of}} an osseous adaptation in the form of proximal humeral retroversion. The purpose of this study was to investigate <b>shoulder</b> flexibility <b>patterns</b> in high school baseball pitchers and possible correlations to fastball velocity and pitching experience. Methods: Thirty-nine high school baseball pitchers were examined. Dominant and non-dominant shoulder external rotation and internal rotation ranges of motion were measured in 90 ° of abduction using a standard inclinometer. Fastball velocity was measured using a JUGS radar gun. Results: Mean external rotation in the dominant arms (121. 85 °, SD 11. 43 °) was significantly greater than that found in the nondominant arms (111. 54 °, SD 11. 56 °) (p =. 0002). In contrast, mean internal rotation on the dominant side (73. 00 °, SD 12. 91 °) was significantly less than that exhibited on the non-dominant side (81. 74 °, SD 14. 77 °) (p =. 0051). The mean total arc of motion (external + internal rotation) between dominant (194. 36 °, SD 15. 72 °) and non-dominant arms (193. 64 °, SD 14. 77 °) was not significantly different (p =. 84). No correlation was found between dominant shoulder external rotation and fastball velocity or years of pitching experience. Discussion and Conclusion: The high school baseball pitchers in this study demonstrated a pattern of increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation in their dominant shoulders compared to their non-dominant shoulders, but the total arcs of motion were symmetrical. These flexibility patterns may be indicative of the osseous adaptation of proximal humeral retroversion and may not necessarily represent pathological changes in soft tissue structures about the shoulder complex as has been previously postulated...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Movement {{analysis}} of the shoulder joint requires a system capable of analysing a complex interplay of movements in six degrees of freedom. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the three dimensional kinematics of asymptomatic shoulders, shoulders with anterior instability and influence of surgical stabilization on kinematics. Materials and Methods: Kinematic data and clinical scores were obtained from nine asymptomatic individuals who served as the control group. Data was also obtained from five patients with recurrent anterior instability who were awaiting stabilization surgery before and at least six months after arthroscopic stabilization and rehabilitation. Abduction in coronal plane, abduction in the scapular plane, forward flexion and circumduction movements were assessed. Results: Unstable shoulders demonstrate a significant decrease in the range of movement when the shoulder is abducted in the coronal plane (p= 0. 002). There is a significant decrease in the area covered by the circumducting arm in instability when the movements are referenced to the trunk (p= 0. 002). Forward flexion (p= 0. 33) and scaption (p= 0. 075) remain unaffected in instability. Surgical stabilization failed to influence a significant change in any of the pre operative kinematic parameters [Abduction in the coronal plane (p= 0. 673), abduction in the scapular plane (p= 0. 733), forward flexion (p= 0. 992) or circumduction (p= 0. 214) ]. There was {{a significant difference in the}} clinical scores between the control group and the patients with anterior instability (Constant score; p= 0. 03, Oxford instability score p= 0. 001). The Oxford instability scores demonstrated a significant improvement after surgical intervention (p= 0. 011), whereas the Constant score did not change (p= 0. 58). Conclusions: This study describes <b>shoulder</b> motion <b>patterns</b> using a non-invasive motion tracking system, which is capable of dynamic movement data capture in six degrees of freedom. There are significant differences in the kinematic characteristics and clinical scores between patients with anterior instability as compared to shoulders in healthy volunteers and the kinematic characteristics are not restored to normal after surgical stabilization and rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Aberrations in <b>shoulder</b> {{movement}} <b>patterns</b> {{are believed}} {{to be associated with the}} presence of shoulder symptoms. However, the detection of movement aberrations has not been rigorously investigated. It is possible that manipulative physiotherapists use the clinical history to prejudge the existence of aberrations, rather than the actual observation of the movement pattern itself. There is a need to determine whether physiotherapists, in the absence of a clinical history, can relate observed anomalies of shoulder movement to the presence of symptoms and to determine the reliability for observation of such anomalous shoulder movement. Methods The sample comprised of 9 symptomatic subjects recruited from four physiotherapy clinics in Christchurch, New Zealand and a further 11 asymptomatic subjects recruited from Christchurch's general population. They were videotaped performing shoulder flexion, abduction, and scapular plane abduction. The video-recordings were evaluated by 11 manipulative physiotherapists who did not know which subjects were symptomatic and who were thus required to judge the symptomatic status as: asymptomatic, symptomatic left, symptomatic right or symptomatic both. Additionally, each physiotherapist completed a survey on each of the 20 subjects regarding the type of movement anomaly that was perceived (e. g. too much scapular elevation, too little glenohumeral movement, etc). Classification accuracy (percentage of correct responses) and agreement (?) among physiotherapists were computed. Results Out of the 220 responses by the physiotherapists regarding symptomatic status, 58 % were correct, with 68 % asymptomatic, 71 % symptomatic left and 30 % symptomatic right subjects correctly classified. Reliability analysis showed ? statistics for all subjects was 0. 23, for asymptomatic subjects 0. 22, symptomatic left 0. 34, and symptomatic right 0. 17. Only five subjects had two or more evaluators agree on the type of anomalous movement. Conclusions Although movement analysis is considered an integral part of a physiotherapist's skill this research has shown that a sample of experienced manipulative physiotherapists had difficulty in determining the symptomatic status of patients with clinically diagnosed shoulder complaints by movement analysis alone.

50|$|The quagga is {{believed}} to have been 257 cm long and 125 - 135 cm tall at the <b>shoulder.</b> Its coat <b>pattern</b> was unique among equids: zebra-like in the front but more like a horse in the rear. It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of polymorphism, with some individuals having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly. It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing mane with brown and white stripes.The only quagga to have been photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five photographs of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed that this is an optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. Embryological evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.|$|R
