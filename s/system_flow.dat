25|$|Full-Flow Filtration — Full-flow {{filtration}} continuously strains particulates out of {{the entire}} <b>system</b> <b>flow.</b> For example, in a 100-ton system, the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal/min. A filter would be selected to accommodate the entire 300 gal/min flow rate. In this case, the filter typically is installed after the cooling tower on the discharge side of the pump. While this is the ideal method of filtration, for higher flow systems it may be cost-prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|Mass flow meters: The {{equations}} {{required for}} calculating rates of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production {{assume that the}} flow rates {{into and out of}} the chambers are known exactly. We use mass flow meters which have the advantage of yielding flow rates independent of temperature and air pressure. Therefore, these flow rates can be considered to be corrected to standard conditions (Standard Temperature Pressure). We only measure and control flow at one location—downstream from the chamber. Therefore, we must assume that the inflow and outflow rates are identical. However, during construction of the respirometry <b>system,</b> <b>flow</b> rate must be measured at all steps, across all connections, to verify integrity of flow.|$|E

The control role of aquifer <b>system</b> to groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> is a key of study of the {{structure of}} groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>system.</b> The groundwater systems of the Ordos basin are analyzed as a case study. The control role of aquifer <b>system</b> to groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> is studied by comparison of groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> under the control of different aquifer structures in 2 -D profile numerical model. The research shows that the groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> of the Ordos basin have the multilayer structure characteristics. The groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> in the north of the Ordos basin show a cross-formational multi-hierarchy nested flow pattern in the northern aquifer systems without regional impermeable layer where the hydraulic connection between aquifer layers is closely. While, the hydraulic connection is discontinuous in the southern aquifer systems because there are regional impermeable layers in the aquifer <b>systems.</b> The groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> in the south of the Ordos basin show a follow-formational flow pattern...|$|R

The time-accurate simulations consistently over-predicted the hydrodynamic performance according to expecta-tions, but demonstrated strong dependency on particular CFD aspects: The strictness of the numerical convergence and {{the changes in the}} inflow and outflow configurations have a con-siderable effect on the <b>system's</b> <b>flow</b> behavior.

The semipermanent reflector is made up of eight separate pieces of beryllium, four of which are referred to as control-rod access plugs. Each control-rod access plug contains two unlined irradiation facilities, designated CR-1 through CR-8. Each of these facilities accommodates an experiment capsule similar to those used in the small removable beryllium facilities. The vertical centerlines of all control-rod access plug irradiation facilities are located 12.68 in. (32.2 cm) from the vertical centerline of the reactor. Only non-instrumented experiments can be irradiated in these facilities. When not in use, these facilities contain beryllium plugs.
