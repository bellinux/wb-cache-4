40|$|FCTESTNET (Fuel Cell Testing and Standardization Network) is {{an ongoing}} European network project within {{framework}} program 5. It is a three-year project that commenced 2003, with 55 partners from European research centers, universities, and industry, working in the fuel cell field. The main objective of FCTESTNET is to promote the harmonization of testing procedures and methodologies within the European Union. The lack of standardized test methods for fuel cell technology is a fact. The development of standardized test methods {{is very important for}} the commercialization of the fuel cell technology. Standardized test methods {{are one of the most}} important instruments in the quality management work of any industrial process. The players that have a common interest to promote and develop harmonized test methods for fuel cell technology are - Standardization bodies (IEC and ISO) - Fuel cell manufacturing industry (type testing and routine testing) - OEMs (acceptance testing) - Research institutes and universities (R&D) The current work presents one of the core results from the FCTESTNET project, namely a proposal of a harmonized testing format for fuel cell techuology. The harmonized testing format has been developed based on a testing model that was proposed in the initial phase of FCTESTNET. The testing model describes the common process steps in testing and has been a valuable tool to communicate testing activities and develop test format within the network. The testing model describes testing in general and fuel cell testing in particular. It is a three-step model. The first step is the planning step and comprises the listing of standardized test methods and other references that are required for the execution of any specific testing activity. The second step of the testing model is the testing execution, which is where the actual testing is carried out. The result of the testing execution is here referred to as <b>test</b> <b>output</b> data or <b>test</b> <b>output.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>output</b> is analysed and compared with input data from the planning step and finally reported in the third step, that is the evaluation step. Some examples of specific test inputs, in the context of fuel cell testing, are temperature, vibration, fuel flow, rain, etc. Examples of specific <b>test</b> <b>outputs</b> are current, voltage, gas emissions, heat, degradation, etc. In professional testing, the internal function of the test object is of secondary importance. The object is to be treated as a "blackbox". It is the <b>test</b> <b>output</b> and the <b>test</b> result that are of primary importance. Based on terminology originating from the testing madel,such as test object, <b>test</b> inputs, <b>test</b> <b>outputs,</b> etc, a harmonized testing format has been developed and proposed. The key terms in the harmonized testing format are test programme and test module. The test programme is defined as a programme comprising two or more test modules. A test module is a test method defined as the variation of one single test input for example the <b>testing</b> of power <b>output</b> as function of ambient temperature. Furthermore, a test module comprises the objectives, the scope, the test input varied, the <b>test</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>tested,</b> test object class (fuel cell, fuel cell stack or fuel cell system), test procedure, test report, etc. JRC.

Method: During the research we used Janda' s (2004) functional spine tests and muscle tests, that were applied to selected group of three tennis players. The set of compensatory exercises was designed {{on the basis of}} the results of the admission testing. The players were asked to follow this set of exercises with regularly for the period of three months. The selected individuals underwent <b>output</b> <b>testing</b> at the end of the exercise programme. We compared the results of the admission and <b>output</b> <b>testing</b> for the evaluation of the influence of the compensatory exercises of the musculo-skeletal system on the selected subjects. Results: The results that are presented in charts and graphs evaluate the influence of the compensatory ecercises of the musculo-skeletal system on the selected subjects. The results prove that due to regular performance of compensatory exercises we can expect a reduction of muscle shortening and weakening. The muscle shortening in knee flexors and strengthening of the blade muscles occurred at the first of three selected subjects. The second subject' s measured [...] ...|$|R
