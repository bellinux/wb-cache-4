40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{operational}} formulation of General Relativity similar in spirit to existing operational formulations of Quantum Theory. To do this we introduce an operational space (or op-space) {{built out of}} scalar fields. A point in op-space corresponds to some nominated set of scalar fields taking some given values in coincidence. We assert that op-space is the space in which we observe the world. We introduce also a notion of agency (this corresponds {{to the ability to}} <b>set</b> <b>knob</b> settings just like in Operational Quantum Theory). The effects of agents' actions should only be felt to the future so we introduce also a time direction field. Agency and time direction can be understood as effective notions. We show how to formulate General Relativity as a possibilistic theory and as a probabilistic theory. In the possibilistic case we provide a compositional framework for calculating whether some operationally described situation is possible or not. In the probabilistic version we introduce probabilities and provide a compositional framework for calculating the probability of some operationally described situation. Finally we look at the quantum case. We review the operator tensor formulation of Quantum Theory and use it to set up an approach to Quantum Field Theory that is both operational and compositional. Then we consider strategies for solving the problem of Quantum Gravity. By referring only to operational quantities we are able to provide formulations for the possibilistic, probabilistic, and (the nascent) quantum cases that are manifestly invariant under diffeomorphisms.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} {{autonomic}} computing {{is the ability}} to identify, separate and automatically tune parameters related to performance, security, robustness and other properties of a software system. Often the response to events affecting these properties consists of adjusting tuneable system parameters such as table sizes, timeout limits, restart checks and so on. One can think of these tuneable parameters as a <b>set</b> of <b>knobs</b> that can be tweaked or switched to adapt the system to environmental or usage changes. In many ways these tuneable parameters correspond to the switches and potentiometers on the control panel of many hardware devices. While modern software systems designed for autonomic control may make these parameters easily accessible, in legacy systems they are often scattered or deeply hidden in the software source. In this paper we introduce Software Tuning Panels for Autonomic Control (STAC), a system for automatically re-architecting legacy software systems to facilitate autonomic control.

40|$|INTRODUCTION All {{aspects of}} human-computer interaction, from the {{high-level}} concerns of organizational context and system requirements to the conceptual, semantic, and syntactic levels of user interface design, are ultimately funneled through physical {{input and output}} actions and devices.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a <b>set</b> of <b>knobs</b> and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time.

40|$|Abstract—Many applications, {{especially}} those that run on servers, are I/O intensive and therefore require high-performance storage systems. These high-end storage systems consume {{a large amount of}} power, the bulk of which is due to the disk drives. Optimizing disk architectures is a design-time, as well as a run-time, issue, and requires performance and power trade-offs. A hard disk designer needs to balance between the disk rotational speed (rotations per minute, RPM), platter sizes, and the number of platters. The RPM and platter sizes affect performance, and all three have an impact on power. A data center manager might have specific energy budgets within which she has to extract as much performance as possible. Applications themselves may have specific optimization requirements. Therefore, there are different figures of merit, such as performance and energy, and a large space of design and runtime “knobs ” {{that can be used to}} optimize disk drive behavior. Given such a large space, it is desirable to have a systematic methodology to optimally <b>set</b> these <b>knobs</b> to satisfy the figures of merit as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we present the Sensitivity-based Optimization methodology for Disk Architectures (SODA), which leverages results previously obtained in digital circuit design optimization scenarios.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In recent times, large high-dimensional {{datasets}} have become ubiquitous. Video and image repositories, financial, and sensor data {{are just a}} few examples of such datasets in practice. Many applications that use such datasets require the retrieval of data items similar to a given query item, or the nearest neighbors (NN or k-NN) of a given item. Another common query is the retrieval of multiple sets of nearest neighbors, i. e., multi k-NN, for different query items on the same data. With commodity multi-core CPUs becoming more and more widespread at lower costs, developing parallel algorithms for these search problems has become increasingly important. While the core nearest neighbor search problem is relatively easy to parallelize, it is challenging to tune it for optimality. This {{is due to the fact}} that the various performance-specific algorithmic parameters, or “tuning knobs”, are inter-related and also depend on the data and query workloads. In this paper, we present (1) a detailed study of the various tuning knobs and their contributions on increasing the query throughput for parallelized versions of the two most common classes of high-dimensional multi-NN search algorithms: linear scan and tree traversal, and (2) an offline auto-tuner for <b>setting</b> these <b>knobs</b> by iteratively measuring actual query execution times for a given workload and dataset. We show experimentally that our auto-tuner reaches near-optimal performance and significantly outperforms un-tuned versions of parallel multi-NN algorithms for real video repository data on a variety of multi-core platforms. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 201...|$|R
