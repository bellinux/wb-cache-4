Subbable was originally created as a crowdfunding system to continue the production of CrashCourse at the termination of the 2-year Google grant that funded the project.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a channel {{allocation}} algorithm of MSAP(Mobile <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Access</b> Point) and data delivery scheme exploiting the symbol level network coding. The network {{is comprised of}} TS(Tactical Switch) as a backbone node, MSAPs, and TMFTs(Tactical Multi-Function Terminal). The TS performs the channel allocation considering the communication range overlapping between the neighboring MSAPs and applies the symbol level network coding, if necessary, depending on {{the position of the}} TMFTs. Assuming the number of available antennas of TMFT and MSAP will be extended to two from one, we propose two schemes: single mode and dual mode. Through the simulation, we show that the proposed delivery scheme provides higher delivery ratio and lowe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—Pervasive Computing is {{also called}} as Ubiquitous Computing, which means “being present {{everywhere}} at once ” or “constantly encountered”. The main idea behind making these pervasive computing systems {{is that these}} systems improve living by performing computations on their own, without having to be monitored by anyone. These systems are targeted to become invisible to the user i. e., they perform their tasks without the user’s knowledge. To achieve this environment, the underlying requirement is a Network. One of the biggest constraints in achieving this environment is the “Last Mile ” problem. It refers to {{the last leg of}} delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer. In recent years there has been increasing interest shown in wireless technologies for <b>subscriber</b> <b>access,</b> as an alternative to traditional twisted-pair local loop...|$|E
