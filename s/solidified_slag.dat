40|$|During the {{refining}} process of silicon, oxygen-enriched air {{is used to}} react with foreign substances in the molten metal. We consider several subproblems of this process. First we calculate the heat budget by considering possible heat gains and losses due to chemical reactions, solidification of metal etc. The problem of solidifying metal on the walls is formulated and solved with the method of similarity solutions. Some numerical results are given. Concerning the forming of a crater at the gas inlet, we consider both the model of solidifying metal and the model of <b>solidifying</b> <b>slag.</b> A possible implementation for the moving boundary problem ("Stefan problem") is given as well. 1 Introduction A division of the Elkem metallurgical company, Elkem Meraker, manufactures silicon (Si).

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to study material processes that depend on the interaction between fluids with a large discontinuity in thermophysical properties. A base model capable of solving equations of mass, momentum, energy conservation, and solidification has been altered to enable tracking of the interface between two immiscible fluids and correctly predict the interface deformation using a volume of fluid (VOF) method. Two materials processes investigated using this technique are Electroslag Remelting (ESR) and plasma spray deposition. ^ ESR is a secondary melting technique that passes an AC current through an electrically resistive slag to provide the heat necessary to melt the alloy. The simulation tracks the interface between the slag and metal. The model was validated against industrial scale ESR ingots {{and was able to}} predict trends in melt rate, sump depth, macrosegregation, and liquid sump depth. In order to better understand the underlying physics of the process, several constant current ESR runs simulated the effects of freezing slag in the model. Including the <b>solidifying</b> <b>slag</b> in the imulations was found to {{have an effect on the}} melt rate and sump shape but there is too much uncertainty in ESR slag property data at this time for quantitative predictions. ^ The second process investigated in this work is the deposition of ceramic coatings via plasma spray deposition. In plasma spray deposition, powderized coating material is injected into a plasma that melts and carries the powder towards the substrate were it impacts, flattening out and freezing. The impacting droplets pile up to form a porous coating. The model is used to simulate this rain of liquid ceramic particles impacting the substrate and forming a coating. Trends in local solidification time and porosity are calculated for various particle sizes and velocities. The predictions of decreasing porosity with increasing particle velocity matches previous experimental results. Also, a preliminary study was conducted to investigate the effects of substrate surface defects and droplet impact angle on the propensity to form columnar porosity. ...|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{temperature}} and chemistry are correct, the steel is tapped out into a preheated ladle through tilting the furnace. For plain-carbon steel furnaces, as soon as slag is detected during tapping the furnace is rapidly tilted back towards the deslagging side, minimising slag carryover into the ladle. For some special steel grades, including stainless steel, the slag is poured into the ladle as well, to be treated at the ladle furnace to recover valuable alloying elements. During tapping some alloy additions are introduced into the metal stream, and more lime is added {{on top of the}} ladle to begin building a new slag layer. Often, a few tonnes of liquid steel and slag is left in the furnace in order to form a [...] "hot heel", which helps preheat the next charge of scrap and accelerate its meltdown. During and after tapping, the furnace is [...] "turned around": the slag door is cleaned of <b>solidified</b> <b>slag,</b> the visible refractories are inspected and water-cooled components checked for leaks, and electrodes are inspected for damage or lengthened through the addition of new segments; the taphole is filled with sand at the completion of tapping. For a 90-tonne, medium-power furnace, the whole process will usually take about 60-70 minutes from the tapping of one heat to the tapping of the next (the tap-to-tap time).|$|E
40|$|International audienceElectroSlag Remelting (ESR) {{is widely}} used to produce high added value alloys for {{critical}} applications (aerospace industry, nuclear plants, etc.). In collaboration with Aubert & Duval, Institut Jean Lamour has been developing for several years a numerical transient model of an ESR heat. In the previous version of the model, the crucible {{was assumed to be}} perfectly electrically insulated from the electrode-slag-ingot system.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of zinc-containing wastes {{is an important}} sustainability issue facing the metallurgical and wider community as these materials maypose environmental problems and problems related {{to a lack of}} storage space. Major sources of these materials at present are zinc leach residues and electric arc furnace (EAF) dusts, the latter originating from steel recycling practice. The development of technologies that provide technical and economic solutions to the processing of these materials remainsan ongoing problem. One of the technologies currently used to process zinc-containing wastes is zinc slag fuming which relies on the reduction and volatilization of zinc from a molten slag bath. Zinc fuming processes can provide technical and economical solutions to the treatment of zinc-containing residues if they realize high zinc fuming rates. It is now clear as a result ofextensive industrial experience and a number of studies that high process temperatures (about 1350 °C), low oxygen partial pressures and good mixing of the molten bath are essential to obtain high fuming rates down to low zinc concentrations in the slag. High operating temperaturesdrastically shorten the lifetime of refractory linings in conventional zinc fuming furnaces. These limitations may be overcome through the use of water-cooled freeze linings on the smelting reactors, that is a stationary layer of solidified material formed at the inside of the furnace wall as a result of external cooling of the reactor wall. The use of water cooling is characterized by specific challenges in relation to the control of heat losses of the process, the thickness of the freeze lining and the safety of the operations. This Ph. D. text describes a new mathematical model to assist in the optimization of zinc fuming processes, enabling enhanced fuming rates to beachieved whilst maintaining the integrity of the smelting vessel. The model is applied to a new submerged-plasma zinc fuming process. In subsequent chapters, two aspects of the model are further investigated. First,the properties of slag freeze linings in stationary conditions are investigated experimentally. In these experiments, slag freeze layers are produced by <b>solidifying</b> <b>slag</b> onto an air-cooled probe. Second, the heat transfer assumptions in the model are further investigated and integrated into an extended zinc fuming model.

A strong correlation between {{the composition of the}} slags in terms of amount of acidic oxides (SiO 2, Al 2 O 3) and basic oxides (CaO, FeO) and the volatility was determined.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} LIBS technique considering the rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of metallurgic slag was the main objective of the particular thesis. Firstly, the LIBS technique applied on pure metals and then on samples containing the same metals in CaO matrix and the time-resolved characteristics of the plasmas produced by nsec and psec pulses were studied. Both the plasma temperature and electron density are decaying similarly and the space-averaged values determined in the nanosecond case are slightly higher than for the picosecond one. Moreover, the calibration curves obtained, show that the inherent sensitivity of the technique remains almost unaltered independently of the pulse duration. The detection limits {{were found to be}} few ppm. Then, the potentiality of LIBS method for quantitative on-line, multi-element slag analysis on plant scale was examined. Further, in order to examine more closely the produced slag, slag samples were analysed in the laboratory. The measurements were performed on <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> samples in a pelletized form and on as delivered <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> samples. The limits of the accuracy of this technique depend mainly on the laser spot/phase size ratio, the level of surface abnormalities and the distribution of each element in the matrix. The non-homogeneity level of the slag product seems to be not important in LIBS analysis, when the above ratio is quite large. It is of great importance whether the element is embedded in the matrix or in a specific crystallized phase. The influence of surface abnormalities is reduced in the case of pressed slag, but primarily for the elements distributed in the matrix, fragmentation of the slag should be avoided. The accuracy of LIBS quantitative slag analysis is strongly dependent on the standard samples that are used Regarding the liquid slag analysis, the calibration curves presented satisfactory linear dependence between the intensity of analytic lines with the corresponding concentrations while the intensity values of liquid slag appeared to be relatively increased with regard to the intensity values of solid slag under the same experimental conditions. Widening phenomena were characterized the lines of certain elements in liquid slag. For concentrations > 4 - 5 % an increased slope in calibration curves of liquid slag was observed. Finally, it was observed that each element behaves in a different way from sample in sample but also from phase in phase. ...|$|E
40|$|An iron {{silicate}} (fayalite) based slag {{is formed}} in the secondary copper smelting process. This slag contains substantial amount of ZnO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 and minor components such as Na 2 O, PbO, MgO and Cr 2 O 3. This slag is of great importance to the copper smelting process and the entire production loop. The phase relations and the viscosity of the slag system at the smelting condition influences the process in both kinetic and thermodynamic ways. The cooling process has {{a great impact on}} the final microstructure of the <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> and further affects the following slag valorization applications. It is reported by the copper recycling industry that the copper smelting slag often has a high viscosity which may lead to problems in slag tapping. In the present study, the copper slag was observed in-situ with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). It was found that solid precipitation at the tapping temperature is the main reason of the increasing viscosity. In order to solve this problem, the phase relations in the industrial slag system ZnO-“FeO”-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO (CaO/SiO 2 = 0. 05, Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 = 0. 15) were investigated by quenching samples after reaching equilibrium at 1423 K (1150 °C) under iron saturation. The equilibrium composition of the phases was determined with electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). The effect of individual components, such as FeO, ZnO and CaO on the phase equilibrium of the slag system has been quantitatively studied. A high temperature rheometer system has been employed to study the rheological behavior of the industrial slag with iron saturation. Non-Newtonian behavior has been observed and the effect of the major components (FeO, ZnO and CaO) on the rheological property of the slag system has been investigated. The crystallization behavior of both ZnO containing slag (FeO-ZnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO, FeO/SiO 2 = 2, ZnO = 9 wt. %, Al 2 O 3 = 5 wt. %, CaO = 1 wt. %) and ZnO free slag (FeO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO, FeO/SiO 2 = 1. 6, Al 2 O 3 = 5 wt. %, CaO = 1 wt. %) under various cooling rates was observed in-situ by CLSM. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams were constructed. The influence of the individual components of the slag, e. g. FeO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 on the crystallization behavior of the fayalite slag was systematically studied via water quenching experiments followed by a detailed EPMA-WDS micro-chemical analysis. Industrial scale experiments were carried out to study the cooling process of the copper smelting slag. The slag was cooled in an iron pot, a copper mold, a steel plate and quenched with water flow. XRF, XRD and EPMA were employed to characterize the slag. The cooling process was simulated with the software COMSOL, the temperature profile and the cooling rate were calculated. The relation between the cooling history and the microstructure of the <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> was investigated.

Detonation cord is used in commercial boilers to break up clinkers (<b>solidified</b> coal ash <b>slag)</b> adhering to tube structures. Also a vertical centered cord being lowered into the water of a drilled well can remove any clogging that obstructs water flow. Higher-yield detonating cord can be used to cut down small trees, although the process is very uneconomical compared to using bulk explosive, or even a chainsaw. High-yield detonating cord placed by divers has been used to remove old dock pilings and other underwater obstructions. Creating a slipknot from detonating cord yields a field-improvised device that can be quickly employed to cut a locked doorknob off a door. Detonation cord can be taped in several rings to the outline of a military man-sized target and detonated, breaching a man-sized hole into wooden doors or light interior walls. Detonating cord is also employed directly in building demolition where thin concrete slabs need be broken via channels drilled parallel to the surface, an advantage over dynamite since a lower minimum of explosive force may be used and smaller diameter holes are sufficient to contain the explosive. Anything much more substantial than these uses requires the use of additional explosives.|$|R
40|$|The UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ freeze lining concept {{combines}} wall cooling {{with carbon}} and graphite refrac-tories of higher thermal conductivities to “chill ” the refractory lining by transferring {{heat from the}} refractory lining. Effective sidewall water cooling, together with {{the efficiency of the}} heat dissipating conductive refrac-tories, lowers the temperature of the lining to below that of the molten process materials. This causes a layer of slag and process metal to solidify or “freeze ” and form a protective “skull ” which completely coats the refractory hot face. Once formed, the slag skull insulates the refractories, reducing heat loss and protect the lining from erosion, chemical attack, thermal shock, and other stresses. The result: extended life and greatly improved refractory performance. The Ilmenite smelting process depends on the presence of a <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> skull to protect sidewall refrac-tory material from chemical attach by molten slag. No known refractory material is able to withstand this corrosive material. To date, UCAR has not applied their Chill Kote ™ technology in the ilmenite smelting industry. This paper revolves around the results obtained from conducting an ilmenite smelting campaign on a 500 kW DC open-arc furnace with a UCAR designed refractory system.

40|$|Ilmenite is a titanium-rich ore, and {{accounts}} {{for almost all}} the world's consumption of titanium bearing minerals. One of the main uses of titanium is as powdered TiO 2, used extensively as whitening pigment. The {{first step in the}} process of making TiO 2 pigment, is reducing the ilmenite to a titanium-rich slag. The titanium slag consists mainly of a titanium phase on the form of M 3 O 5. The elements Fe, Mn and Mg can substitute Ti in the M 3 O 5 lattice, and the slag also contains impurities such as SiO 2, CaO, Al 2 O 3, Cr 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5. The slag needs to be purified and processed to make the pigment end product. This thesis focuses on the stage after reducing the ilmenite to a titanium-rich slag, and before the further purification of the slag. To get {{a better understanding of the}} properties of the solid slag after reduction in the blast furnace, both industrially collected and experimentally prepared samples have been analyzed. It is believed that the cooling rate and access to oxygen of the slag during solidification will influence the microstructure of the <b>solidified</b> <b>slag.</b> This gives arise to differences both in grain size and shape, but also the phases present. Samples were collected from the industrial plant Tizir Titanium & Iron in Tyssedal, Norway. Slag samples prepared at the university were made by controlling temperature during solidification, and the properties of the samples were linked to those of the slags from the industrial plant. Slag cross-sections were analyzed using BSD images and EDS spectra from the electron microscope. Phases in the slags were analyzed with X-ray diffraction. A theoretical review of thermal analysis for the slags was conducted. The main titanium phases identified were pseudobrookite and rutile.

40|$|Titania slag is a {{feedstock}} to {{the pigment}} industry, {{which in turn}} provides titania pigment to producers of everyday products like paper, cosmetics and toothpaste. Titania slag is the primary product of the pyrometallurgical process of ilmenite smelting – the other products being iron and CO gas. Titania slag is typically tapped from the furnace into blocks of approximately 20 tons. After cooling these blocks are crushed and milled to size fractions suitable for the processes of the pigment producers. These processes are broadly grouped into two types of technology: the chloride route (during which titania slag is reacted with chlorine and subsequently re oxidised thereby removing the impurities) and the sulphate route (in this process the titania slag is purified after dissolving the slag in sulphuric acid). Due {{to the nature of}} these two processes, several specifications are imposed {{on the quality of the}} titania slags. The fluidised-bed technology used in the chloride process limits the size distribution of the slag to between 106 µm and 850 µm. Ilmenite smelting industries consequently crush and mill the titania slag to below 850 µm. The fraction below 106 µm is then sold to the sulphate market. Since the coarser chloride grade product is the more valuable product, slag producers continuously strive to improve the ratio between the coarser and finer fractions. This study reports on parameters which influence the particle size distribution of titania slags and therefore the split between the coarser (more valuable) and finer (less valuable) products. Pilot-scale slag ingots were used to identify chemical and process variables which influence the yield of coarser material. The microstructure of as-cast and milled slag was examined, and indicated a role of silicate phases in the crushing behaviour. Industrial-scale slag ingots were used to test whether the roles of tapping rate and water cooling (as identified from the pilot-scale ingots) also applied under industrial conditions. A numerical method was applied to estimate the thermal conductivity of the <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> (from measurements on pilot-scale ingots), and to predict the cooling and solidification behaviour of industrial-scale ingots.

Four processes were observed; both direct current electrode positive (DCEP) and direct current electrode negative (DCEN), as well as alternating current (AC) at 600 A and DCEP with a higher current at 1000 A. The videos show an erratic droplet transfer {{with a lot of}} spatter that was caught by the cavern walls and directed into the weld pool. Additionally, flux was molten {{at the top of the}} cavern close to the electrode and merged into the droplet that was still attached to the wire.

40|$|During the {{reprocessing}} of spent Material Test Reactor (MTR) {{fuel elements}} from research reactor DIDO a radioactive waste solution is produced. Besides the radiotoxical elements, the waste solution contains aluminium from the cladding material of {{the spent fuel}} element and sodium hydroxide which {{is given to the}} acidic waste solution to reach a pH value between 12 and 13. After the neutralisation, the waste solution is <b>solidified</b> in a <b>slag</b> rich cement matrix. The final solidified product has to be assessed for a final disposal in a deep geological repository. One aspect of the assessment is related to intrinsic factors inherent to the solidified waste physical properties and the interaction between the binding agent and the waste solution. Another aspect of the safety assessment is related to the hydrolytic behaviour of the final cemented waste product under deep geological disposal conditions. The alkalinity of the waste solution acts as an activator for the hydration of the blast furnace slag. The rate of slag hydration decreases at late ages due to the formation of a denser microstructure of reaction products around the slag particles. The solidification of the waste solution with pure blast furnace slag and slag rich matrices leads to significant compressive strength. The effect is more marked for the waste solution cemented with only blast furnace slag. The solidification with blast furnace slag enables a physical immobilisation of the radiotoxical elements. In presence of MgCl_ 2 -rich salt brines, the solid waste matrice has no barrier function: the radiotoxical elements are released from the cement matrix within few months. Cs leaching behaviour shows no interaction with the cement matrix regardless of the pH in the surrounding aqueous phase.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of alumina increase on the functioning of casting powder during continuous casting. Two aspects of the powder's performance were experimentally measured, namely the influence of alumina on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour. These two aspects were then related to the in-mould functioning of the casting powder with the aid of literature references. Casting slag must provide lubrication between the mould surface and the thin steel shell. Alumina increase will cause viscosity increase in casting slags and will hinder lubrication when the inflow of casting slag into the mould/strand gap deteriorates. Heat transfer across the gap is determined by the amount of solid casting slag and the form (glass or crystalline) thereof. Heat transfer across a crystalline material may be up to seven times lower than that across a glass phase. The increased alumina will serve to increase the ratio of glassy phase to crystalline phase in the gap, so increasing the heat transfer. To determine the true extent of alumina increase with modern clean steel practice, samples were taken from the moulds of both the VI and V 2 continuous casters at ISCOR Vanderbijlpark. The influence of this alumina increase on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour of the casting slag were experimentally measured. Viscosity measurements were done with a rotating bob viscometer (in a vertical tube furnace) on two commercial casting powders (with increasing AI 2 O 3 content). Viscosity prediction models were evaluated with the data from the measured viscosity values. Crystallisation measurements were done by quench experiments with the aid of the hot thermocouple technique. Crystallisation behaviour after a specified heat cycle was presented as the percentage opaque material (crystalline) to vitreous material (glassy) measured with an optical microscope. For the seven sequence casts during which samples were collected from the mould, it was found that the alumina content of the casting slag reached a steady-state value within the first ladle (first 40 minutes) with an increase of 3 to 4 mass %. The influence of a 4 mass % alumina increase on the measured viscosity is small enough that proper lubrication function of the slag will not be negatively affected. Viscosity prediction models vary in their accuracy and are limited with respect to the composition range of the casting powder and the temperature range for which they are valid. The increased alumina content was found to have a strong influence on the percentage crystalline material present. After the sample was heated to 1300 °C, kept there for 10 s, and then quenched, the crystalline material will decrease from 60 % to 30 % for 5 mass % alumina added. This decreased crystalline material present may notably increase heat transfer. Full crystallisation does not occur at a single temperature, and crystallisation occurs over a temperature interval (of up to 200 °C). This means that crystallisation temperature values quoted by casting powder manufacturers depend on the heat cycle and the technique used during crystallisation measurements. Several crystalline phases are usually present in <b>solidified</b> casting <b>slag</b> and these crystalline phases are strongly influenced by the alumina content: the stable crystalline phases may change as alumina content increases.

40|$|Basic {{oxygen furnace}} (BOF) slag is a main {{by-product}} generated during converter steelmaking. Valorization of BOF slag {{contributes to the}} sustainability of the steel industry and alleviates the environmental burden significantly. The present research is dedicated to investigate the valorization of BOF slag with respect to recover metal and apply the slag in constructional productions that create added value. In {{the first part of}} the research, the carbothermic reduction of BOF slag was investigated systematically. Reduction of Fe and P containing phases was discussed. Effects of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 additions on the microstructure and mineralogy associated with the reduction process were also investigated. Formation and growth mechanisms of the extracted metallic phase were explored. The second part of this research focuses on optimization of slag solidification to prevent slag expansion and obtain enhanced cementitious/hydraulic properties. Influence of Al 2 O 3, basicity (mass ratio of CaO/SiO 2), and oxygen partial pressure on the BOF slag was studied in detail. The effect of Al 2 O 3 addition on the mineralogical modification and crystallization kinetics of BOF slag was studied by both water quenching and in-situ observations. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) and time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams were constructed. The critical cooling rate to vitrify BOF slag was, for the first time, determined quantitatively. Crystallization sequence was clarified by integrating the in-situ observations and post-mortem analysis with thermodynamic calculations. To reveal the influence of basicity and oxygen partial pressure on the mineralogical and morphological modification of BOF slag, original and SiO 2 modified slags were re-melted and solidified under argon and/or air atmosphere followed by slow cooling. Experimental observations were then compared with the results of thermodynamic modelling to achieve a thorough understanding. The effects of basicity and oxygen partial pressure were then evaluated with respect to the energy consumption for the slag valorization. Finally, a SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 modified BOF slag was water granulated at a pilot scale. The amorphous and mineral fractions were measured quantitatively. A mathematical model was developed to provide an insight into the crystallization behavior during the granulation. Temperature profiles of the slag particles with different sizes were calculated with the aid of COMSOL Multiphysics software. The findings of this research suggest an important approach to optimize the microstructure/mineralogy of the <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> through modifying slag chemistry and solidification conditions. The present study provides a fundamental basis for “Zero waste” of BOF slag, which will be achieved by innovation of the hot-stage slag engineering with both metal recovery and slag utilization. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} some aspects {{concerning}} secondary metallurgy of steel {{where there is}} little or very inconsistent information in the literature. More specifically, it is devoted to the studies on high temperature phase equilibria in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system, the formation of ladle glaze and the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron. First, the solidification of different slags on MgO based refractories was studied in order to reveal the mechanism behind the formation of “ladle glaze”. The formation of the slag glaze layer was studied by dipping MgO rods, dense or porous, into liquid slags at 1873 K. The rods were thereafter cooled at a predetermined rate. From a later SEM-EDS microscopy, {{it was found that the}} initial slag composition had the most profound effect on the phases found in the <b>solidified</b> <b>slag</b> layer. It was found that the type of MgO rod used and cooling speed had a minor impact on the morphology on the solidified samples. In addition, the slags used in the study were equilibrated at 1773 K, 1673 K and 1573 K in order to get an understanding of the equilibrium phases and their relationship during cooling. On the basis of the experimental results, the mechanism regarding entrainment of exogenous inclusions from the refractory lining was also discussed. Secondly, phase diagram studies in the high basicity region of the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system were performed using the quench technique followed by EPMA analysis. The main focus in the study was to find the liquidus surfaces for MgO and CaO saturation at 1773 and 1873 K. Based on the experimental data, phase diagrams for the 25, 30 and 35 mass percent alumina sections were constructed for silica contents generally less than 20 mass percent [...] The results generally agreed very well with previous, well established phase diagrams. In addition, the activities of MgO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 were estimated using the phase diagram information. At last, the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron at 1823 K were studied. In a pre-study, the thermodynamics of Ag-Mg solutions were studied, necessary for the Fe-Mg system. For the Ag-Mg system, two different experimental techniques were used; the vapor pressure method and the gas equilibration technique. The temperature range of the Ag-Mg study was 1573 to 1823 K. It was found that the excess Gibbs energy of this system can be described quite well with a sub-regular solution model. In the Fe-Mg study, the partition of Mg between liquid iron and liquid silver were studied at 1823 K. Using the results from the pre-study, the activity coefficient of Mg in liquid iron and the self-interaction parameter were determined at 1823 K. QC 2011031...|$|E
40|$|Crystallization of {{metallurgical}} slags {{occurs in}} many industrial pyrometallurgical processes. Important examples are {{the application of}} freeze linings, refractory degradation and the usability of the <b>solidified</b> <b>slag.</b> To extend the fundamental knowledge of these phenomena, this research focuses on the simulation and in situ observation of crystallizing minerals in oxide melts. Modeling of slag crystallization can bring valuable insight into phenomena {{that are difficult to}} measure or observe, such as solute diffusion and growth kinetics of minerals in liquid slags. In this work, the phase field technique is used because it has proven its capabilities for microstructure evolution in metals, such as solidification, coarsening and solid-state transformations. A state-of-the-art multi-phase and multi-component model is extended to simulate crystallization of oxide melts. Therefore, the model is linked with thermodynamic databases for oxides, the phase field mobility is made dependent on the interface orientation to allow faceted crystal growth, and a new boundary condition is developed to treat redox dependent behavior of multivalent cations when the melt is in contact with an oxygen-containing atmosphere. The phase field model is applied to the isothermal dendritic crystallization of Wollastonite (CaO. SiO 2) in a ternary CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melt, and the crystallization of Magnetite spinel (FeO. Fe 2 O 3) in a FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melt, under an oxidizing atmosphere. Besides the simulations, the crystallization behavior of Wollastonite in a CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melt is also observed experimentally, using a confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM). Relating the simulation to experimental results allows an estimation of the solid-liquid interfacial energy of Wollastonite in a CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melt, which is difficult to measure directly. The developed model is also used to answer a longstanding issue regarding ternary two-phase diffusion couples, in which multiple analytical solutions exist. Using the phase field model, this work shows that the diffusion path depends on the Gibbs energies of both phases as well as their interfacial energy.

40|$|Abstract Today iron {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} metals in our daily life. The first iron objects resulting from smelting iron ores was dated to the 3 rd millennium BC. Iron smelting was developed in Anatolia (Turkey) and spread fast across the Mediterranean. Initially iron was considered a valuable metal, but by the 13 th century BC, it had evolved to a metal for daily use, in tools and weaponry. Iron slag, the metallurgical waste product of smelting and smithing activities, are often found on sites dating already from the Neolithic. Studying slag over metal object has the advantage that the record of slag is more complete (slag are rusty lumps not worth plundering), destructive analysis can be performed (since no one really cares about slag, except a select group of archaeometallurgist) and corrosion has little effect on the texture of the slag. Slag are one of the most underestimated find on archaeological sites, often classify in boxes as production waste material and discarded for decades. Slag found during almost three decades of excavations in Sagalassos, a Hellenistic to Early-Byzanine site in the SW of Turkey, underwent the same faith. The iron slag found in Sagalassos, were first described by Kucha et al. (1995). These authors attempted a first technological reconstruction of the iron production. Afterwards, slag were used for several smaller, mostly provenance studies. This thesis fills the gaps in the first studies and has two main aims, employing the framework of “chaîne opératoire”. Firstly, the local iron technology is reconstructed using chemical, mineralogical and statistical techniques. This includes among others the determination of the used raw materials as well as deducing the thermochemical history of the slag. Secondly, the “chaîne opératoire” offers a framework to put this technology in a broader, archaeological context. This includes determining the potential exchange of knowledge and goods based on provenance and spatial analysis, as well as determining the scale of the production, potential trade and the sustainability employing mass balance models. Iron slag are a complex amalgam of iron silicates, iron oxides and amorphous phases. This makes standard chemical and mineralogical analysis need adaptation specific to slag material [...] The chemical composition of the iron slag is determined by ICP-OES, applying an adapted LiBO 2 -fusion. Due to a change in legislation, sampling was unfortunately no longer allowed in Sagalassos during the course of this thesis. A new methodology, using HH-pXRF was developed to characterize iron slag in the field. For this study, a calibration was developed in cooperation with dr. R. Scott (KU Leuven), to obtain semi-quantitative results. Mineralogical characterization of the slag is acquired by optical microscopy and XRD-analysis. The minerals are quantified using the Rietveld method. Also here, adjustments specific for iron slag needed to be made. SEM was further used to refine the Rietveld implementation code for magnetite and ulvöspinel quantification in XRD. Interpretation of the chemical and mineralogical data is aided by applying statistical analysis, such as box- and kernel density plots, PCA, correlation tests, regression analysis and ANOVA. To obtain insight in the used raw materials and yield of the iron production process, mass balance calculations are necessary. Different models are tested and compared. It could be concluded that none of the model are applicable for the Sagalassos iron slag. The models require a thorough knowledge of the used raw materials, which is not the case for the Sagalassos sites. To estimate the scale of the production and ecological impact, this thesis needed to rely on ratio’s obtained from experimental archaeometallurgy. Three, potentially four smelting sites are identified in the Sagalassos territory: Bereket (dating inconclusive), Tekkeli Tepe (6 th- 7 th century AD), Dereköy (6 th- 7 th century AD) and potentially Düzen Tepe (5 th- 2 nd century BC). There are remarkable differences between the different sites in the use of raw material and the applied technology. At Bereket, a site 25 km SW of the administrative centre, a limonite ore in a chert matrix was exploitated for iron smelting. A clear ore dressing site, with chopped off chert, could be recognized. A slag heap of around 110 m² is found next to the ore dressing site. The main type of slag found at this site are tap slag, indicating the use of tap slagging furnace. The slag (and ore) are characterized by elevated Cr-values. CaO is clearly used as a flux. The iron smelting process must have been very efficient, since no free iron oxides are present and the main mineralogical constituent is hedenbergite and tephroite. At Tekkeli Tepe, iron slag are spread across a hill site. Magnetic images reveal the presence of two, maybe more, furnaces. A potential magnetite-spinel vein was exploitated at this site. The slag here are furnaced cooled slag, implying that the <b>slag</b> <b>solidify</b> at the bottom of the furnace. The slag are rich in Ti, V and Zr. CaO was clearly used as flux. The furnace efficiency is remarkable lower than that of Bereket. Euhedral magnetite, interpreted as unreacted magnetite ore, is the main constituent in the iron slag. Also other free iron oxides, such as wüstite, are present in the slag. At Dereköy, a similar slag type is recognized. Here, a magnetite-spinel placer deposit is the most likely candididate to be exploitated as iron ore. The slag are also rich in Ti, V and Zr and also here CaO was used as a flux. Also in the case of Dereköy the furnace efficiency is lower than that of Bereket, though a slight improvement compared to Tekkeli Tepe could be noticed. Magnetite is still present as remnant of the ore, but it has clearly reacted since hopper-shapes are the dominant texture in the slag. The reason for the efficiency difference between Bereket on the one hand and Tekkeli Tepe and Dereköy on the other, is related to the used ore. Ti will elevate the smelting temperature, making it more difficult to tap. Moreover, magnetite is more difficult to reduce than limonite. There are also some resemblances between the three sites. They are all three build on a hill site, probably exploiting the wind for their furnaces. The sites are also build in the proximities of their ores (least effort principle), away from the settlements. Finally, the applied furnace temperature falls in the same range of 900 - 1250 °C. It is unclear whether Düzen Tepe is a smelting or smithing site. Primary and secondary smiting slag are identified on the site. The presence of a valuable iron ore source, namely a magnetite placer deposit, and the possible identification of an ore dressing site, suggest however that also smelting activities occurred at Düzen Tepe. This implies, in comparison to Bereket, Tekkeli Tepe and Dereköy, that both smelting and smithing occurred within the city walls. The thermomechanical characteristics of the smithing slag indicate the use of a single, mechanically handled forging technique. This means that the smithed object is heated at constant temperature, after which it is hammered (mechanically deformed). This process is repeated over and over again and will result in a simple utility object. At the administrative centre of Sagalassos, the main activity is smithing. Three potential workshop dating Early Roman to Early Byzantine, are recognized, though most iron slag are found in secondary contexts (dump fill, road leveler). Based on the textural analysis of the slag, two main smithing techniques can be recognized. The dominant technique is the mechanically handled technique similar to Düzen Tepe. The second technique that emerges, is a temperature handled technique. Here different temperature regimes are recognized in the slag, indicating the forging of complex objects. Moreover, CaO is used as a protective agent, which can be indicative of the forging of cutting-edge objects. After the technological reconstruction, the data are further used to unravel the “chaîne opératore” of the site. The archaeological implications, mainly economical and politically, are further described. First of all, there does not seem to be an exchange of knowledge between the smelting sites. This can be related to a potential time lag or the distance between sites, but is most likely related to the different use of ores. Based on the provenance analysis, there does not seem to be an exchange of goods. The scale of the iron smelting sites is estimated based on literature of experimental archaeology. Though the sites of Bereket and Tekkeli Tepe are, in comparison to Düzen Tepe, considered industrial scaled iron production sites, compared to other Roman sites worldwide, the production is small. This implies that the Sagalassos sites are mainly self-sufficient, answering to local the local market and no export occurred. This however also implies that the ecological impact of the iron production was minor, surely compared to other wood consuming activities in the territory. The main demand of iron comes from civil demand, opposed to military demand. There does not seem to be a link between the type of smithing techniques and periods of conflict or supply to the Roman army. In general, this thesis showed that the iron production in the Sagalassos territory is small, mainly focusing on local civil (urban and rural) demand. There was no or limited trade. The impact on the local environment would have been minor. This thesis whipped off the dust that covered the iron slag of Sagalassos after being stored as production waste for almost 20 years and reconstructs the technology and associated “chaîne opératoire” of the iron production in the territory. It offered the opportunity to estimate the importance of Sagalassos as an iron production centre. Moreover, this thesis offers future archaeometallurgist a workflow applicable to smithing and smelting slag. This thesis contributes to the field of archaeometallurgy in general by offering a methodology and showing the importance of studying smithing slag, which are often discarded in literature. By studying SHB, the researcher obtains insight in the applied smithing techniques and thus the forged objects. Finally, this thesis also stresses the importance of mineralogical analysis, more important the use of simple optical microscopy to study the thermomechanical history of smelting and smithing slag. status: publishe...|$|R
