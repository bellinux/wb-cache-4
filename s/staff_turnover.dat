5|$|Peter Geoffrey Edwards, AM (born 29 August 1945) is an Australian {{diplomatic}} and military historian. Educated at the University of Western Australia and the University of Oxford, Edwards {{worked for the}} Department of Foreign Affairs, the Australian National University and the University of Adelaide before being appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975 in 1982. The nine-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards spent fourteen years at the Australian War Memorial (AWM) writing two of the volumes, while also researching, editing, and dealing with budget limitations and problems with <b>staff</b> <b>turnover.</b> Since leaving the AWM in 1996, Edwards {{has worked as a}} senior academic, scholar and historical consultant. In 2006 his book Arthur Tange: Last of the Mandarins won the Queensland Premier's History Book Award and the Western Australian Premier's Book Award for Non-Fiction.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the project}} was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted {{by a lack of}} {{resources}} and funds. He instead had to enlist historians based outside of the AWM for some of the volumes, who agreed to work on the history without financial compensation. The series also experienced problems with <b>staff</b> <b>turnover.</b> Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill—author of the volumes on the Australian Army—caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan , dealing with army operations up to 1966), were delivered in a timely fashion and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012; two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of Bean and Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship 				between nursing staffing and quality of life (QOL) in nursing 				homes (NHs). The relationships between nursing staff hours per 				resident day, nursing <b>staffing</b> skill mix, <b>turnover</b> of nursing 				<b>staff,</b> and the answers given to QOL questions by 231 residents 				in Iowa NHs were investigated. Unexpectedly, only part of 				staffing variables were statistically significantly correlated 				with QOL of residents and nurse staffing variables seemed to 				have little influence on predicting QOL of residents in this 				study. The major differences between this study and previous 				studies are that previous research focused on quality of care 				(QOC) and this study measured QOL by measuring residents 2 ̆ 7 				outcomes. Previous studies found that nurse staffing is an 				important factor in improving QOC (and by implication, QOL) of 				NH residents. Based on the statistically significant 				relationships, RNs 2 ̆ 7 unique contributions were supported by the 				findings that NHs with more RNs, compared with LPNs/LVNs and 				CNAs, had residents with higher scores in the functional 				competence domain and overall QOL summary items. This study 				found that nurse <b>staffing</b> <b>turnover</b> is positively correlated with 				QOL, especially in the individuality domain. However, the whole 				study takes place in one state, Iowa. Iowa has a homogeneous 				population with limited racial diversity. Only Iowa NHs were 				selected and it is questionable whether the findings may be 				generalizable to the rest of the United States. Further research 				is required to confirm the relationship and provide policy 				guidelines, including nurse staffing recommendations, to 				guarantee optimal QOL for NH residents...|$|R
40|$|In Western Australia, many {{teachers}} in remote Indigenous communities are new graduates, {{and as well}} as being inexperienced in teaching mathematics, they also have little experience being in a remote community with Indigenous people. In 2010 seven schools in the Kimberley in Western Australia established the Fitzroy Valley Numeracy Project.

Executive Director Kathy Lear resigned effective April 5. Tracy Houck was hired full-time {{as executive director of the}} museum on November 1, 2012. However, the search for a new executive director was not a timely one. Houck took the reins of PGSMA too late for planning for the museum's popular Christmas Collection art show to begin. The event was cancelled for 2012, although Houck pledged to bring it back in 2013. In December 2012, the museum faced a major facility crisis. PGSMA had been aware since early in 2012 that it needed new boilers to replace its two aged heaters. Some fund-raising had already occurred. But on December 30, one of the museum's two boilers failed, and the second boiler came close to failing. PSGMA applied for an emergency grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, but the agency argued that block-grant support for city-owned buildings operated by nonprofits did not qualify for the block-grant (which was intended to support public agencies only). there was doubt that the museum would receive it.|$|E
25|$|In December 1932, {{the general}} counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) resigned, and Reed was {{appointed}} the agency's new general counsel. Since 1930, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Eugene Meyer, had pressed Hoover to take a more active approach to ameliorating the Great Depression. Hoover finally relented and submitted legislation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act was signed into law on January 22, 1932, but its operations were kept secret for five months. Hoover feared both political attacks from Republicans and that publicity about which corporations were receiving RFC assistance might disrupt the agency's attempts to keep companies financially viable. When Congress passed legislation in July 1932 forcing the RFC to make public the companies that received loans, the resulting political embarrassment led to the resignation of the RFC's president and his successor as well as other <b>staff</b> <b>turnover</b> at the agency. Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President in November 1932 led to further staff changes. On December 1, 1932, the RFC's general counsel resigned, and Hoover appointed Reed to the position. Roosevelt, impressed with Reed's work and needing someone who knew the agency, its staff and its operations, kept Reed on. Reed mentored and protected the careers of a number of young lawyers at RFC, many of whom became highly influential in the Roosevelt administration: Alger Hiss, Robert H. Jackson, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr. (later an important federal district court judge), and David Cushman Coyle.|$|E
