The <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> in the Longdong area were mainly formed after the Late Triassic, as a result of multiple-stage tectonic events in the Late Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. These extensively developed fractures are mostly unfilled and effective, which noticeably improve the permeability of tight reservoirs in the Ordos Basin.|$|R

40|$|It is {{a problem}} that how thrust faults control the {{distribution}} of <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> in the exploration and development of fracture oil-reservoirs. One section of fracture outcrops in Ordovician carbonites is measured in the north margin of Tarim Basin, and two sections cross the Fault I in the central Tarim Basin are measured and processed in the paper. The development rule of <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> can be depicted by the fracture density, and the fractures near fault can be divided into two regions: the fracture zone controlled by fault and the fracture zone controlled by regional stress field. The ratio of fault-controlled fracture zone width to the throw of thrust fault is a very important parameter to depict the development of fractures influenced by thrust fault. The ratio is related to the mechanism, scale and throw of the thrust fault. The width of fault-controlled fracture zone can be predicted based on the mechanism and throw of the thrust fault. It is very helpful to the exploration and development of fault-controlled fracture reservoirs.

This methodology consists of step-by-step procedures for mixed mode fracture in generic components and of an integrated computer code, Composite Durability Structural Analysis (CODSTRAN).

30|$|Two {{distinct}} tectonic events {{took place}} from the Late Mesozoic to the Cenozoic, resulting {{in two different}} stress fields in these periods. In the Late Mesozoic, namely from the Early Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous, the long-distance effect of subduction of the Izanagi Plate turned from north-northwestward to northwestward when the force arrived at the Ordos Basin, resulting in the WNW-trending stress fields and the <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> in NW–EW trends (e.g., Wan 1994; Hou et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2016); while in the Cenozoic, the predominant tectonic event became the northeastward collision between the Indian and the Eurasian Plate, {{which led to the}} NE-trending stress fields and the <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> in NNE–ENE trends (e.g., Yuan et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2014 b). Two episodes of fractures are developed under distinct tectonic events, so the stress fields of different periods should be taken into consideration during the fracture prediction.|$|R
30|$|The {{reservoirs}} {{deposited in}} the evaporated platform—restricted platform facies are mostly calcareous dolomite and dolomitic limestone with strong brittleness, while nonreservoirs are composed of argillaceous and gypsum rocks with strong plasticity. Thus, under tectonic stress, the reservoir interval {{is more likely to}} form <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> due to fracturing (Aqrawi et al. 1998; Carnell and Wilson 2004; He et al. 2012; Moutaz et al. 2010). Fractures account for 71  % of the reservoir space in the reservoir interval but 29  % of the space in the nonreservoir interval. During the syngenetic–para-syngenetic period, dissolved fractures were likely to form due to strong leaching by meteoric fresh water. The uplifting and erosion after Carboniferous deposition and before Permian deposition leached the formations with meteoric water again, making the dissolved <b>fractures</b> and <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> formed earlier enlarge further. Therefore, dissolved fractures are quite abundant in these reservoirs. But they are small in scale, mostly dissolved microfractures, and bigger ones are only found in local areas (Fig.  5 f).|$|R

40|$|Study on the {{effectiveness}} of fractures is of great significance for understanding reservoir types and properties, identifying reservoir seepage mechanisms and delineating the reasonable development technologies and policies. In this paper, the Changxing reef-flat facies reservoirs in the Yuanba area, Sichuan Basin, was taken as an example. After the characteristics of natural fractures were evaluated, {{the effectiveness}} of different types of fractures was investigated by using core, thin section, imaging logging and production performance data. Then, the main geological factors that influence fracture effectiveness were analyzed, and the development significance of effective fractures was illustrated. The following results are obtained. (1) <b>Structural</b> <b>fractures</b> and diagenetic fractures are mainly developed in Changxing Fm carbonate reservoirs in Yuanba area. <b>Structural</b> <b>fractures</b> include shear fractures and extensional fractures, and diagenetic fractures include dissolution fractures, structural-dissolution fractures and pressure-solution <b>fractures.</b> (2) High-angle <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> are the most effective, followed by horizontal fractures and then oblique fractures, and pressure-solution fractures are the least effective. (3) Among <b>structural</b> <b>fractures,</b> those of NW–SE and nearly E–W oriented are more effective than those of the NE–SW oriented. (4) The earlier the fractures are formed, {{the more likely they are}} to be filled with calcite or dolomite and become invalid. (5) The fractures which are formed before or during the oil and gas charging tend to be filled with organic matters and become invalid. The late fractures which are formed after oil and gas charging are mostly effective and their contribution to the reservoir is the greatest. (6) The fractures nearly parallel to the maximum principal stress direction of current ground stress present good effectiveness with large opening. It is concluded that the opening and filling features of natural fractures help determine if fractures are effective or not, and the development degree, distribution and combination features of effective fractures and the matching relationship between fractures and pores further dominate the development significance of effective fractures; that when the effective fractures are more developed and are connected with each other to form a large-scale fracture network, separated and isolated pores and dissolved fractures and cavities can be connected, as a result, the physical properties of reservoirs are improved and high production rates of gas wells are realized...|$|R

30|$|Structures such as faults, {{joints and}} {{fractures}} of diverse patterns have acted as precursors of several slope instability cases within the Benue Trough Nigeria. In some cases, the structures by their nature weakened and also created avenues that streams took advantage to further destabilize the rock slopes. In other cases, structure orientation played significant {{roles in the}} mobility and eventual runout distance of debris flow and avalanches in the region. Detailed field-based <b>structural,</b> <b>fracture</b> and paleostress analyses were therefore carried out to determine the fractural patterns that correlate to reported instability and landslide cases in the region; and to produce models that reveal areas with heightened risk.|$|E

30|$|Volcanic {{rocks in}} the Songliao Basin {{experienced}} relatively short weathering or no weathering at all. As a result, volcanic structures are completely preserved. Volcanic rocks have relatively complete facies with reservoirs predominantly developed in eruption facies. Major controlling factors for the storage capacity of volcanic reservoirs include lithological features, rock facies, <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> and dissolution by acidic fluids. To be more specific, the developments of primary pores in volcanic rocks are mainly determined by lithological features and rock facies; <b>structural</b> <b>fractures</b> may enhance the permeability of volcanic rocks and serve as seepage channels for acidic fluids in later stages. Later dissolution by acidic fluids can enlarge primary pores, whereas weathering and leaching can facilitate the formation of secondary pores and fractures. Favorable facies of volcanic rocks include intrusive facies, upper subfacies of effusive facies and air-fall subfacies of eruption facies, all of which develop primary pores. In later stages of volcanic activity, acidic fluids may rise along fractures and enter pores through fractures, stimulating the formation of dissolution pores, and eventually enlarging reservoir spaces. The upper subfacies of effusive facies, air-fall subfacies of eruption facies and intrusive facies near craters below the weathering crust, which have been reformed due to acidic fluid dissolution in later stages of volcanic activities below the unconformity surface (approximately 3, 600 – 3, 800  m), are favorable facies {{for the development of}} reservoir spaces.|$|R

Therefore, the stresses in the microfibrils and matrix were relaxed to different extents, depending on the treatment conditions, such as duration, pressure, and temperature [9]. Furthermore, the degradation of hemicelluloses at high temperatures can lead to stress relaxation and reduction in hygroscopicity in THM specimens.
