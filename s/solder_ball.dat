50|$|In the {{assembly}} of integrated circuit packages to printed circuit boards, a head-in-pillow defect is {{a failure of the}} soldering process. For example, {{in the case of a}} ball grid array package, the pre-desposited <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> on the package and the solder paste applied to the circuit board may both melt, but the melted solder does not join. A cross-section through the failed joint shows a distinct boundary between the <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> on the part and the solder paste on the circuit board, rather like a section through a head resting on a pillow.|$|E

5000|$|In {{integrated}} circuit packaging, a <b>solder</b> <b>ball,</b> also a solder bump (ofter referred to simply as [...] "ball" [...] or [...] "bumps") is {{a ball of}} solder that provides the contact between the chip package and the printed circuit board, {{as well as between}} stacked packages in multichip modules. The solder balls can be placed manually or by automated equipment, and are held in place with a tacky flux.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{method is}} laser re-balling. Here the stencil is {{programmed}} into the re-balling unit. A bondhead (looks like a tube/needle) is automatically loaded with one tin ball from a <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> singulation tank. The ball is then heated by a laser, {{such that the}} tin-solder ball becomes fluid and flows onto the cleaned chip. Instantly after melting the ball the laser turns off and a new ball falls into the bondhead. While reloading the bondhead of the re-balling unit changes the position to the next pin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{size and}} shape of the metal {{particles}} in the solder paste determines how well the paste will [...] "print". A <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> is spherical in shape; this helps in reducing surface oxidation and ensures good joint formation with the adjoining particles. Irregular particle sizes are not used, as they tend to clog the stencil, causing printing defects. To produce a quality solder joint, it's very important for the spheres of metal to be very regular in size and have a low level of oxidation.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the uniaxial flow curve for <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> in a flip-chip from experimental-computational algorithms based on finite element modeling (FEM) of in-plane thermal displacement data measured by electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI). In order to measure the deformation of such tiny components as the <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> in the flip-chip, the spatial resolution of ESPI was increased to submicron scale by magnifying the areas studied.

50|$|The {{most common}} test types {{performed}} on a bond tester are the wire pull test, which generally puts an upward force on a gold/aluminum/silver/copper wire, and the die shear test, which generally comprises loading a {{die from the}} side. When equipped with tweezers, bond testers may also perform cold bump pull tests. During such a test, a <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> down to 50 µm in diameter is reform it to the shape something like a mushroom and then pulled off the surface. Modern bond testers can perform {{a wide variety of}} tests with high precision, because automation eliminates human influence on the measurement.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{there were}} several {{lead-free}} assemblies and chip products initiatives being driven by the Japan Electronic Industries Development Association (JEIDA) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE). These initiatives resulted in tin-silver-copper alloys being considered and tested as lead-free <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> alternatives for array product assemblies.In 2003, tin-silver-copper was {{being used as a}} lead-free solder. However, its performance was criticized because it left a dull, irregular finish and it was difficult to keep the copper content under control. In 2005, tin-silver-copper alloys constituted approximately 65% of lead-free alloys used in the industry and this percentage has been increasing. Large companies such as Sony and Intel switched from using lead-containing solder to a tin-silver-copper alloy.|$|E
50|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the POWER2 optimized for transaction processing was introduced in May 1994 as the POWER2+. Transaction processing workloads benefited from {{the addition of a}} L2 cache with capacities of 512 KB, 1 MB and 2 MB. This cache was implemented off-package with industry-standard burst SRAMs. The cache was connected to the POWER2+ via a 64- (for low-end systems) or 128-bit bus (for high-end systems). The cache was direct-mapped, had a 128-byte line size, and was write-through. The cache tags were contained on the storage control unit chip. The POWER2+ has a narrower 64- or 128-bit memory bus and a smaller 64 or 128 KB data cache. As there is less cache, the data cache unit chips are smaller as a result, and the revised storage control unit chip is also smaller. A goal for the six-chip configuration was to reduce cost, and therefore the chips are packaged in a <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> connect (SBC) package instead of a MCM.|$|E

40|$|Ball-Grid-Array (BGA) {{has become}} one of the most popular {{packaging}} techniques in the electronic industry. Coplanarity inspection of BGA <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> is critical in BGA manufacturing for process and quality control. Currently, the 3 D measurement systems for BGA coplanarity inspection are mainly based on laser scanning techniques. However, they suffer from low inspection speed due to the physical line-scanning process. In this paper, a fast and cost-effective 3 D measurement system for coplanarity inspection of BGA <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> is proposed. The proposed system uses an LCD-based phase measuring technique to perform full-field 3 D measurement of BGA <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> with high accuracy.

50|$|The BGA is {{descended from}} the pin grid array (PGA), which is a package with one face covered (or partly covered) with pins in a grid pattern which, in operation, conduct {{electrical}} signals between the integrated circuit and the printed circuit board (PCB) on which it is placed. In a BGA the pins are replaced by pads {{on the bottom of}} the package, each initially with a tiny <b>solder</b> <b>ball</b> stuck to it. These solder spheres can be placed manually or by automated equipment, and are held in place with a tacky flux. The device is placed on a PCB with copper pads in a pattern that matches the solder balls. The assembly is then heated, either in a reflow oven or by an infrared heater, melting the balls. Surface tension causes the molten solder to hold the package in alignment with the circuit board, at the correct separation distance, while the solder cools and solidifies, forming soldered connections between the device and the PCB.|$|E

Each UBM area comprised four layers deposited on a Si-wafer. Sequentially, the deposit comprised 0. 4 mm of Al, 4 mm each of Ni and Cu, and 20 nm of Au from bottom to top of the metallization. Two compositions of lead-free <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> (Sn- 3. 5 mass%Ag and Sn- 3. 5 mass%Ag- 0. 7 mass%Cu) and a lead containing one (Sn- 37 mass%Pb) as a reference were selected for the experiment.

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{investigating}} the effects of thermal aging and Au addition on the electrical resistance of <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> (bumps) in flip chip (FC) and UltraCSP packages. The specimens include one FC with eutectic Sn-Ag-Cu solder bumps and two types of UltraCSP, which have 20 -mil and 30 -mil eutectic Sn-Pb <b>solder</b> <b>balls,</b> respectively. The thermal aging test is performed with thermal aging at 175 °C for FC, and 150 °C for CSPs for up to 2000 hours, respectively. The electrical resistance of each daisy-chain pair of <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> is measured using the Four Point Kelvin Method. With the increase in thermal aging time, electrical resistance of CSPs without Au increases gradually. After 1000 hour, the resistance seems to level off. While the resistance of CSPs with Au addition ascends monotonically with prolonged thermal aging. For Sn-Ag-Cu flip chip solder bumps, at 175 °C for only 24 hours, the electrical resistance of a daisy-chain pair of solder bumps drops substantially. From 24 to 2000 hours, the electrical resistance increases at first and soon becomes stable.

40|$|Interposers with through-silicon vias (TSVs) play a {{key role}} in the {{three-dimensional}} integration and packaging of integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems. In the current practice of fabricating interposers, <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> are placed next to the vias; however, this approach requires a large foot print for the input/output (I/O) connections. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the possibility of placing the <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> directly on top of the vias, thereby enabling a smaller pitch between the <b>solder</b> <b>balls</b> and an increased density of the I/O connections. To reach this goal, inkjet printing (that is, piezo and super inkjet) was used to successfully fill and planarize hollow metal TSVs with a dielectric polymer. The under bump metallization (UBM) pads were also successfully printed with inkjet technology on top of the polymer-filled vias, using either Ag or Au inks. The reliability of the TSV interposers was investigated by a temperature cycling stress test (- 40 °C to + 125 °C). The stress test showed no impact on DC resistance of the TSVs; however, shrinkage and delamination of the polymer was observed, along with some micro-cracks in the UBM pads.
