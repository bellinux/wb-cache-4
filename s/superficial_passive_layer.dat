40|$|Present paper {{deals with}} the use of the {{electrochemical}} impedance spectroscopy to identify different processes in the <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> growth over steel rebar surface immersed in an alkaline media simulating the concrete pore solution. Two cases have been considered: a <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> spontaneously grown in a high alkaline media and a <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> assisted by the application of an anodic potential in the same media. The application of electric equivalent circuits allows distinguishing between the different mechanisms occurring in this <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> when grows in different conditions. An electric equivalent circuit with two RC loops connected in parallel is often used for fitting the EIS diagrams obtained for spontaneous growth of <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> in the alkaline solution simulating the concrete pores. However, when the <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> is formed under anodic polarization, a Warburg element must be introduced in the equivalent circuit. According to the Point Defect Model (PDM), this Warburg element is allocated to the transport of oxygen vacancies through the <b>passive</b> <b>layer,</b> which concentration changes with the potential.

40|$|Brightly and uniformly colored <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> on Ti {{are formed}} by {{application}} of ac polarization in aqueous NH 4 BF 4. A {{wide spectrum of}} well-defined colors is accomplished by varying the ac voltage. The passive films are stable in the ambient and in aqueous chloride, perchlorate, and sulfate solutions. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses indicate that the <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> are compact and do not show fractures or cracks. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the colored <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> demonstrates that their surface-chemical composition depends on the ac polarization voltage. The main constituents of the <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> are Tiz+, O 2 -, and F- (z varies from 4 to 2 depending on the film's depth). Fluoride in the film originates from decomposition of NH 4 BF 4, and it accumulates at the inner metal/passive-film interface. XPS depth profiling shows that the higher the ac voltage applied, the thicker the passive film formed. Electrochemical properties of the colored Ti <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> are determined by recording polarization curves in the 2 ̆ 2120. 8 to 3. 2 V range as well as Tafel plots in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) region in 1. 0 M aqueous H 2 SO 4. The polarization curves show that the corrosion potential of the colored <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> shifts toward less-negative potentials indicating {{that they are more}} stable than Ti under the same conditions. The passive region for the colored layers resembles that for Ti. The Tafel plots for the HER demonstrate that the <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> have higher activity toward the HER than Ti. The Tafel relations reveal new features that can be associated with the partial breakdown/decomposition of the <b>passive</b> <b>layers,</b> H absorption, and the onset of Ti hydride formation.

40|$|The {{passivation}} of {{two high}} strength duplex stainless steels (HSSS) {{was investigated in}} alkaline solutions simulating the pore solution of concrete by the growth of natural and induced passive films. Induced passive films were generated both by cyclic voltammetry and by chronoamperometry. Natural passive films were spontaneously grown by the immersion of the steel in the alkaline electrolyte. These <b>passive</b> <b>layers</b> were characterised by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, corrosion current density (i corr) and corrosion potential (E corr) monitoring. The effect of significant parameters, such as the pH in the HSSS/alkaline solution interface, {{the composition of the}} duplex stainless steels and the ageing of the <b>passive</b> <b>layer,</b> on the electrochemical performance of both induced and spontaneously grown passive films has been analysed. The increase of alkalinity highly influences the electrochemical performance of the passive film by promoting the formation of a <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> with a less resistant electrochemical response. The electrochemical behaviour of the <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> is also affected by the alloying elements like Mo or Ni.

30|$|The erosion {{corrosion}} mechanism {{increases corrosion}} reaction rate by continuously removing the <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> of corrosion {{products from the}} wall of the pipe. The <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> is a thin film of corrosion product that actually serves to stabilize the corrosion reaction and slow it down.

Addition of either ClO 3 (-) or ClO 4 (-) stimulated general corrosion and ruptured the <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> (stable pitting), with ClO 3 (-) being more aggressive than ClO 4 (-). Metastable pitting events appear as current oscillations (spikes) at potentials close to the pitting potential when Cl- ions are produced by cathodic reduction of ClO 3 (-) and ClO 4 (-) before <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> growth. Current-time measurements are performed at fixed potential after production of Cl- ions and show that the rate of metastable pitting and the intensity of current spikes increase with the potential and the concentration of aggressive anions. Concepts of thin film growth are applied to the <b>passive</b> <b>layer</b> formation in order to explain those results.
