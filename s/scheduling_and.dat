5|$|Double Dare is an American {{television}} {{game show}} on which two teams compete to win cash and prizes by answering trivia questions and completing messy stunts known as physical challenges. Hosted by Marc Summers, the program premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986, {{as its first}} game show. The series saw many adjustments in <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> titling throughout its run.|$|E

Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E

He and Byrd, however, had also disagreed over the decision to participate in bowl games in violation of conference rules. Tatum was opposed to it, as it greatly increased the difficulty of <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> had caused the reduction in number of home games.|$|E

5|$|Further {{testing of}} Silverplate B-29 {{aircraft}} and Thin Man and Fat Man bomb shapes {{was carried out}} at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944. Testing shifted to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, in October. Project Y controlled the <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> contents of the tests, which were {{carried out by the}} Flight Test Section of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit as Project W-47. The tests were supervised by Ramsey until November, when Commander Frederick Ashworth became Parson's head of operations, and assumed responsibility for the test program. The test bombs were assembled by the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit's Special Ordnance Detachment. Tests continued {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945. At first only the Ordnance Division's fuse and delivery groups were involved, but as the tests became more detailed, and live explosives were incorporated into the test bombs, other groups were drawn into the test program.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2008, amid {{complaints}} {{directed toward}} CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved {{a vote of}} no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, {{laid out in a}} thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, the board of trustees unanimously voted to their confidence and support of Ryan and extended his contract.|$|E

50|$|CalConnect, the Calendaring <b>and</b> <b>Scheduling</b> Consortium, is a {{partnership}} among vendors, developers, and customers to advance calendaring <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> standards <b>and</b> implementations.

The Consortium develops recommendations for improvement and extension of relevant standards, develops requirements and use cases for calendaring <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> specifications, conducts interoperability testing for calendaring <b>and</b> <b>scheduling</b> implementations, <b>and</b> promotes calendaring <b>and</b> <b>scheduling.</b>|$|R
5|$|The site is {{only able}} to {{communicate}} with LEO satellites in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which can communicate in all orbits. All three stations are interconnected and communicate with the Tromsø Network Operations Center, {{which is part of the}} TSS complex. This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to communicate with all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> conflict resolution, in addition to network planning, customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Waseda University, Saito played SimCity on the Macintosh, {{which prompted}} him to pursue video game creation after graduating. His first game was a simulation title {{that was part of}} a future media project for a publishing house. When Saito asked to develop a second, the business refused because it was not a video game company. He left the company to personally produce the second game, which built on ideas he conceived while working on his first: elevators and towers. Saito teamed up with freelance programmer Takumi Abe to complete the project. To research the gameplay, Saito contacted an elevator company to learn about elevator <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> management. However, the company declined to provide the information. Saito handled the graphic design, and started with a monochromatic scaled tower created in HyperCard. The designer added color to differentiate between office- and hotel-type buildings. As development neared completion, Saito noticed that the Mac's performance had improved and decided to increase the color palette size from 16 to 256colors. Saito enlisted a second designer to produce animation for the graphics and improve the details for the color increase.|$|E

30|$|S {{represents}} {{both the}} <b>schedule</b> <b>and</b> location of {{work as well}} as their adaptability. Based on the considerations above, we assume that work <b>schedules</b> <b>and</b> locations that fit in well with leisure activities provide more utility than those that do not. In addition, flexible <b>schedules</b> <b>and</b> locations provide more utility than inflexible ones, because they are more adaptable to changing circumstances for instance. Note that this is not much different from the usual assumptions about consumption and leisure in standard labour economics. Just like we assume that consumption and leisure are normal goods, i.e. that more consumption and more leisure “is better” {{in the sense that it}} provides more utility, we assume here that more flexibility in work <b>schedule</b> <b>and</b> location (i.e. more control over timing and location of work) and thus a better <b>schedule</b> <b>and</b> working time fit “is better” as well.|$|R
