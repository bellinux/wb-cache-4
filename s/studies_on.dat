The Panel <b>Study</b> <b>on</b> Korean Children was randomly sampled by using a stratified multi-stage sampling method.

Furthermore, based on the data gained through the Panel <b>Study</b> <b>on</b> Korean Children, policy makers can develop appropriate programs that stimulate positive development and prevent negative development of Korean young children throughout their life. Using the Panel <b>Study</b> <b>on</b> Korean Children, data to explore influences of child gender, temperament, of the characteristics of the mother and socioeconomic status on behavioral problems will enable researchers and policy makers to collaborate and develop methods to prevent behavioral problems.|$|R

These exercises in imitation may have allowed Proust to solidify his own style. In addition, in the spring and summer of the year Proust began work on several different fragments of writing that would later coalesce under the working title of Contre Sainte-Beuve. Proust described his efforts in a letter to a friend: [...] "I have in progress: a <b>study</b> <b>on</b> the nobility, a Parisian novel, an essay on Sainte-Beuve and Flaubert, an essay on women, an essay on pederasty (not easy to publish), a <b>study</b> <b>on</b> stained-glass windows, a <b>study</b> <b>on</b> tombstones, a <b>study</b> <b>on</b> the novel".|$|R
