40|$|Starry <b>stonewort</b> (Nitellopsis obtusa) is an alga {{that has}} emerged as an aquatic {{invasive}} species of concern in the United States. Where established, starry <b>stonewort</b> can interfere with recreational uses of water bodies and potentially have ecological impacts. Incipient invasion of starry <b>stonewort</b> in Minnesota provides an opportunity to predict future expansion in order to target early detection and strategic management. We used ecological niche models to identify suitable areas for starry <b>stonewort</b> in Minnesota based on global occurrence records and present-day and future climate conditions. We assessed sensitivity of forecasts to different parameters, using four emission scenarios (i. e., RCP 2. 6, RCP 4. 5, RCP 6, and RCP 8. 5) from five future climate models (i. e., CCSM, GISS, IPSL, MIROC, and MRI). From our niche model analyses, we found that (i) occurrences from the entire range, instead of occurrences restricted to the invaded range, provide more informed models; (ii) default settings in Maxent did not provide the best model; (iii) the model calibration area and its background samples impact model performance; (iv) model projections to future climate conditions should be restricted to analogous environments; and (v) forecasts in future climate conditions should include different future climate models and model calibration areas to better capture uncertainty in forecasts. Under present climate, the most suitable areas for starry <b>stonewort</b> are predicted {{to be found in}} central and southeastern Minnesota. In the future, suitable areas for starry <b>stonewort</b> are predicted to shift in geographic range under some future climate models and to shrink under others, with most permutations indicating a net decrease of the species' suitable range. Our suitability maps can serve to design short-term plans for surveillance and education, while future climate models suggest a plausible reduction of starry <b>stonewort</b> spread in the long-term if the trends in climate warming remain...|$|R

40|$|The aquatic isopod Asellus aquaticus can in some lakes {{be found}} as two {{different}} ecotypes; {{one in the}} habitat dominated by reed and one in <b>stonewort</b> stands. These ecotypes {{have been shown to}} differ in size, color and behavior. The reed ecotype is larger, darker and more active compared to the <b>stonewort</b> ecotype. In the two habitats there are different dominating predators: Invertebrate predators in the reed habitat and fish in the <b>stonewort</b> habitat. This project aims to examine how the presence of invertebrate predators and fish affect the two ecotypes of the isopod in regard to behavior and size composition in different substrates. To examine the effect on behavior the activity of isopods collected from Lake Tåkern was measured without and with chemical cues from perch and damselfly larva. The result of the behavior experiment showed no difference between the ecotypes nor the treatments. The lack of differences in the behavior indicates {{that there could be a}} variation between lakes. The effect on the size composition was examined by subjecting groups of isopods to predation by perch or damselfly larva in different substrate. The mean length of the group was measured before and after the trials. The size decreased significantly for the reed ecotype in <b>stonewort</b> substrate when subjected to predation by perch. The size for the <b>stonewort</b> ecotype increased significantly in reed substrate with damselfly larva as predator. The effect on size supports that the predators are the cause of the size difference between the ecotypes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{other group}} within the Viridiplantae are the mainly {{freshwater}} or terrestrial Streptophyta, {{which consists of}} the land plants together with the Charophyta, itself consisting of several groups of green algae such as the desmids and <b>stoneworts.</b> Streptophyte algae are either unicellular or form multicellular filaments, branched or unbranched. The genus Spirogyra is a filamentous streptophyte alga familiar to many, as it is often used in teaching {{and is one of}} the organisms responsible for the algal [...] "scum" [...] that pond-owners so dislike. The freshwater <b>stoneworts</b> strongly resemble land plants and are believed to be their closest relatives.

50|$|Charophyta is a {{division}} of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. With the cladistic inclusion of the Embryophyta, the Charophyta is synonymous with the Streptophyta. The sister group of the Charophytes are the Chlorophyta. Basal Chlorophyta are the Mesostigmatophyceae, the Chlorokybophyceae and an unnamed clade containing {{the remainder of the}} Charophyta. Some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagella are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in <b>stoneworts</b> (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil <b>stoneworts</b> of Devonian age that {{are similar to those of}} the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} express phenotypically plastic {{responses}} to environmental cues might be adaptive in changing environments. We studied phenotypic plasticity in mating behaviour {{as a response}} to population density and adult sex ratio in a freshwater isopod (Asellus aquaticus). A. aquaticus has recently diverged into two distinct ecotypes, inhabiting different lake habitats (reed Phragmites australis and <b>stonewort</b> Chara tomentosa, respectively). In field surveys, we found that these habitats differ markedly in isopod population densities and adult sex ratios. These spatially and temporally demographic differences are likely to affect mating behaviour. We performed behavioural experiments using animals from both the ancestral ecotype ("reed" isopods) and from the novel ecotype ("stonewort" isopods) population. We found that neither ecotype adjusted their behaviour in response to population density. However, the reed ecotype had a higher intrinsic mating propensity across densities. In contrast to the effects of density, we found ecotype differences in plasticity in response to sex ratio. The <b>stonewort</b> ecotype show pronounced phenotypic plasticity in mating propensity to adult sex ratio, whereas the reed ecotype showed a more canalised behaviour with respect to this demographic factor. We suggest that the lower overall mating propensity and the phenotypic plasticity in response to sex ratio have evolved in the novel <b>stonewort</b> ecotype following invasion of the novel habitat. Plasticity in mating behaviour may in turn have effects on the direction and intensity of sexual selection in the <b>stonewort</b> habitat, which may fuel further ecotype divergence...|$|R

50|$|Many botanists {{propose that}} the <b>stoneworts</b> and their {{relatives}} {{be placed in a}} division, sub-kingdom, or even kingdom by themselves, often named Charophyta.

50|$|Most Characeae {{are found}} in fresh water, usually in still, clear water where they attach to the {{substrate}} by rhizoids. They can be pioneer colonizers or ephemerals.

5000|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} the embryophytes are discussed further below, but they {{are believed to have}} evolved from within a group of complex green algae during the Paleozoic era (which started around [...] ).
