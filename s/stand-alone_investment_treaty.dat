40|$|This article {{examines}} five common justifications for the <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> system {{in order to}} highlight aspects {{of the system that}} give cause for concern. First, it examines whether <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> are a means to encourage foreign direct investment and concludes that this expectation is contradicted by common provisions in <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> and is unsupported by the preponderance of empirical evidence. If this justification was a factor in the decisions of states to conclude <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> - or of international organizations to promote them - then these decisions appear to have been based on incomplete knowledge and analysis of the anticipated benefits. Second, the {{article examines}} the claim that <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> respond to the bias and unreliability of domestic courts and criticizes <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> in this respect for being both under-inclusive (by extending access to international adjudication to a narrow class of private actors only) and over-inclusive (by failing to account for situations where domestic courts offer justice to a foreign investor). Third, the paper examines the claim that <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration advances the rule of law in the resolution of investor-state disputes and questions this claim after considering how <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration fails to incorporate keg institutional safeguards of judicial independence that are present in other adjudicative systems that resolve public law claims. Fourth, the paper examines the argument that <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> affirm the sovereignty and bargaining strategies of states and outlines tentative evidence that governments did not test carefully the anticipated benefits of the treaties, did not appreciate fully the risks of investor-state arbitration, and did not carry out sophisticated cost-benefit analyses prior to committing themselves to the <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> system. Finally, the paper examines the justification that <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> were endorsed by the democratic processes of states and draws attention both to the role of arbitrators in giving meaning to the treaties and to certain aspects of <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> that appear to undermine democratic choice. Based on this analysis, it is recommended that governments exercise greater care when considering entry into the system or, more likely, the maintenance or renewal of existing treaties, and that governments consider options for reform...|$|R

40|$|<b>Investment</b> <b>treaties</b> are {{triangular}} <b>treaties.</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>treaties</b> are {{entered into}} by two states {{but they are}} unusual because they provide enforceable protections to investors as third party beneficiaries. State A (the host state) agrees to provide certain protections to investors coming from State B (the home state). If the investor considers that these protections have been violated, <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> also grant the investor permission to bring an arbitral claim directly against the host state. <b>Investment</b> <b>treaties</b> clearly protect investors against certain unilateral actions by host states, such as expropriation without compensation. But do they also protect investors against unilateral actions by home states and collective actions by the treaty parties? For instance: can a home state settle an investor’s claim without the investor’s consent; can a host state rely on inter-state countermeasures as a defense in an investor-state dispute; and can the treaty parties jointly terminate the treaty with immediate effect? <b>Investment</b> <b>treaties</b> tend not to answer these questions, yet these second and third order questions are beginning to plague the field. These issues are important because they strike {{at the heart of}} the <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> system, requiring us to confront fundamental and unanswered questions about the nature and limits of <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> rights. In particular, what rights have been given to investors? And what powers have been retained by home and host states acting individually and the treaty parties acting collectively? Instead of following the existing path of analyzing whether <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> create procedural and/or substantive rights, I contend that <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> should be reconceptualized as agreements between sovereign states that create enforceable benefits for investors as non-sovereign, third party beneficiaries. This triangular approach produces a hybrid theory that draws on principles from public international law, domestic contract law, and public law, which can be used to create appropriate default rules for resolving the three controversies listed above...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze the {{following}} points {{from the standpoint}} of incentives for investors: (a) What functions does arbitration between investors and national governments with regard to <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> (<b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration) fulfill; and (b) what is the significance of specific system design with regard to arbitration, in particular the allowance of a choice between arbitration and domestic court hearings. Following the rapid {{increase in the number of}} <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> in recent years, <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration is attracting attention as a general dispute resolution mechanism for <b>investment</b> <b>treaties.</b> There has, however, been insufficient study with regard to the functions that <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration fulfills and, more specifically, how its procedures should be designed. In this paper, I focus on two specific aspects of court hearings and arbitration: first, their neutrality; and second, the consistency of judgments and the possibility of predicting them. I analyze how incentives for investors are influenced by the differences between court hearings and arbitration regarding these two factors, and the possibility of choosing between court hearings and arbitration. What this analysis clearly shows is that while it is not always desirable for investors to use arbitration, it is always desirable for investors to be able to choose between arbitration and court hearings, although their usefulness differs from situation to situation. If the situation involves issues implicitly assumed by traditional <b>investment</b> <b>treaties,</b> for example "incompetent and unfair courts, and competent and fair arbitration tribunals," then both will produce desirable results for investors. But at present such an assumption is not necessarily valid. In view of this, it is necessary to reexamine the functions of arbitration itself and the most desirable form of its procedures. ...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the later}} {{half of the}} 1990 s, {{there has been a}} {{remarkable}} rise in the use of investor-versus-state arbitration clauses under <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> (hereinafter "investment treaty arbitration"). Points at issue that have frequently been raised in arbitration under <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> include (1) obligations to compensate for expropriation, (2) obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment, and (3) obligations to grant most-favored nation treatment. Of these, the first two points are often incorporated into arbitration decisions in cases where an investing company has suffered losses in a host country. It is rare that an arbitration tribunal supports an investing company's demand concerning compensation for expropriation. Regarding fair and equitable treatment, however, investors are often awarded compensation, with arbitration tribunals recognizing extensive rights of investors, and adopting a broader interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment obligations than is provided for under general international law (e. g., Metalclad v. Mexico, S. D. Myers v. Canada, Pope and Talbot v. Canada). As to the third point, most-favored nation treatment, recent arbitrations have upheld the principle that the government of a host country must ensure such treatment not only in substance but also in procedure (e. g., E. A. Maffezini v. Spain). This has raised the question of just how far the MFN obligation extends, shedding light on the hitherto undefined scope of the MFN principle. Through these arbitration decisions concerning the accordance of fair and equitable treatment and MFN treatment, it now widely recognized that a host country's obligation to grant such treatment is greater than many countries believed they had undertaken under the various <b>investment</b> <b>treaties.</b> This has prompted some to question the legitimacy of <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration. The question being asked is how a group of anonymous foreigners (arbitrators), in a case brought at the initiative of another foreigner (an investor), can conclude "behind closed doors" (i. e., where open and fair procedures are not ensured) that a decision taken by the national government, which represents all the people of a country, is illegal. Adding fuel to their anger is resentment over the fact that only foreign investors are entitled to use <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration; such mechanisms are not available to domestic investors. This leads to charges of "reverse discrimination. " In response to such criticism, measures are being studied to improve the transparency of <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration, as well as to ensure the consistency of arbitration decisions. At the same time, however, some countries are wary of and moving away from <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration, concluding <b>investment</b> agreements that do not adopt <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration as a means of dispute settlement (e. g., the investment chapter of the U. S. -Australia Free Trade Agreement). The increasing use of <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration shows that the legalization of international relations (or the institutionalization of third-party dispute settlement procedures) is proceeding beyond the framework of the World Trade Organization. In the past, investors typically turned to arbitration with a complaint against the government of a host country only after withdrawing from the country. Recently, however, there have been an increasing number of cases where an investing company files a complaint while maintaining its operations in the host country. On the side of investors, {{it should be noted that}} the increased use of <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration has resulted in greater predictability in the investment environment. Meanwhile, governments, as users of <b>investment</b> <b>treaties</b> or free trade agreements (FTAs) that include provisions for investment, should, when negotiating such a treaty or agreement, bear in mind, that fair and equitable treatment and MFN treatment obligations may generate unforseen impacts when linked to <b>investment</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration. ...|$|R
