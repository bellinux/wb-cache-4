5|$|Bids for {{construction}} were forwarded to the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin approved the submission by John Brown & Company {{to construct the}} hull and machinery, with <b>separate</b> <b>contracts</b> awarded to Armstrong and Vickers for the battlecruiser's armament. The total cost of construction was set at £2million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and the builders to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian Government, and a close watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain Francis Haworth-Booth, the Australian Naval Representative in London.|$|E

5|$|Detailed {{design on}} {{the first stage of}} the freeway, from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the {{northern}} edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. The design included a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three <b>separate</b> <b>contracts.</b> Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary Bailey Bridge over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} of Sunshine State Parkway gas stations and service centers were originally bid out under <b>separate</b> <b>contracts,</b> {{and as a}} result, differing petroleum brands operated concurrently along the Parkway, with varying levels of service and pricing. This practice was discontinued in 1995 when all service center operations were combined to improve supply and continuity of service; with Martin Petroleum, a Florida Corporation, operating the stations with Citgo brand fuel at its stations. Since then, the Venezuelan government, under President Hugo Chávez, nationalized Citgo, and in 2006, political controversy resulted in a movement to remove the brand from the turnpike. Currently, the gas stations are under the Shell Brand.|$|E
25|$|Plevins issued three <b>separate</b> <b>contracts</b> for the Colmore Row {{range of}} the hotel and {{construction}} work started in 1875 {{on the corner of}} Church Street. The hotel opened on 1 February 1879, with 100 rooms and a further 60 unfinished at the time of opening. Other facilities included a restaurant with an entrance fronting Church Street, two coffee rooms and stock rooms. The stock rooms were an exhibition space where businessmen could demonstrate their new products and were built as the hotel aimed to attract most of its clients from commercial visitors from out of town. The hotel was let to Arthur Field, a hotel operator from Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1880 the hotel was extended, when the corner of Church Street and Barwick Street was built.|$|E

25|$|As {{they are}} not {{organized}} by the PGA Tour itself, certain events (such as the major championships) {{are not part of}} the overall broadcast contracts, but are broadcast under <b>separate</b> <b>contracts</b> with their respective organizers. CBS carries the Masters Tournament and the PGA Championship, the first and last majors of the year, over broadcast television, with ESPN serving as its Masters cable partner for early round action and TNT serving that role for the PGA Championship. As of 2015, as part of an agreement with the United States Golf Association, the year's second major, the U.S. Open, is carried by Fox Sports and is usually carried over broadcast television each day of the tournament. Beginning in 2016, The Open Championship, the year's third major, airs on NBC, with cable coverage on the Golf Channel (previously, ESPN had carried the entire tournament).|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Disney and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{entered into}} a {{licensing}} contract that gave Disney worldwide rights to use the MGM brand and logo for what would become Disney-MGM Studios, which included working production facilities for movies and television shows and a satellite animation studio, which began operation prior to the park's debut. In 1988, MGM/UA responded by filing a lawsuit that claimed Disney violated the agreement by operating a working movie and television studio at the resort. On May 1, 1989, the theme park opened adjacent to the production facilities, with MGM's only affiliation being the original licensing agreement that allowed Disney to use MGM's name and lion logo in marketing, and <b>separate</b> <b>contracts</b> that allowed specific MGM content {{to be used in}} The Great Movie Ride. When the park first opened, the only two attractions were the Studio Backlot Tour and the Great Movie Ride.|$|E
25|$|Having {{conducted}} {{the survey and}} steered the bill through Parliament, Telford {{does not appear to}} have been involved in the construction of the canal. Tenders received for the work varied wildly in price, and he chose those that he thought best, as well as contributing £1000, but after that, the civil engineering was managed by William Crosley, a job which he carried out to a high standard. He had previously been working on the northern end of the Lancaster Canal, but resigned from that post to work on the Macclesfield Canal. Construction of the canal began at Bollington on 4 December 1826, with a ceremonial cutting of the first sod. The northern section from Bosley Locks to Marple was awarded as five <b>separate</b> <b>contracts,</b> and work progressed steadily. The Trent and Mersey Canal had managed to get a clause inserted into the enabling Act that required them to build the final mile (1.6km) of the canal where it joined theirs, and to charge tolls to those using it. By the time the committee met in 1828, much of the northern end of the canal was nearing completion, and contracts for the three sections from Bosley to the Trent and Mersey had been awarded. No work had started on the locks, as the contractor was busy opening a quarry on the nearby hill called Bosley Cloud, and building a railway to carry the quarried stone to the lock sites.|$|E

A <b>separate</b> <b>contract</b> was awarded for water and sewer utility work, for $61,319. Work began in July 1963 and stopped in late October for the winter. It resumed in July 1964, running through October, and again in 1965. The visitor center was completed on August 27, 1966. A <b>separate</b> <b>contract</b> for parking lot and site improvements was completed on September 12, 1966 {{at a cost of}} $168,176. Gewalt was the supervising architect through construction.|$|R

Five multinational companies have been shortlisted for two <b>separate</b> <b>contracts,</b> jointly worth an estimated $8 billion (Rs37,600 crore), to manufacture and supply locomotives for the Indian Railways. In the past, Indian Railways manufactured locomotives at the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works in West Bengal or from state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, and diesel locomotives from Diesel Locomotive Works in Varanasi. These factories now have developed capacity issues. Germany’s Siemens AG, Bombardier Transportation India Ltd, a unit of Canada’s Bombardier Inc., and France’s Alstom SA is attempting to secure an order to build and supply at least 660 electric locomotives for the railways. General Electric Co. (GE) and Electro Motive Diesel Inc. (EMD) will compete for the second contract—to build and supply 1,000 diesel train engines for the national transporter.|$|E

A feng shui consultant was used during the design process as its implementation {{is important to the}} large Chinese Canadian population in Richmond. The initial design cost $206 million, but this was cut back by removing features. One that was kept was an underground parking lot under the venue, which increased construction cost with $23 million. The city split the construction work into 23 <b>separate</b> <b>contracts.</b> The city sent delegations to sixteen ovals around the world, costing $459,000. It was topped off on spending $120,000 to send nine officials, including the mayor and a councilor, to attend the 2006 Winter Olympics. Project management was contracted to MHPM Project Managers, construction manager was Dominion Fairmile Construction and structural engineers were Fast + Epp and Glotman Simpson, with the former responsible for the roof structure and façade and the latter for the base building.
