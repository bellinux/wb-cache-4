40|$|Food drying methods {{nowadays}} {{are mostly}} in high use {{of electricity and}} fuel which lead to high operational cost. This {{has resulted in a}} waste of energy and money due to the use of modern tools requires significant costs for implementation. Meanwhile, the traditional food drying process only uses sun rays in their process, where the process is far more efficient than the modern drying method. In this study, the test was conducted to determine the <b>trapped</b> <b>solar</b> heat energy requirements for the process of drying foods such as agricultural products, particularly bananas. The <b>solar</b> <b>trap</b> test by using <b>solar</b> <b>trap</b> container was carried out include determining the thermal energy requirement for drying, preparing equipment (<b>solar</b> <b>trap</b> container) to <b>trap</b> <b>solar</b> energy, handling and drying tests on samples of bananas. The percentage amount of water removal and energy required for the drying process was found to be 48 % and 134 J. The results of this study can determine that <b>solar</b> <b>trap</b> drying method is easier, quicker and more effective than the usual method of drying because it use natural solar energy. Several proposals have been suggested for improvement for future study, such as controlling the <b>solar</b> <b>trap</b> air in the container, replacing the <b>trap</b> <b>solar</b> wall with a darker color, examining the floors slope so that more <b>solar</b> <b>traps</b> collected and installing a small hose on the base of the container so that the water evaporated in the <b>solar</b> <b>trap</b> may exit through the route...|$|R

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 5 reviews. Neil Martinez-Belkin XXL gave the album an L, saying [...] "In all, <b>Trap</b> <b>House</b> III is Gucci’s strongest effort this year, perhaps his best since his 2012 “comeback tape,” Trap Back. The booming production and the Brick Squad CEO’s natural charisma make it so. The two aforementioned Auto-Tuned records also serve as proof that Gucci’s still more than capable of surprising listeners with some unexpected tricks up his sleeve. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Good times, some redundant numbers, all of it jumbled together, and everything else returning fans are used to (or frustrated by). Just be aware, Gucci's inspired by more serene and soft moments at this point, so call this the most [...] "couch locked" [...] of all <b>Trap</b> <b>Houses</b> and get prepared to sprawl out for a long, low ride." ...|$|R
