HTC would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use the remaining microphones it acquired in good faith; the offending component was replaced with an alternative version in future production runs.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E

5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make the Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and {{would be able to}} control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E

Skinner, however, dismisses his {{concerns}} and sends him home. While leaving, Doggett has a hallucination of Tipet, ordering him to kill Scully. Suddenly, Doggett finds himself in front of Scully. Rather than kill his partner, he turns the axe upon himself. Doggett is immediately awakened from his dark reverie and finds himself in his bedroom, with Scully standing over his bed. He begins to thank her for saving his life, but she informs him that Tipet died due to his coma.|$|E

5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
