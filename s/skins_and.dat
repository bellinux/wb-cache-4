It may be complicated <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> structure infection or uncomplicated <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> structure infection. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration has called them acute bacterial <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> <b>skin</b> structure infections (ABSSSI). ABSSSI are common and encompass {{a variety of}} disease presentations and severity. Increased antimicrobial resistance among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is the main problem in treatment. So, development of newer agents to fight against resistant microbes is the need of the hour. Ceftaroline, a newer cephalosporin, is one promising agent...|$|R

5|$|In 1836, British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson {{proclaimed the}} red-eared cat {{commonly}} found in Nepal to be a lynx and therefore named it Lynchus erythrotus; Ceylonese naturalist Edward Frederick Kelaart described the first jungle cat skin from Sri Lanka in 1852 and stressed upon its close resemblance to Hodgson's red cat. William Thomas Blanford pointed out the lynx-like appearance of cat <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> skulls from the plains around Yarkant County and Kashgar when he described Felis shawiana in 1876.|$|E
5|$|In rivercane basketweaving among Southeastern Woodlands {{tribes in}} the Americas, {{butternut}} (Juglans cinerea) and yellow root (Xanthorhiza simplicissima) provide a rich yellow color. Chitimacha basket weavers have a complex formula for yellow that employs a dock plant (most likely Rumex crispus) for yellow. Navajo artists create yellow dyes from small snake-weed, brown onion <b>skins,</b> <b>and</b> rubber plant (Parthenium incanum). Rabbitbush (Chrysothamnus) and rose hips produce pale, yellow-cream colored dyes.|$|E

A 2004 study of <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.|$|E

5|$|Its growing rarity {{increased}} interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, {{the last two}} confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, {{off the coast of}} Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A record of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird.|$|E
40|$|Grape {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and widely {{cultivated}} fruits in the world. Although grape <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seeds are waste product of the winery and grape juice industry, these wastes contain large amounts of phytochemicals such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and anthocyanidins, which play an important role as chemopreventive and anticancer agents. We evaluated efficacies of grape <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seeds on hepatic injury induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in rats. Treatment with DMN significantly increased levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. Diet supplementation with grape skin or seeds (10 % daily for 4 weeks) prevented these elevations. The grape <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seeds also restored serum albumin and total protein levels, and reduced the hepatic level of hydroxyproline and malondialdehyde. Furthermore, grape <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seeds reduced DMN-induced collagen accumulation, as estimated by histological analysis of liver tissue stained with Sirius red. Grape <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seeds also reduced hepatic stellate cell activation, as assessed by α-smooth muscle actin staining. In conclusion, grape <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seeds exhibited in vivo hepatoprotective and antifibrogenic effects against DMN-induced liver injury, suggesting that grape <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> seeds may be useful in preventing the development of hepatic fibrosis...|$|R

5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet.

Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E
