5|$|Jurassic Park's lead {{computer}} programmer, Dennis Nedry, {{having been}} bribed by Hammond's corporate rival Lewis Dodgson, deactivates the park's security system {{to gain access}} to the embryo storage room where he steals the valuable fetilized embryos. Nedry stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry, the power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the Tyrannosaurus injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} razor has a rotating, vibrating or oscillating {{blade to}} remove unwanted hair. The electric razor {{does not require}} the use of <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> soap, or water. The razor is powered by a small DC motor, and usually has rechargeable batteries, though early ones were powered directly by house current. The electric razor was invented in 1928 by Col. Jacob Schick.|$|E
25|$|In August 1973 while Rawat was in Detroit {{to receive}} an award, he was slapped {{in the face with}} a <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> pie by Pat Halley, a radical journalist. Rawat said {{that he did not want}} his {{attacker}} arrested or hurt, but Halley was himself attacked a few days later and seriously injured. When local members heard of the incident they notified Rawat who requested that DLM conduct a full investigation. Two followers were identified as the assailants and the police were immediately notified but the Detroit police declined to initiate extradition proceedings. There was speculation that the lack of action by the Detroit police may have been connected with Halley's radical politics.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{disadvantages of}} shaving soap {{is lack of}} convenience and space. Creating the lather and preparing the face is more time consuming than with other <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b> In addition, use of a shaving mug and optionally a lather bowl, consumes more space and takes more time than most <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> do.|$|R
50|$|Propane {{is used as}} a {{propellant}} {{for many}} household aerosol sprays, including <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> and air fresheners.|$|R
50|$|Shaving soaps {{typically}} {{cost more}} initially, when the shaving mug and soap is purchased. These costs can be significantly reduced by using mugs and bowls {{found in the}} kitchen, or purchased for a small amount at resale stores. Even though shaving soaps may cost more initially when buying the soap and equipment, {{over a longer period}} of time, shaving soaps are comparable in cost, or even cheaper than many <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b> Furthermore, <b>shaving</b> soaps have less ecological impact with respect to aerosol <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b>|$|R
500|$|Aloe vera {{is used on}} facial tissues {{where it}} is {{promoted}} as a moisturiser and anti-irritant to reduce chafing of the nose. Cosmetic companies commonly add sap or other derivatives from Aloe vera to products such as makeup, tissues, moisturizers, soaps, sunscreens, incense, <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> or shampoos. A review of academic literature notes that its inclusion in many hygiene products is due to its [...] "moisturizing emollient effect".|$|E
500|$|Rogers {{also has}} a {{publicly}} disclosed set of habits. He has had a diet, which includes on average more than one meal a day from McDonald's at least since college. [...] He only eats simple familiar foods and will return an order because a vegetable touched his meat. [...] His family's long-time (over 40 years) housekeeper, claims that he buys things such as <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> and deodorant in sixes and that he changes his toothbrush every other week. [...] He collects teddy bears (especially Winnie the Pooh).|$|E
500|$|Most of the Snow Hill scenes filmed at Elios {{were shot}} at night {{so that the}} fake [...] "snow" [...] looked more convincing; 26 tons of <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> was used to give the street a snowbound look. For the {{daylight}} scenes, the Elios set was swathed in fog, to disguise {{the fact that the}} surrounding countryside had no snow. Camera overexposure was also occasionally used to avoid continuity errors. The film's costumes were designed by Enrico Job (the husband of director Lina Wertmüller), and were influenced by hippie fashion styles, including mufflers, shawls, and outfits made of fur and leather; Corbucci was known for standing heavily against the hippie subculture. Like other Spaghetti Westerns, the film was shot silent so that post-production dubbing could be performed in multiple languages.|$|E
5000|$|Boro-glycerine {{found its}} way into many [...] "medicinal" [...] products, {{including}} <b>shaving</b> <b>creams,</b> in which it was considered a skin conditioner, and applied directly as a lip balm ...|$|R
25|$|In lower concentrations, it {{is found}} in toothpastes, shampoos, <b>shaving</b> <b>creams,</b> and bubble bath formulations, {{for its ability to}} create a foam (lather), for its {{surfactant}} properties, and in part for its thickening effect.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{television}} commercials for Noxzema <b>Shave</b> <b>Cream</b> by the William Esty Advertising Agency caused a sensation when model Gunilla Knutson asked men to [...] "take it off, {{take it all}} off" [...] (referring to facial hair).|$|R
500|$|Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) {{noted that}} the [...] "red reality" [...] is real because she shows up in that world first, {{and in the other}} the next day. Dr. Evans helps Michael with the case in the [...] "green reality", while Lee insisted that the picture Evans noted is fake. Michael and Hannah speak about Kate in the [...] "red reality", when he finds out that her sister had died earlier. Michael thinks that she must be on the cocaine because of that. He shows Rex what they use to do together, Rex is {{depressed}} and mad, while Rex walks off claiming that he is studying for a Spanish test at school. Later, they go to a man's house who has a video camera at his house. This helps Michael with the case in the [...] "green reality". Vega and Michael continue on the case, and Michael goes to the house. Vega says nothing is there, while Michael thinks to his [...] "green reality", and looks in the bathroom for evidence, which was <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> in the cabinet. They speak to Cameron Fuller and Darin Knox, who committed the crime. Evidence was that a drink was dropped on the person who had fallen in the lake. Soon after, Dr. Wild finds evidence from the camera that Kate and her friend had done the crime. She finally confesses to it. They speak in both realities about the story of how it came to the current life. Michael speaks to Rex, again. Rex claimed that he was mad because the racquet was Hannah's, and that it helped him deal with her death in the [...] "green reality". Rex goes to the tennis court and apologized to Cole who forgives him.|$|E
2500|$|Norman Gunston {{interviews}} Caroline Jones; Delilah; and Diana Dors (from BBC2 UK special). Marathon telethon 1976. Norman's dreamtime: [...] "How the <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> gets in a lather". Gunston concludes {{show with}} duet with Delilah.|$|E
2500|$|Stearic acid {{is mainly}} {{used in the}} {{production}} of detergents, soaps, and cosmetics such as shampoos and <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> products. Soaps are not made directly from stearic acid, but indirectly by saponification of triglycerides consisting of stearic acid esters. [...] Esters of stearic acid with ethylene glycol, glycol stearate, and glycol distearate are used to produce a pearly effect in shampoos, soaps, and other cosmetic products. They are added to the product in molten form and allowed to crystallize under controlled conditions. [...] Detergents are obtained from amides and quaternary alkylammonium derivatives of stearic acid.|$|E
50|$|Wet Lubricants is a {{brand of}} {{personal}} lubricants produced by Wet International, part of Trigg Laboratories in Las Vegas. The line includes a variety of water-based and silicone-based lubricants, as well as massage oils and <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Super-Max is a {{brand of}} {{disposable}} shaving blades, disposable razors and system razors amongst other personal care products {{for both men and}} women. The brand commenced operations in 1940 and has gained an experience of over 50-years in making shaving blades. Super-Max also offers toiletries which ranges from <b>shaving</b> <b>creams,</b> <b>shaving</b> foams, shaving gels, after-shave splash and balm and deodorants.|$|R
50|$|A non-aerosol cream that {{simulated}} {{the original}} product {{was created in}} 2003, but was reformulated to the Barbasol Non-Aerosol Therapeutic <b>Shave</b> <b>Cream</b> in 2006 (Pfizer also had a similar simulation of the original Barbasol cream, but discontinued it in 1999).|$|R
2500|$|In addition, {{there can}} be similar rites of {{passages}} associated with parts of naval and military life, which do not constitute true initiations as the participants are already and remain {{members of the same}} community. One such rite is associated with crossing the equator on board a naval ship, but it can even be taken by passengers on board a cruise liner, who are not and do not become members of anything but the so-called [...] "equator crossing club". Another form, “Kissing the Royal Belly” or “Royal Baby”, calls for initiates to kneel before {{a senior member of the}} crew, who wears a mock diaper. This “Baby” usually has a huge stomach covered with greasy materials ranging from cooking oil to mustard, <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> eggs, and oysters. Junior sailors must lick the Baby’s navel area, while the [...] "baby" [...] grabs and shakes their head to better smear the goo onto their faces.|$|E
2500|$|Ivanov, an exiled Russian {{and former}} {{military}} officer living in Berlin, {{has taken up}} employment as a barber; an apt position, Nabokov notes, as Ivanov's sharp facial appearance had earned him the nickname [...] "Razor" [...] in his earlier life. On a hot day, an unnamed character dressed largely in black enters the barber's, deserted save for Ivanov, and requests a shave. Ivanov quickly realises that the customer is a fellow Russian who, the reader gathers, tortured Ivanov during Russia's period of revolutionary upheaval. With the unnamed character sitting in the chair, his face lathered with <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> Ivanov reminds him of their last encounter. Ivanov then proceeds begins to shave him, recounting their previous meeting while also strongly hinting at the effect that one slip of the razor could have. The reader half expects Ivanov to exact his revenge. But having told his story, Ivanov relents and the terrified and clean-shaven Soviet flees from the barber's.|$|E
2500|$|That night, Hugh somehow {{manages to}} get out of his locked room and is found outside Diana's room, a bloodied knife in his hands from having killed a cat. Hugh recovers {{consciousness}} and tells the others he intends to go out shooting rabbits. It is clear that his real intention is to commit suicide in the woods with a shotgun and therefore save himself and the others further pain. Poirot stops him and tells them all that Hugh is being set up to commit suicide. He is being poisoned with Datura. The alkaloid produces hallucinations and causes great thirst. It is being given to Hugh as part of his <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> and thereby continually entering his system with each day's application. Poirot took a sample to the chemist for testing. As to who is responsible ... Poirot reveals that Admiral Chandler has inherited the insanity of his family but Hugh is not his biological son. Hugh is the natural son of Colonel Frobisher who had an affair with Mrs Chandler before he went to India. The Admiral recognised the resemblance in his son to his friend and learned the truth from his wife before she died in that curious [...] "boating accident". He blocked Hugh from seeing a doctor who would have confirmed his sanity.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{commercial}} creams {{are often}} sold in spray cans, {{but can also}} be purchased in tubs or tubes. <b>Shaving</b> <b>creams</b> in a can are commonly dispensed as a foam and sometimes as a gel that starts turning into foam as it is rubbed into the skin, also known as post-foaming <b>shaving</b> gel. <b>Creams</b> that are in tubes or tubs are commonly used with a shaving brush to produce a rich lather (most often used in wet shaving).|$|R
50|$|Recently, Barbasol {{released}} Sensitive Skin, Mountain Blast (a new fragrance), and Arctic Chill (menthol) to {{its line}} of <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b> Several aftershave products {{have also been}} introduced under the Barbasol brand name. More recently, Barbasol has introduced disposable razors in twin-blade, three-blade, and six-blade versions.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s, Dial {{became the}} best-selling {{deodorant}} soap in the US. The company adopted the slogan [...] "Aren't you glad you use Dial? Don't you wish everybody did?" [...] in 1953. In the 1960s, Armour expanded the Dial line with deodorants and <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The toilet of Amelius, {{simple as}} it was, had its mysteries for Rufus. He {{was at a loss}} among the perfumes. They were all {{contained}} in a modest little dressing case, without labels of any sort to describe the contents of the pots and bottles. He examined them one after another, and stopped at some recently invented French shaving-cream. [...] "It smells lovely," [...] he said, assuming it to be some rare pomatum. [...] "Just what I want, it seems, for my head." [...] He rubbed the <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> into his bristly iron-gray hair, until his arms ached. When he had next sprinkled his handkerchief and himself profusely, first with rose water, and then (to make quite sure) with eau-de-cologne used as a climax, he felt that he {{was in a position to}} appeal agreeably to the senses of the softer sex. In five minutes more, he was on his way to Mr. Farnaby's private residence.|$|E
50|$|A Colgate-Palmolive {{advertisement}} {{claimed that}} its Palmolive Rapid Shave <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> {{was so good}} {{it could be used}} to shave sandpaper. The commercial showed sandpaper applied with <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> and then shaved.|$|E
50|$|The first can of {{pressurized}} <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> was Rise <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> {{which was}} introduced by Carter-Wallace in 1949. By the following decade this format attained two-thirds of the American market for shaving preparations. The gas in <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> canisters originally contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but this substance was increasingly believed to be detrimental to the Earth's ozone layer. This led to restrictions or reductions in CFC use, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency ban in the late 1970s. Gaseous hydrocarbon propellants such as mixtures of pentane, propane, butane and isobutane could be used instead of the CFCs. Because of the large proportion of water in pressurized <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> the risk from the normally flammable hydrocarbons was reduced.|$|E
25|$|Nonoxynol-9 is {{sometimes}} included in <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> for its properties as a nonionic surfactant; it helps break down skin oils that normally protect hair from moisture, {{so that they}} become wet and, hence, softer and easier to shave. Gillette formerly used nonoxynol-9 for this purpose in its Foamy products, but has discontinued the practice.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1930s, Beiersdorf began {{producing}} {{such products}} as tanning oils, <b>shaving</b> <b>creams,</b> shampoo and facial cleanser and toners.

50|$|The {{beginning}} of The Mentholatum Company started when Albert Alexander Hyde left {{the real estate}} market in 1889. With the collapse of the market, Hyde established a new partnership called The Yucca Company, located in Wichita, Kansas, which focused on manufacturing and marketing <b>shaving</b> <b>creams,</b> laundry soap, and toilet soap. The Yucca Company was the {{beginning of}} The Mentholatum Company.|$|R
50|$|Karger {{moved to}} Los Angeles from Chicago and began acting. He {{appeared}} in a John Hughes-directed Edge <b>Shave</b> <b>Cream</b> commercial, as well as featured roles in Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law; Rich Man, Poor Man; Horshack! (a pilot for a spinoff from Welcome Back Kotter); and Airport - 1975. However, Karger continued to follow his passion for politics, and eventually landed with the Dolphin Group in 1977.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{advantages}} of shaving soap over aerosol <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> is the additional hydration provided by shaving soaps. For optimal softening of whiskers, the natural oils {{on the face}} and whiskers must be removed. After oil {{is removed from the}} whiskers by the shaving soap and brush, water can more easily penetrate the whiskers. This results in whiskers being more easily cut than when using soapless creams and not brushing.|$|R
