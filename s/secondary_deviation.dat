By definition and illustrating Hering's law, this <b>secondary</b> angle of <b>deviation</b> {{is greater than the}} primary one, measured with the sound eye fixing. We present here a comparative study of the amount of subjective excyclodeviation measured in patients suffering from IVth nerve palsy, with the sound or affected eye fixing. METHODS: Two groups of patients were entered into the study: Group 1 (N = 54) for superior oblique palsies studied retrospectively and Group 2 (N = 14), for a prospective study of those recently acquired (post-traumatic) and followed over 6 months. In both groups, measurements were made at two stages, early (1 to 7 weeks after onset) and late (4 to 6 months later). RESULTS: In both groups, the majority of cases showed a greater <b>secondary</b> torsional <b>deviation,</b> the difference between this and the primary deviation lessening on late stage measurements.

However, studies describing the influence of a structural LLD on upper limb motion are lacking. The current study therefore aimed at the evaluation of upper limb motion during gait in LLD patients compared to healthy controls.; Motion capture data from 14 patients with structural LLD and 15 healthy controls that were collected during barefoot walking at a self-selected speed were retrospectively analyzed. Specifically, kinematic parameters of the shoulder and elbow joints as well as the trunk segment were investigated and considered in relation to a minimal clinically important difference of 5 °.; The shoulders in LLD patients were kept constantly in a more extended and at initial contact in a more adducted position as compared to healthy controls. In addition, the patients' elbow joints showed increased flexion motion and the trunk segment indicated a constant trunk lateral-flexion and axial rotation tendency towards the affected side.; Patients with structural LLD indicated clinically relevant <b>secondary</b> <b>deviations</b> in shoulder and elbow motion. While some of these deviations were most likely passive physical effects, others might have occurred as active strategies to maintain balance or to regulate total body angular momentum. These findings contribute to the understanding of <b>secondary</b> gait <b>deviations</b> induced by a structural LLD and might serve as a basis for further investigations using complex musculoskeletal models...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Walking {{for healthy}} humans {{is a basic}} {{everyday}} activity. In patients, especially those with neurologic disorders, the walking pattern can strongly deviate from those of healthy humans. For clinicians {{it is crucial to}} distinguish between primary and <b>secondary</b> gait <b>deviations</b> to plan the appropriate treatment. Primary gait deviations are causative and the target of therapy. <b>Secondary</b> gait <b>deviations</b> can be either active compensation or passive physical effects. Both do not require treatment as they are resolved when the primary impairment is corrected. The focus of this thesis relied on the walking patterns of patients with different primary pa-thologies, e. g. patients with spasticity or orthopaedic patients. The aim was to identify princi-pals of a pathological gait, with intention that it can further assist in differentiating between primary and <b>secondary</b> gait <b>deviations.</b> Three-dimensional gait analysis, driven by a marker-based movement analysis system (VICON) provided the data. All studies had a retrospective study design. Besides joint kinematics and surface electromyographic (EMG) data, muscle strength data were also analysed. It was investigated which parameters, such as muscle strength or orthotics, influences the gait of patients besides the primary pathology. First, a method to detect a characteristic gait cycle for one subject was developed and evalu-ated. Based on Principal Component Analysis, the algorithm selects a trial that is closest to the median of all trials across different parameters, e. g. joint angle curves. The Selection Method for a Representative Trial (SMaRT) evaluates the data automatically, without subjec-tive bias, and provides full repeatability. Furthermore, SMaRT required 1. 4 s to analyse 100 datasets. Hereby, it was more than three orders of magnitude faster than the visual selection done by experts. Most importantly, the error rate of SMaRT with 1. 2...|$|R

In order to maintain proper function, secondary mechanisms are required. The aims of this systematic review were (1) to identify secondary mechanisms in pathologic gait that have been described throughout the scientific literature by means of instrumented gait analysis, (2) to distinguish between active compensatory mechanisms and passive physical effects and (3) to identify common compensatory mechanisms {{that appear to be}} independent from the underlying disease. A comprehensive literature search revealed 4080 citations for review, whereof 148 studies entered the full-text review. Thirty-six studies were included and the quality of these studies was assessed by two independent reviewers (kappa= 0. 83). The quality of the included studies showed large variation and several methodological issues were identified. Five studies were further identified describing only passive physical effects, leaving a total of 31 studies reporting on compensations. The qualitative analysis revealed common compensations that appeared to be independent from the underlying pathology. In clinical practice, distinguishing primary from <b>secondary</b> gait <b>deviations</b> can be considered highly important since unnecessary treatment may be avoided. However, given the introduction of general principles of compensatory mechanisms and the fact that certain presumed "compensations" were identified as simple passive physical effects, <b>secondary</b> gait <b>deviations</b> have to be further investigated. Computer simulation studies are valuable, especially in respect of the distinction between compensations and physical effects. Furthermore, the need for a uniform terminology was highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) {{equations}} with blade blockage and blade force {{source terms}} are solved in the meridional plane of complete axial flow turbomachinery using a finite-volume scheme. The equations of the compressible actuator disk (AD) {{are introduced to}} modify {{the evaluation of the}} convective fluxes at the leading and trailing edges (LEs and TEs). An AD behaves as a compact blade force which instantaneously turns the flow with no production of unphysical entropy. This avoids unphysical incidence loss across the LE discontinuity and allows for application of all of the desired deviation at the TE. Unlike previous treatments, the model needs no handmade modification of the throughflow (TF) surface and does not discriminate between inviscid and viscous meridional flows, which allows for coping with strong incidence gradients through the annulus wall boundary layers and with <b>secondary</b> <b>deviation.</b> This paper derives a generalized blade force term that includes the contribution of the LE and TE ADs in the divergence form of the TF equations and leads to generalized definitions of blade load, blade thrust, shaft torque, and shaft power. In analyzing a linear flat plate cascade with an incidence of 32 deg and a deviation of 21 deg, the proposed model provided a 105 reduction of unphysical total pressure loss compared to the numerical solution with no modeling. The computed mass flow rate, blade load, and blade thrust showed excellent agreement with the theoretical values. The complete RANS TF solver was used to analyze a four-stage turbine in design and off-design conditions with a spanwise-averaged incidence of up to 2 deg and 43 deg, respectively. Compared to a traditional streamline curvature solution, the RANS solution with incidence and deviation modeling provided a 0. 1 to 0. 7 % accurate prediction of mass flow rate, shaft power, total pressure ratio, and adiabatic efficiency in both the operating conditions. It also stressed satisfactory agreement concerning the spanwise distributions of flow angle and Mach number at LEs and TEs. In particular, <b>secondary</b> <b>deviation</b> was effectively predicted.

METHODS [...] A method for surgically correcting the vertical deviation and the pseudoptosis is described in three patients with longstanding third nerve palsy. By decreasing the ability of the non-involved eye to elevate, a fixation duress was created which eliminated the <b>secondary</b> <b>deviation</b> that characteristically occurs in such patients when the involved eye fixates. As a result of this technique, both eyes in all patients on attempted fixation were under similar duress, therefore requiring equal amounts of stimulation to move into the primary position. When the fixation duress was sufficient, elimination of the hypotropia and ptosis was achieved. Additionally, in order to correct the exotropia, generous recession and resection procedures in the involved eye and recession of the lateral rectus in the noninvolved eye were performed. RESULTS [...] Between 8 and 10 prism dioptres of esotropia were achieved and maintained in two patients. One patient had 20 prism dioptres of exotropia. Two patients had no residual ptosis and one required an additional anterior levator resection to achieve a satisfactory result.

This study investigated the effects of correcting lower extremity function by orthotics on spinal gait kinematics in hCP patients.; Ten adolescent hCP patients and 15 healthy controls were included. Using a validated and previously used enhanced marker set, sagittal and frontal plane spinal curvature angles as well as general trunk and lower extremity kinematics were measured while walking barefoot as well as with an orthotic correction (only hCP patients) using a 12 -camera motion capture system.; The hCP patients in both the barefoot and orthotic conditions indicated clinically relevant greater lumbar lordosis angles (d≥ 0. 96, p≤ 0. 071), smaller thoracic kyphosis angles (d≥ 0. 84, p≤ 0. 142) and differences in frontal plane lumbar curvature angles (d≥ 1. 00, p≤ 0. 105) compared to controls. However, these angles were not influenced by the successful restoration of a normal heel-to-toe gait pattern and the correction of any LLD using lower extremity orthotics.; Spinal gait deviations in adolescents with mild hCP seemed not to result secondarily from foot equinus or LLD, but probably from structural deformities such as hip flexor contractures.

40|$|This paper compares two {{theoretical}} {{perspectives on}} deviance, the behavioral and interactionist. Although these two perspectives arise from separate disciplines and intellectual traditions, we {{will argue that}} their approaches {{to the study of}} deviance in general and to mental illness in particular share many basic similarities, as well as some important differences, and that an analysis of each helps us understand the limitations and strengths of the other. The behavioral and interactionist perspectives are chosen for examination for three reasons. First, it is our opinion that these two theoretical approaches represent the most creative recent work by sociologists and psychologists on deviant behavior. Second, there are few attempts in the literature to integrate the perspectives (Ullman and Krasner, 1969; Singelmann, 1972; and Akers, 1973 are recent exceptions), and, in fact, the perspectives are often posed as antagonistic. Third, both perspectives share a rejection of the dominant psychiatric conceptualizations of deviant behavior and place greater emphasis on the social context of deviance. The discussion of these two perspectives will compare them by examining their approaches to one form of deviance, mental illness. Attention will be given to the similarities and dissimilarities of these perspectives in terms of concepts, propositions and methodology, with particular attention to areas of actual or potential crossfertilization.

40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview on the association between premature plantarflexor muscle activity (PPF), muscle strength, and equinus gait in patients with various pathologies. The purpose was to evaluate whether muscular weakness and biomechanical alterations are aetiological factors for PPF during walking, independent of the underlying pathology. In a retrospective design, 716 patients from our clinical database with 46 different pathologies (orthopaedic and neurologic) were evaluated. Gait analysis data of the patients included kinematics, kinetics, electromyographic activity (EMG) data, and manual muscle strength testing. All patients were clustered three times. First, patients were grouped according to their primary pathology. Second, all patients were again clustered, this time according to their impaired joints. Third, groups of patients with normal EMG or PPF, and equinus or normal foot contact were formed to evaluate the association between PPF and equinus gait. The patient groups derived by the first two cluster methods were further subdivided into patients with normal or reduced muscle strength. Additionally, the phi correlation coefficient was calculated between PPF and equinus gait. Independent of the clustering, PPF was present in all patient groups. Weak patients revealed PPF more frequently. The correlations of PPF and equinus gait were lower than expected, due to patients with normal EMG during loading response and equinus. These patients, however, showed higher gastrocnemius activity prior to foot strike together with lower peak tibialis anterior muscle activity in loading response. Patients with PPF and a normal foot contact possibly apply the plantarflexion-knee extension couple during loading response. While increased gastrocnemius activity around foot strike seems essential for equinus gait, premature gastrocnemius activity does not necessarily produce an equinus gait. We conclude that premature gastrocnemius activity is strongly associated with muscle weakness. It helps to control the knee joint under load independent from the underlying disease, and it is therefore a <b>secondary</b> <b>deviation.</b> If treated as primary target, caution should be exercised...|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of ground vibration from railway traffic represents {{a major challenge}} for railway operators, {{especially with regard to}} the increasing number of new lines built close to residential buildings. In this context, it becomes essential to have a model that accounts on the one hand for ground/structure interaction {{and on the other hand}} for wheel/rail interaction. In this paper, such a model is developed by combining two existing models. The model for ground/structure interaction, SIPROVIB, is an analytical model of a slab with Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis coupled to the ground in 3 D. The model for wheel/rail interaction is a computationally efficient time-domain model, where vehicle and track are represented by pre-calculated Green's functions. The wheel/rail contact is modelled as 3 D, non-linear and non-Hertzian. Both models are combined by replacing the track Green's function by a Green's function representing the ground and slab coupled to a simplified rail model. Numerical results showed that the influence of slab and ground on the dynamic wheel/rail contact forces increases for thinner slabs and softer grounds, but is generally of <b>secondary</b> importance. <b>Deviations</b> in contact force did not exceed 2 dB for frequencies up to 200 Hz. © 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA).

40|$|Introduction: Foot equinus and {{leg length}} {{discrepancy}} (LLD) are common problems {{in patients with}} hemiplegic cerebral palsy (hCP), each causing <b>secondary</b> <b>deviations</b> of pelvic motion during gait [1 – 3]. It is therefore plausible that the deviations in spinal kinematics observed in hCP patients occur secondarily as a compensation arising from the disturbed leg function and the associated changes {{in the position of}} the pelvis. Research question: Does the correction of lower extremity function by orthotics (ankle-foot-orthosis and heel lift) have an effect on spinal gait kinematics in hCP patients? Methods: A total of 10 adolescent hCP patients and 15 healthy controls participated in this study. Participants were equipped with 56 reflective markers (combination of Plug-in-Gait full body and IfB marker sets) and measured during barefoot walking at a self-selected speed using a 12 -camera motion analysis system (Vicon). Patients then wore shoes with orthotic corrections on the affected side and were measured again. Thoracic and lumbar spinal curvature angles in the sagittal and frontal planes (primary outcomes) as well as segmental trunk, lower extremity joint angles, and spatio-temporal gait parameters (secondary outcomes) were extracted and parameterized accordingly. Comparisons between populations and conditions were conducted using oneway analyses of variance with Tukey post hoc tests and effect sizes. To evaluate the clinical relevance of a difference, a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 58 was used for the angles. Results: The pathological toe-walking gait pattern during the barefoot condition was corrected into a normal heel-to-toe gait pattern when walking with the orthotic corrections. However, this seemed not to influence spinal or general trunk kinematics. Differences could only be found between the hCP patients and the healthy controls (see Figure). Discussion: Spinal gait deviations in adolescent patients with mild forms of hCP seemed to occur not as a secondary effect of a spastic equinus foot or an LLD but due to proximal abnormalities such as hip flexor contractions, which might have been long-term structural adaptations due to passive secondary effects of foot deformity. The question remains, however, whether lower extremity orthotics in younger patients and/or more severe cases of hCP would have different effects on spinal kinematics. In addition, all patients were used to walking with orthotics and might therefore have already adapted their barefoot walking pattern such that possible effects of orthotics have been diluted. Future research should consider investigating long-term effects of orthotics as well as the relation between spinal kinematics and disease severity. References [1] Brunner R, et al.

This leads us to consider the distinction between primary and secondary background effects. These were developed by Boudon (1974) in relation to the influence of social background on educational disadvantage (e.g., Becker and Müller 2011, p. 56 f.) and can also be transferred to the effects of gender.

40|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) is {{a complex}} syndrome, with {{multiple}} interactions between joints and muscles. Abnormalities in movement patterns can be measured using motion capture techniques, however determining which abnormalities are primary, and which are secondary, is a difficult task. Deformity of the foot has anecdotally been reported to produce compensatory abnormalities in more proximal lower limb joints, {{as well as in}} the contralateral limb. However, the exact nature of these compensations is unclear. The aim of this paper was to provide clear and objective criteria for identifying compensatory mechanisms in children with spastic hemiplegic CP, in order to improve the prediction of the outcome of foot surgery, and to enhance treatment planning. Twelve children with CP were assessed using conventional gait analysis along with the Oxford Foot Model prior to and following surgery to correct foot deformity. Only those variables not directly influenced by foot surgery were assessed. Any that spontaneously corrected following foot surgery were identified as compensations. Pelvic rotation, internal rotation of the affected hip and external rotation of the non-affected hip tended to spontaneously correct. Increased hip flexion on the affected side, along with reduced hip extension on the non-affected side also appeared to be compensations. It is likely that forefoot supination occurs <b>secondary</b> to <b>deviations</b> of the hindfoot in the coronal plane. Abnormal activity in the tibialis anterior muscle may be consequent to tightness and overactivity of the plantarflexors.

Addressing a key knowledge gap in modular VLP engineering, this study investigates the underlying fundamentals affecting the ability of induced antibodies to recognize the native pathogen. Specifically, this quality of immune response is correlated to the peptide antigen module structure. We modularized a helical peptide antigen element, helix 190 (H 190) from the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding region, for presentation on murine polyomavirus VLP, using two strategies aimed to promote H 190 helicity on the VLP. In the first strategy, H 190 was flanked by GCN 4 structure-promoting elements within the antigen module; in the second, dual H 190 copies were arrayed as tandem repeats in the module. Molecular dynamics simulation predicted that tandem repeat arraying would minimize <b>secondary</b> structural <b>deviation</b> of modularized H 190 from its native conformation. In vivo testing supported this finding, showing that although both modularization strategies conferred high H 190 -specific immunogenicity, tandem repeat arraying of H 190 led to a strikingly higher immune response quality, as measured by ability to generate antibodies recognizing a recombinant HA domain and split influenza virion. These findings provide {{new insights into the}} rational engineering of VLP vaccines, and could ultimately enable safe and efficacious vaccine design as an alternative to conventional approaches necessitating pathogen cultivation.

40|$|Abdomino-perineal {{resection}} (APR) is {{a commonly}} performed surgical procedure {{in the treatment}} of colonic and rectal cancer. This operation leaves the patient with a permanent colostomy and a large pelvic floor defect significantly contributing to patient morbidity. Sexual dysfunction, as a complication of APR, is often overlooked, because the focus remains on disease eradication and in most cases, there are limited if any adjunct treatments available. As the incidence of bowel cancer increases in younger populations, this can {{have a significant impact on}} the quality of life and wellbeing of women. It is well known that vaginal wall defects, incontinence and sexual dysfunction are expected complications of radical lower gastrointestinal and urological surgery. Vaginal axis <b>deviation</b> <b>secondary</b> to radical surgery is a rarer or perhaps less reported complication, which if left untreated, may have a significant impact on sexual function. To date, most case reports have dealt with concomitant vaginal reconstruction with myocutaneous flaps, but none have addressed surgical options that specifically target vaginal axis deviation. We present the first case of successful reconstructive surgery to alter vaginal axis in an attempt to reverse apareunia years after APR...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the extent to which the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based virtual 3 -dimensional (3 D) models of the intact orbit can approach that of the gold standard, computed tomography (CT) based models. The goal was to determine whether MRI is a viable alternative to CT scans in patients with isolated orbital fractures and penetrating eye injuries, pediatric patients, and patients requiring multiple scans in whom radiation exposure is ideally limited. Materials and Methods: Patients who presented with unilateral orbital fractures to the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital from March 2011 to March 2012 were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional study. The primary predictor variable was the imaging technique (MRI vs CT). The outcome measurements were orbital volume (primary outcome) and geometric intraorbital surface <b>deviations</b> (<b>secondary</b> outcome) between the MRI- and CT-based 3 D models. Results: Eleven subjects (9 male) were enrolled. The patients’ mean age was 30 years. On average, the MRI models underestimated the orbital volume of the CT models by 0. 50 0. 19 cm 3. The average intraorbital surface deviation between the MRI and CT models was 0. 34 0. 32 mm, with 78 2. 7...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: A common {{practice}} in X-ray crystallographic structure 15 refinement has been to model atomic displacements or thermal fluctuations as isotropic motions. Recent high-resolution data reveal, however, significant departures from isotropy, described by aniso-tropic displacement parameters (ADPs) modeled for individual atoms. Yet, ADPs are currently reported for a limited set of 20 structures, only. Results: We present a comparative analysis of the experimentally reported ADPs and those theoretically predicted by the anisotropic network model (ANM) for a representative set of structures. The relative sizes of fluctuations along different directions are 25 shown to agree well between experiments and theory, while the cross-correlations between the (x-, y- and z-) components of the fluctuations show considerable <b>deviations.</b> <b>Secondary</b> structure elements and protein cores exhibit more robust anisotropic characteristics compared to disordered or flexible regions. 30 The deviations between experimental and theoretical data are comparable to those between sets of experimental ADPs reported for the same protein in different crystal forms. These results {{draw attention to the}} effects of crystal form and refinement procedure on experimental ADPs and highlight the potential utility of ANM 35 calculations for consolidating experimental data or assessing ADPs in the absence of experimental data.

40|$|The present article {{proposes a}} novel {{methodology}} to evaluate secondary flows {{generated by the}} annulus boundary layers in complex cascades. Unlike two-dimensional (2 D) linear cascades, where the reference flow is commonly defined as that measured at midspan, {{the problem of the}} reference flowdefinition for annular or complex 3 D linear cascades does not have a general solution up to the present time. The proposed approach supports secondary flow analysis whenever exit streamwise vorticity produced by inlet endwall boundary layers is of interest. The idea is to compute the reference flow by applying slip boundary conditions at the endwalls in a viscous 3 D numerical simulation, in which uniform total pressure is prescribed at the inlet. Thus the reference flow keeps the 3 D nature of the actual flow except for the contribution of the endwall boundary layer vorticity. The resulting secondary field is then derived by projecting the 3 D flow field (obtained from both an experiment and a fully viscous simulation) along the local reference flowdirection; this approach can be proficiently applied to any complex geometry. This method allows the representation of secondary velocity vectors with a better estimation of the vortex extension, since it offers the opportunity to visualize also the region of the vortices, which can be approximated as a potential type. Furthermore, a proficient evaluation of the <b>secondary</b> vorticity and <b>deviation</b> angle effectively induced by the annulus boundary layer is possible. The approach was preliminarily verified against experimental data in linear cascades characterized by cylindrical blades, not reported for the sake of brevity, showing a very good agreement with the standard methodology based only on the experimental midspan flow field. This article presents secondary flows obtained by the application of the proposed methodology on two annular cascades with cylindrical and 3 D-designed blades, stressing the differences with other definitions. Both numerical and experimental results are considered...|$|R
