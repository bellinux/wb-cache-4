5|$|After {{becoming}} Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, Theodore of Tarsus {{resolved the}} situation by deposing Ceadda and restoring Wilfrid as the Bishop of Northumbria. For the next nine years Wilfrid discharged his episcopal duties, founded monasteries, built churches, and improved the liturgy. However his diocese was very large, and Theodore wished to reform the English Church, a process which included breaking up <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> dioceses into smaller ones. When Wilfrid quarrelled with Ecgfrith, the Northumbrian king, Theodore {{took the opportunity to}} implement his reforms despite Wilfrid's objections. After Ecgfrith expelled him from York, Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the papacy. Pope Agatho ruled in Wilfrid's favour, but Ecgfrith refused to honour the papal decree and instead imprisoned Wilfrid on his return to Northumbria before exiling him.|$|E

5|$|During the Western Han period, conscripted peasants were {{organized}} into work teams consisting of {{over a hundred}} thousand laborers. About 150,000 conscripted workers, serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over {{a total of five}} years, worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang'an, which were completed in 190 BC. Conscript laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various deities and the spirits of the emperor's ancestors. Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and Zhengguo Canal, built by the previous State of Qin and Qin dynasty (221â€“206 BC), respectively.|$|E
5|$|Each town in {{the colony}} was {{considered}} a single church congregation; in later years, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted {{to those who had}} converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required for acceptance. This was a more liberal doctrine than some other New England congregations, such as those of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.|$|E
5|$|Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is {{the best}} {{preserved}} southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Orcadian broch villages {{it is unlikely that}} the tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.|$|E

Because units of limitanei operated in one area, had their own camps, and often recruited from the same area, they tended to maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.|$|E

In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuffâ€”North America Tour 1985.

5|$|Private Ambulance Service â€“ Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response are <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E
