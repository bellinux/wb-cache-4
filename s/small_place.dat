The Castilian account of the First Siege of Gibraltar indicates {{that it was only}} a <b>small</b> <b>place,</b> with [...] "one thousand one hundred and twenty-five Moors" [...] within {{at the time of its}} fall. Only two siege engines and a few hundred men were needed to reduce it. After the conquest and the expulsion of the town's population, Ferdinand IV of Castile ordered the defences to be strengthened with the walls repaired, a keep constructed above the town and a dockyard (atarazana) to be built to house galleys. However, the main siege of Algeciras failed, and the Castilians struck a deal with the Granadan sultan allowing them to hold on to Gibraltar.|$|E

500|$|Allemannische Gedichte {{was very}} successful, {{and a new}} edition was {{published}} a year later, this time crediting the author. When Hebel read the poems aloud to margrave Charles Frederick, the duke praised them, and Hebel noticed his exact local knowledge: [...] "I am surprised how the margrave knew all the villages, every <b>small</b> <b>place,</b> every shrub and hedge from Utzenfeld to Lörrach, and could always say: this is this, and yes, that's how it is." [...] In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: [...] "In certain moments I feel all proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that I could make our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame".|$|E

[...] The spot is now referred to as the [...] "high-water mark" [...] of the Confederacy, not only because it was the furthest position reached by Confederate troops during the charge but also because the failure of Pickett's Charge is regarded as the major turning point of the Civil War.

[...] The regiment had been placed slightly to the south of the [...] "copse of trees" [...] which served as the target of the Confederate units during the charge. [...] The 19th Massachusetts was in line with the 42nd New York. [...] The two units were the second line of defense in their brigade.|$|E
