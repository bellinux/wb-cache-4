40|$|The {{influence}} of varying laser trim {{patterns on the}} electrical performance of a novel CuAlMo thin film resistor material were investigated. The benefits and limitations of various trim geometries were considered before two patterns, the ‘L’ cut and <b>serpentine</b> <b>cut,</b> were selected to laser trim resistor samples to target values of 1 to 10 Ω, using previously optimized laser conditions. The effect of increasing trim gain and varying trim pattern on the stability and standard deviation of the films were then systematically investigated. A two stage trimming process was utilized to reduce resistance drift figures to < 0. 1 % following storage for 168 hours at 125 °C in air and also allowed much tighter resistance tolerances of < ± 0. 1 % to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1949 Presentation date: 1948 - 06 - 11 The area {{studied in}} detail, {{known as the}} Antone District, {{is located in the}} {{southeast}} corner of Wheeler County, Oregon,, between longitude 119 37. and 119 ° 54 east, and latitude 44 ° 23 and 44 ° 3 O' north. Surface elevations range from 3050 feet above sea level in the northeast corner of the district, to 6 M 5 feet on Spanish Peak. The Miocene Columbia Biver lavas outcrop over 48 of the 68 square miles in the district. Older rocks exposed include Pre- Cretaoeous mota-sedimente and metamorphosed intrusives, Cretaceous conglomerates and sandstones, a granite porphyry pluton, and the brilliantly colored rooks of the upper 011 goe. ne and lower Miocene John Day. The early Tertiary formation known as the Clarno does not outcrop in this district. Younger formations include the gravels and tuffs of the upper Miocene Mascall formation, extensive outcrops of the Pliocone Rattlesnake, and limited accumulations of undifferentiated Quaternary alluvium. A horublende andesite extrusive, which is probably of Pleistocene age, occurs {{in the western part of}} the district. Eaoh of the above stratigraphic units is discussed under the following headings: Distribution and Topographic Expression; Lithology; Thickness; Age and Stratigraphic Relations. A section of the "Dayville Quadrangls, issued by the U. S. aeologioal Survey, was used as a base for a detailed map showing the distribution of the various formations. Special attention was devoted to the study of the Pre-Cretaceous rooks. Approximately 8000 feet of ohloritic schist, argillite, caleareous sohist, phyllie, marble, and quartzite are included in this older series. Basic Intrusives, largely altered to <b>serpentine,</b> <b>cut</b> the meta-sediments. The structure of the Antone District is discussed under the following subheadings: John Day Valley Syncline; Ochoco Escarpment and Highland; Pre-Cretaceous Folding and Faulting; Cretaceous Monocline; and, Fracturing and Slumping of the Rattlesnake Formation. Special sections have been devoted to historical and economic geology. The report is adequately illustrated with photomicrographs of representative rooks and with numerous pertinent detail photographs. Also included is a plate showing the structural details of a north-south section through the middle of the Antone District...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} key {{developments}} in thin film resistive trimming geometry {{for use in}} the fabrication of discrete precision resistors. Firstly an introduction to the laser trimming process is given with respect to well established trim geometries such as the plunge, 'L' and <b>serpentine</b> <b>cuts.</b> The effect of these trim patterns on key electrical properties of resistance tolerance and temperature co-efficient of resistance (TCR) of the thin films is then discussed before the performance of more recent geometries such as the three-contact and random trim approaches are reviewed. In addition to the properties of the standard trim patterns, the concept of the heat affected zone (HAZ) and ablation energy and the effect of introducing a 'fine' trim in areas of low current density to improve device performance are also studied. It is shown how trimming geometry and laser parameters can be systematically controlled to produce thin film resistors of the required properties for varying applications such as high precision, long term stability and high power pulse performance...|$|R

The fountain is pictured at right, just {{to the side of}} a <b>serpentining</b> path that <b>cuts</b> through the park. Water cascades down three concentric tiers of water basins before landing in the much larger pool below, whose perimeter is delineated by stones. A plaque has also been set into a stone obelisk at the fountain's front, but cannot be read. In the background, a residential-style building of some kind is obscured by tree foliage...|$|R
50|$|The {{combined}} river flows west-southwest in {{a winding}} course across Modoc County, past Canby {{and through the}} Modoc National Forest in the narrow Stonecoal Valley gorge. It turns south to flow past Lookout and into northern Lassen County, past Bieber, to emerge into the ranching region of Big Valley. North of Little Valley it flows into northeast Shasta County and the Shasta National Forest. Then the river reaches Fall River Valley, where it is joined by the Fall River, which is fed {{by one of the}} largest freshwater spring systems in the United States. After passing through the town of Fall River Mills, the river drops over Pit River Falls, then enters the head of a long <b>serpentine</b> canyon that <b>cuts</b> through the southern Cascade Range. It then turns south to join the Sacramento River as the eastern arm of Shasta Lake reservoir, approximately 15 mi north of Redding. Two major tributaries, Squaw Creek and the McCloud River, join the Pit from the north within the lake. The lower 30 mi of the river forms the longest of the five arms of Shasta Lake, which is formed by Shasta Dam on the Sacramento downstream from the original confluence.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of in situ CO 2 sequestration in mantle rock is widely investigated (Kelemen & Matter (2008) amongst others). The process involves infiltration of CO 2 -rich fluids into the mantle rock through initial cracks, which react {{with the main}} constituents of the host rock (olivine and pyroxene) to form serpentine and carbonates. Hereby the CO 2 content in the atmosphere is reduced. A volume increase during both serpentinization and carbonation could cause further fracturing of the rock. In this case, the fractures would enhance the process by creating additional reaction surface and allowing fluids to penetrate deeper into the rock. Studying naturally fractured mantle rocks gives insight in the mechanisms that {{play a role in}} the formation of fracture networks and fracture propagation. Two case-studies of fractured peridotite bodies in the Western Gneiss Region (Norway) and the brecciated Lherz body (French Pyrenees) were done. The development of fracture networks and the role of serpentinization and carbonation in fracturing were investigated by studying the geometry and scale of fracture patterns in the field and performing optical and electron microprobe (EMP) analyses on thin sections. The peridotite bodies of Raudhaugene and Ugelvik in Norway are characterized by a variety of fracture networks at different scales. A homogeneous serpentine network is observed at micro-scale. At outcrop scale, fracture networks consist of thin (1 mm) extensional fractures filled with <b>serpentine.</b> Fractures <b>cut</b> each other and the compositional banding fairly randomly, although fractures at angles of 60, 90 and 120 degrees also occur. At some localities thick serpentine veins with a second generation of perpendicular fractures were found and parallel talc veins have been observed. Pyroxenite layers are characterized by a regular fracture pattern of equally spaced fractures (sub) perpendicular to the pyroxenite layer. The fractures show a dominant orientation. Crack-seal vein microstructures are observed within the fractures. The homogeneous serpentine network indicates widespread fluid infiltration, most likely via a micro-fracture network that formed in an earlier stage. As there is no gradient in the degree of serpentinization throughout the peridotite body, the micro-fracture network is not likely to be the result of reaction-induced fracturing. It is more plausible that the micro-scale fracture network has formed due to thermal cracking. The crack-seal structure observed in the fractures in the pyroxenite layers shows that extension has taken place during serpentinization. The regularly spaced fractures are partly explained by differential volume expansion due to serpentinization. The predicted volume change in the adjacent peridotite is large enough to cause the observed extension in the pyroxenite layers. The dominant orientation of the fractures in the pyroxenite layers is explained by influences from regional stress. Outcrop-scale fractures in the peridotite do not show evidence for reaction-induced fracturing. More likely they formed due to multiple phases of regional stress and hierarchical fracturing. Different breccias are recognized in the Lherz peridotite body, which are characterized by angular or rounded peridotite clasts, a calcite or peridotite matrix, and the presence of exotic clasts. Cross-cutting relations reveal that serpentinization occurred before fracturing and the formation of carbonate veins. Rotated angular clasts and calcite geodes cannot be explained by reaction-induced fracturing, rather they have a sedimentary origin. This is confirmed by lamination in the matrix consisting of calcite and peridotite particles. Rounded clasts and the incorporation of exotic clasts in the breccia also indicate a sedimentary setting. The Lherz body was most likely intensely fractured due to tectonic stress and subsequently reworked by sedimentary processes. The absence of Mg-rich carbonates in both geological settings, indicate that in situ carbonation has not taken place. Carbonates are present in the form of calcite in fractures, but their origin is most likely outside the system and no evidence has been found that they are involved in fracturing. In this study insights were gained in fracture patterns and various mechanisms of fracture development. Clear evidence for reaction-induced fracturing, resulting in peridotite fracture networks, was not observed...|$|R
