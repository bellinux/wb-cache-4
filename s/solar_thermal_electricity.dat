An ORC system works like a conventional Rankine cycle but it uses an organic compound as working fluid, instead of water.

This paper estimates the impact on productive activities of increasing the production capacity of the installed solar thermal plants in Andalusia. Using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach, estimates of the changes in the economic sectors’ activity under two different scenarios are obtained: i) based on two types of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>electricity</b> plants currently in operation; and ii) based on an increase from 11 MW in 2007 to 800 MW installed capacity by 2013 to comply with the ‘Plan Andaluz de Sostenibilidad Energética (PASENER) – Sustainable Energy Plan for Andalusia’. For the case of a parabolic-trough solar collector power plant, results show that compliance with the PASENER goal would increase the level of the productive activities by around 30 %.
