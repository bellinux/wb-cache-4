5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The rivet warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs to remove individual rivets and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The catcher (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy rivet set or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the round head of the rivet, while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic rivet hammer to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter <b>sunk</b> <b>hole.</b> Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS Titanic, the man who hammered the rivet was known as the [...] "basher". Upon cooling, the rivet contracted and exerted further force, tightening the joint.|$|E

For lifts at grade, housings for the rods are often <b>sunk</b> into support <b>holes,</b> known as caissons, that are inaccessible and often complicated by groundwater levels. If placed above ground, the space occupied by the rod housings is unusable. Gagnon’s actuator eliminates caissons and reduces the volume of unusable space below the platform of the lift.|$|R
5000|$|While {{prospecting}} {{and living}} off the country Barker and Dennis were joined by Jack Thompson, and John Wells, who had also been rebel soldiers. They eventually wandered into a gulch {{on the west side}} of the Big Belt Mountains. [...] Late fall was at hand, and they determined to stay for the winter—there was a good creek, and wild game. At one place near the mouth of the Gulch, east of the creek, Thompson <b>sunk</b> a <b>hole</b> and found the first pay dirt, a piece of gold about the size of a grain of wheat. [...] Prospecting up the canyon they found more gold in small quantities. Eventually they established a modest discovery of placer gold in gravels of the little creek, where a day’s hard work could produce enough to pay for a few pounds of beans.|$|R

Next he lighted the fuse; and, warning the others, they hastily recrossed the dangerous bridge. They had reached {{the edge of the forest}} when a flash sprang up amidst the foam and a sharp crash was followed by a deafening, drawn-out uproar. Rending, grinding, smashing, the jamb broke up, hammered upon the partly shattered boulder, and carrying it away or driving over it washed in tremendous ruin down the rapid. When the wild clamour had subsided, Salter gave the men some instructions, and then as they approached the lamp noticed Vane's reddened hand.|$|R

60|$|Six {{more days}} were spent in driving holes {{according}} to Harry's plan. The result was {{in all cases}} the same. Sand and small stones were brought up attached to the grease. They had now <b>sunk</b> the <b>holes</b> at a much more rapid rate than at first, for they were accustomed to the work, their muscles had hardened, {{and they were able}} to strike more frequently and with greater force. They would have got on still more quickly had it not been for the trouble in sharpening the drills. These were heated in the small blacksmith's fire Dias had brought. They were first placed in the fire, but this was not sufficiently hot to raise them beyond a dull red glow. When this was done a shovelful of glowing fragments was taken from the fire and placed on the hearth, and among these the small bellows raised the ends of the drills to a white heat, when of course they were easily worked. At first they had some difficulty in tempering them. Sometimes, when cooled, the points were too soft, at other times too brittle; but at the end of a week they had arrived at the proper medium. But one of the party had to work steadily to keep the drills in good order.|$|R
60|$|A shallow {{stream of}} muddy water came murmuring {{down from the}} hills. It covered the wide bed that Neale remembered had been a dry, sand-and-gravel waste. On each side the {{abutment}} piers had been undermined and washed out. Not a stone remained in sight. The banks were hollowed inward and shafts of heavy boards were sliding down. In {{the middle of the}} stream stood a coffer-dam in course of building, and near it another that had collapsed. These frameworks almost hid the tip of the middle pier, which had evidently slid over and was sinking on its side. There was no telling what had been <b>sunk</b> in that <b>hole.</b> All the surroundings--the tons of stone, cut and uncut, the piles of muddy lumber, the platforms and rafts, the crevices in the worn shores up and down both sides--all attested to the long weeks of fruitless labor and to the engulfing mystery of that shallow, murmuring stream.|$|R
5000|$|The Alba Regia cave is {{the third}} deepest cave in the country. Its {{exploration}} was begun in 1975 and due to the hostile environment it took {{for quite a long}} time. In October, the entrance test hole, which depth is almost five meters, was dug. Exploratories went along the next 30 metres through strait routes full of scree. Then, beyond some crannies, they reached the so-called [...] "Explorer branch" [...] of the cave in which the first stalagmites could be seen. At the bottom of the test <b>hole,</b> <b>sunk</b> in extremely difficult circumstances, the channel was opened on 24 October. The air temperature of the inner passages of Cave Alba Regia is about 7 degrees lower than the Hungarian average 8,1-8,5°C. During the exploration, the strong enrichment of carbon dioxide in some passages became apparent. It is Istvan Eszterhas who collects and converses the wildlife of the cave that was wholly closed until its discovery. He started trapping in 1976, and even in that year he could differentiate between 21 species. In 1977, the number of cave creatures increased to 56, and in 1979, it was as high as 70. The cave can be visited only with a permission and a professional guide.|$|R

60|$|A jar {{containing}} {{about thirty}} pounds of powder was <b>sunk</b> in a <b>hole</b> in an immense {{block of ice}} which lay close against {{the stern of the}} ship. Mivins, being light of foot, was set to fire the train. He did so, and ran--ran so fast that he missed his footing in leaping over a chasm, and had well-nigh fallen into the water below. There was a whiz and a loud report, and the enormous mass of ice heaved upwards in the centre, and fell back in huge fragments. So far the result was satisfactory, and the men were immediately set to sink several charges in various directions around the vessel, to be in readiness for the highest tide, which was soon expected. Warps and hawsers were also got out and fixed to the seaward masses, ready to heave on them at a moment's notice; the ship was lightened as much as possible, by lifting her stores upon the ice, and the whole crew--captain, mates, and all--worked and heaved like horses, until the perspiration streamed from their faces, while Mizzle kept supplying them with a constant deluge of hot coffee. Fred and the young surgeon, too, worked like the rest, with their coats off, handkerchiefs bound round their heads, and shirt-sleeves tucked up to their shoulders.|$|R

6000|$|My {{success as}} story-teller, commentator, critic, jester, revived my childish {{ambition}} towards authorship. My first stirrings {{in this direction}} I cannot rightly place. I remember when very small falling into a <b>sunk</b> dust-bin--a deep <b>hole,</b> rather, into which the gardener shot his rubbish. The fall twisted my ankle so that I could not move; and the time being evening and my prison {{some distance from the}} house, my predicament loomed large before me. Yet one consolation remained with me: the incident would be of value to me in the autobiography upon which I was then engaged. I can distinctly recollect lying on my back among decaying leaves and broken glass, framing my account. [...] "On this day a strange adventure befell me. Walking in the garden, all unheeding, I suddenly"--I did not want to add the truth--"tumbled into a dust-hole, six feet square, that any one but a moon calf might have seen." [...] I puzzled to evolve a more dignified situation. The dust-bin became a cavern, the entrance to which had been artfully concealed; the six or seven feet I had really fallen, [...] "an endless descent, terminating in a vast and gloomy chamber." [...] I was divided between opposing desires: One, for rescue followed by sympathy and supper; the other, for the alarming experience of a night of terror where I lay. Nature conquering Art, I yelled; and the episode terminated prosaically with a warm bath and arnica. But from it I judge that desire for the woes and perils of authorship was with me somewhat early.|$|R
60|$|When {{the whole}} hill shall have been {{properly}} washed, the contained reefs will present this wall-like appearance. The dimensions are ten feet long {{by the same}} height and half that thickness, and the slope shows an angle of 40º. We passed onwards {{to the top of}} the ridge, winding among the pits and round <b>holes</b> <b>sunk</b> by the native miners in order to work the casing of the reef. One of these, carefully measured, showed 82 feet. About sixty yards to the north-north-east we reached the crest of what Mr. Ross calls 'Ponsonby Hill.' He notices that the strike of the quartz, which shows visible gold, is from north-north-east to south-south-west, and its underlie to the south-east is at the ratio of one inch in twelve. Cameron found that near the head of the descent, 120 feet to the plain below, three, and perhaps four lodes meet. The true bed, with a measured thickness of 157 feet, strikes north 22º east, the western 355º, and the eastern north 37º east (true). All radiate from one point, a knot which gives 'great expectations.' The natives have opened large man-holes in search of loose gold, and here, tradition says, many nuggets have been found. A greater number will come to light when the miners shall dig the 'blind creek' to the east, and when the roots of the secular trees crowning the summit shall be laid bare by the hose. I would wash down and sluice the whole of the Akankon ridge.|$|R

Straight beams, connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at equal intervals, are placed together on the ground; these are mortised on the inside, and covered with plenty of earth. But the intervals which we have mentioned, are closed up in front by large stones. These being thus laid and cemented together, another row is added above, {{in such a manner}} that the same interval may be observed, and that the beams may not touch one another, but equal spaces intervening, each row of beams is kept firmly in its place by a row of stones. In this manner the whole wall is consolidated, until the regular height of the wall be completed. This work, with respect to appearance and variety, is not unsightly, owing to the alternate rows of beams and stones, which preserve their order in right lines; and, besides, it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defence of cities; for the stone protects it from fire, and the wood from the battering ram, since it (the wood) being mortised in the inside with rows of beams, generally forty feeteach in length, can neither be broken through nor torn asunder."On the western side, there was a gateway, build of wood, standing on eight posts. This gateway was double-winged and 6 m wide. A central post divided the gateway into two gates of 2.5 m each.

6000|$|At 2 P.M. {{the caravan}} started along the Fiumara course {{in rear of}} the deserted kraal, and after an hour's ascent Rirash {{informed}} us that a well was near. The Hammal and I, taking two water skins, urged our mules over stones and thorny ground: presently we arrived at a rocky ravine, where, surrounded by brambles, rude walls, and tough frame works, lay the wells-- three or four <b>holes</b> <b>sunk</b> ten feet deep in the limestone. Whilst we bathed in the sulphureous spring, which at once discolored my silver ring, Rirash, baling up the water in his shield, filled the bags and bound them to the saddles. In haste we rejoined the caravan, which we found about sunset, halted by the vain fears of the guides. The ridge upon which they stood was a mass of old mosques and groves, showing that in former days a thick population tenanted these hills: from the summit appeared distant herds of kine and white flocks scattered like patches of mountain quartz. Riding in advance, we traversed the stony ridge, fell into another ravine, and soon saw signs of human life. A shepherd descried us from afar and ran away reckless of property; causing the End of Time to roll his head with dignity, and to ejaculate, [...] "Of a truth said the Prophet of Allah, 'fear is divided.'" [...] Presently we fell in with a village, from which the people rushed out, some exclaiming, [...] "Lo! {{let us look at}} the kings!" [...] others, [...] "Come, see the white man, he is governor of Zayla!" [...] I objected to such dignity, principally on account of its price: my companions, however, were inexorable; they would be Salatin--kings--and my colour was against claims to low degree. This fairness, and the Arab dress, made me at different times the ruler of Aden, the chief of Zayla, the Hajj's son, a boy, an old woman, a man painted white, a warrior in silver armour, a merchant, a pilgrim, a hedgepriest, Ahmed the Indian, a Turk, an Egyptian, a Frenchman, a Banyan, a sherif, and lastly a Calamity sent down from heaven to weary out the lives of the Somal: every kraal had some conjecture of its own, and each fresh theory was received by my companions with roars of laughter.|$|R
40|$|Tijekom ovogodišnje arheološke kampanje u centru Ivanca na položaju Stari grad istraženo je 26 grobova, većinom južno od kule te u samoj središnjoj kuli. Razvrstani su u nekoliko horizonata, uglavnom na temelju međusobnih stratigrafskih odnosa. Mjestimično su pronađeni i istraženi tragovi naseobinskoga sloja iz srednjega vijeka. Po prvi puta je istraživano i područje izvan gabarita Staroga grada, gdje je otkriven obrambeni jarak (ukoliko nije riječ tek o strmoj padini terena u ranije doba). Čini se da je ukapanje jarka oštetilo i ugao pretpostavljene romaničke apside. Dokumentirano je postupno zatrpavanje jarka. Otkriven je i kasnosrednjovjekovni zid nepoznate namjene koji se nalazio izvan gabarita Grada kakvoga znamo. Lokalitet je nakon istraživanja zasut pijeskom. Istraživanja će se nastaviti. In {{the period}} between 10 May and 12 June 2010, the Institute of Archaeology (IARH) {{conducted}} the ninth phase of archaeological excavations in Ivanec at the Stari Grad site. This {{is a continuation of}} excavations that have been carried out by the IARH at the initiative of the Town of Ivanec since 1998 (Belaj 2008). In 2010, excavations of the area within the northern, rectangular tower of Stari Grad were completed. Excavations west of the tower commenced, and the area south of the tower, i. e. between the tower and the Gothic St. John’s Church continued. However, the most intensively excavated area was a trial-trench of 4. 80 × 7. 20 m located east of the northern tower. This was due to the extraordinary features of the structure unearthed beneath the northern tower during the campaign of 2009. Namely, it seems that the foundations represent the remains of the oldest and thus most valuable structure found {{in the course of the}} excavations: a Romanesque church. However, the situation found in this area differs from what was expected. An assumed large defensive trench was unearthed which at an earlier point of time used to surround Stari Grad. Unfortunately, we still cannot claim with certainty that this was really a ditch, as only a smaller part of its southern slopes have been excavated. In favour of the assumption that it was a ditch is the fact that it cut and consequently destroyed the presumed eastern wall of the apse of the newly discovered church, which was precisely the structure that was the primary objective of this year’s excavations. The ditch was later cut by a large long trench extending along the eastern foundations of the northern tower. Consequently, the northern tower represents a newer defence stage of the Old Town, even though the ditch and the tower might have been used in parallel for a while. In the ditch, several filling phases can be identified. The older stage is represented by a smaller number of fills, cut during the construction of the eastern wall of the northern tower, while the newer stage followed after the construction of the northern tower when, after the ditch had been more or less filled to the top, the area east of the tower was covered by a thick layer of yellow clay, which probably served for the final levelling of the terrain. Remains of pillars were identified, set in large <b>holes</b> <b>sunk</b> deep into the lowest fills of the ditches, around which at a later stage the fills were deposited. Although, unfortunately, the ditch cut the structure identified in the course of earlier excavations, which could represent the eastern wall of the apse of the newly discovered church, the function of the structure is partly also suggested by a grave in which lower leg and foot bones were unearthed. It is located in the presumed apse, and its isolated position speaks in favour of it being connected with the newly discovered church, and not the Gothic Church of St. John. In this area, south of the ditch, a small amount of paving was also excavated, constructed of medium-sized stones (15 - 20 cm), bound by firm white plaster and covered with a thinner layer of white plaster. The relationship between this paving (possibly even the structure’s flooring) and the ditch could not be determined exactly. In the course of the 2010 campaign, the northern tower was completely excavated. The last ten graves were excavated, of which nine were located to the south of the newly discovered building, and one in the presumed apse of the Romanesque church. Excavations also continued in the sector North of the Nave of the Gothic Church of St. John, where 15 graves were researched. On the basis of individual finds, their interrelations and the differences between individual burial phases identified in previous research, the graves were chronologically classified into several burial phases. Several graves, excavated in the north, near the Gothic Church of St. John, can be assigned to the newer burial horizon, which is characterised by the presence of belt buckles and burying the deceased with their arms crossed over their chest or stomach. Some graves with the deceased with their arms laid by their body belong to the medium burial phase. Just as in past excavations, in the graves of this phase no remains of coffins or nails were encountered. An older medium phase stands out which had already been identified in and around St. John’s Church, characterised by burials that do not follow the orientation of St. John’s Church and probably do not belong to the graveyard of this newly discovered, older Romanesque church. An interesting phenomenon, already noticed in previous years among finds from some of these graves, is the occurrence of animal teeth. These appear relatively frequently as grave goods. Probably, they functioned as amulets. This year, the assumption that some graves belonged to the oldest burial phase, usually characterised by stone paving and Bijelo Brdo culture material, could be confirmed solely on the basis of stratigraphic relationships. Among the graves ascribed to this stage, grave 279 stands out. It is a sort of ossuary with the relatively well preserved bones of an adult person which were irregularly arranged in the grave. It seems to be either a secondary burial or a body that had been cut into pieces before its burial. On the burial’s rims large, poorly preserved iron mounts were found. Therefore it seems that the remains were buried in a wooden casket. Despite a large number of graves, the exceptionally fatty and compact black and brown cultural layer was also preserved in smaller segments. In the black layer, some fragments of house daub, varying in size, were found along with pottery shards, many of which were decorated with a wavy line. In the brown layer, which regularly occurs under the black layer, many pieces of house daub and some provincial classical Roman or Celtic pottery were unearthed. Among finds unearthed in the 2010 excavations, the largest in number are ceramic vessel shards, particularly from the new era. A large number of stove tile fragments from the same period were also found, as well as many iron nails and other metal artefacts, along with fragments of glass, porcelain, etc. From the Middle Ages, there are mostly fragments of pottery and daub. These were found in the black cultural layer and in numerous fills. As far as special finds are concerned, the decorated or shaped shards of ceramic vessels and stove tiles, several bronze needles, two specimens of coins and various other metal artefacts particularly stand out. Among the newer fills of the ditch, Ferdinand II trimmed three-kreuzer silver coins were unearthed, probably minted in 1622 or 1623. Several fragments of glass bottles and other vessels were found, together with a ceramic whorl and, once again, several examples of animal teeth in graves. The find of a pair of compasses, probably of bronze, and also iron mounts from a smaller coffin from grave 279 particularly stand out...|$|R
