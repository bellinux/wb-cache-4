50|$|Mr. Know-It-All was {{a popular}} <b>supporting</b> <b>segment</b> of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. There were fifty {{segments}} produced. The segments featured Bullwinkle J. Moose, in his typical know-it-all fashion, pompously giving advice and instruction on any and every given topic, {{such as how to}} catch a bee or how to sneak into the movie theater without a ticket. Of course, true to Bullwinkle's nature, something would always go humorously and disastrously wrong by the end. Boris Badenov plays a variety of roles as Bullwinkle's antagonist in most of the segments.|$|E
50|$|Cow and Chicken has a {{total of}} 52 episodes in 4 seasons that were {{produced}} from November 1996 to April 1999. Each half-hour contains 2 Cow and Chicken and 1 I Am Weasel segment. Cow and Chicken premiered as a full half-hour on July 15, 1997. The series ran for 52 episodes through 1999. As a <b>supporting</b> <b>segment,</b> the show included a cartoon called I Am Weasel; this segment was spun off as an independent series late in the show's run. Typically, an episode would consist of two seven-minute Cow and Chicken shorts playing back-to-back, then followed by a seven-minute I Am Weasel short before the end credits. The exception to this structure was episode 105 ("The Ugliest Weenie"), which had the Weasel short ("I Are Big Star") play in-between the two Cow and Chicken shorts, possibly because said shorts were one storyline.|$|E
50|$|The {{syndicated}} {{version of}} The Underdog Show consists of 62 half-hour episodes. The supporting segments {{differ from the}} show's original network run. The first 26 syndicated episodes feature Tennessee Tuxedo as a <b>supporting</b> <b>segment</b> (Tennessee Tuxedo originally aired as a separate show and also has its own syndicated adaptation). Thereafter, {{for most of the}} balance of the package, the middle segments include Go Go Gophers and Klondike Kat for three consecutive half-hours and Tennessee Tuxedo in the fourth. Commander McBragg is featured in the majority of episodes, replaced by three segments of The Sing-A-Long Family (in shows one-three, 28-30, and 55-57). The final two syndicated Underdog half-hours feature one-shot cartoons originally part of an unsold pilot for a projected 1966 series, The Champion (Cauliflower Cabbie and Gene Hattree), with Commander McBragg appearing in show 61 and Go Go Gophers in show 62.|$|E

40|$|The SKN- 1 {{transcription}} factor specifies early embryonic cell fates in Caenorhabditis elegans. SKN- 1 binds DNA at high affinity as a monomer, {{by means of}} a basic region like those of basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins, which bind DNA only as dimers. We have investigated how the SKN- 1 DNA-binding domain (the Skn domain) promotes stable binding of a basic region monomer to DNA. A flexible arm at the Skn domain amino terminus binds in the minor groove, but a <b>support</b> <b>segment</b> adjacent to the carboxy-terminal basic region can independently stabilize basic region–DNA binding. Off DNA, the basic region and arm are unfolded and, surprisingly, the <b>support</b> <b>segment</b> forms a molten globule of four a-helices. On binding DNA, the Skn domain adopts a tertiary structure in which the basic region helix extends directly from a <b>support</b> <b>segment</b> a-helix, which is required for binding. The remainder of the <b>support</b> <b>segment</b> anchors this uninterrupted helix on DNA, but leaves the basic region exposed in the major groove. This is similar to how the bZIP basic region extends from the leucine zipper, indicating that positioning and cooperative stability provided by helix extension are conserved mechanisms that promote binding of basic regions to DNA.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} impact that guest students at Harrisburg Area Community College had on the financial support structure of the College. While the study focused on one segment of students at a particular college, the techniques developed could be used with any segment of students at any college, {{so long as they}} can clearly be identified. ^ There is extensive literature available on the impact of certain government policies and certain social changes on institutions of higher education. However, little or no literature centers on the financial impact of a specific groups of students who supplement a regular college program by taking courses, particularly in the summer, at a community college. ^ A systematic sample was selected to estimate the cost to the student, local, state, and federal governments, and others of one full-time equivalent guest student registered at Harrisburg Area Community College. The sample was broken down according to whether the student 2 ̆ 7 s home institution was a public or private college. The estimated costs were used to construct a matrix which describes the cost to each <b>supporting</b> <b>segment</b> according to the type of institution from which the student came. Standard techniques from the management sciences were used to determine the present value of student loans. This allowed for a comparison of the apparent costs and the true costs to each of the supporting segments. ^ The study reveals: (A) The substantial role of indirect aid, particularly from the federal government. (B) The resulting difference between the apparent cost and the true cost of higher education. (C) The strong dependence of Harrisburg Area Community College on such indirect aid. (D) The impact on the local supporting school districts resulting from guest enrollments. ^ The study provides reasons for the College and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to alter their current policies. Such policy changes include: (1) Recruiting guest students, and (2) Subsidization by the Commonwealth of local school districts on behalf of guest students from the districts. ...|$|E
