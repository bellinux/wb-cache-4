40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a unique approach of turning {{on and off}} transistor cores to reconfigure low-noise amplifiers. A small footprint single-pole, <b>single-throw</b> <b>switch</b> is optimized for low insertion loss and high isolation. A narrowband (non-switchable) LNA is developed as a basis of comparison for reconfigurable designs. The optimized switch is incorporated into different switchable transistor core architectures. These architectures are investigated to determine their ability to reconfigure amplifier performance. One switchable transistor core topology is integrated into a cascode LNA design. An in depth stability analysis employing the S-probe technique is used to help improve {{the reliability of the}} cascode design. In addition, a single-pole, double-throw transmit/receive switch, as well as a deserializer are developed to help support the LNA block in a reconfigurable phased-array radar system. This type of flexible radar design is very beneficial in challenging electromagnetic environments.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} in 3 -D RF microelectromechanical systems switches intended for power ap-plications. The novel switch architecture employs electrothermal hydraulic microactuators to provide mechanical actuation and 3 -D out-of-plane silicon cantilevers that have both spring action and latching mechanisms. This facilitates an OFF-state gap separation distance of 200 μm between ohmic contacts, {{without the need for}} any hold power. Having a simple assembly, many of the inherent problems associated with the more traditional suspension-bridge and cantilever-type-beam architectures can be overcome. A single-pole <b>single-throw</b> <b>switch</b> has been investigated, and its measured ON-state insertion and return losses are less than 0. 3 dB up to 10 GHz and greater than 15 dB up to 12 GHz, respectively, while the OFF-state isolation is better than 30 dB up to 12 GHz. The switch works well in both hot- and cold-switching modes, with 4. 6 W of RF power at 10 GHz and without any signs of degradation to the ohmic contacts.

V-Band and W-Band {{as well as on}} a technology for multi-functional MMICs. The coplanar switches are using high-performance InGaAs PIN diodes as active switching elements. The focus of the illustrated measurement results is on the characteristics of the W-Band switches. The SPST (single-pole <b>single-throw)</b> <b>switches</b> exhibit a low minimum insertion loss of 0. 66 dB (1. 17 dB) at 85 GHz (84 GHz) with an extremely high corresponding isolation of 29. 2 dB (24. 5 dB). Even under extremely low DC-power consumption conditions of 0. 95 mW (0. 8 mW), the switches demonstrated impressive isolations of 23. 7 dB (20. 7 dB). Excellent mm-wave performance is also achieved with the 94 GHz SPDT (single-pole double-throw) switch. An insertion loss as low as 1. 4 dB in transmit mode and 1. 8 dB at 96 GHz in receive mode is obtained. A very high isolation value greater than 40 dB is observed. Furthermore, we are developing a heterointegration technology for multi-functional MMICs and present a first comparison between heterointegrated SPST switches (PIN + HFET layer structure) and the normal SPST switches (only PIN structure) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} fast time-domain {{simulation}} of piecewise-linear networks with switches {{is described in}} this paper. The method {{is based on a}} discrete-time switch model that consists of a constant conductance in parallel with a current source. In each simulation step, value of the current source is updated as a function of known network signals. The function [4], [5], [6], ideal switch model is assumed, while references [7], [8], [lo] propose various simple approximations to the ideal switch model. An ideal switch has zero impedance when on, zero admittance when off, and switches between the two states in takes one of two forms, depending on the state (on or off) of the switch. Since system matrix is constant, regardless of the states of the switches, simulation time is essentially the same as for linear, time-invariant network of the same complexity.

40|$|A Penning trap {{experiment}} for {{the determination}} of the g-factor of the bound electron in heavy highly-charged ions, ALPHATRAP, is under construction at the Max-Planck-Institute in Heidelberg MPIK. As a part of this experiment, a vacuum valve and an electromechanical switch were constructed and tested. ALPHATRAP will be connected to an electron-beam ion trap (EBIT) via a room temperature beam-line. Since trapping of highly-charged ions requires extremely good vacuum, in excess of 10 - 15 mbar, the external flow of the background gas from the room-temperature beam-line has to be reduced significantly. Therefore, a cryogenic vacuum valve was developed, which enables adequate storage times. The valve is manually actuated, and operates at cryogenic temperatures as well as in strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, for the image-current detection electronics a cryogenic electromechanical switch was developed. The switch is actuated by a piezoelectric element. Advantages compared to semiconductor devices are negligible leakage currents for the switch being in open position and negligible dielectric losses. The switch is designed as a single-pole <b>single-throw</b> <b>switch</b> and has a residual resistance of only 11 m. The designs and test results of the devices are presented...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{efficient}} transmitter {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (TX MMIC) suitable for high-speed wireless communication. In {{order to achieve}} high output power, the TX is based on a direct modulation approach, containing a stacked-FET voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and an amplitude modulator. Thus, the modulation scheme is based on amplitude-shift keying (ASK). The MMIC utilizes the Fraunhofer IAF 50 nm gate-length metamorphic high-electronmobility transistor (mHEMT) technology. The stacked-FET oscillator generates the carrier signal and achieves an output power of about 14 dBm. The carrier frequency can be tuned from 87. 8 to 98. 2 GHz. Due to the FET-stacking approach the amplitude modulator can be simplified to a single-pole, <b>single-throw</b> (SPST) <b>switch.</b> Hence, the transmitter MMIC achieves a peak output power of 12 : 5 dBm and a maximum data rate of 18 Gbit/s.

The measurement results of the first prototypes show better than 15 dB isolation in the blocking state and better than 3 dB insertion loss in the non-blocking state for 500 - 750 GHz. The higher insertion loss is mainly attributed to the insufficient metal thickness and surface roughness on the waveguide sidewalls.

5000|$|In most wired systems, {{a button}} on the outside next to the door, located around the height of the doorknob, {{activates}} a signaling device (usually a chime, bell, or buzzer) inside the building. Pressing the doorbell button, a single-pole, <b>single-throw</b> (SPST) pushbutton <b>switch</b> momentarily closes the doorbell circuit. One terminal of this button is wired to a terminal on a transformer. A doorbell transformer steps down the 120 or 240-volt AC electrical power to a lower voltage, typically 10 to 20 volts. The transformer's other terminal connects to one of three terminals on the signaling device. Another terminal is connected to a wire that travels to the other terminal on the button. Some signaling devices have a third terminal, which produces a different sound. If there is another doorbell button (typically near a back door), it is connected between the transformer and the third terminal. The transformer primary winding, being energized continuously, does consume a small amount (about 1 to 2 W) of standby power constantly; systems with lighted pushbutton switches may consume a similar amount of power per switch. [...] The tradeoff is that the wiring to the button carries only safe, low voltage isolated from earth ground.|$|R
