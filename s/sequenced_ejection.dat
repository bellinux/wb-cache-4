40|$|It {{is shown}} that the work {{function}} algorithm for the 2 -evader problem has competitive ratio m Γ 2 for all metric spaces with m points. This settles the k-server conjecture for metric spaces with k+ 2 points. Keywords: On-line algorithms, analysis of algorithms, server problem 1 Introduction The `-evader problem is defined on a finite metric space M. On the points of M there are ` evaders that are free to move from point to point and they respond {{to a series of}} ejections. An ejection from a point forces each evader residing at this point to move to some other point. The objective of the evaders is to respond to a finite <b>sequence</b> of <b>ejections</b> by traveling a total distance that is as small as possible. We are interested in the on-line version of the problem when the <b>ejection</b> <b>sequence</b> is not known to the evaders in advance, but ejections are revealed (to all evaders) one by one.

40|$|Background—Heart valve surgery has an {{associated}} in-hospital mortality rate of 4 % to 8 %. This study aims {{to develop a}} simple risk model to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing heart valve surgery to provide information to patients and clinicians and to facilitate institutional comparisons. Methods and Results—Data on 32 839 patients {{were obtained from the}} Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland on patients who underwent heart valve surgery between April 1995 and March 2003. Data from the first 5 years (n 16 679) were used to develop the model; its performance was evaluated on the remaining data (n 16 160). The risk model presented here is based on the combined data. The overall in-hospital mortality was 6. 4 %. The risk model included, in order of importance (all P 0. 01), operative priority, age, renal failure, operation <b>sequence,</b> <b>ejection</b> fraction, concomitant tricuspid valve surgery, type of valve operation, concomitant CABG surgery, body mass index, preoperative arrhythmias, diabetes, gender, and hypertension. The risk model exhibited good predictive ability (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P 0. 78) and discriminated between high- and low-risk patients reasonably well (receiver-operating characteristics curve area, 0. 77). Conclusions—This is the first risk model that predicts in-hospital mortality for aortic and/or mitral heart valve patients with or without concomitant CABG. Based on a large national database of heart valve patients, this model has been evaluated successfully on patients who had valve surgery during a subsequent time period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alström Syndrome (ALMS) is an {{extremely}} rare multiorgan disease caused by mutations in ALMS 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common finding but only one series has been investigated by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR). METHODS: Eight genetically proven ALMS patients (ages 11 - 41) underwent CMR performed by standard cine steady state, T 1, T 2 and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) <b>sequences.</b> <b>Ejection</b> fraction (EF), Diastolic Volume (EDV) and Systolic Volume normalized for body surface area (ESV), and mass indices were determined, as well as EDV/Mass ratio, an index expressing the adequacy of cardiac mass to heart volume. Regional fibrosis was assessed by LGE; diffuse fibrosis was measured by a TI scout sequence acquired at 5, 10 and 15 min after gadolinium by comparing inversion time values (TI) at null time in ALMS and control group. RESULTS: In one patient severe DCM was present with diffuse LGE. There were seven cases without clinical DCM. In these patients, EF was at lower normal limits or slightly reduced and ESV index increased; six patients had decreased mass index and EDV/Mass ratio. Mild regional non ischemic fibrosis was detected by LGE in three cases; diffuse fibrosis was observed in all cases, as demonstrated by shorter TI values in ALMS in comparison with controls (5 min: 152 ± 12 vs 186 ± 16, p 0. 0002; 10 min: 175 ± 8 vs 204 ± 18, p 0. 0012; 15 min: 193 ± 9 vs 224 ± 16, p 0. 0002).

Methods We performed CMR and echo in 52 patients with first AMI shortly after primary angioplasty and four months thereafter. CMR included cine-MR and T 1 -weighted first-pass and late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) <b>sequences.</b> Global <b>ejection</b> fraction (EF CMR, %) and regional left ventricular function (systolic wall thickening %, [SWT]) were determined from cine-MR images. In echo the global left ventricular function (EF echo, %) and regional wall motion abnormalities were determined. A segment in echo was scored as "infarcted" if it was visually > 50 % hypokinetic. Results EF echo revealed a poor significant agreement with EF CMR at baseline (r: 0. 326; p Conclusion Wall motion and EF by CMR and echocardiography correlate poorly in the acute stage of myocardial infarction. Correlation improves after four months. Systolic wall thickening by CMR < 30 % indicates an infarcted segment with influence on the left ventricular function. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Cabin {{ejection}} {{systems are}} much more complex than ejection seats. They require devices to cut cables and conduits connecting the cabin and fuselage. The cabin must have aerodynamic stabilization devices to avoid tumbling after ejection. The large cabin weight mandates a very large parachute, with a more complex extraction sequence. Air bags must deploy beneath the cabin to cushion impact or provide flotation. To make on-the-pad ejections feasible, the separation rockets {{would have to be}} quite large. In short, many complex things must happen in a specific timed <b>sequence</b> for cabin <b>ejection</b> to be successful, and in a situation where the vehicle might be disintegrating. If the airframe twisted or warped, thus preventing cabin separation, or debris damaged the landing airbags, stabilization, or any other cabin system, the occupants would likely not survive.|$|R

At time B, the meteorite has impacted, melting and introducing {{a large amount of}} energy into the surface. This surface energy propagates as a shock wave. At time C, the shock wave continues to propagate, a rarefraction wave pushes back towards the crater in response, and material is ejected from the crater. If any of this material is moving at a rate faster than the escape velocity(Ve=5.0 km/s) of Mars, it may leave the influence of Martian gravity. Mars has a minimum distance from earth of 54.6 million km that the ejecta would then have to travel with the perfect trajectory(dashed line) to impact on earth.

5000|$|SHK's {{final report}} - not {{available}} in English - concluded that the plane had passed through the other aircraft's wake vortex while in a steep (−70 degrees) dive. When passing, the pilot's pitch command was [...] "up", but instead the vortex inflicted a large aerodynamic transient on the aircraft, throwing it down into an almost vertical (−85 degrees) dive. These factors combined to create an angle of attack that was too large for the command to be obeyed, and so the ground-collision warning system alerted the pilot that a turn to avoid a crash would require more than 10 g. The pilot elected to vacate the aircraft {{in accordance with the}} flight manual. At the same moment the vortex effect ceased, reducing the angle of attack to within flyable limits.

A total of four human cadaveric spine specimens (T 12 -L 5) were tested. The test matrix consisted of two parts. The first part subjected specimens to sub-failure loading to outline spinal kinematics during dynamic vertical acceleration. The second part of the test matrix consisted of acceleration tests designed to induce compression and/or burst fractures as sustained by military aviators during ejection.

50|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the cockpit would be a sealed fireproof and blast-resistant capsule, inspired by the example of the Scott Crossfield incident in the X-15 rocket plane, consideration was then given to making the capsule ejectable. After studying examples from both aviation and 250 mph drag boat racing of ejectable or separable capsules, it was decided to pattern the capsule separation for RV1 largely after the drag boat model, in which the capsule separates only after a crash has already initiated. However, due to the much higher speeds and different motions expected in comparison to a drag boat if RV1 were to crash, it was decided to incorporate both a mechanism for actively ejecting the capsule and an aerodynamic decelerator. Banks of compressed air rams {{on each side of the}} capsule will serve as the ejection mechanism, with tilt switches mounted in the horizontal and vertical planes acting to initiate ejection without driver intervention. In the <b>ejection</b> <b>sequence</b> currently envisioned, if the RV1 pitches or rolls beyond preset limits, a tilt switch will open a solenoid valve that releases compressed nitrogen into the banks of rams. As the capsule is launched outward, the tension from a steel cable lanyard attached between the capsule and the chassis will pull a mechanism in the capsule that releases a ballute to decelerate and stabilize the capsule.|$|R
