40|$|The {{design of}} sensor {{networks}} {{for measuring the}} mean and spatial distribution of snow depth at the scale of 1 - 16 km 2 was evaluated by deploying an embedded-sensor network consisting of ultrasonic snow depth sensors to capture the variable physiographic features around an operational <b>snow</b> <b>course</b> in Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada of California. Manual snow surveys were also carried out during accumulation and ablation periods. Four years of continuous data from the embedded-sensor network showed that snow depths during both accumulation and ablation periods can vary as much as 50 % based on variability in topography and vegetation across a 0. 4 ha study area. Spatial snow surveys showed that such a sensor network can be deployed so as to capture both the variability and mean for accumulation and ablation periods across a 1 km 2 area surrounding the sensor network, with a broader network required to extend this to 4 and 16 km 2 areas. In forested areas, higher canopy densities, greater than 60 % closure, {{were associated with the}} lowest snow depths. Analysis of historical <b>snow</b> <b>course</b> records from 14 sites in Yosemite, including the 10 spatial measurements made during each monthly <b>snow</b> <b>course</b> survey, showed snow depths across the 300 m <b>snow</b> <b>course</b> transects to be relatively uniform, with 68 % of all monthly values having standard deviations no more than 10 % of the mean. Although existing snow courses do little to help define the spatial patterns of snow distribution at the 1 - 16 km 2 scales, it is feasible to extend the representativeness of current operational networks by deploying low-cost embeddedsensor networks nearby.

These data are far from a perfect data set and data users should know the errors and limitations within them. In the current setting, only those collecting the data have access to the raw data and the site biographical information. In Utah, records extend back to at least 1912. Systematic measurements began in the mid 19202 ̆ 7 s with many long term snow courses established at that time. In an extremely fortuitous circumstance, Mr. George D. Clyde (former Governor of Utah) was responsible for the Snow Survey Program during the 19302 ̆ 7 s in Utah and had foresight to document each existing <b>Snow</b> <b>Course</b> in the year 1936. Each site was meticulously mapped, described and most important, photographed from several angles. Comparisons are made between the 1936 photographs, maps and descriptions and current conditions, specifically with regard to vegetation and sample point location. General conclusions are made regarding the impact that vegetation change has had on snow accumulation at each course. Changes in sampling technique and data processing are documented, particularly with regard to sample density and the re-sampling (or lack thereof in the record up to the 19502 ̆ 7 s) of individual sample points when density thresholds are exceeded. With the advent of weather modification programs, changes in snow accumulation could reasonably be expected. Utah began a relatively small test weather modification program in the 19502 ̆ 7 s in central Utah. The Utah cloud seeding act was passed in 1973 and the seeding program has continued since that time. Snow Courses affected by this program are identified and the potential impact on historical data. Finally, recommendations for individual <b>snow</b> <b>course</b> suitability for long term study based on consistency are made for each of the courses examined.

The CS 725 was developed by Hydro Quebec in collaboration with Campbell Scientific Canada Corporation and determines SWE by passively measuring the attenuation of naturally emitted terrestrial gamma radiation from the soil by the snowpack. The CS 725 provides a non-contact technique for determining SWE that is effective with any type of snow or ice cove and whose performance is not affected by adverse weather conditions. Field testing of the CS 725 was conducted at Sunshine Village, Alberta (2008 - 2011), SNOTEL Tony Grove Ranger Station, Utah (2009 - 2010), and Anestølen, Norway (2011 - 2012).

Strong agreement is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively between all automated methods of SWE: CS 725, snow pillow, and precipitation gauge.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a newly proposed data assimilation method for historical snow water equivalent SWE estimation using remotely sensed fractional snow-covered area fSCA. The newly proposed approach {{consists of a}} particle batch smoother (PBS), which is compared to a previously applied Kalman-based ensemble batch smoother (EnBS) approach. The methods were applied over the 27 -yr Landsat 5 record at snow pillow and <b>snow</b> <b>course</b> in situ verification sites in the American River basin in the Sierra Nevada (United States). This basin is more densely vegetated and thus more challenging for SWE estimation than the previous applications of the EnBS. Both data assimilation methods provided significant improvement over the prior (modeling only) estimates, with both able to significantly reduce prior SWE biases. The prior RMSE values at the snow pillow and <b>snow</b> <b>course</b> sites were reduced by 68 %- 82 % and 60 %- 68 %, respectively, when applying the data assimilation methods. This result is encouraging for a basin like the American where the moderate to high forest cover will necessarily obscure more of the snow-covered ground surface than in previously examined, less-vegetated basins. The PBS generally outperformed the EnBS: for snow pillows the PBSRMSE was approx. 54 %of that seen in the EnBS, while for snow courses the PBSRMSE was approx. 79 %of the EnBS. Sensitivity tests show relative insensitivity for both the PBS and EnBS results to ensemble size and fSCA measurement error, but a higher sensitivity for the EnBS to the mean prior precipitation input, {{especially in the case}} where significant prior biases exist...|$|E
