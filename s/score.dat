40|$|Many proper <b>scoring</b> rules {{such as the}} Brier and log <b>scoring</b> rules implicitly reward a {{probability}} forecaster relative to a uniform baseline distribution. Recent work has motivated weighted proper <b>scoring</b> rules, which have an additional baseline parameter. To date two families of weighted proper <b>scoring</b> rules have been introduced, the weighted power and pseudospherical <b>scoring</b> families. These families are compatible with the log <b>scoring</b> rule: when the baseline maximizes the log <b>scoring</b> rule over some set of distributions, the baseline also maximizes the weighted power and pseudospherical <b>scoring</b> rules over the same set. We characterize all weighted proper <b>scoring</b> families and prove a general property: every proper <b>scoring</b> rule is compatible with some weighted <b>scoring</b> family, and every weighted <b>scoring</b> family is compatible with some proper <b>scoring</b> rule...|$|R

30|$|The main {{findings}} related to hypothesis one included significant correlations between overestimation bias <b>scores</b> and BAS self-report <b>scores.</b> Hypothesis one posited that higher BAS <b>scores</b> {{would be associated}} with greater overestimation bias <b>scores</b> for positive stimuli presentation. (Based on previous findings in the literature that visual emotional stimuli evoke arousal, higher BAS <b>scores</b> are associated with sensitivity to reward and positive emotionality, and BIS is associated with sensitivity to anxiety, novelty, and punishment.) The second part of hypothesis one was that higher BIS <b>scores</b> {{would be associated with}} greater overestimation bias <b>scores</b> for negative stimuli presentation on the same premise. Higher BAS <b>scores</b> were associated with positive stimuli presentation. However, BIS <b>scores</b> were not significantly correlated with overestimation bias <b>scores.</b> BAS Drive subscale <b>scores</b> were main contributors to this partial support of hypothesis one, as the <b>scores</b> from BAS Drive were the only subscale <b>scores</b> that were significantly correlated with overestimation bias <b>scores</b> for positive stimuli. When data for hypothesis one were stratified by sex, women’s BAS Drive <b>scores</b> were significantly correlated with overestimation bias <b>scores</b> for positive stimuli presentation, while no such relationship was evidenced for men’s BAS subscale <b>scores.</b> This may indicate the need to test for sex-related differences in affective time perception according to personality traits in the future.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination – Revised (ACE-R) is a {{dementia}} screening tool. The {{objectives of}} this study were to investigate rater accuracy in <b>scoring</b> the ACE-R in terms of its total and subscale <b>scores</b> and to examine whether <b>scoring</b> accuracy is affected by participant experience of using the ACE-R. Methods: Three filmed vignettes of the ACE-R being administered to older adult actors (mock patients) were used to assess <b>scoring</b> accuracy across multiple raters. The vignettes had a pre-determined ‘true score’. Study participants were required to complete ACE-R <b>scoring</b> sheets for each vignette. Participants were Community Nurses and Trainee Clinical Psychologists. Results: Participant <b>scores</b> were compared with the pre-determined true <b>scores</b> as a means of measuring <b>scoring</b> accuracy. The results indicated that the majority of participant <b>scores</b> were either the same as or within a few points of the true <b>scores.</b> However, when compared to the true <b>scores,</b> participant total <b>scores</b> differed significantly on two out of the three vignettes. <b>Scoring</b> accuracy was lowest for the Memory subscale of the ACE-R. <b>Scoring</b> accuracy issues were also identified for the Visuospatial and Attention and orientation subscales. Individual items which had low <b>scoring</b> accuracy were identified. Discussion: The majority of participants <b>scored</b> the same as or within a few points of the true <b>scores,</b> such deviation is likely to be clinically acceptable, providing over-emphasis is not placed on cut off <b>scores.</b> Professionals using the ACE-R should ensure they are familiar with the <b>scoring</b> guidelines for the items highlighted in this study as having low <b>scoring</b> accuracy.
