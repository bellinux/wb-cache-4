25|$|Perfoliate {{pondweed}} is {{not widely}} cultivated, which is perhaps surprising {{as it is}} not ecologically demanding and is an attractive plant. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. It is easy to grow in a garden pond or even in a barrel, but unlike some other submerged plants {{needs to be able}} to root in a suitable substrate such as sand or aquatic compost. Keeping nutrient levels low helps to prevent smothering by algae and more invasive aquatic plants. Plants being established <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>weighted</b> down initially to allow them to root, and benefit from being planted among other aquatic plants that can act as a 'nursery'. Transplants have a high survival rate once established.|$|E

50|$|In principle, foundationalism {{holds that}} basic beliefs {{unilaterally}} support derived beliefs, with support always directed {{from the former}} to the latter; coherentism holds that beliefs mutually support each other when they {{belong to the same}} coherent belief-set.

So the rival theories began to lean closer together. Moreover, those foundationalists who wondered why there couldn't be mutual support between basic and derived beliefs were in danger of falling into coherentism. Those coherentists who wondered why experiential beliefs <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>weighted</b> more heavily than others were also falling into foundationalism.|$|E

The operating times found in studies with a laparotomy control group range from 218 to 290  min [18, 21]. The {{operation time}} for the laparoscopic procedures is generally longer than for a laparotomy.

50|$|Quadrant 3: Low-involvement/ {{rational}} purchases: The third quadrant represents routine low-involvement purchases evident {{for many}} packaged goods such as detergents, tissues and other consumable household items. Consumers make habitual purchases, and after consumption {{the benefit of}} using the brand is reinforced which ideally results in long-term brand loyalty (re-purchase). Given {{that this is a}} rational purchase, consumers need to be informed or reminded of the product's benefits. Advertising messages should encourage repeat purchasing and brand loyalty while media strategy <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>weighted</b> towards media that can deliver high frequency required for reminder campaigns such as TV, radio and sales promotion.|$|E

5000|$|Quadrant 4: Low-involvement/ {{emotional}} purchases: In {{the final}} quadrant, consumers make low-involvement, relatively inexpensive purchases {{that make them}} feel good. Impulse purchases and convenience goods fall into this category. The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should [...] "congratulate" [...] customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>weighted</b> towards options that reach customers when they {{are close to the}} point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays.

50|$|In a {{study by}} Nancy Shore, {{community-based}} participatory researchers were interviewed for their interpretation and critique of the Belmont Report. Interviewees expressed concerns regarding the Belmont Reports ethical principles and interpretations as being {{one size fits all}} and advocated researchers to resist the tendency to rely on those principles systematically. It argues that the ethical analysis should be extended to take into account more appropriate factors, such as cultural, gender, ethnic and geographical considerations. Debate continues over the ethics and regulations of research involving human subjects because of discrepancies over the meaning and priority of the Belmont Reports basic ethical principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Notably, the Belmont Report does not specify how its three ethical principles <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>weighted</b> or prioritized. According to Albert R. Jonsen, a member of the National Commission that composed the report, the Institutional Review Board is charged with weighing these principles and deciding how they should be applied. Matters become controversial when deciding if the principles should be interpreted as more or less weighty depending upon the particular circumstances of the research in question, if the principles should be viewed as an obligation that society must undertake on behalf of its members, or if it should be viewed as giving absolute priority to respect for persons’ autonomy over the general good of society.|$|E

30|$|While we {{investigate}} two regular grid-like cell layouts herein, {{the concept of}} cluster rotation can also be applied to more general irregular layouts.

This {{may not be as}} simple as with a regular cell layout, but remains feasible, given a set of BS locations and coverage areas and/or where interference results without coordination. Voronoi diagrams of order n [36] could be of use to locate regions of coordinated BSs, by identifying the n nearest BSs at any given location; the distances <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>weighted</b> based on the type/tier of each transmitting node.

In this thesis we have studied three different interest rate models, namely; the Hull-White extended Vasicek model, the CIR++ model and the G 2 ++ model.
