50|$|Such fish as <b>shad,</b> <b>herring,</b> {{and striped}} bass—which make their migratory {{spawning}} runs between March and early June—had been blocked by Bosher, which made migration impossible {{for at least}} 300 miles upstream in the James, the Rivanna River, and other tributaries.While the dam still functions to get water into the Canal, which has {{become more of a}} historic feature than a means of transportation, it has also created conditions to make this section of the James suitable for powerboating with waterskiing and other activities typically available only on lakes and larger waterways.Perhaps the rise of powerboating explains why, rather than breach or demolish the dam, as has been the recent custom in other communities, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries decided instead to build an extensive fish ladder aside the dam.Opened in 1999, the fish ladder allows the migratory fish around the dam via a 17-inch-wide pathway.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Alden fish {{friendly}} turbine {{is designed}} to safely pass fish downstream at hydroelectric projects while generating power. The new technology was developed with funding from the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Advanced Hydro Turbine Systems Program and more recently with funding from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Applications for the new technology include using the turbine as a downstream fish bypass, passing minimum environmental flows, adding new capacity, and new developments at non-powered dams. With further development, this new technology could also be considered to replace existing conventional units. This turbine has been designed and model tested by Voith Hydro and is available for commercial application. This presentation will provide examples of potential full-scale installation applications. The examples {{range in size from}} 7 MW to 70 MW and varying fish species including eels, salmon, <b>shad,</b> <b>herring</b> and shortnose sturgeon. Information presented will include overall powerhouse arrangements, predicted fish passage survival for varying fish species and sizes, estimated equipment costs and estimated total project costs.

40|$|Global warming has {{increased}} the frequency of extreme climate events, yet responses of biological and human communities are poorly understood, particularly for aquatic ecosystems and fisheries. Retrospective analysis of known outcomes may provide insights {{into the nature of}} adaptations and trajectory of subsequent conditions. We consider the 1815 eruption of the Indonesian volcano Tambora and its impact on Gulf of Maine (GoM) coastal and riparian fisheries in 1816. Applying complex adaptive systems theory with historical methods, we analyzed fish export data and contemporary climate records to disclose human and piscine responses to Tambora’s extreme weather at different spatial and temporal scales while also considering sociopolitical influences. Results identified a tipping point in GoM fisheries induced by concatenating social and biological responses to extreme weather. Abnormal daily temperatures selectively affected targeted fish species—alewives, <b>shad,</b> <b>herring,</b> and mackerel—according to their migration and spawning phenologies and temperature tolerances. First to arrive, alewives suffered the worst. Crop failure and incipient famine intensified fishing pressure, especially in heavily settled regions where dams already compromised watersheds. Insufficient alewife runs led fishers to target mackerel, the next species appearing in abundance along the coast; thus, 1816 became the “mackerel year. ” Critically, the shift from riparian to marine fisheries persisted and expanded after temperatures moderated and alewives recovered. We conclude that contingent human adaptations to extraordinary weather permanently altered this complex system. Understanding how adaptive responses to extreme events can trigger unintended consequences may advance long-term planning for resilience in an uncertain future...|$|E

5000|$|Sport {{fishing for}} {{flathead}} catfish using either rod and reel, limb lines, or bare hands (noodling) {{can be an}} exciting pastime.

A common element of flathead catfish location is submerged wood cover such as logs and rootwads which often collect at bends in rivers. A good flathead spot usually also includes relatively deep water compared to the rest of a particular section of river, a moderate amount of current, and access to plentiful baitfish such as river <b>herring,</b> <b>shad,</b> carp, drum, panfish, or suckers. Anglers targeting large flathead catfish usually use stout tackle such as medium-heavy or heavy action rods from 6 - 10 ft in length with large line-capacity reels and line ranging from 20 - 80 lbf N test breaking strength. Generally large live baits are preferred such as river <b>herring,</b> <b>shad,</b> sunfish (such as bluegill), suckers, carp, goldfish, drum, and bullheads ranging from 5 - 12 in in length.|$|R

Anadromous fish were present at least as far upstream as Mendon, Massachusetts. While it appeared that salmon disappeared sometime in the 1700 s, <b>shad</b> and <b>herring</b> were caught into the 1800 s. The decline of these species has been attributed to the construction of dams along the river. Early laws passed by the Rhode Island General Assembly sought to protect the fisheries by limiting weirs, requiring that dams be opened seasonally, and that bypasses be made for the migrating fish. However, as manufacturing became increasingly important along the river, a gradual shift occurred, and laws were passed favoring factory owners and industrialization over the fisheries. The preexisting laws protecting the fishery were not enforced. Fish bypasses became blocked with dams of their own, the dams were made higher, and the flow of the river was often reduced. Other factors contributing to the decline of anadromous fish were the building of bridges that narrowed the river, the discharge of manufacturing wastes and sewage into the river, and overfishing...|$|R

Forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCombined small-angle x-ray {{scattering}} and {{transmission electron microscopy}} studies of intramuscular fish bone (<b>shad</b> and <b>herring)</b> indicate that the lateral packing of nanoscale calcium-phosphate crystals in collagen fibrils can be represented by irregular stacks of platelet-shaped crystals, intercalated with organic layers of collagen molecules.

Using the model, the diffuse fan-shaped small-angle {{x-ray scattering}} intensity profile, dominating the equatorial region of the scattering pattern, could be quantitatively analyzed {{as a function of}} the degree of mineralization. The mineral platelets were found to be very thin (1. 5 nm∼ 2. 0 nm), having a narrow thickness distribution. The thickness of the organic layers between adjacent mineral platelets within a stack is more broadly distributed with the average value varying from 6 nm to 10 nm, depending on the extent of mineralization.

40|$|The {{historic}} and present ranges of anadromous alosids and striped bass were determined {{for three of}} Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s rivers. American <b>shad,</b> blueback <b>herring,</b> and alewives migrated to at least Remington (river mile 188) on the Rappahannock River. They ascended {{the entire length of}} the York River, reaching at least Milford on the Mattaponi and {{the entire length of the}} Pamunkey.

Although striped bass were historically caught in the James as far upstream as Balcony Falls (near Glasgow) and probably as far upstream as shad on the other rivers, it is doubtful that they ever spawned above the fall line on any river. Present ranges for all species are Fredericksburg (Embrey Dam) on the Rappahannock, unchanged on the York, and Richmond (Bosher Dam) on the James.
