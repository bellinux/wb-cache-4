40|$|AbstractEbola virus (EBOV) is {{a highly}} {{pathogenic}} filovirus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and animals. Here we provide evidence that cell–cell contact promotes infection mediated by the glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV. Interestingly, expression of EBOV GP alone, {{even in the absence}} of retroviral Gag-Pol, is sufficient to transfer a retroviral vector encoding Tet-off from cell to cell. Cell-to-cell infection mediated by EBOV GP is blocked by inhibitors of actin polymerization, but appears to be less sensitive to KZ 52 neutralization. Treatment of co-cultured cells with cathepsin B/L inhibitors, or an entry inhibitor 3. 47 that targets the receptor NPC 1 for virus binding, also blocks cell-to-cell infection. Cell–cell contact also enhances <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> rVSV <b>bearing</b> GP in monocytes and macrophages, the primary targets of natural EBOV infection. Altogether, our study reveals that cell–cell contact promotes EBOV GP-mediated infection, and provides new insight into understanding EBOV spread and viral pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Variations in the polyomavirus major {{capsid protein}} VP 1 {{underlie}} important biological differences between highly pathogenic large-plaque and relatively nonpathogenic small-plaque strains. These polymorphisms constitute major determinants <b>of</b> virus <b>spread</b> in mice and also dictate previously recognized strain differences in sialyloligosaccharide binding. X-ray crystallographic {{studies have shown}} that these determinants affect binding to the sialic acids. Here we report results of further experiments designed to test the importance of specific contacts between VP 1 and the carbohydrate moieties of the receptor. With minor exceptions, substitutions at positions predicted from crystallography to be important in binding the terminal �- 2, 3 -linked sialic acid or the penultimate sugar (galactose) destroyed the ability of the virus to replicate in cell culture. Substitutions that prevented binding to a branched disialyloligosaccharide were found to result in viruses that were both viable in culture and tumorigenic in the mouse. Conversely, substitutions that allowed recognition and binding of the branched carbohydrate chain inhibited spread in the mouse, though the viruses remained viable in culture. Mice of five different inbred strains, all highly susceptible to large-plaque virus, showed resistance to the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> polyomavirus strains <b>bearing</b> the VP 1 type which binds the branched-chain receptor.

30|$|Why has polygyny, {{marriage}} {{of a man}} to multiple women, common in most societies throughout history, almost disappeared in modern industrialized countries? Do women {{play a role in}} its disappearance? A simple theoretical model suggests that at the later stage of the transition from polygyny to monogamy, the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> human capital and the increase of labor income have led to the rise of monogamy. A general equilibrium model of the marriage market illustrates that the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> human capital results in an increase in women’s income opportunities and lowers the importance of bequests in determining their sons’ incomes. Both effects improve women’s outside option, mating monogamously, and decrease the marginal benefit of the economic advantages provided by polygynous unions. This, in turn, reduces polygyny by increasing the cost of polygynous mating for men. When the human capital level is sufficiently high, men find it optimal to marry monogamously instead <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> the high cost of polygynous mating.|$|R

40|$|The high {{latitude}} ionosphere {{contains a}} multitude of large-scale ionospheric density structures. These act as tilted reflecting surfaces, which cause HF (3 - 30 MHz) radio signals to deviate from {{the plane of the}} great circle between the transmitter and receiver. There are also a large number of smaller scale electron density irregularities that scatter the signal out of the plane of the great circle. Consequently, measurements <b>of</b> the <b>bearing</b> <b>of</b> incoming HF signals are often found to be displayed from the great circle <b>bearing</b> <b>of</b> the transmitter, sometimes by as much as 100 °. This thesis is a study <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> measurements obtained during the period 1993 to 1996 over seven high latitude paths of various lengths and orientation. Characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>bearing</b> deviations are found to be strongly related to geophysical parameters such as geomagnetic activity (Ap) indices and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field since these also parameterise the morphology of large scale ionospheric density structures. In addition, the daily times of near-great circle propagation are found to relate strongly to Ap on paths lying in the region of the mid-latitude trough. Relationships are identified between bearing deviations and signal parameters such as the signal strength and the Doppler <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the signal spectrum. Ionograms have been recorded on two paths, and exhibit characteristic features that identify modes of propagation associated with reflections from tilted ionospheric layers and scattering from ionospheric irregularities. The associated bearings have been examined to determine the orientation of these tilts and/or the approximate location of scattering centres. The results of this research may be used as a basis for devising diagnostic tests to determine the level of confidence in the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> measurements made <b>of</b> HF signals at high latitudes...|$|R

40|$|Bearing is a {{key part}} of rotary machines, and its working {{condition}} is critical in normal operation of rotary machines. Vibrational signals are usually analyzed to monitor the status <b>of</b> <b>bearing.</b> However, information on the status <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> is always buried in heavy background noise; that is, status information <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> is weaker than the background noise. Extracting the status features <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> from signals buried in noise is difficult. Given this, a step-varying vibrational resonance (SVVR) method based on Duffing oscillator nonlinear system is proposed to enhance the weak status feature <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> by tuning different parameters. Extraction ability of SVVR was verified by analyzing simulation signal and practical bearing signal. Experimental results show that SVVR is more effective in extracting weak characteristic information than other methods, including multiscale noise tuning stochastic resonance (SR), Woods–Saxon potential-based SR, and joint Woods–Saxon and Gaussian potential-based SR. Two evaluation indices are investigated to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the fault detection capability of the SVVR method.
