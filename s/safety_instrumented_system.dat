50|$|A high-integrity {{pressure}} {{protection system}} (HIPPS) {{is a type}} of <b>safety</b> <b>instrumented</b> <b>system</b> (SIS) designed to prevent over-pressurization of a plant, such as a chemical plant or oil refinery.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of demands are crucial when analysing a <b>safety</b> <b>instrumented</b> <b>system</b> (SIS). IEC 61508 distinguishes between {{low and high}} demand mode when calculating risk for such a system. In reality there are systems that can not clearly be placed {{in one of the}} two modes. These types of systems are called intermediate demand mode systems, which we will analyse in this thesis. Not many published SIS reliability studies focus on the problems related to this borderline. Oliveira Oliveira 2 predicts somewhat strange behaviour for the hazard rate in the intermediate demand mode, as well as Jin with a focus on the demand duration.|$|E

Either automated actions or manual (operator) actions {{may be required to}} complete the <b>safety</b> <b>instrumented</b> function to place the process in a safe state or mitigate a hazard in response to an alarm or indication. DOE will issue a new standard, Application of <b>Safety</b> <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Systems</b> Used at DOE Nonreactor Nuclear Facilities, to provide guidance for the design, procurement, installation, testing, maintenance, operation, and quality assurance of SIS used in safety significant functions at DOE nonreactor nuclear facilities.

SIS design must take into account human-machine interfaces and their limitations and follow good human factors engineering (HFE) practices. HFE encompasses many diverse areas (e. g., information display, user-system interaction, alarm management, operator response, control room design, and system maintainability), which affect all aspects of system development and modification.
