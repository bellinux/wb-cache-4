5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum, {{commonly}} known as the rayed earthstar or four-footed earthstar, is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to the genus Geastrum, or earthstar fungi. First described scientifically by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, G.quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan—but not common—species of Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a <b>saprobe,</b> feeding off decomposing organic matter present in the soil and litter of coniferous forests.|$|E
5|$|A <b>saprobe</b> or parasite, O.nidiformis is nonspecific in its {{needs and}} is {{compatible}} {{with a wide variety}} of hosts. It has been recorded on native Banksia (including B.attenuata and B.menziesii), Hakea, Acacia, Nuytsia floribunda and various Myrtaceae, including Agonis flexuosa and Melaleuca species, and especially Eucalyptus, as well as Nothofagus, Casuarina species and Allocasuarina fraseriana, and even introduced trees such as Pinus or Platanus species. It plays an important role in breaking down wood and recycling nutrients into the soil.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a <b>saprobe,</b> and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E

50|$|Most Helotiales live as <b>saprobes</b> on soil humus, dead logs, {{manure and}} other organic matter.|$|R
50|$|Like all fungi, {{they are}} heterotrophs with some being {{described}} as <b>saprobes</b> (with weak evidence).|$|R
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model <b>saprobe</b> in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella surrecta {{is a rare}} species, {{even though}} its major host is quite common; the {{conditions}} required for the parasite to produce fruit bodies are not well known. Some authors have suggested that it may grow equally well as a parasite or a <b>saprobe.</b> V.surrecta has been found on its host in several different habitat types, including birch woodlands, pine plantations, scrub, thickets of small trees or shrubs beside roads, and under brambles. No definite preference for soil type has been determined, having been found in sands, clay, gravels, and peat. In 1867, Worthington George Smith {{reported that he had}} successfully cultivated the species by partially burying fruit bodies under water-soaked rotting fir leaves that were placed in a bell-glass in a warm room. According to his account, a white mycelium grew over the leaves and eventually formed small white pins (immature, undifferentiated fruit bodies) that grew into fully formed mushrooms about two weeks after starting.|$|E
500|$|The surface {{mycelium}} of M.haematopus is whitish and fluffy. Swelling at {{the terminal}} tips of hyphae (diameter up to 12µm) is present, {{but not very}} abundant, and [...] hyphae are very rare. Bioluminescence is present, but weak. Extracellular oxidase enzymes are present, consistent with its ecological role as a <b>saprobe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mucoromycotina {{includes}} {{many of the}} model Zygomycetes. It {{includes many}} rapidly growing species. Most are <b>saprobes,</b> plant pathogens, and mycoparasites. Some induce human mycosis.|$|R

50|$|Pluteus {{is a large}} genus of fungi {{with over}} 300 species. They are wood rotting <b>saprobes</b> with pink spore prints and gills that are free from the stem.|$|R
500|$|Armillaria gallica (synonymous with A.bulbosa and A.lutea) is {{a species}} of honey {{mushroom}} in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales order. The species is a common and ecologically important wood-decay fungus that can live as a <b>saprobe,</b> or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or butt rot. It is found in temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been inadvertently introduced to South Africa. Armillaria gallica has had a confusing taxonomy, {{due in part to}} historical difficulties encountered in distinguishing between similar Armillaria species. The fungus received international attention in the early 1990s when an individual colony living in a Michigan forest was reported to cover an area of , weigh at least , and be 1,500 years old. This individual is popularly known as the [...] "humungous fungus", and is a tourist attraction and inspiration for an annual mushroom-themed festival in Crystal Falls.|$|E
500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is {{a common}} species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae with a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. The fruit bodies of the <b>saprobe</b> typically grow in clusters on or near rotting hardwood tree stumps or underground tree roots. Depending on their stage of development, the tawny-brown mushroom caps may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to [...] The caps, marked with fine radial grooves that extend nearly to the center, rest atop whitish stems up to [...] long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective mica-like cells that provide the inspiration for both the mushroom's species name and the common names mica cap, shiny cap, and glistening inky cap. Although small and with thin flesh, the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the gills will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, spore-laden liquid—an enzymatic process called autodigestion or deliquescence. The fruit bodies are edible before the gills blacken and dissolve, and cooking will stop the autodigestion process.|$|E
500|$|Pholiota squarrosa, {{commonly}} known as the shaggy scalycap, the shaggy Pholiota, or the scaly Pholiota, is a species of mushroom in the Strophariaceae family. Common in North America and Europe, it is often an opportunistic parasite, and has a wide range of hosts among deciduous trees, although it can also infect conifers. It can also live as a <b>saprobe,</b> deriving nutrients from decomposing wood. The mushroom is typically found growing in clusters at the base of trees and stumps. Both the cap and the stem are covered in [...] small, pointed scales that are pointed downward and backward. The crowded gills are yellowish, then later rust-brown. The mushroom has an odor that, depending on the author, has been described as resembling garlic, lemon, radish, onion, or skunk. It has a strong taste, resembling radishes. [...] Once thought to be edible, it is now considered and known to be poisonous, especially if consumed in combination with alcohol. The mushroom contains unique chemicals thought to help it infect plants by neutralizing defensive responses employed by them. The very similar P.squarrosoides differs in having a paler cap that is sticky between the scales, and smaller spores.|$|E
30|$|Sarocladium {{species are}} {{frequently}} associated with grasses as <b>saprobes,</b> parasites, and mutualistic endophytes. A species of Sarocladium (anamorphic Hypocreales) was isolated as endophytic fungus from the coastal grass Spinifex littoreus (Poaceae).|$|R

30|$|As {{regard to}} Leotiomycetes, this class {{includes}} both non-lichen- and lichen-forming fungi. These species colonize a large variety of habitats, and act as <b>saprobes</b> or form parasitic associations {{with a wide range}} of other organisms. Besides parasites and <b>saprobes,</b> the group includes endophytes and symbionts of a wide range of plants (Wang et al. 2006 a) and it has recently been signalled also from marine environments (Burgaud et al. 2009; Jones and Pang 2012 a, [b]). Moreover, similarly to Dothideomycetes, many helotialean fungi are known only from a teleomorphic stage. Their anamorphs are either undiscovered or it is assumed that they have been lost in the process of evolution (Wang et al. 2006 b).|$|R
30|$|The Capnodiales {{are mainly}} defined by their shared {{ecological}} niche as leaf epiphytes {{associated with the}} honey dew produced by insects and <b>saprobes</b> or leaf pathogens and are an ascostromatal order without pseudoparaphyses (Hughes 1976; Crous et al. 2009 a; Chomnunti et al. 2011).|$|R
