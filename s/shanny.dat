2500|$|The common blenny, {{also known}} as the <b>shanny,</b> is found in {{northern}} temperate waters. They hide under rocks and in crannies in rock pools when the tide is out. They feed on green seaweed and invertebrates such as barnacles. They can crawl on dry land, using their paired fins. About 16cm long, they have smooth skin, without scales, and are covered with soft slime. The slime prevents them drying if they are stranded on a shore between tides. So long as their skin stays moist, they can breathe out of water. They are sometimes called [...] "sea frogs" [...] because they bask in the sun on weeds outside the water, and like frogs, jump to safety when disturbed. They can change their colour to match their surroundings. The female lays eggs in crevices or under stones and the male guards them until they hatch. In the winter, when storms can be severe, they move out of their rock pools into the shallows. The common blenny is bold with strong teeth, and will bite humans if it feels threatened.|$|E

In 1996 and 1997, years of locally low capelin abundance, I measured murre chick diet composition, feeding rates, breeding success, chick growth, adult masses, maximum dive depths and off-duty pair members' time spent at site. I then compared these data with those gathered by previous researchers in years when capelin were more abundant (1981, 1982 and 1983). After the decline, murres fed their chicks up to 75 percent less capelin and up to 65 per cent more daubed <b>shannies</b> than they had fifteen years previously. Feeding rates of both species varied by up to 250 per cent among the five years, but this variation was not concomitant with changes {{in the proportion of}} capelin in the chicks' diets. The murres' dietary shift did not seem to affect their colony attendance adversely; counts of both murres on some plots increased, while on others they did not differ significantly. Neither murre species had significantly different breeding success among years. Chicks of both species grew well following the decline in capelin availability.

40|$|Species with {{dispersal}} {{mediated by}} planktonic larvae {{are expected to}} be more likely to show temporal genetic variation, due to differences in larval mortality and dispersal ability. The <b>shanny</b> Lipophrys pholis is a typical benthic rocky intertidal fish and its dispersion is limited to its long larval stage. In contrast, the sand-smelt Atherina presbyter has a very short planktonic life, small size and weak swimming capabilities, which translates into reduced dispersion potential. A total of 226 specimens of L. pholis (collected in 2003, 2013 and 2014) and 281 of A. presbyter (collected in 2005, 2012, 2013 and 2014) were screened for genetic variation using the mitochondrial control region. Only 12 (out of 171) and 25 (out of 155) haplotypes found were shared between sampling periods for the <b>shanny</b> and the sand smelt, respectively. For both species, haplotype networks showed a deep genealogy with multiple levels of diversification and no temporal structure. Interestingly, some of the previously inferred missing haplotypes were sampled in more recent years. The genetic diversity indices showed little variation among sampling periods and were generally high. For L. pholis significant genetic differentiation was detected between 2013 and 2014, while no significant differences were detected between sampling periods in A. presbyter. The <b>shanny</b> showed lower effective population size per generation when compared to the sand-smelt (which yielded lack of evidence for genetic drift for the first and second period of the study).

40|$|The {{study of}} the phylogeography of inshore fish from West Europe is {{revealing}} diverse geographical and demographical patterns. Some species conform to the phylogeographic patterns typical of terrestrial organisms, with marked signatures of the last glaciation and a decline of genetic diversity {{to the north of}} the species range. Other species, however, reveal no decline in diversity with latitude and signatures of expansions older than the last glaciation. The <b>shanny</b> Lipophrys pholis is a common intertidal resident fish in west European rocky shores. It is unable to leave the rocky stretch where it settled as a juvenile, so that dispersal depends entirely on the planktonic larval stage. These life-history and behavioural traits make the <b>shanny</b> an interesting species for phylogeographical analysis, as long-range movements by adults, which could blur historical signals, are absent. In this paper the phylogeography of L. pholis was studied using a fragment of the mitochondrial control region and one from the first intron of the S 7 ribosomal protein gene. The European samples (ranging from SW Spain to the Netherlands) did not display population differentiation, isolation-by-distance or latitudinal declines in genetic diversity. Iberia was proposed as having operated as the main glacial refugium for the <b>shanny.</b> The genealogy of the European population showed that the largest expansion detected was older than the last glaciation, with lineages persisting from the early Pleistocene, which does not conform to colonisation by a few founders in the current interglacial. It is argued that if fishes have very large population sizes and high dispersal rates, populations can efficiently track climatic shifts so that little or no genetic structure remains after each range expansion and latitudinal gradients of genetic diversity tend to be weak or non-existent...|$|E

Dower, J. A. Helbig, and W. C. Leggett Abstract: We followed three patches of larval radiated <b>shanny</b> (Ulvaria subbifurcata) using drogued drifters to assess regional differences in growth and mortality rates. We estimate dispersive losses directly using local surveys of surface currents corrected for the tidally induced divergence {{caused by the}} lack of synopticity of our surveys. We also monitored the abundance of juvenile capelin (Mallotus villosus), the major planktivore in the region, using hydroacoustic integration. The pattern of divergence–convergence showed considerable temporal and spatial variability, which resulted in substantial changes in the inferred biological mortality rates. The net mortality rates appeared to be directly proportional to the local abundance of pelagic fish. As with other patch studies, we are limited in the number of observations we obtained, but the results of this multidisciplinary study do suggest a strong potential for prey– predator interactions between larvae and adult planktivorous fish.

40|$|The daubed <b>shanny</b> (Leptoclinus maculatus, Family Stichaeidae) is {{considered}} to be an ecologically significant species in the arctic waters of Norway because of high abundance and the unique energy storage abilities of its postlarvae. Both postlarvae and adults are found in relative large abundances in Svalbard fjords as well as along the ice edge of north-east Svalbard, even at sub-zero temperatures. The postlarva feeds primarily on Calanus spp. and stores lipids from this high-energy diet in a unique lipid sac on the ventral side of its body. This energy storage enables it to survive pelagically during the arctic winters when food is scarce. The postlarvae are pelagic for the first 2 – 3 years of their life before they descend to the bottom and transform to a benthic mode of life. Our results indicated that this transition takes place when the postlarva reach about 80 mm in length and an age of 3 years. The relative size of the lipid sac, as well as changes in the morphology of the postlarvae, can be used as indices of the transition from pelagic postlarva to benthic juvenile. The lipid sac index (% of gutted weight) was negatively correlated with length and age and started to decrease when the postlarva transformed to a benthic lifestyle. At this point, the growth in terms of the length–weight relationship shifted from a positive asymptotic growth to a negative asymptotic growth, reflecting the changes in the lipid sac index, while several changes in morphological traits took place. The benthic mode of early juveniles is largely influenced by environmental conditions and prey abundance, since the fish is depleted from their energy stores and need to rapidly switch to benthic prey in their new habitat. In conclusion, this is the first study on the early life history of the daubed <b>shanny</b> and it presents evidence that the first 5 years in the life of this species is divided in two distinct parts, one pelagic and one benthic, in which postlarvae display unique growth and morphological traits adapted to the challenges of these arctic marine environments...|$|E

Feeding success and growth were derived from the analysis of gut content and otolith micro-structure of larvae from four cohorts (1997 – 2000) from the southern Gulf of St Lawrence. We observed {{a high degree of}} serial cor-relation in otolith growth (OG) from hatching, suggesting that events occurring early in life have long-standing effects on future growth potential. The diet of fast-growing individuals was dominated by large prey, such as cladocerans and fish larvae (including conspecifics), while slow-growing larvae foraged primarily on smaller copepod naupliar stages. Both feeding success (stomach content) and an index of condition (body depth) were positively correlated with OG, and these relationships explained approximately three times more variance in mackerel than in larval radiated <b>shanny</b> (Ulvaria subbifurcata) of similar size. Relationships linking age-dependent scores of body depth to feeding success and growth were 3. 5 – 4 times stronger than those based on length-dependent indices, suggesting that differences in energy allocation during early ontogeny may {{play a significant role in}} determining an individual’...|$|E
