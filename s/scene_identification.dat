We {{are all very}} sophisticated, but not infallible at <b>scene</b> <b>{{identification}},</b> face identification and speech perception. Traditional explanations attribute this expertise to some holistic, somewhat specialized, mechanisms. Perhaps such quick identifications are achieved by more specific and complex perceptual detectors which gradually [...] "chunk" [...] (i.e., unitize) features that tend to concur, {{making it easier to}} pull a whole set of information. Whether any concurrence of features can gradually be chunked with practice or chunking can only be obtained with some pre-disposition (e.g. faces, phonological categories) is an open question. Current findings suggest that such expertise is correlated with {{a significant increase in the}} cortical volume involved in these processes. Thus, we all have somewhat specialized face areas, which may reveal an innate property, but we also develop somewhat specialized areas for written words as opposed to single letters or strings of letter-like symbols. Moreover, special experts in a given domain have larger cortical areas involved in that domain. Thus, expert musicians have larger auditory areas. These observations are in line with traditional theories of enrichment proposing that improved performance involves an increase in cortical representation. For this expertise, basic categorical identification may be based on enriched and detailed representations, located to some extent in specialized brain areas. Physiological evidence suggests that training for refined discrimination along basic dimensions (e.g. frequency in the auditory modality) also increases the representation of the trained parameters, though in these cases the increase may mainly involve lower-level sensory areas.|$|E
40|$|In range sensing with time-multiplexed {{structured}} light, {{there is}} a trade-off between accuracy, robustness and the acquisition period. The acquisition period is lower bounded by {{the product of the}} number of projection patterns and the time needed for acquiring a single image. In this paper a novel structured light method is described. Adaptation of the number and form of the projection patterns to the characteristics of the scene takes place as part of the acquisition process. Noise margins are matched to the actual noise level, thus reducing the number of projection patterns to the necessary minimum. Color is used for light plane labeling. The dimension of the pattern space (and the noise margins) are thus increased without raising the number of projection patterns. It is shown that the color of an impinging light plane can be identified from the image of the illuminated scene, even with colorful <b>scenes.</b> <b>Identification</b> is local and does not rely on spatial color sequences. Therefore, in comparison to other color structured light techniques, assumptions about smoothness and color neutrality of the scene can be relaxed. The suggested approach has been implemented and the theoretical results are supported by experiments...|$|R

Owing to errors in <b>scene</b> <b>identification</b> and to the relationship between the spatial scales of cloud systems and the spatial resolution of the ERBE scanner, the anisotropy of the radiation fields determined from ERBE observations was suspected of exhibiting a field of view size dependence.

Comparing the anisotropy for constant size fields of view with that obtained using unaltered full-resolution scanner observations, it was found that there were significant and systematic differences of the order of 5 10 % for all scene types.

The ERBE maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) <b>scene</b> <b>identification</b> {{is assumed to be}} accurate for nadir fields of view. Various combinations of neighboring ERBE scanner fields of view at nadir are used to determine the population of cloud scene types as a function of field of view size. Longwave and shortwave thresholds are then determined for each of the ERBE solar zenith, satellite view zenith, and relative azimuth angular bins so that the population of cloud scene types at a particular satellite view zenith angle is consistent with the field of view size at the particular satellite view zenith angle. Differences between the anisotropy of reflected sunlight and emitted longwave radiation obtained using the new <b>scene</b> <b>identification</b> method and that obtained using the ERBE MLE method show that the ERBE radiative fluxes have satellite view zenith angle dependent biases. Thresholds are also developed for cloud <b>scene</b> <b>identification</b> with fields of view that are constructed to have a constant size with satellite view zenith angle. The angular dependence of reflected sunlight and emitted longwave radiation for scenes identified with these thresholds show little dependence on field of view size.

The CERES instrument consists of a threechannel broadband scanning radiometer. The scanning radiometer measures radiances in shortwave (SW, 0. 3 - 5 micron), window (WN, 8 - 12 micron), and total (0. 3 - 200 micron) channels. The longwave (LW) component is derived as the difference between total and SW channels. These measured radiances at a given sun-Earthsatellite geometry are converted to outgoing reflected solar and emitted thermal TOA radiative fluxes by using CERES scene-type dependent angular distribution models (ADMs). The CERES instruments must remain radiometrically stable and correctly inter-calibrated to accurately capture changes in Earth"s radiation budget from interannual to decadal timescales. This presentation will focus on comparisons between collocated radiance measurements from CERES instruments on Aqua and on Suomi-NPP.
