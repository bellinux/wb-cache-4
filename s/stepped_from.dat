5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E

25|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 1958 {{in a game}} against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> the batter's box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman— one {{who turned out to be}} the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.|$|E

For several months, they lived packed into the small frontier farmhouse of the local Thralls family {{along with a few}} postulants that had been waiting for them when they arrived. With the founding of this new order separate from that in France, Guerin became known as Mother Theodore, the superior of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, November 24, Oswald {{was being}} escorted by detectives through the {{basement}} of Dallas Police Headquarters toward an armored car that was {{to take him to}} the nearby county jail.

Oswald was taken unconscious by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital—the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07p.m. Dallas police chief Jesse Curry announced Oswald's death on a TV news broadcast.|$|E

25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E

500|$|Prince Albert {{arrived at}} 10 a.m. at the Great Western Railway terminus. The royal train, {{conducted}} by Brunel himself, had taken {{two hours and}} forty minutes from London. There was a guard of honour {{of members of the}} police force, soldiers and dragoons and, as the Prince <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> the train, the band of the Life Guards played works by Labitsky and a selection from the [...] "Ballet of Alma". Two sections of the platform were boarded off for the reception and it was noted by The Bristol Mirror that parts were covered with carpets from the Council House. The Prince Consort, dressed as a private gentleman, was accompanied by his equerry-in-waiting, personal secretary, the Marquess of Exeter, and Lords Wharncliffe, Liverpool, Lincoln and Wellesley.|$|E

The [...] "silvery sky giants, manned by their blue ribbon crews" [...] flew over National Airport (now Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) in {{formation}} at 9:30pm and landed. The generals and crews <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> their aircraft, LeMay waiting until he was smoking one of his signature cigars. Along with senior USAAF staff and reporters, wives and family were at the airport to greet the airmen, {{as well as a}} crowd of onlookers. Photographs were taken at the airport, then the airmen were whisked off to the Statler Hotel, now the Capital Hilton. In the lobby, the weary, grimy and stubble-bearded men were besieged for autographs. Some of them stayed up later to hear supper-club singer Hildegarde in the grand showroom, others went to bed to catch up on sleep.|$|E
500|$|Around 3 p.m., {{the cannon}} fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern {{soldiers}} <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> the ridgeline and advanced the {{three-quarters of a}} mile (1,200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as [...] "Pickett's Charge". As the Confederates approached, there was fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from Hancock's II Corps. In the Union center, the commander of artillery had held fire during the Confederate bombardment (in order to save it for the infantry assault, which Meade had correctly predicted the day before), leading Southern commanders to believe the Northern cannon batteries had been knocked out. However, they opened fire on the Confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results. Nearly {{one half of the}} attackers did not return to their own lines.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{air base}} {{that would serve}} as the {{launching}} point was called Mizutani at Chitose locally, and Sapporo Air Base by the Americans. Today it is the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Camp Higashi-Chitose. It was built at {{the southern part of}} Japan's northern island Hokkaidō, near the city of Sapporo, as the base for long-range flights to attack the U.S.—one-way suicide trips made by four-engine bombers—a function that it never served. The three B-29s landed safely, and LeMay <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> his aircraft to be greeted by approximately 30 Japanese soldiers and the base commander, who saluted for some time before realizing that LeMay had no intention of returning the salute. With that treatment setting the tone for U.S.–Japan relations in the area, the airmen made certain to wear side arms as they walked around downtown Sapporo on the evenings of September 16 and 17. LeMay later said that the 3,000 Japanese sailors manning the air base were [...] "polite" [...] and posed no threat.|$|E

500|$|Most of Yonkers' {{economy in}} the early 19th century {{was derived from the}} Saw Mill River. As of 1813, there was a small wharf {{slightly}} upstream from the mouth where the sloops that carried river trade put in. Five small mills existed along the river above the village, all with their own dams, small mill ponds, and nearby tenements for the workers. The stagecoach route up the Post Road stopped at an inn near the bridge; a few stores existed to supply the workers there and at the mills. [...] Some pastures and orchards existed, but the rocky soil deterred most attempts at farming. (A historian later wrote that it was said at the time that [...] "the succession of boulders was so continuous that one might have <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> Getty Square to the present Glenwood without setting his foot upon the ground".) Between the rocky soil and Wells' general refusal to sell or lease most of his land, there were so few settlers in Yonkers that two schoolhouses built during the Revolution fell into severe neglect {{due to the lack of}} students.|$|E

2500|$|In 1919 Delilah L.

The aged Colonel {{was on his way to}} preach in a small church of the village and had just <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> a Pacific Electric street car when these men knocked him down and ran over him, killing him through their careless driving, his death, occurring within twenty-four hours afterwards without his regaining [...] consciousness, was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky to the people of the State. He had spent the two years previous in dictating and assisting Professor Charles Alexander to write his autobiography." [...] The book had been sent to the publishers and was ready to come off the press when he was killed.|$|E

According to the French accounts, of which Voltaire's is the best known, Lord Charles <b>stepped</b> <b>from</b> the ranks and, in response to a similar movement promptly made by the French commander, politely called to him to order his people to fire, but in reply was assured, with equal politeness, that the French guards never fired first. According to the story which he himself sent in a letter to his brother three weeks later, his men came within twenty or thirty paces of the enemy, whereupon he advanced in front of the regiment, drank to the health of the French, bantered them with more spirit than pungency on their defeat at Dettingen, and then turned and called on his own men to huzzah, which they did. Hay recalled that [...] "it was our regiment that attacked the French Guards: and when we came to within twenty or thirty paces of them, I advanced before our regiment; drank to them and told them that we were the English Guards, and hoped they would stand till we came quite up to them, and not swim the Scheldt as they did the Main at Dettingen." ...|$|E
