The protectors are provided with extensions through {{the structure of the}} aircraft's outer surface and within a <b>static</b> <b>discharger.</b> Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical electronic equipment. Aircraft lightning protection provides an electrical path having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high voltage field form an ionization channel due to the system's breakdown voltage. Various lightning protection systems must reject the surge currents associated with the lightning strikes. Lightning protection means for aircraft include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of composite structures. Various ground connection means to the layers comprises a section of wire mesh fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent ground structure. Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.|$|E

Finely divided solid substances dispersed into a dust cloud (e. g. into a silo) can form a potential explosive atmosphere, {{if in the}} right concentration with the oxidizing agent (e. g. air).
