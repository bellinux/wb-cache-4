500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting to <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at one time, {{the other at}} another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that {{it makes no sense}} to simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E
500|$|At Peking Airport, contingents of the Chinese {{military}} {{await the}} arrival of the American presidential aircraft [...] "Spirit of '76", carrying Nixon and his party. The military chorus sings the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. After the aircraft touches down, Nixon emerges with Pat Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The president exchanges stilted greetings with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai, who heads the welcoming party. Nixon speaks of the historical significance of the visit, and of his hopes and fears for the encounter ("News has a kind of mystery"). The scene changes to Chairman Mao's study, where the Chairman awaits {{the arrival of}} the presidential party. Nixon and Kissinger enter with Chou, and Mao and the president converse in banalities as photographers record the scene. In the discussion that follows, the westerners are confused by Mao's gnomic and frequently impenetrable comments, which are amplified by his secretaries and often by Chou. The scene changes again, to the evening's banquet in the Great Hall of the People. Chou toasts the American visitors ("We have begun to celebrate the different ways") and Nixon responds ("I have attended many feasts"), after which the toasts continue as the atmosphere becomes increasingly convivial. Nixon, a politician who rose to prominence on anti-communism, announces: [...] "Everyone, listen; just let me <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> I opposed China, I was wrong".|$|E

2500|$|In an August 27, 2006, {{appearance}} on Meet the Press, Novak {{was asked if}} indeed Armitage was his source of Mrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA operative. Novak responded: [...] "I told Mr. Isikoff... that I do not identify my sources on any subject if they're on a confidential basis until they identify themselves... I'm going to <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> though, I haven't said before. And that is that I believe {{that the time has}} way passed for my source to identify himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 2016 interview, Han Kang stated, [...] "I {{think this}} novel has some layers: {{questioning}} human {{violence and the}} (im)possibility of innocence; defining sanity and madness; the (im)possibility of understanding others, body as the last refuge or the last determination, and some more. It will be inevitable that different aspects are more focused on by different readers and cultural backgrounds. If I could <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> this novel isn’t a singular indictment of the Korean patriarchy. I wanted {{to deal with my}} long-lasting questions about the possibility/impossibility of innocence in this world, which is mingled with such violence and beauty. These were universal questions that occupied me as I wrote it".|$|E

I am proud that Israel is among the most open countries in the world in relation to the LGBT community discourse." [...] During an event held for the annual community rights day at the Knesset, Netanyahu proclaimed that he was [...] "asked to come here in the middle of my busy schedule to <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to the male and female members of the LGBT community: We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 21, 2012, the duo {{released}} a statement announcing their hiatus. Redfoo said, [...] "I feel like we've {{been doing this for}} so long, four or five years" [...] and that he and SkyBlu would not be performing together anytime soon as they would be taking their careers in different directions. Once the news surfaced that band members Redfoo and SkyBlu had split, the group went to MTV News to set the record straight. SkyBlu said, [...] "Well, you know, first of all, we're not breaking up. I know that for sure. We're family and stuff, so it's always love ... It's interesting because somebody will <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> [...] it's just like high school, {{then all of a sudden}} [...] 'They're breaking up. They're fighting.'" [...] However, it has been revealed by SkyBlu that their plan is for fans to see the band as individuals and then come back stronger than ever.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "speaking with a forked tongue" [...] {{means to}} {{deliberately}} <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and mean another or, to be hypocritical, or {{act in a}} duplicitous manner. In the longstanding tradition of many Native American tribes, [...] "speaking with a forked tongue" [...] has meant lying, and a person was no longer considered worthy of trust, once he had been shown to [...] "speak with a forked tongue". This phrase was also adopted by Americans {{around the time of}} the Revolution, and may be found in abundant references from the early 19th century– often reporting on American officers who sought to convince the tribal leaders with whom they negotiated that they [...] "spoke with a straight and not with a forked tongue" [...] (as for example, President Andrew Jackson told the Creek Nation in 1829). According to one 1859 account, the native proverb that the [...] "white man spoke with a forked tongue" [...] originated as a result of the French tactic of the 1690s, in their war with the Iroquois, of inviting their enemies to attend a Peace Conference, only to be slaughtered or captured.|$|E

5000|$|Penn did not {{generally}} view hypocrisy as a problem. If {{a person was}} <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and doing another, Penn believed he would at least agree with either what the person was saying or with what the person was doing.|$|R
60|$|C. Wal. Don't quote Scripture here, sir, {{especially}} in that gross literal way! The new lights here have {{taught us that}} Scripture's <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> is a certain proof that it means another. Except, by the bye, in one text.|$|R

50|$|A third theme expresses anti-upper class sentiments. Lady Basildon, and Lady Markby are {{consistently}} portrayed as absurdly two-faced, <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>one</b> moment, then turning around {{to say the}} exact opposite (to great comic effect) to someone else. The overall portrayal of the upper class in England displays an attitude of hypocrisy and strict observance of silly rules.|$|R
