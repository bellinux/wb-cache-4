5|$|Cleaning up any spill {{immediately}} and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> other absorbent material {{directly on the}} spill. Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed. The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.|$|E
5|$|For {{adventitious}} protection, {{an animal}} uses {{materials such as}} twigs, <b>sand,</b> <b>or</b> pieces of shell to conceal its outline, for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case, or when a decorator crab decorates its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.|$|E
25|$|Oil sands, {{also known}} as tar <b>sands</b> <b>or</b> crude bitumen, or more {{technically}} bituminous sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit. Oil sands are either loose <b>sands</b> <b>or</b> partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, and water, saturated with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen (or colloquially as tar due to its superficially similar appearance).|$|R
30|$|The {{bright spots}} as {{observed}} in the seismic data in Fig.  17 are typically associated with direct hydrocarbon indicators, which {{are said to be}} stratigraphic traps, but not necessarily hydrocarbon bearing due to many reasons. One of them may be due to lithology–fluid, lithology–porosity, porosity–fluid and even lithology–lithology existence ambiguities in the investigating areas. In principle, they are low-impedance gas <b>sands.</b> <b>Or</b> they could be <b>sands</b> <b>or</b> shales under overpressure. They can be highly cemented <b>sands</b> <b>or</b> coal beds and top of salt diapers or could be due to their formation anisotropy. Because of these reasons, there is still ambiguity in arguing that bright spots are not necessarily all the time hydrocarbon traps.|$|R
50|$|The kicksled is {{in common}} use in Norway, Sweden and Finland, {{especially}} where roads are not <b>sanded</b> <b>or</b> salted.|$|R
5|$|Growing medium - Free-draining, humus-rich, {{somewhat}} acid {{growing media}} {{are used for}} commercial production, such as a mixture of peat or leafmould and an inert material such as grit, sharp <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> polystyrene beads. It is recommended that plants should be grown in relatively small pots; half-height pots are suitable.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, <b>sand,</b> <b>or</b> pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{primitive}} order and members do not extrude their stomach when feeding, lack an anus {{and have no}} suckers on their tube feet. Papulae are plentiful on their aboral surface and they possess marginal plates and paxillae. They mostly inhabit soft-bottomed areas of <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> mud. There is no brachiolaria stage in their larval development. The comb starfish (Astropecten polyacanthus) {{is a member of}} this order.|$|E
50|$|Sands of the Nile, {{also known}} as Hindu <b>Sands</b> <b>or</b> <b>Sands</b> of the Desert, is a popular magic trick {{performed}} since {{the early part of}} the 20th century. It was a staple of Doug Henning's stage and television shows.|$|R
50|$|The shrub {{typically}} {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 0.5 to 1.8 m. It is found in deep <b>sands</b> <b>or</b> loam over granite.|$|R

5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{takes place}} in the three mountainous regions at 45 {{distinct}} coal beds near Mesozoic basins. Over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate, kyanite, <b>sand,</b> <b>or</b> gravel, were also mined in Virginia in 2012. The state's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism. 35 million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting crater may explain sinking and earthquakes in the region.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E

5|$|Flea larvae {{emerge from}} the eggs to feed on any {{available}} organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding.|$|E
5|$|Habitats {{within the}} SSSI include reed beds, salt marshes, {{freshwater}} lagoons and <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> shingle beaches. The wetlands {{are important for}} wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities. Ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles, natterjack toads and several scarce plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, {{though a few}} are known to occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills {{to return to a}} den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E

5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within a {{kilometer}} (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found {{most often in}} areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live {{in areas where the}} sea floor consists primarily of mud, <b>sand,</b> <b>or</b> silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{obscuration}} {{caused by}} yellow clouds had been {{noted in the}} 1870s when they were observed by Schiaparelli. Evidence for such clouds was observed during the oppositions of 1892 and 1907. In 1909, Antoniadi noted {{that the presence of}} yellow clouds was associated with the obscuration of albedo features. He discovered that Mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when the planet was closest to the Sun and was receiving more energy. He suggested windblown <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> dust as the cause of the clouds.|$|E
60|$|Another note-book {{reveals a}} deeper romance {{in the case}} of Miss Emily; this is related by Anne of Green Gables, who once or twice flashes across the scene, though for the most part her friends and neighbors at White <b>Sands</b> <b>or</b> Newbridge or Grafton as well as at Avonlea are the persons involved.|$|R

5|$|The lagoons {{behind the}} shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty {{due to the}} {{percolation}} of seawater through the bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including the starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, and lagoon cockle. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the water beetle yellow pogonus, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It {{is possible that the}} area was inhabited for considerably longer, with evidence of an Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm <b>sand</b> <b>or</b> submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
