40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present a {{rationale}} to explore the use of clinical tests for the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> to detect early axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and to suggest a protocol to validate these clinical tests. Based on the European Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatments of Pelvic Girdle Pain, we propose a set of six clinical tests to identify the likely presence of inflammation in the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> associated with early axial SpA. As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current gold standard used to identify inflammation in the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints,</b> the results of the proposed set of clinical tests are compared with those from the MRI examinations. We hypothesize that specific clinical tests, which combine pain provocation and functional tests, for assessing the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> will help to identify early active inflammation at the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> in axial SpA. If such tests prove to be sensitive and specific, they could add further value to the diagnostic classification criteria for axial SpA...|$|R

500|$|Berry overcame several {{physical}} ailments {{during his}} football career, a fact he became famous for, {{but one that}} according to Berry was often exaggerated by the media. He was skinny and injury prone, such that when his college teammates saw {{him for the first}} time they sarcastically dubbed him, [...] "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy". Reportedly, because one leg was shorter than the other, Berry had to wear padding inside his shoe in order to walk properly. However, according to Berry, this was not entirely true. In actuality, bruised nerves near the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joint</b> occasionally caused misalignment in his back, which in turn affected his legs and caused one to become slightly shorter; it was not a permanent condition. To alleviate this, he wore a back brace for 13 years in the NFL.

2500|$|Seemingly free {{of injury}} {{for the first}} time in years, Graf began the year by winning the Australian Open, where she {{defeated}} Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final with the loss of only two games. Graf later stated it was the best tennis she had ever played in a Grand Slam final. She then won her next four tournaments in Tokyo, Indian Wells, Delray Beach and Miami respectively. In the Miami final, she lost her first set of the year—to Natasha Zvereva—after winning 54 consecutive sets. In the Hamburg final, she lost {{for the first time}} in 1994 after 36 consecutive match victories, losing to Sánchez Vicario in three sets. She then won her eighth German Open, but there were signs that her form was worsening as she almost lost to Julie Halard in a quarterfinal.

This was followed by a first-round straight-sets loss at Wimbledon to Lori McNeil, her only loss at Wimbledon between 1991 and 1997 and her first loss in a first round Grand Slam tournament in ten years. Graf still managed to win San Diego the following month but aggravated a long-time back injury in beating Sánchez Vicario in the final. Graf developed a bone spur at the base of her spine due to a congenital condition of the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joint.</b> She began to wear a back brace and was unsure about playing the US Open but elected to play while receiving treatment and stretching for two hours before each match.

2500|$|In 1966 Gary Sobers' {{powerful}} West Indian team toured England and Snow was recalled {{after his}} 7/29 and 4/18 destroyed them before 10,000 people at Hove when Sussex beat the tourists by 9 wickets. He took 4/84 and 0/117 in the Third Test at Trent Bridge and 3/143 in the Fourth at Headingley but the West Indies won {{them both to}} go 3–0 up in the series and the formidable Brian Close was made captain for the final Test. Snow was initially dropped for [...] The Oval, but was recalled due to the injury to the recalled John Price, then considered the fastest bowler in England. It was the turning point of his career as England collapsed to 166 for 7, before Tom Graveney 165 and John Murray 112 consolidated, but it still left England a little short of a commanding score until Snow hit eight boundaries in his 59 not out and added 128 with fellow bowler Ken Higgs, who made 63. This was two runs short of the then Test record for the tenth wicket, and is still a Test record for the last wicket between England and the West Indies. It remains as the all-time Test match record partnership between batsmen 10 and 11. They retired to the pavilion for a beer afterwards, but had their pints hurriedly replaced by teacups for their newspaper picture by officials concerned {{with the image of}} the game. Snow's 59 not out was the first test 50 by an England number 11 batsman and remained a record until Jimmy Anderson made 81 against India in 2014. Snow (2/66 & 3/40) removed the West Indian openers Conrad Hunte and Easton McMorris for 12 runs in the second innings, Brian Close caught Sobers off him for a first ball duck and England won a stunning victory by an innings and 34 runs. Sobers explained that [...] "the ball from Snow bounced a bit but I suppose I was beaten by the speed more than anything. I didn't get hold of it properly, edged it into my body. It flew out to Brian and that was that". John Snow became a national hero and until 1973 was England's premier fast bowler and a regular player in the England Test team. This Test was the first of a run of 40 with only one defeat in 1966–71, of which Snow played 32. There was no tour in 1966–67 and in the summer of 1967 he took 13 wickets (30.00) against India and Pakistan, but missed the last two tests because of an inflammation of his <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Fully {{aware that}} they needed to win the last Test to retain the Ashes the Australian {{selectors}} axed Bill Lawry, the first Australian captain ever to be dropped mid-series. Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry {{at the end of the}} Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose we all have to get around to it some day". Although the appointment of the more aggressive Ian Chappell as captain (with Ian Redpath as his vice-captain) made sense, Lawry was still a redoubtable opening batsman who averaged 40.50 in the series and many thought that his services should have been retained. Instead the veteran Victorian opener Ken Eastwood was called up for his only Test after having made 177 against New South Wales. John Gleeson, Ashley Mallett and Ross Duncan were all dropped and replaced by debutant Tony Dell, a left-arm fast medium bowler, and the leg-spinners Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner. The selectors made another mistake in not recalling Garth McKenzie to partner his Western Australia team-mate Dennis Lillee after he had broken Geoff Boycott's arm on the same ground in a one-day match. McKenzie could have been a real handful for the England batsmen, and was only two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian Test record of 248 wickets (Benaud wrote 'Bring back McKenzie' in his newspaper column). This meant Australia's four man bowling attack had only 6 Test wickets to their name, the least since [...] in 1945–46 when seven players made their debut after the war. Boycott was, of course, unfit to play and Brian Luckhurst returned to open the innings, having missed the Sixth Test because of his bruised hands. John Snow had been suffering from an inflamed <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joint,</b> which required traction and complete rest, but he was declared fit in time for the Test. This was Australian umpire Lou Rowan's last Test as he retired at the end of the season and the Australian selectors Don Bradman retired after 35 years, out of which Australian had held the Ashes for all but 6 years.|$|E
2500|$|Snow {{started his}} First Class Cricket and Test Match {{career as a}} fast-medium seam bowler, {{but when he was}} not chosen for the 1965–66 Ashes tour of Australia he played club cricket in South Africa and re-modelled his bowling action. He had bowled {{slightly}} chest-on, which restricted his pace and ability to move the ball. His work resulted in a more classical sideways-on action. This new style pleased the purists who referred to his [...] "graceful, yet deadly, action", and [...] "beautifully easy and controlled bowling method, slanting the ball into the batsman but also cutting it sharply off the pitch". However, Snow usually bowled only fast-medium in run-of-the-mill county and tour games and saved his fast bowling for Test Matches and when the mood took him on the pacey wickets at Hove. The best example is the Australian Tour of 1970–71 when he took 31 wickets (22.83) in the six tests, but only 7 wickets (71.57) in the six other first-class matches on the tour. Even in Tests [...] "he varied his pace cleverly, rarely bowling flat-out for a whole over, but unleashing the odd very quick delivery. Just like Charlie Griffith in the West Indies side of the 1960s, Snow had the ability to drop the ball slightly short and get it to lift painfully into the batsmen's body". As a result, he struck several batsmen on the head, Greg Chappell at Hove in 1968 when he was playing for Somerset and the tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner in the Sydney Tests of 1970–71. Ian Chappell said that he always found something new in his bowling repertoire whenever he began a new series against him. Unlike Trueman and Statham, Snow had no regular new-ball partner, teaming up with David Brown, Jeff Jones, Alan Ward, Chris Old, Ken Shuttleworth, Peter Lever, Bob Willis, Geoff Arnold and others. Though his career overlapped that of Willis in 1971–76, injuries and selection problems prevented them from forming the impressive duo that they might have been. In 1967 he jarred his back while bowling against India at [...] X-rays found that he had a <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joint</b> abnormality which had become inflamed and that the only cure was traction and complete rest. As a result, Snow became very insistent that he not be overbowled and was frequently accused of [...] "not trying" [...] when he was too ill to field properly. Once Ted Dexter made him bowl throughout a session for Sussex and he took a week to recover. When not bowling Snow often lounged around the outfield – ignoring the game if he felt it wasn't going anywhere – but had a fine throwing arm when he wanted to use it.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} interleukin 6 (IL- 6) in the pathogenesis of bilateral erosive sacroiliitis in human tumour necrosis factor transgenic (hTNFtg) mice, an animal model of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods Histological sections of the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> from hTNFtg and IL- 6 −/−hTNFtg mice were evaluated, and wild type and IL- 6 −/−mice served as controls. mRNA levels of infl ammation and tissue degradation related genes isolated from <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> were also evaluated by quantitative PCR. Results Severe, erosive bilateral sacroiliitis in 14 -week-old hTNFtg animals was accompanied by an upregulation of mRNAs related to tissue infl ammation such as matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP 3), MMP 9 and MMP 13 or osteoclast activation such as cathepsin K and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. In addition, IL- 6 was increased in the sera and in the <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> of hTNFtg animals. However, high expression of these marker genes in <b>sacroiliac</b> <b>joints</b> from IL- 6 −/−hTNFtg mice was also found. Moreover, absence of IL- 6 in these animals did not alter bilateral, erosive sacroiliitis when compared to hTNFtg littermates. Conclusions IL- 6 is not a crucial regulator in an animal model of TNF-mediated bilateral, erosive sacroiliitis. This fi nding questions the potential of IL- 6 blockade as a new treatment in patients with AS...|$|R
