5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1988, the band started rehearsing material for a new album with producer André Jacquemin, who had worked on all the Monty Python’s records. The album Take a Bite was published by GWR in October 1988 and follows in the steps of Nightmare at Maple Cross, presenting powerful and melodic metal songs, tinged with the humour typical of the band. To promote the album, Girlschool did a UK tour with Gary Glitter, followed by a North American tour. In 1989, they travelled across Europe with Dio and to the Soviet Union with Black Sabbath, {{till the end of}} the year. After their return from Russia, GWR did not renew their contract and the band practically broke up. Musical tastes were changing worldwide in favour of grunge and more extreme metal genres, compelling most acts originated from the new wave of British heavy metal to disband or to reduce their activities, and the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> to Girlschool.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's New Road ground in Worcester, but no play was possible due to bad weather, and so the match {{was moved to the}} following day. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to be playing. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's West Indian bowler, Vanburn Holder, bowled the first over. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl one extra due to a no ball—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete {{at the end of the}} over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod were the batsmen. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.|$|E
25|$|In Finland {{the first}} season was {{originally}} aired by the commercial MTV (Mainostelevisio) channel in 1976, but it was withdrawn after couple of episodes on demand of the national programme board as the show was considered too brutal and horrifying.

Mark recognises that these are symptoms, not of satanic assassination of some sort, but of thallium poisoning.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} {{designed}} in Gothic revival style and was fire resistant, being constructed of masonry. The third {{story of the}} design was not built to save money. It had an iron fire-door separating the library from the main entrance section. This saved the library from the fire of 1907 which destroyed {{the rest of the}} timber parliament buildings. Coincidentally, exactly the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> in Ottawa in 1916—with fire doors saving the Library when the Centre Block of the Canadian Parliament burned.|$|E

In the high jump, Didrikson and Jean Shiley tied for first, both setting a new American record. Osburn set an American record in the discus throw, winning from Jenkins and the eventual Olympic champion, Copeland; Didrikson, who was relatively unfamiliar with this event, placed fourth. Nan Gindele had set a world record in the javelin four weeks before the Trials, but failed to replicate that form at the Trials; Didrikson won with a personal best.|$|E
25|$|With frame {{buildings}} and wood-burning fireplaces and stoves, fire {{was always a}} risk in the city. Chimney fires were frequent. On March 18, 1741, the governor's house in Fort George caught on fire, and soon the church connected to his house was ablaze too. People tried to save it, but the fire soon grew beyond control. The fire threatened to spread to another building, where all the city documents were kept. The governor ordered the windows smashed and documents thrown out to save them. Later the practice was {{to keep them in}} the City Hall. A week later another fire broke out, but was put out quickly. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> the next week at a warehouse. Three days later a fire broke out in a cow stable. On the next day a person walking past a wealthy neighborhood saw coals by the hay in a stable and put them out, saving the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Wrestling in Florida again, Brisco {{teamed with}} his brother to win several more championships. In 1977, they {{defeated}} Bob Orton, Jr. and Bob Roop for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Ox Baker and Superstar Billy Graham and soon regained it in a rematch. On January 25, 1978, they won the belts again by defeating Ivan Koloff and Mr. Saito. While holding these belts, they also won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship on February 21, from Mike Graham and Steve Keirn. They dropped the United States tag belts back to Graham and Keirn but soon regained them. They were defeated for the United States title by Killer Karl Kox and Bobby Duncum, and were again successful in regaining it in a rematch. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> when the Briscos faced Mr. Saito and Mr. Sato that year: they lost the belts and quickly won them back. The Briscos also defeated Saito and Sato to regain the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. The following year, another victory over Saito and Sato earned the Briscos their final United States Tag Team Championship reign.|$|E

Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> to you, the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Christman {{was engaged}} in {{traveling}} around the world lecturing about Scientology and gave media interviews about the subject. In his 2008 book , author Andrew Morton thanked Christman in the acknowledgements section for advising him {{with regard to the}} jargon and complicated history of Scientology. In February 2008, Christman appeared on the National Public Radio program Morning Edition in a piece about the protest movement against Scientology called Project Chanology started by the Internet-based group Anonymous; she said she objected to any illegal methods used, but appreciated new activists taking part in criticizing Scientology. Along with Scientology critic Mark Bunker, she took part in the international protests against the organization in 2008 as part of Project Chanology. Christman maintains an account on YouTube with the identification [...] "ToryMagoo44", where she posts topically about Scientology. Her YouTube account was briefly shut down in April 2008 around the time period that the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> to Mark Bunker; soon afterwards an unidentified individual posted to alt.religion.scientology and boasted of [...] "silencing" [...] Christman. Christman resided in Los Angeles in 2009. The Sunday Times characterized Christman in a 2009 article as [...] "a fierce critic of the church".|$|E
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

A Rolling Stones critic commented Beyoncé was looking {{stunning}} in a bridal suite, {{adding that the}} most disarming thing about the clip is that she sings directly to the camera. The review concludes that, [...] "the video hits all of its marks perfectly, conveying all of the nuances in the lyrics while providing a lovely, memorable visual." [...] The Washington Posts Sarah Anne Hughes wrote Beyoncé is [...] "extravagantly dressed" [...] in the video adding that the only downside {{is that there is}} no dance in the tradition of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008). Kara Warner of MTV News called [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had", [...] "as different as night and day" [...] adding that the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> with their music videos. Werner further praised Beyoncé [...] "gorgeous" [...] dress and added that it [...] "will likely land on a few style blogs soon, given its embroidered and jeweled details, not to mention the silk bows and ruching on the sides". A writer of The Huffington Post described the video as a transition to the one for [...] "Run the World". Cristina Everett of Daily News noted that the look of satisfaction and hapinness on her face make the video the best revenge for her ex-lover. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan noted that Beyoncé was looking [...] "makeup-commercial-flawless". He also wrote that if country singer Kellie Pickler remade the video shot-for-shot, it would never leave CMT rotation for it is [...] "a perfect CMT video".|$|E
500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were.

This time, however, the line was blocked by the carriages of the first train; No.2 hit these with some force, causing the carriages of the first train to drag their brakes and run away down the line, and causing the locomotive to drop back onto the rack rail and stop safely. The carriages from the first train rolled down the line to Clogwyn station, where they became derailed.|$|E

[...] By virtue of these improvements the company achieved the transfer of most of the cross-Severn mail routes from the rival New Passage. However, the passage remained dangerous.
