40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of longitudinal or cross sectional brain imaging data to identify effects of neurodegenerative diseases {{is a fundamental}} task in various studies in neuro-science. However, when there are <b>systematic</b> <b>variations</b> in the images due to parameter changes such as changes in the scanner protocol, hardware changes, or when combining data from multi-site studies, the statistical analysis becomes problematic. Motivated by this scenario, {{the goal of this}} pa-per is to develop a unified statistical {{solution to the problem of}} <b>systematic</b> <b>variations</b> in statistical image analysis. Based in part on recent literature in harmonic analysis on diffu-sion maps, we propose an algorithm which compares oper-ators that are resilient to the <b>systematic</b> <b>variations.</b> These operators are derived from the empirical measurements of the image data and provide an efficient surrogate to captur-ing the actual changes across images. We also establish a connection between our method to the design of wavelets in non-Euclidean space. To evaluate the proposed ideas, we present various experimental results on detecting changes in simulations as well as show how the method offers im-proved statistical power in the {{analysis of}} real longitudinal PIB-PET imaging data acquired from participants at risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 1...|$|R

5000|$|Each {{of these}} three {{analyses}} has its strengths and weaknesses, and which analysis is preferred varies {{based in part on}} the theoretical framework adopted. The traditional ellipsis analysis has an advantage insofar as it is the most straightforward; a simple ellipsis mechanism is involved, which explains the fact that ellipsis in such cases is (usually) optional. The ellipsis analysis cannot, however, so easily account for the <b>systematic</b> <b>variation</b> in forms seen with possessives, since it suggests {{that there should be no}} such variation. The covert pronoun analysis can easily accommodate the fact that N-ellipsis has a distribution that is close to that of the indefinite pronoun one, but it too has difficulty with the <b>systematic</b> <b>variation</b> in forms seen with possessives. Both analyses are challenged by the fact that they cannot explain why N-ellipsis is limited in occurrence in English to a relatively small number of pre-nominal elements. Both are also challenged by the observation that the null element must be [...] "introduced".|$|E
50|$|After timing {{the radio}} pulses for some time, Hulse and Taylor {{noticed that there}} was a <b>systematic</b> <b>variation</b> in the arrival time of the pulses. Sometimes, the pulses were {{received}} a little sooner than expected; sometimes, later than expected. These variations changed in a smooth and repetitive manner, with a period of 7.75 hours. They realized that such behavior is predicted if the pulsar were in a binary orbit with another star, later confirmed to be another neutron star. Pulses from the companion neutron star have not been detected, but this might only be the result of an unfavorable viewing angle.|$|E
5000|$|The third analysis, {{the overt}} pronoun analysis, {{accommodates}} the <b>systematic</b> <b>variation</b> in possessive forms, since {{it assumes that}} the distinct pronoun forms appear precisely in order to indicate when a pronoun is present. The overt pronoun analysis can also account for the {{relatively small number of}} pre-nominal elements that can [...] "introduce" [...] ellipsis, since it reduces this ability down to a simple lexical characteristic of the pre-nominal elements involved. Furthermore, it quite obviously accounts {{for the fact that the}} [...] "ellipsis" [...] must be introduced, for there is in fact no ellipsis, but rather a pronoun appears.|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates airline {{customer}} loyalty and estimates the switching costs for a domestic airline route in Brazil through a stated preference survey. Several structures of discrete choice models were tested {{to represent the}} choice of behavior: multinomial logit, mixed logit random coefficients, multinomial logit incorporating <b>systematic</b> <b>variations</b> of preferences, mixed logit error component and mixed logit error component incorporating <b>systematic</b> <b>variations</b> of preferences. The results showed that loyal passengers {{are more likely to}} choose the dominant Brazilian airline Tam. The switching costs of passengers loyal to Tam, for this sample, are equivalent to 15 % of the fare, which represents much more than the percentage for other companies. These passengers are less sensitive to variations in the fares and incur higher costs not to switch airlines...|$|R

50|$|In {{the latter}} case (modeling <b>systematic</b> <b>variation),</b> RMM models are {{estimated}} assuming that variation in the linear predictor (generated via variation in the regressor-variables) contribute to the overall variation of the modeled response variable (Y). This case is addressed and demonstrated in Shore (2005a, 2012 and relevant references therein). Estimation is conducted in two stages. First the median is estimated by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations (of fitted model from sample data points). In the second stage, the remaining two parameters (not estimated in the first stage, namely, {c,d}), are estimated. Three estimation approaches are presented in Shore (2012): maximum likelihood, moment matching and nonlinear quantile regression.|$|E

40|$|Leakage {{power is}} one of the most {{critical}} issues for ultra-deep submicron technology. Subthreshold leakage depends exponentially on linewidth, and consequently variation in linewidth translates to a large leakage variation. A significant fraction of variation in linewidth occurs due to <b>systematic</b> <b>variations</b> involving focus and pitch. In this paper we propose a new leakage estimation methodology that accounts for focus-dependent variation in linewidth. The ideas presented in this paper significantly improve leakage estimation and can be used in existing leakage reduction techniques to improve their efficacy. We modify the previously proposed gate length biasing technique of [9] to consider <b>systematic</b> <b>variations</b> in linewidth and further reduce leakage power. Our method reduces the leakage spread between worst and best process corners by up to 62 %. Defocus awareness improves leakage reduction from gate length biasing by up to 7 %...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>variation</b> {{is brought}} about by changes in the linguistic, psychological, and social context. Linguistic factors are usually {{extremely}} local. For example, in earlier stages of acquisition, a learner will often display systematic constraints {{on their ability to}} use the correct tense. They may say [...] "Last year we travel to the ocean" [...] rather than [...] "Last year we travelled to the ocean." [...] They also tend to make more mistakes when the word following a tensed word begins with a consonant (i.e., burned bacon). But they will show higher accuracy when the word following the tensed word begins with a nonconsonant (i.e., burned eggs).|$|E
50|$|Shore (2003a) {{developed}} Inverse Normalizing Transformations (INTs) in {{the first}} years of the 21st century and has applied them to various engineering disciplines like statistical process control (Shore, 2000a, b, 2001a, b, 2002a) and chemical engineering (Shore at al., 2002). Subsequently, as the new Response Modeling Methodology (RMM) had been emerging and developing into a full-fledged platform for modeling monotone convex relationships (ultimately presented in a book, Shore, 2005a), RMM properties were explored (Shore, 2002b, 2004a, b, 2008a, 2011), estimation procedures developed (Shore, 2005a, b, 2012) and the new modeling methodology compared to other approaches, for modeling random variation (Shore 2005c, 2007, 2010; Shore and A’wad 2010), and for modeling <b>systematic</b> <b>variation</b> (Shore, 2008b).|$|E

40|$|The {{motion of}} the giant planets from Jupiter to Neptune is chaotic with Lyapunov time of {{approximately}} 10 Myr. A recent theory explains {{the presence of this}} chaos with three-planet mean-motion resonances, i. e. resonances among the orbital periods of at least three planets. We find that the distribution of these resonances with respect to the semi-major axes of all the planets is compatible with orbital instability. In particular, they overlap in a region of 10 ^{- 3 } AU with respect to the variation of the semi-major axes of Uranus and Neptune. Fictitious planetary systems with initial conditions in this region can undergo <b>systematic</b> <b>variations</b> of semi-major axes.
