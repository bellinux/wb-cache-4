Subsequently, his group discovered <b>squalamine</b> to be a potent antiangiogenic compound with activity against solid tumors.

5000|$|<b>Squalamine</b> was {{initially}} discovered {{on the basis}} of its anti-bacterial activity. It has proven to be a broad spectrum antimicrobial compound that exhibits potent activity in vitro and in vivo against gram negative and gram positive bacteria,fungi, protozoa, and many viruses. [...] Subsequent studies in vitro and in animals demonstrated various unanticipated pharmacological properties. In several vertebrate models, <b>squalamine</b> exhibits systemic anti-angiogenic activity against rapidly proliferating blood vessels that arise in pathological settings. As a consequence it is being evaluated in several human clinical trials for cancer, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Ohr Pharmaceuticals is currently evaluating <b>squalamine</b> in a Phase III study for angiopathic retinopathy applied topically to the eye. In mammals, systemically administered <b>squalamine</b> is cleared by the liver, and transported via the biliary system into the feces. <b>Squalamine</b> has been evaluated in trials for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (stage I/IIA), ovarian cancer (stage IV), and prostate cancer as well as several phase I pharmacokinetic studies. [...] In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration granted <b>squalamine</b> Fast Track status for approval for treatment of age-related macular degeneration.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Squalamine</b> is an amphipathic {{zwitterionic}} molecule. At physiological pH it {{is positively}} charged. Because of the stereochemistry of its steroid framework, it assumes a flat, plate-like structure. As {{a consequence of}} these physical properties, <b>squalamine</b> binds electrostatically to membranes made of negatively charged phospholipids(PLs). The orientation of the polar substituents on <b>squalamine</b> causes it {{to sit on the}} surface of the membrane to which it binds, rather than penetrate the surface. Bacteria, unlike most eukaryotic cells, display negatively charged PLs on the membrane surfaces that are exposed to the environment. <b>Squalamine,</b> like many of the cationic antimicrobial peptides and proteins that have been discovered to date, interacts with the plasma membranes of bacteria and disturb function; precisely how squalamine's membrane attack kills its microbial targets remains unknown. Eukaryotic cells position negatively charged PLs on the inner leaflet (the cytoplasmic face)of the plasma membrane;the outer leaflet, the surface exposed to the outside world, is populated principally by zwitterionic PLs, such as phosphatidyl choline. Why such asymmetry in the anionic phospholipid composition of the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane exists is not known. <b>Squalamine</b> does not normally interact with the plasma membranes of normal eukaryotic cells because of the absence of negatively charged PLs on their surface. However, certain cells possess specific [...] "transporters" [...] that provide <b>squalamine</b> with an access through the membrane. Liver, capillary, and certain hematopoetic cells possess these transporters and define the pharmacology of the compound, restricting its bio-distribution to a limited numbers of tissues and organs in an animal. Once <b>squalamine</b> has traversed the plasma membrane, it binds electrostatically to the negatively charged cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, effectively neutralizing the negative surface potential. As a consequence, proteins that are bound to that surface through electrostatic interactions are displaced. The cellular consequences of this [...] "displacement" [...] will vary depending upon the specific cellular context. Since proteins such as the Rho GTPases, which play a role in actin dynamics and cellular movement, are linked to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, <b>squalamine</b> disrupts several Rac1-actin-dependent processes, such as growth factor dependent endothelial migration and angiogenesis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Squalamine</b> ( [...] ) is an aminosterol {{compound}} with potent {{broad spectrum}} antimicrobial activity {{discovered in the}} tissues of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) by {{a team led by}} Michael Zasloff. [...] Zasloff searched the tissues of the dogfish for compounds that might help explain the hardiness of this animal to infection, despite its [...] "primitive" [...] immune system. Using techniques that Zasloff's team had developed to isolate and identify antimicrobial peptides from animal tissues, the team extracted and characterized a novel bile acid-like compound containing a polyamine never before seen in nature. The compound was called [...] "squalamine", based on its source (Squalus acanthias) and its chemical structure (a sterol linked to a polyamine). Further analyses of larger quantities of dogfish liver extracts revealed <b>squalamine</b> to be the most abundant member of a larger aminosterol family comprising at least 12 related compounds. One of these, [...] "MSI-1436" [...] or trodusquemine, although structurally similar to <b>squalamine</b> (it carries a spermine rather than a spermidine) and also quite potent as an anti-infective, exhibits a profoundly different pharmacology in vertebrates, causing weight loss and adipose tissue mobilization.|$|E

5000|$|A {{symptomatic}} {{patient will}} present an unusual amount of itching and alopecia. [...] Primary treatment involves griseofulvin, an antimycotic agent. For patients who don't respond to Griseofulvin, other drugs, Itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine {{can be used}} as a replacement to or in conjunction with griseofulvin. These drugs are preferred over griseofulvin as they have a shorter duration for treatment. [...] However, these agents have drug-drug interactions and over a prolonged period of time can cause liver damage. [...] Currently, <b>squalamine,</b> an aminosterol with fungicidal properties is being researched as its mechanism of action is different from that of the aforementioned medicines, making it a good drug for those who don't respond well to Itraconazole, fluconazole or terbinafine. Systemic treatment with oral medication and anti-fungal shampoos has also been effective. [...] Antifungal shampoos (Ketoconazole 2% shampoo or selenium sulfide 2.5% [...] ) are effective as they reduce the transmission of the diseased hair by preventing its shedding. [...] Other treatments include, epilation of the infected follicles, topical ointments and steroidal treatments. Topical ointments immobilize the fungus and reduce shedding but they do not penetrate the hair follicle and hence must be used in conjunction with other treatment methods.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} the shark {{antimicrobial}} aminosterol <b>squalamine</b> to induce the leakage of polar fluorescent dyes from large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (LUVs) has been measured. Micromolar <b>squalamine</b> causes leakage of carboxyfluorescein (CF) from vesicles prepared from the anionic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylserine (PS), and cardiolipin. Binding analyses based on the leakage data show that <b>squalamine</b> has its highest affinity to phosphatidylglycerol membranes, followed by phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin membranes. <b>Squalamine</b> will also induce the leakage of CF from phosphatidylcholine (PC) LUVs at low phospholipid concentrations. At high phospholipid concentrations, the leakage of CF from PC LUVs deviates from a simple dose–response relationship, {{and it appears that}} some of the <b>squalamine</b> can no longer cause leakage. Fluorescent dye leakage generated by <b>squalamine</b> is graded, suggesting the formation of a discrete membrane pore rather than a generalized disruption of vesicular membranes. By using fluorescently labeled dextrans of different molecular weight, material with molecular weight ≤ 4000 g/mol is released from vesicles by <b>squalamine,</b> but material with molecular weight ≥ 10, 000 is retained. Negative stain electron microscopy of squalamine-treated LUVs shows that <b>squalamine</b> decreases the average vesicular size in a concentration-dependent manner. <b>Squalamine</b> decreases the size of vesicles containing anionic phospholipid at a lower squalamine/lipid molar ratio than pure PC LUVs. In a centrifugation assay, <b>squalamine</b> solubilizes phospholipid, but only at significantly higher squalamine/phospholipid ratios than required for either dye leakage or vesicle size reduction. <b>Squalamine</b> solubilizes PC at lower squalamine/phospholipid ratios than PG. We suggest that <b>squalamine</b> complexes with phospholipid to form a discrete structure within the bilayers of LUVs, resulting in the transient leakage of small encapsulated molecules. At higher squalamine/phospholipid ratios, these structures release from the bilayers and aggregate to form either new vesicles or squalamine/phospholipid mixed micelles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSqualamine, an aminosterol {{antibiotic}} {{isolated from}} the dogfish shark, creates relatively large defects in phospholipid bilayers, allowing the unrestricted translocation of small molecules across these compromised membranes (B. S. Selinsky, Z. Zhou, K. G. Fotjik, S. R. Jones, N. R. Dollahon, A. E. Shinnar, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1370 (1998) 218 – 234). However, an aminosterol structurally similar to <b>squalamine</b> was found {{to act as a}} proton ionophore in anionic phospholipid vesicles. In contrast with <b>squalamine,</b> gross membrane disruption was not observed with this synthetic analog (G. Deng, T. Dewa, S. L. Regen, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118 (1996) 8975 – 8976). In this report, the ionophoric activity of <b>squalamine</b> was tested in anionic and zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles. No ionophoric activity was observed for <b>squalamine</b> in vesicles comprised of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), or a mixture of the two lipids. Experiments using radiolabeled <b>squalamine</b> indicated that all of the <b>squalamine</b> added to PG vesicles remained with the vesicles, while approximately one-half of the <b>squalamine</b> added to PC vesicles was incorporated. We have synthesized the aminosterol analog of <b>squalamine</b> possessing ionophoric activity, and its ionophoric activity in PG vesicles was confirmed. The synthetic compound possessed no measurable lytic activity when added to preformed phospholipid vesicles. As both compounds possess significant antimicrobial activity, these results suggest that either multiple mechanisms for the antimicrobial activity of aminosterols exist, depending upon the aminosterol structure, or possibly an unrelated common mechanism for antimicrobial activity remains to be discovered...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of alpha-synuclein {{is closely}} associated with Parkinson's disease and related syndromes. We show that <b>squalamine,</b> a natural product with known anticancer and antiviral activity, dramatically affects alpha-synuclein aggregation in vitro and in vivo. We elucidate the mechanism of action of <b>squalamine</b> by investigating its interaction with lipid vesicles, which are known to stimulate nucleation, and find that this compound displaces alpha-synuclein from the surfaces of such vesicles, thereby blocking the first steps in its aggregation process. We also show that <b>squalamine</b> almost completely suppresses the toxicity of alpha-synuclein oligomers in human neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting their interactions with lipid membranes. We further {{examine the effects of}} <b>squalamine</b> in a Caenorhabditis elegans strain overexpressing alpha-synuclein, observing a dramatic reduction of alpha-synuclein aggregation and an almost complete elimination of muscle paralysis. These findings suggest that <b>squalamine</b> could be a means of therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease and related conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features {{that were designed}} to mimic those of <b>squalamine,</b> an antibiotic isolated from the stomach of the dogfish shark. The mimics, like <b>squalamine,</b> are sterol-polyamine conjugates. Unlike <b>squalamine,</b> the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. Several <b>squalamine</b> mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and fungi. Some {{had little or no}} hemolytic activity. The hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. One of the <b>squalamine</b> mimics, SM- 7, was bactericidal against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and S. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. Subinhibitory concentrations of SM- 7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. These results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. <b>Squalamine</b> mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. The <b>squalamine</b> mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as topical antimicrobial agents...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several methanogenic archaea {{have been}} {{detected}} in the human intestinal microbiota. These intestinal archaea may contaminate medical devices such as colonoscopes. However, no biocide activity has been reported among these human-associated archaea. Methodology: The minimal archaeacidal concentration (MAC) of peracetic acid, chlorhexidine, <b>squalamine</b> and twelve parent synthetic derivatives reported {{in this study was}} determined against five human-associated methanogenic archaea including Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and two environmental methanogens Methanobacterium beijingense and Methanosaeta concilii by using a serial dilution technique in Hungates tubes. Principal Findings: MAC of <b>squalamine</b> derivative S 1 was 0. 05 mg/L against M. smithii strains, M. oralis, M. arboriphilicus, M. concilii and M. beijingense whereas MAC of <b>squalamine</b> and derivatives S 2 –S 12 varied from 0. 5 to 5 mg/L.

ObjectiveWe investigated the potential use of <b>squalamine,</b> a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound, as a nebulizer disinfectant. MethodsPari LC nebulizers were artificially contaminated with a suspension of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 108 CFU/mL) and fungi (Candidida albicans and Aspergilus niger; 107 CFU/mL) and then disinfected by immersion in <b>squalamine</b> solution for 20 min. Glutaraldehyde and Korsolex peracetic acid were used as disinfectant controls. ResultWe found that 0. 5 g/L <b>squalamine</b> reduced the levels of viable S. aureus and P. aeruginosa by 5 log 10 and the level of viable C. albicans by 4 log 10 after 20 min. A concentration of 2 g/L was needed to reduce the level of A. niger cells by 4 log 10 in 6 hours. Finally, a formulation of <b>squalamine</b> {{in the form of a}} soluble disinfecting tablet containing 2. 5 % (w/w) <b>squalamine</b> was developed and successfully applied for nebulizer disinfection.

40|$|International audienceAntimicrobial {{resistance}} is an increasingly life-threatening problem {{that emphasizes the}} need to develop new antibacterial agents. The in vitro antibacterial activity of <b>squalamine,</b> a natural aminosterol, has been previously demonstrated against multidrug-resistant bacteria and moulds. Although the antibacterial activity of <b>squalamine</b> was found to correlate with that of other drugs, such as colistin, against Gram-negative bacteria, the former was active against Gram-positive bacteria, which are resistant to colistin. In this work, we provide new insights into squalamine's antibacterial mechanism of action compared with other known antibiotics. We evaluated squalamine's antibacterial mechanism of action using the broth microdilution method for MIC determination and time-kill assays, transmission electron microscopy for morphological change studies, bioluminescence for ATP release measurements and fluorescence methods for membrane depolarization assays. Concerning Gram-negative bacteria, <b>squalamine,</b> similar to colistin, required interaction with the negatively charged phosphate groups in the bacterial outer membrane as {{the first step in a}} sequence of different events ultimately leading to the disruption of the membrane.

Objectives This phase II randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial aimed at testing the efficacy and safety of a three-week <b>squalamine</b> ointment regimen {{for the treatment of}} tinea capitis. Patients Males aged 6 – 15 years presenting with tinea capitis were treated with either topical squal-amine ointment or placebo for 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was complete clinical cure. The secondary endpoints were the occurrence of local and/or sys-temic adverse events, mycological cure, and partial clinical response. Prospective follow-up of clinical adverse events was performed daily. Results Five patients were treated with 1 % squal-amine ointment and 15 with placebo. No complete cure was observed. No clinical or biological adverse event was recorded. A significantly (p = 0. 03) better hair-growth score, indicating a partial clinical improvement of the tinea capitis lesion, was observed in the patients treated with <b>squalamine</b> compared to those treated with placebo.

We aimed to test whether <b>squalamine</b> and a synthetic aminosterol derivative (ASD) display any in vitro activity comparable to currently available systemic antifungals, an acceptable safety index, as well as to provide insights into their mechanism of action. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of <b>squalamine,</b> ASD and available antifungals were determined against 21 yeast isolates that were recovered from cases of fungemia. Remarkably, homogeneous MICs ranging from 8 - 16 mg/L and from 1 - 2 mg/L were noted for <b>squalamine</b> and ASD, respectively, as opposes the heterogenous in vitro activity of available systemic antifungals. Aminosterols induced haemolysis, a surrogate for toxic effects to mammalian cells, at concentrations high above their MICs. In time-kill studies, killing was as fast with ASD as with amphotericin B. Both aminosterols induced a time-dependent disruption of yeast membrane, as evidenced by gradual increase of ATP efflux.

The treatment of cancer may benefit from the introduction of novel therapies derived from natural products. Natural products have served to provide a basis for many of the pharmaceutical agents in current use in cancer therapy. Emerging research indicates that progressive growth and spread of many solid tumors depends, in part, on the formation of an adequate blood supply, and this process of tumorassociated angiogenesis is reported to have prognostic significance in several human cancers.

Results: We evaluated <b>squalamine</b> and chlorhexidine to decontaminate sputum specimens for the culture of mycobacteria. Eight sputum specimens were artificially infected with 105 colony-forming units (cfu) /mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans as contaminants. In the second step, we tested chlorhexidine-based decontamination on 191 clinical specimens, (Chlorhexidine, 0. 1, 0. 5 and 0. 7 %). In a last step, growth of contaminants and mycobacteria was measured in 75 consecutive sputum specimens using the routine NALC-NaOH decontamination protocol or with 0. 7 % chlorhexidine decontamination and an inoculation on Coletsos medium. In the artificially model, contaminants grew in 100 % of the artificially infected sputum specimens decontaminated using 100 mg/mL <b>squalamine,</b> in 62. 5 % of specimens decontaminated using N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine-Sodium Hydroxide (NALC-NaOH), and in 0 % of specimens decontaminated using 0. 1 %, 0. 35 %, or 1 % chlorhexidine (P 1. 4. 10 (2) cfu M. tuberculosis when any concentration of chlorhexidine was used (P < 0. 05). In the second step we found that 0. 7 %-chlorhexidine yielded 0 % contamination rate, 3. 2 % for 0. 5 %-chlorhexidine and 28. 3 % for 0. 1 %-chlorhexidine. As for the 75 specimens treated in parallel by both methods we found that when using the standard NALC-NaOH decontamination method, 8 / 75 (10. 7 %) specimens yielded M. tuberculosis colonies with a time to detection of 17. 5 +/- 3 days and an 8 % contamination rate. Additionally, 14 specimens yielded mycobacteria colonies (12 M. tuberculosis, and 2 Mycobacterium bolletii) (18. 7 %) (P = 0. 25), which has yielded a 100 % sensitivity for the chlorhexidine protocol.

Alkaloids are a large and structurally diverse group of compounds, which have served as scaffolds for important antibacterial drugs like metronidazole and the quinolones. In this review we highlight other alkaloids with development potential. Natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic alkaloids of all classes are considered, looking first at those with direct antibacterial activity and those with antibiotic-enhancing activity. Potent examples include CJ- 13, 136, a novel actinomycete-derived quinolone alkaloid with MICs of 0. 1 ng/mL against Helicobacter pylori, and <b>squalamine,</b> a polyamine alkaloid from the dogfish shark which renders Gram-negative pathogens 16 to > 32 -fold more susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Where available, information on toxicity, structure-activity relationships, mechanisms of action, and in vivo activity is presented. The effects of alkaloids on virulence gene regulatory systems such as quorum sensing, and virulence factors like sortases, adhesins, and secretion systems are also described. The synthetic isoquinoline alkaloid virstatin, for example, inhibits the transcriptional regulator ToxT in Vibrio cholerae, preventing expression of cholera toxin and fimbriae, and conferring in vivo protection against intestinal colonization. The review concludes with implications and limitations of the described research, and directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Methanogenic archaea are {{constant}} {{members of}} the human oral and digestive microbiota retrieved, in particular, from periodontitis lesions. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Methods: Using the macrodilution method in Hungate tubes with optical microscope observation combined with monitoring methane production, we determined the antibiotic resistance characteristics of eight methanogenic archaea. Results: Methanobrevibacter smithii strains were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, ofloxacin, tetracycline and amphotericin B, with MICs >= 100 mg/L; these strains were also highly resistant to vancomycin (MIC >= 50 mg/L). They were moderately resistant to chloramphenicol (MIC <= 25 mg/L), and were susceptible to bacitracin (MIC <= 4 mg/L), metronidazole, ornidazole and <b>squalamine</b> (MIC <= 1 mg/L). The susceptibility of Methanosphaera stadtmanae was the same as M. smithii, except for chloramphenicol (MIC <= 4 mg/L), and Methanobrevibacter oralis yielded the same data as M. smithii, except for bacitracin (MIC <= 25 mg/L). The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of 'Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis', which was recently isolated from human faeces, was identical to that of M. smithii. Conclusions: Human methanogenic archaea are highly resistant to antibiotics, being susceptible only to molecules that are also effective against both bacteria and eukarya. Methanogenic archaea are good candidates to test for antimicrobial activity against members of this unique domain of life. Further studies to develop new molecules specifically targeting archaea as potential causes of infection are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{formation}} by endochondral ossification {{is traditionally}} {{viewed as a}} process in which only cells of the osteo and chondral lineages are involved. New {{studies have shown that the}} vasculature, which is critical to the growth and survival of all organ systems, and provides critical developmental signals for cartilage and bone tissue. ^ The skeletogenic mesenchyme undergoes various states of vascularization during development from mesenchyme to long bone. In the embryonic chick limb, uncommitted, vascularized mesenchyme becomes avascular through active vascular regression, leaving a prechondrogenic mesenchymal field. This avascular mesenchyme condenses and commits to the chondrogenic lineage. We found that inhibition of the vascular regression process inhibits condensation of precartilaginous mesenchyme, indicating a requirement of avascularity for cartilage differentiation. ^ This avascular state, characteristic of cartilage, is reversed during the process of endochondral ossification within the long bone. Blood vessels bring necessary signals and cells for proper terminal differentiation of chondrocytes and bone formation. We perturbed the vascular system of the elongating humerus with the antiangiogenic compound <b>squalamine</b> and found that proper vascularization is required for ossification. Surprisingly, we also uncovered a need for blood vessels in stimulating earlier stages of chondrocyte maturation, despite the cartilage remaining avascular. ^ Our findings highlight the complex communication between vastly different tissues in the skeletal and circulatory systems. Our studies will stimulate more research into this new form of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction, which we believe will prove increasingly important in developmental biology. ...|$|E
40|$|M Vaughn Emerson, Andreas K LauerCasey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USAAbstract: Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the leading}} cause of vision loss in the industrialized world. In the last few decades, the mainstay of treatment for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD has been thermal laser photocoagulation. In the last decade, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin extended treatment for more patients. While both of these treatments have prevented further vision loss in a subset of patients, improvement in visual acuity is rare. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of AMD-related CNV. Pegaptanib, an anti-VEGF aptamer prevents vision loss in CNV, although the performance is similar to that of photodynamic therapy. Ranibizumab, an antibody fragment and bevacizumab, a full-length humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF have both shown promising results with improvements in visual acuity with either agent. VEGF trap, a modified soluble VEGF receptor analogue, binds VEGF more tightly than all other anti-VEGF agents and has also shown promising results in early trials. Other treatment strategies to decrease the effect of VEGF have used small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) to inhibit VEGF production and VEGF receptor production. Steroids, including anecortave acetate in the treatment and prevention of CNV, have shown promise in controlled trials. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as vatalanib, inhibit downstream effects of VEGF, and have been effective in the treatment of CNV in early studies. <b>Squalamine</b> lactate inhibits plasma membrane ion channels with downstream effects on VEGF, and has shown promising results with systemic administration. Other growth factors, including pigment epithelium-derived growth factor that has been administered via an adenoviral vector has shown promising initial results. In some patients ciliary neurotrophic factor is currently being studied for the inhibition of progression of geographic atrophy. Combination therapy has been investigated, and may prove to be more effective in the management of AMD-associated CNV. Ongoing and future studies will be crucial for optimizing the treatment of patients with AMD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Until recently, {{only two}} options were {{available}} {{for the treatment of}} choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) associated with age related macular degeneration (AMD) -thermal laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V). However, new treatments for CNV are in development, and data from phase III clinical trials of some of these pharmacological interventions are now available. In light of these new data, expert guidance is required to enable retina specialists with expertise in the management of AMD to select and use the most appropriate therapies for the treatment of neovascular AMD. METHODS: Consensus from a round table of European retina specialists was obtained based on best available scientific data. Data rated at evidence levels 1 and 2 were evaluated for laser photocoagulation, PDT-V, pegaptanib sodium, and ranibizumab. Other treatments discussed are anecortave acetate, triamcinolone acetonide, bevacizumab, rostaporfin (SnET 2), <b>squalamine,</b> and transpupillary thermotherapy. RESULTS: PDT-V is currently recommended for subfoveal lesions with predominantly classic CNV, or with occult with no classic CNV with evidence of recent disease progression and a lesion size <or= 4 Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) disc areas (DA). The new classes of anti-angiogenic agents-namely, pegaptanib sodium and ranibizumab (the latter when peer reviewed phase III data become available) are recommended for subfoveal lesions with any proportion of classic CNV or occult with no classic CNV. For juxtafoveal classic CNV, PDT-V or anti-angiogenic therapy should be considered if the new vessels are so close to the fovea that laser photocoagulation would almost certainly extend under the centre of the foveal avascular zone. For all other well demarcated juxtafoveal lesions and for extrafoveal classic lesions, laser photocoagulation remains the standard treatment. Therapy should be undertaken within 1 week of the fluorescein angiogram on which the clinical decision to treat is based. At each follow up, fluorescein angiography should be performed and best corrected visual acuity measured as a minimum requirement. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations provide evidence based guidance for the choice and use of non-surgical therapies for the management of neovascular AMD. Revisions of the recommendations may be required as new data become available...|$|E
