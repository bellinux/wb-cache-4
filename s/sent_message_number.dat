40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new distributed data object called Resource Controller which provides an abstraction {{for managing the}} consumption of a global resource in a distributed system. Examples of resources that may be managed by such an object include; <b>number</b> of <b>messages</b> <b>sent,</b> <b>number</b> of nodes participating in the protocol, and total CPU time consumed. The Resource Controller object is accessed through a procedure that can be invoked at any node in the network. Before consuming a unit of resource at some node, the controlled algorithm should invoke the procedure at this node, requesting a permit to consume {{a unit of the}} resource. The procedure returns either a permit or a rejection. The key characteristics of the Resource Controller object are the constraints that it imposes on the global resource consumption. An (M; W) -Controller guarantees that the total number of permits granted is at most M; it also ensures that if a request is rejected then at least M Γ W permits a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{features}} of messaging services {{do not yet}} have a good safety standards, because the implementation of the mobile operators as a service provider can still find the content of <b>messages</b> <b>sent</b> by the customer. Another problem arises from the human error is an error writing the <b>message</b> destination <b>number.</b> These things cause a lack of guarantee of the confidentiality of <b>messages</b> <b>sent.</b> To meet the confidentiality aspect of the <b>message</b> <b>sent</b> can be used steganography and encryption techniques. By utilizing these two techniques are expected to ensure the confidentiality of <b>messages</b> <b>sent.</b> The <b>message</b> will be <b>sent</b> via MMS. <b>Messages</b> <b>sent</b> can only be read by a recipient who has a right to know the contents of the message using a secret key. At this final project, implemented by the method of steganography algorithms Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion. LSB insertion technique is a technique by replacing the bits lower (least significant bits) of the container media. Container media used a jpg image file. Encrypted messages to be inserted first using RC 6 encryption algorithm. This application was built with J 2 ME programming language that can be embedded in mobile phones. Based on software testing performed can be seen that the software can be run well and these two techniques can be implemented properly to increase security on the delivery of messages via MMS...|$|R

In this paper a percolation driven probabilistic flooding algorithm is proposed, which provides large message delivery ratio with small <b>number</b> of <b>sent</b> <b>messages,</b> compared to traditional flooding. To control the <b>number</b> of <b>sent</b> <b>messages</b> the proposed algorithm uses locally available information only, thus induces negligible overhead on network traffic. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed and the theoretical results are verified through simulation examples...|$|R
