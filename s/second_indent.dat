2500|$|Note that, by the <b>second</b> <b>indent</b> of this Article, Argentina was {{supposed}} to receive territory on the right bank of the River Paraguay (i.e. in the Great Chaco) {{all the way up}} to Bahia Negra. [...] That is about 600km to the north of the present boundary at the Pilcomayo river. [...] For the reasons explained in the second section of this Article, from the moment the Treaty was signed Brazil set out to frustrate Argentina's claim to this territory, and succeeded.

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 9-10 mm. The forewings {{are dark}} fuscous with two rather oblique wedge-shaped whitish-ochreous spots from the costa posteriorly, reaching half across the wing. The hindwings are blackish-fuscous with cloudy light fuscous suffused transverse streaks before {{and beyond the}} middle, the <b>second</b> <b>indented</b> in the middle. There is a sharply-defined sub-metallic prismatic-fuscous streak from four-fifths of the costa to below the apex and continued along the termen to the middle.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings are dark purplish-bronzy-fuscous. The markings are whitish-ochreous. There are two transversely placed confluent {{spots in the}} disc near the base and a broad rather irregular transverse fasciae at one-third and beyond the middle, the posterior edge of the <b>second</b> <b>indented</b> by a dark spot representing the second discal stigma. A triangular spot is found on the costa at four-fifths, and cloudy dot on the termen opposite. The hindwings are grey, darker towards the apex.|$|R
5000|$|In Western {{literary}} traditions, use of line {{is arguably}} the principal feature which distinguishes poetry from prose. Even in poems where formal metre or rhyme is weakly observed or absent, the convention of line continues on the whole to be observed, at least in written representations, although there are exceptions (see Degrees of license). In such writing, simple visual appearance on a page (or any other written layout) remains sufficient to determine poetic line, and this sometimes leads to {{the suggestion that the}} work in question is no longer a poem but [...] "chopped up prose". A dropped line is a line broken into two parts, with the <b>second</b> <b>indented</b> to remain visually sequential.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIndentation {{testing is}} a common method to assess the {{mechanical}} properties of materials near their surface. The elasto-plastic properties may be determined from the force penetration curves measured in indentation using inverse methods. In this spirit, Dao et al. [1] (Acta Materialia, 49, 2001) have established a forward and a reverse analysis for engineering metals using the equivalent conical indenter of the Berkovich and the Vickers pyramids, which has an included angle θ of 70. 3 °. Extending Dao's approach, we studied, based on a finite element analysis on elasto-plastic materials, {{the influence of the}} included angle of conical indenters (θ= 70. 3, 60, 50 and 42. 3 °) and the friction coefficient on the force penetration curves. Based on this analysis, we suggest a more general method for determining the plastic properties of metals. The mechanical behaviour is modeled with the Young's modulus, E, the yield strength, σy, and the strain hardening exponent, n. We have shown that friction has a significant effect on the normal force measured on tips having included angles lower or equal to 50 °. We have constructed, for each indenter geometry, a dimensionless function relating the characteristic parameters of the loading curve in indentation to the elasto-plastic parameters of metals. These functions have been generalized for any included angle. We show that the use of a <b>second</b> <b>indenter</b> with an included angle lower than θ= 70. 3 ° allows us to determine the strain hardening exponent with greater accuracy. Moreover, the sharper the indenter, the better the accuracy...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is grand and has several rooms. The altar space {{is separated from}} the nave {{and there is no}} iconostasis. The altar contains two niches. The communion table is made in three pieces and stands in the centre of the altar. The floor of the altar is made of brick tiles. The church has a characteristic brick facade. Every <b>second</b> row is <b>indented</b> and covered with mortar. The single and double doors are made of oak wood and rotate around metal axles.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings are white, the dorsal three-fifths suffused pale brownish, on the posterior third darkened {{to form a}} quadrate fuscous blotch, a dark brown streak sprinkled blackish {{from the base of}} the costa to the anterior angle of this blotch. There is a very fine black dash representing the plical stigma and a short almost longitudinal fuscous line from beneath the costa at one-sixth. Suffused dark fuscous spots are found just beneath the costal edge before and beyond the middle, where two curved oblique brownish-grey interrupted lines or series of dots run to the dorsum at two-thirds and the tornus, the <b>second</b> acutely <b>indented</b> above the middle. There is also a marginal series of blackish dots around the posterior part of the costa and termen. The hindwings are whitish, the apical third suffused pale greyish and the costa slightly dilated anteriorly, a whitish subcostal hairpencil from the base to three-fifths.|$|R
5000|$|In general, line breaks {{divide the}} poetry into smaller units called lines, (this is a {{modernisation}} {{of the term}} verse) which are often interpreted {{in terms of their}} self-contained meanings and aesthetic values: hence the term [...] "good line". Line breaks, indentations, and the lengths of individual words determine the visual shape of the poetry on the page, which is a common aspect of poetry but never the sole purpose of a line break. A dropped line is a line broken into two parts, in which the <b>second</b> part is <b>indented</b> to remain visually sequential through spacing. In metric poetry, the places where the lines are broken are determined by the decision to have the lines composed from specific numbers of syllables.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 18-19 mm. The forewings {{are light}} greyish ochreous, the veins suffused light fuscous {{and with a}} slightly indicated fuscous dot {{at the base of}} the fold. The stigmata are blackish, the plical obliquely beyond the first discal. There is a blackish dot towards the costa before the middle, from beyond this a series connected by fuscous shading strongly curved around the <b>second</b> discal stigma, <b>indented</b> on the fold, to the dorsum at two-thirds. A curved series of cloudy blackish dots is connected by slight fuscous suffusion from the costa at four-fifths to the dorsum before the tornus, indented beneath the costa, the apical area beyond this suffused fuscous. There is also a marginal series of black dots around the apex and termen. The hindwings are rather dark grey.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{moisture}} on copper thin film adhesion {{have been investigated}} using {{a modified version of}} the superlayer indentation test. Copper films up to 100 nm thick were sputter deposited on thermally oxidized silicon wafers. A 1 µm tungsten superlayer with 1 GPa compressive residual stress was sputter deposited on top of Cu films, providing extra energy for interfacial debonding upon indentation. The samples were first indented to a depth just greater than the thickness of the W/Cu bi-layer and then unloaded. Water was introduced to the <b>indent,</b> and a <b>second</b> higher load <b>indent</b> was made in the exact same location as the first one to drive crack propagation in the wet environment. For the indents made to the same maximum load, there was a dramatic increase in blister size in the wet environment compared to the blister size in the dry environment. Copper film adhesion in the presence of water was up to 20 times lower than in the dry environment (0. 1 J/m 2 vs. 2 J/m 2). Chemical reactions at the crack tip along with the surface energy minimization by water are thought to be the causes for the adhesion reduction...|$|R
5000|$|In poetry, a dropped {{line is a}} line {{which is}} broken into two lines, but where the <b>second</b> part is <b>indented</b> to the {{horizontal}} position {{it would have had}} an unbroken line. For example, in the poem [...] "The Other Side of the River" [...] by Charles Wright, the first and second lines form a dropped line, as do the fourth and fifth lines: It's linkage I'm talking about,::::::::and harmonies and structures,And all the various things that lock our wrists to the past.Something infinite behind everything appears,:::::::::::::and then disappears. Charles Wright Dropped lines have a variety of functions and uses. In Robert Denham's words, a dropped line is [...] "a spatial as well as temporal feature, affecting both the eye and ear." [...] It may be used to determine the visual appearance of the line as a whole. Wright, for example, uses dropped lines to reference landscape paintings, especially by Paul Cézanne and Giorgio Morandi, which influenced his writing. As Joe Moffett notes, the dropped line [...] "can be seen as imitating the sense of horizontal rhythm prevalent in paintings by Cézanne." [...] Modern poets who are known for using dropped lines include Wright, Carl Phillips, and Edward Hirsch.|$|R
40|$|Stochastic {{resonance}} (SR) {{is commonly}} {{understood to be}} the enhancement, by noise, of the response of a system to a weak input signal. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the occurrence of SR in spinal and cortical evoked field potentials (EFPs) elicited by periodic tactile stimuli in the anesthetized cat. The electrodes were positioned in spinal and cortical somatosensory regions in which the largest negative EFPs were detected. The periodic tactile stimuli consisted of local skin displacements on the central pad of the hindpaw. Two series of experiments were performed. First, periodic tactile stimuli and the noisy tactile stimuli were applied with the same <b>indenter.</b> <b>Second,</b> noisy tactile stimuli were applied with an additional indenter placed on the glabrous skin of the third hindpaw digit. This last protocol ensured that the signal and noise were mixed not in the skin but in the somatosensory regions of the CNS. All cats showed distinct SR behavior at the spinal and cortical stages of the sensory encoding. Such SR was abolished in the cortical but not in the spinal recording after sectioning of the dorsal columns and the ipsilateral dorsolateral funiculus. This suggests that the spinal neurons may also contribute to the SR observed at the cortical level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented evidence that such a remarkable phenomenon embodies electrical processes of the spinocortical somatosensory system itself.
