40|$|The <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> initiates and {{maintains}} spermatogenesis in the testis. To perform this role, the stem cell must self replicate {{as well as}} produce daughter cells that can expand and differentiate to form spermatozoa. Despite the central importance of the <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> to male reproduction, {{little is known about}} its morphological or biochemical characteristics. This results, in part, from the fact that spermatogonial stem cells are an extremely rare cell population in the testis, and techniques for their enrichment are just beginning to be established. In this investigation, we used a multiparameter selection strategy, combining the in vivo cryptorchid testis model with in vitro fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cryptorchid testis cells were fractionated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis based on light-scattering properties and expression of the cell surface molecules α 6 -integrin, αv-integrin, and the c-kit receptor. Two important observations emerged from these analyses. First, spermatogonial stem cells from the adult cryptorchid testis express little or no c-kit. Second, the most effective enrichment strategy, in this study, selected cells with low side scatter light-scattering properties, positive staining for α 6 -integrin, and negative or low αv-integrin expression, and resulted in a 166 -fold enrichment of spermatogonial stem cells.

40|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} {{by the process of}} spermatogenesis. At the base of this process is a pool of spermatogonial stem cells that generate new stem cells as well as committed spermatogonia that will eventually differentiate in spermatozoa. A tight balance between self-renewal and differentiation must be maintained to prevent accumulation of stem cells or depletion of the seminiferous tubules. The mechanisms by which self-renewal and differentiation are regulated are largely unknown. Therefore we aimed at identifying genes involved in <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> self-renewal and/or differentiation. Genes have been identified using both a candidate and a genomics approach. The gene Ly 6 a/e, also known as Sca- 1, is frequently used for the isolation of hematopoietic stem cells and plays a role in the repopulating capacity of these cells and the development of committed progenitor cells. Furthermore, LY 6 a/e was reported to be expressed by the testicular side population. In this thesis, expression of SCA- 1 has been localized to mesenchymal and peritubular cells and histological examination of Ly 6 a/e null mice testes revealed no abnormal phenotype. Together these observations indicate that LY 6 A/E is not expressed by spermatogonial stem cells and that LY 6 A/E does not play a role in spermatogonial stem cells self-renewal or differentiation. Expression of Utf 1 is rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation of embryonic stem cells. In chapter 3, expression of UTF 1 in the rat testis is shown to be restricted to the population of cells that contains the stem cells, i. e. gonocytes in embryonic and neonatal rats and to a subpopulation of early A spermatogonia in adult rat testis. This result together with the recently proposed notion that UTF 1 may be involved in the maintenance of a specific epigenetic profile suggests that UTF 1 plays a role in maintaining the spermatogonial stem cells in an undifferentiated state. Two protocols of <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation have been established. Both, BMP 4 and activin A induce differentiation of the GC- 6 spg <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> line. Expression of c-KIT, a marker of differentiated spermatogonia, is up-regulated and BMP 4 and activin A receptors are expressed. Using BMP 4 induced differentiation of the GC- 6 spg cells as a model in a time course micro-array experiment revealed numerous transcripts that are differentially regulated during the differentiation process. Among the differentially regulated genes are several TGF? family members and downstream targets. Furthermore, a number of genes more generally known {{to play a role in}} stem cell maintenance or differentiation are identified. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the expression pattern of six differentially regulated genes, indicating that the list of genes identified can be used as candidate genes for further research. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that activin A and BMP 4 act via distinct and identical downstream target genes. Our results form a strong foundation for further research as multiple genes have been identified that likely play a role in <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> self-renewal and/or differentiation.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} that regulate germ-cell development {{is crucial to}} reproductive medicine and animal production. Animal gametes originally derive from sexually undifferentiated primordial germ cells (PGCs), which develop into mitotic germ cells (oogonia or spermatogonia) before proceeding to meiosis [Wylie, C. (1999) Cell 96, 165 – 174]. Spermatogonia are thought to include a population of <b>cells</b> with <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> activity, which proliferate throughout the lifespan of male animals and produce spermatozoa [Zhao, G. Q. & Garbers, D. L. (2002) Dev. Cell 2, 537 – 547]. However, the functional differences between PGCs and <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are poorly understood. Here we show that transplanted adult testicular germ cells can colonize sexually undifferentiated embryonic gonads and resume gametogenesis. Testicular germ <b>cells</b> containing <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from adult male rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of newly hatched embryos of both sexes, and {{the behavior of the}} donor cells was observed. The testicular germ cells differentiated into spermatozoa in male recipients and fully functional eggs in female recipients. Furthermore, the donor-derived spermatozoa and eggs obtained from the recipient fish were able to produce normal offspring. These findings indicate that fish testicular germ <b>cells,</b> probably <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> possess a high level of developmental plasticity and sexual bipotency, even after the animal reaches maturity. Furthermore, our results suggest that <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are at least partly functionally similar to PGCs...|$|R

Therefore, after termination of radiation therapy or chemotherapy, the spermatognia <b>stems</b> <b>cells</b> may re-initiate the formation of spermatogenesis.|$|R

However, {{there has been little}} substantial evidence that supports this assumption. In the present study, we performed serial transplantation of spermato-gonial <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to investigate if they expand by self-renewing division following transplantation. The transgenic mouse carry-ing the Green fluorescent protein gene was used as the donor cell source that facilitated identification and recollection of col-onized donor germ cells in the recipient testes. The established colonies of germ cells in the recipient testes were collected and transplanted to new recipients. This serial transplantation of <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> repopulated the recipient testes, which were successfully performed sequentially up to four times from one recipient to the next. The incubation periods between two sequential transplantations ranged from 55 to 373 days. During these passages, the <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> showed constant activity to form spermatogenic colonies in the recipient testis. They continued to increase in number {{for more than a year}} following transplantation. Colonization efficiency of sper-matogonial <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was determined to be 4. 25 % by using Sl/ Sld mice as recipients that propagated only undifferentiated type A spermatogonia in their testes. Based on the colonization ef-ficiency, one colony-forming activity was assessed to equate to about 20 <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were estimated to expand over 50 -fold in 100 days in this experiment. sperm, spermatogenesis, testi...|$|R
