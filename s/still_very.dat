5|$|Although Bede {{is mainly}} studied as a {{historian}} now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works.

The drainage into the canal was not able to completely stop the floods that regularly affected certain outer areas of the city.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} <b>still</b> <b>very</b> limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, {{and the general}} {{standard}} of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.|$|E

5|$|The {{suburb of}} Beaumont, in the City of Burnside, was founded as a {{purpose-built}} village by Sir Samuel Davenport in 1848. The location of Beaumont to Adelaide, a rapidly developing settlement at the time, made {{land in the}} area extremely expensive. Although Adelaide as a new settlement was prospering during the mid-19th century, <b>still</b> <b>very</b> few people could afford the exclusivity of Beaumont.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Southampton 4–1 on aggregate to {{lift the}} Anglo-Italian League Cup, Napoli were entered into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup for 1976–77, where they reached the semi-finals, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Anderlecht. The club won their second Coppa Italia trophy in 1975–76, eliminating Milan and Fiorentina en route, before beating rivals Hellas Verona 4–0 in the final. In the Italian league, Napoli were <b>still</b> <b>very</b> much a consistent top six side {{for much of the}} late 1970s. Even into the earliest two seasons of the 1980s, the club were performing respectably with a third-place finish in 1980–81.

5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy.

The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

5|$|Between 1970 and 1972, {{a pair of}} Montagu's harriers, Britain's rarest {{breeding}} birds of prey, nested in the reed bed. The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£,000 in 20). The Montagu's harriers did not return, but marsh harriers did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then <b>still</b> <b>very</b> rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 {{to cope with the}} numbers of visitors.|$|E

Linda married Musty Siddick, had two children Ruby and Irene, and in the 1970s they were living in a Northern Territory Pintupi community called Yayayi. After Musty's death she remarried.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, the Friends of the Constitution (Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej)which {{included}} many {{participants in the}} Great Sejmwas organised to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. It is now regarded as the first modern-style political party in Poland's history. The response to the new constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party enjoyed considerable influence. General support among the middle nobility was crucial and <b>still</b> <b>very</b> substantial; most of the provincial sejmiks deliberating in 1791 and early 1792 supported the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was <b>still</b> <b>very</b> traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E
