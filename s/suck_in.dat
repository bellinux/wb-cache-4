5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to <b>suck</b> <b>in</b> their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
5|$|The less {{stringent}} {{rules of}} the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex {{as one of their}} major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula <b>Suck?</b> <b>in</b> 1969.|$|E

25|$|While Bartlett {{continued}} his desperate manoeuvre, the ship listed more and more. The other crew members began {{to fear that}} the list would become too large, and {{so they decided to}} put the first lifeboat onto the water without waiting for the order to do so. Bartlett then decided to stop the ship and her engine. However, before he could do so, two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side. The still-turning propellers sucked the two lifeboats into it, crushing them along with their passengers. Bartlett was then finally able to stop the propellers before they could <b>suck</b> <b>in</b> another lifeboat.|$|E

500|$|The Minish Cap {{features}} {{a number of}} enhancements that benefit from the more powerful Game Boy Advance platform. The game's camera angle is {{much closer to the}} ground, allowing more detail. In the overworld and in dungeons, the game replaces the traditional item interface of the handheld Zelda games with pictures associating items or actions with buttons, similar to the item interface in 3D titles like [...] and [...] Enemies include familiar creatures from the Zelda universe. Link can also perform special actions present in the 3D Zelda games, such as rolling while running. Along with returning items such as Bombs, Arrows and Pegasus Boots, The Minish Cap introduces three new items: the Mole Mitts, the Gust Jar, and the Cane of Pacci. The Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt barriers to explore new areas, the Gust Jar can <b>suck</b> <b>in</b> nearby items and substances and can be used to suck up certain enemies and fire them as projectiles, and the Cane of Pacci can flip certain objects over and allow Link to launch himself out of holes in the ground. The game advances the combat system from previous handheld installments by allowing Link to learn new sword techniques throughout the game, some of which are techniques from previous games and some of which are new. As the game progresses, Link will collect Elements that fuse with his sword, allowing him to make copies of himself using glowing floor panels, used to solve puzzles such as pushing large blocks or hitting multiple switches simultaneously.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{many other}} {{offshore}} platforms, Piper Alpha had an automatic fire-fighting system, driven by both diesel and electric pumps (the latter were disabled by the initial explosions). The diesel pumps {{were designed to}} <b>suck</b> <b>in</b> large amounts of sea water for fire fighting; the pumps had an automatic control to start them in case of fire (although {{they could not be}} remotely started from the control room in an emergency). However, the fire-fighting system was under manual control on the evening of 6 July: the Piper Alpha procedure adopted by the Offshore Installation Manager (OIM) required manual control of the pumps whenever divers were in the water (as they were for approximately 12 hours a day during summer) although in reality, the risk was not seen as significant for divers unless a diver was closer than [...] from any of the four [...] level caged intakes. A recommendation from an earlier audit had suggested that a procedure be developed to keep the pumps in automatic mode if divers were not working {{in the vicinity of the}} intakes as was the practice on the Claymore platform, but this was never developed or implemented.|$|E
