50|$|The First General Meeting {{was held}} at the London Tavern and the second in the house of J.Hartley and Son, at 137 Leadenhall Street - the latter being the first address to be officially {{recorded}} as ‘the offices of the Society’.The first prospectus was published in the Shipping Gazette and aroused widespread interest “offering advantages to the seafaring portion of the community, which no office has yet attempted.” The reaction was favourable and many shipping companies showed interest - P&O at once declared their intention to establish a superannuation scheme with the Society. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company having initially declined the proposal, were soon to change their minds. Even with such interest the Marine and General Directors were convinced that they could offer still lower rates for marine life risks than those they had originally announced. A closer study of the limited marine mortality data was undertaken as well as a review of the current practice of other Life Offices. In terms of the mortality data they concluded that mortality among seafarers was approximately 50 per cent higher than among comparably select ‘ordinary’ lives. In terms of the practice of other Life Offices, the Marine and General Directors found ample evidence that backed up the original claim that marine life assurance had been previously neglected.Royal Exchange, London for example had no such risks on their books, but were they to accept any they would require an extra premium of £2 per cent (1852) for European <b>sea</b> <b>risk</b> and considerably more for the Cape, Australia and the West Indies. The London Assurance Corporation had accepted only one such risk - the captain of a coasting steamer - and had charged 15s. per cent extra.|$|E

A total of 139 samples comprising 104 marine sediments and 35 estuarine sediments {{were collected from}} the Bohai Sea area and analyzed for seventeen antibiotics. The results reveal that the presence and concentration of antibiotics were generally higher in the estuaries than in the sea. The highest antibiotic concentration, 4695 mu g kg(- 1) of oxytetracycline, occurred in the estuarine sediment from Ziya New River. Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay and the surrounding estuaries had higher concentrations of antibiotics.

40|$|The {{growing number}} of remote sensing systems and ship {{reporting}} technologies (e. g.

Research on reliable data mining techniques has proven essential {{to the discovery of}} knowledge from such increasingly available information on ship traffic at sea. Data driven knowledge discovery has very recently demonstrated its value in fields that go beyond the original maritime safety and security remits of such data. They include, but are not limited to, fisheries management, maritime spatial planning, gridding ship emissions, mapping activities at <b>sea,</b> <b>risk</b> assessment of offshore platforms, and trade indicators. The extraction of useful information from maritime Big Data is thus a key element in providing operational authorities, policy-makers and scientists with supporting tools to understand what is happening at sea and improve maritime knowledge.

40|$|Abstract The {{concept of}} risk under sea {{carriage}} {{is an important}} subject under sales law. This {{due to the fact}} that when goods are handed over from the seller to a carrier, neither the seller nor the buyer has physical control over the goods while in transit Risk under sales law deals with who bears the risk of goods damaged or loss without fault on the part of the parties to the sales contract. Risk under the sea carriage therefore has to do with who bears the ultimate responsibility in circumstances of loss or damage to the goods while in transit. Usually the parties under the sales contract contemplate on insurance to cover such losses. However, it is important to establish whether it is the seller or the buyer who has a claim against the carrier or insurer. I chose the concept of risk under sea carriage because coming from a developing country where raw materials are exported and finished products imported, trade is vital to the economic growth of the country. As bulk cargoes are mainly transported by <b>sea,</b> <b>risk</b> under sea carriage cannot be overlooked. Therefore, it is important to understand how trade partners allocate risk among themselves especially after each has fulfilled his contractual obligation and a carrier who is not a party to the transaction has to convey the goods to the buyer. To get a clear understanding of the concept of risk under sea carriage, I chose to look at the transaction based on a contract where the seller has to get the goods, arrange for the transport and insurance (CIF) and found out that the contract of sale, finance, contract of carriage and contract of insurance are inter-dependant in an international trade transaction...|$|E

Such arrangements are known as bottomry or respondentia bonds. Early insurance arrangements reflected poor understanding of insurance theory. For example, in 1692, England offered life annuities for sale at a fixed price, independent of age. Not surprising, healthy young people bought the policies, and the treasury lost heavily. Mortality tables had not yet been conceived. Indeed, Edmond Halley (from Halley’s comet) produced the first life table in response to this event. Still, many of the modern problems had been anticipated. Understanding of moral hazard dates back to second-century Roman Palestine.

40|$|AbstractA {{large number}} of {{industries}} will experience climate change related damages with the climate change processes over the coming years. For example, the <b>risks</b> from <b>sea</b> level rising will be faced. In addition, {{there are a lot}} of uncertainties for the climate change in the future. Therefore, making decisions when to invest in the long term the <b>sea</b> level rising <b>risk</b> related projects is important and complex. The complexity of the decisions mainly lies in the evolving nature of the <b>sea</b> level rising <b>risk,</b> particularly due to the global climate change but also the future socio-economic development scenarios. In this paper, we first regard the sea level and the temperature as the underlying assets, and then develop a real option model to evaluate potential <b>sea</b> level rising <b>risk</b> management opportunities. In the case of American real options, we reformulate the problem to a linear parabolic variational inequality (VI) in two spatial dimensions and develop a power penalty method to solve it. It is shown that the nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) is uniquely solvable and the solution of the PDE converges to that of the VI at the rate of order O(λ−k 2). A so-called fitted finite volume method is proposed to solve the nonlinear PDE in both cases of European and American options, and the convergence of the fully discrete system of equations is obtained. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the theoretical results of this method...|$|R

40|$|Managed retreat - the {{relocation}} of homes and infrastructure under threat from coastal flooding - {{is one of the}} few policy options available for coastal communities facing long-term <b>risks</b> from accelerated <b>sea</b> level rise. At present, little is known about how the Australian public perceives policy options to mitigate <b>sea</b> level rise <b>risks.</b> This paper explores a range of different decision-making criteria used to assess a managed retreat scheme. A metatheoretical social functionalist framework is used to make sense of personal concerns elicited from an online survey asking respondents to consider a managed retreat scheme. The framework proposes that people can act intuitively as scientists, economists, politicians, prosecutors and theologians, when considering a complex topic such as managed retreat policy. The research found that the survey respondents are more likely to consider the topic of managed retreat from multiple functional perspectives than from a single functional perspective. The type of social functionalist frameworks that people used to assess the Conditional Occupancy Rights scheme was found to be influenced by their perceptions of <b>sea</b> level rise <b>risk.</b> The findings have implications for public debates about the long-term <b>risks</b> of <b>sea</b> level rise and for engaging with the community about managed retreat policy options...|$|R
