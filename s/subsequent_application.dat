5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each <b>subsequent</b> <b>application</b> has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E

He acquired and accumulated extensive property in Honolulu and Maui, and according to Reverend Armstrong, who was pastor at Kawaiahaʻo Church and knew him in later life, stated [...] "He did accumulate property; he had lands, houses, cattle, and money. But he did not hoard these fruits of his industry—he gave freely to aid in every good work; gave for the support of the Gospel; aided in building meeting houses and school houses; in sending the Gospel to the heathen, and in assisting the needy.” On March 1849, he attempted to purchase the island of Kahoʻolawe from the King and the Land Commission. Kaʻauwai offered $400 for the entire island, which had been previously used unsuccessfully as a male penal colony. The offer was refused by the King and his Privy Council of State, and a <b>subsequent</b> <b>application</b> dated to August 18, 1854 for a fifty-year lease at $200 per year was also declined. He also worked as a farmer and acquired property on Maui for growing taro and banana, which he won prizes for at the Hawaiian Agricultural Society in 1851.|$|E

60|$|When, therefore, {{we argue}} {{from a number}} of known cases to another case {{supposed}} to be analogous, it is always possible, and generally advantageous, to divert our argument into the circuitous channel of an induction from those known cases to a general proposition, and a <b>subsequent</b> <b>application</b> of that general proposition to the unknown case. This second part of the operation, which, as before observed, is essentially a process of interpretation, will be resolvable into a syllogism or a series of syllogisms, the majors of which will be general propositions embracing whole classes of cases; every one of which propositions must be true in all its extent, if the argument is maintainable. If, therefore, any fact fairly coming within the range of one of these general propositions, and consequently asserted by it, is known or suspected to be other than the proposition asserts it to be, this mode of stating the argument causes us to know or to suspect that the original observations, which are the real grounds of our conclusion, are not sufficient to support it. And in proportion to the greater chance of our detecting the inconclusiveness of our evidence, will be the increased reliance we are entitled to place in it if no such evidence of defect shall appear.|$|E

To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went--it was not very extensive--kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's <b>subsequent</b> <b>application</b> of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.|$|E
