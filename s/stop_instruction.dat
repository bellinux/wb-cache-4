50|$|The APEXC is an {{incredibly}} simple machine.Instruction and data words are always 32 bits long. The processor uses integer arithmetic with 2's complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits long. The APEXC has no RAM, except for a 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, {{for a total of}} 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket calculator is faster.One oddity {{is that there is no}} program counter: each machine instruction includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder-based memory.The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching (which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may simulate it.Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there is no other adequate word.Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a <b>stop</b> <b>instruction,</b> which enables the operator to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter the address of another program and run it.Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output could be fed to a printer ('teletyper') unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with a special 32-key keyboard (each tape row had 5 data holes (<-> bits), which makes 32 differentvalues).|$|E

40|$|An ad-hoc {{mobile network}} is a {{collection}} of mobile nodes that are dynamically and arbitrarily located in such a manner that the interconnections between nodes are capable of changing on a continual basis. Mobile Ad-Hoc networks are not new to computer science, but the concept of a well organized routing simulator that can demonstrate routing protocols used in Ad-Hoc networks a reality. This simulator will be capable of demonstrating two different routing protocols initially, but will also have the room to expand its capabilities. The simulator will be able to play out many real life scenarios, allowing users to seek out a routing protocol that can optimize the Mobile Ad-Hoc Network experience. While selecting a route, nodes with battery power greater than the threshold will only be considered. It would then go on to compute the minimum power-cost route. We propose an alternative ERS scheme to support reactive and proactive protocols such as DSDV and AODV, and it is called Blocking Expanding Ring Search (Blocking-ERS for short) and also Bellman-Ford algorithm is used as another alternative scheme.

40|$|Taxiing at {{any major}} hub airport {{constitutes}} a workload intense navigation and monitoring. Although the pilots {{are supported by}} signage on the airport surface and possibly even taxiway centerline lights, this task can be complicated even in good weather conditions. Radio communication technology is near capacity limits in many airports today resulting in waiting times for the flight crew to negotiate the next taxi clearance. Apart from well known safety issues this often leads to delays - for the passengers as well - and ultimately impacts the environment. Solutions are given by the European research program SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research) which aims at modernizing and harmonizing the European Aviation network. A new surface traffic management concept dispenses with radio communication and proposes the automated use of AGL with individually switched green taxiway centerline lights indicating the path for the flight crew to be followed. For each aircraft a segment of taxiway centerline lights can be illuminated in front of it. The areas not needed are switched off, minimizing the risk of errors. The new concept is independent from cockpit equipment. The procedure is called “Follow-the-Greens”. The SESAR European Airports Consortium “SEAC” validated the new concept {{under the leadership of}} Fraport with its partners DFS, ENAV, Flightdecksystems and ATRiCS under the support of Lufthansa in 2013. A real-time simulation platform for the Frankfurt airport area layout combined two Airbus A 320 fixed based simulators with highly integrated controller working positions.

40|$|Teachers {{wishing to}} offer lessons in nature may hold back {{for fear of}} leaving {{students}} keyed up and unable to concentrate in subsequent, indoor lessons. This study tested the hypothesis that lessons in nature have positive—not negative—aftereffects on subsequent classroom engagement. Using carefully matched pairs of lessons (one in a relatively natural outdoor setting and one indoors), we observed subsequent classroom engagement during an indoor instructional period, replicating these comparisons over 10 different topics and weeks in the school year, in each of two third grade classrooms. Pairs were roughly balanced in how often the outdoor lesson preceded or followed the classroom lesson. Classroom engagement was significantly better after lessons in nature than after their matched counterparts for {{four of the five}} measures developed for this study: teacher ratings; third-party tallies of “redirects” (the number of times the teacher <b>stopped</b> <b>instruction</b> to direct student attention back onto the task at hand); independent, photo-based ratings made blind to condition; and a composite index each showed a nature advantage; student ratings did not. This nature advantage held across different teachers and held equally over the initial and final 5 weeks of lessons. And the magnitude of the advantage was large. In 48 out of 100 paired comparisons, the nature lesson was a full standard deviation better than its classroom counterpart; in 20 of the 48, the nature lesson was over two standard deviations better. The rate of “redirects” was cut almost in half after a lesson in nature, allowing teachers to teach for longer periods uninterrupted. Because the pairs of lessons were matched on teacher, class (students and classroom), topic, teaching style, week of the semester, and time of day, the advantage of the nature-based lessons could not be attributed to any of these factors. It appears that, far from leaving students too keyed up to concentrate afterward, lessons in nature may actually leave students more able to engage in the next lesson, even as students are also learning the material at hand. Such “refueling in flight” argues for including more lessons in nature in formal education...|$|R

5000|$|While a {{computer}} {{may be viewed}} as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously.

By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later.

40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{effectiveness}} of traditional grammar instruction has been ongoing for many decades now. Traditional grammar instruction involves memorization of grammatical rules and practice exercise drills. As early as 1936, the Curriculum Commission of the National Council of Teachers of English stated that “‘all teaching of grammar separate from the manipulation of sentences [should] be discontinued…since every scientific attempt to prove that knowledge of grammar is useful has failed’” (Weaver, Teaching 9). So why is grammar still being taught in the same way-through traditional direct instruction-in many schools? It is because some parents, administrators, politicians, researchers, and teachers wholeheartedly believe that students will learn grammar best through direct instruction, lectures, textbooks, and worksheets of practice exercises, with grammar totally removed from a relevant context. Conversely, other researchers and teachers believe that students learn grammar best by situating grammar instruction in the context of reading and writing, and these researchers and teachers have controlled studies and a body of literature on their side. Immersing students in authentic reading and writing activities, using mini-lessons to teach grammatical concepts, and showing applied grammatical concepts in real life leads to better student writing. Teachers must also focus on the individual writing needs of their students and <b>stop</b> seeing grammar <b>instruction</b> as a hunt for errors.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} {{in the use of}} embedded systems for performing secure transactions, has proportionally increased the security threats which are faced by such devices. Side channel attack, a sophisticated security threat to embedded devices like smartcards, mobile phones and PDAs, exploits the external manifestations like processing time, power consumption and electromagnetic emission to identify the internal computations. Power analysis attack, introduced by Kocher in 1998, is used by adversaries to eavesdrop on confidential data while the device is executing a secure transaction. The adversary observes the power trace dissipated/consumed by the chip during the encryption/decryption of the AES cryptographic program and predicts the secret key used for encryption by extracting necessary information from the power trace. Countermeasures proposed to overcome power analysis are data masking, table masking, current flattening, circuitry level solutions, dummy instruction insertions, balancing bit-flips, etc. All these techniques are either susceptible to multi-order side channel attacks, not sufficiently generic to cover all encryption algorithms, or burden the system with high area cost, run-time or energy consumption. The initial solution presented in this thesis is a HW/SW based randomised instruction injection technique, which infuses random instructions at random places during the execution of an application. Such randomisation obfuscates the secure information from the power profile, not allowing the adversary to extract the critical power segments for analysis. Further, the author devised a systematic method to measure the security level of a power sequence and used it to measure the number of random instructions needed, to suitably confuse the adversary. The proposed processor model costs 1. 9 % in additional area for a simplescalar processor, and costs on average 29. 8 % in runtime and 27. 1 % in additional energy consumption for six industry standard cryptographic algorithms. This design is extended to a processor architecture which automatically detects the execution of the most common encryption algorithms, starts to scramble the power waveform by adding randomly placed instructions with random register accesses, and <b>stops</b> injecting <b>instructions</b> when it is safe to do so. This approach has less overheads compared to previous solutions and avoids software instrumentation, allowing programmers with no special knowledge to use the system. The extended processor model costs an additional area of 1. 2 %, and an average of 25 % in runtime and 28. 5 % in energy overheads for industry standard cryptographic algorithms. Due to the possibility of removing random injections using large number of samples (due to the random nature, a large number of samples will eliminate noise), the author proposes a multiprocessor 'algorithmic' balancing technique. This technique uses a dual processor architecture where two processors execute the same program in parallel, but with complementary intermediate data, thus balancing the bitflips. The second processor works in conjunction with the first processor for balancing only when encryption is performed, and both processors carry out independent tasks when no encryption is being performed. Both DES and AES cryptographic programs are investigated for balancing and the author shows that this technique is economical, while completely preventing power analysis attacks. The signature detection unit to capture encryption is also utilised, which is used in the instruction injection approach. This multiprocessor balancing approach reduces performance by 0. 42 % and 0. 94 % for AES and DES respectively. The hardware increase is 2 X only when balancing is performed. Further, several future extensions for the balancing approach are proposed, by introducing random swapping of encryption iterations between cores. FPGA implementations of these processor designs are briefly described {{at the end of this}} thesis...|$|R
40|$|The Rule Against Perpetuities {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for those who teach property or trusts and estates to review {{some of the major}} schools of jurisprudence and how accurately or inaccurately those schools characterize law and legal development. At first blush, the idea that the rule can be used to advance a student 2 ̆ 7 s mastery or consideration of theory seems absurd. But this essay will outline an innovative approach to the rule that allows those who teach it to mix theory in with the difficult problems that the rule creates. The modern pedagogical approach to the rule treats it as an embarrassment [...] the difficult family problem that is not discussed in public. Teachers see it as bad medicine that must be dispensed and swallowed quickly, and different teachers vary on how much of the rule 2 ̆ 7 s technicalities they think the student should master (or at least endure). Students share the bad medicine view of the rule. Ask students what subject within property they hated most, and most will answer that it was the Rule Against Perpetuities. Indeed, it might rank as the most-hated doctrine studied {{in the first year of}} law school (although the Erie doctrine might give it a run for its money). Arcane in origin, difficult to understand and apply, unintuitive, and seemingly random in its effect, the rule brings together many of the difficulties that students have in adjusting to the rigors of legal study. Students joke about it, have nightmares about it, and learn through rumor that the rule is so complicated that, when they are in practice, they will not be held liable for malpractice if they draft an instrument that is subsequently held void because of the rule. Graduating third-year students frequently say-in all seriousness-that they will gladly spot the bar examiners any perpetuities problems and try to gain credit elsewhere on the exam rather than try to relearn the rule. In sum, students cannot understand why they have to endure the rule except as some kind of horrible historical accident of which they are the most recent victims. They certainly cannot explain what the rule means or does not mean from a jurisprudential standpoint-if ever they consider or are invited by their teachers to contemplate jurisprudence. Of course, some might question the propriety of introducing jurisprudence into the first year. Some people believe that the first year should consist primarily of building-block courses, i. e., courses that introduce students to basic legal rules that will appear in private practice and on the bar exam. Others believe that the first year should introduce students to legal skills or to legal reasoning and schools of jurisprudence more generally, giving the students a broader view of law as a whole before they leap into a specific advanced area. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and teachers often use basic courses in the first year as an introduction to a school or several schools of jurisprudence along with an introduction to doctrine and skills. The typical courses offered in the first year lend themselves to this approach, and Property is no exception. For example, nuisance provides good material to introduce students to the Coase theorem and law and economics; marital property law provides good material to introduce feminist jurisprudence; zoning provides good material to illustrate concepts in public choice theory. Textbooks for Property offer the teacher tools for taking this approach to introducing jurisprudence. The Dukeminier and Krier text has an excerpt of Harold Demsetz 2 ̆ 7 s economic account of the development of private property (along with critiques of it); Joseph Singer 2 ̆ 7 s text offers a good overview of the law-and-economics approach to nuisance law, as well as a critique of that approach; and the Cribbet text begins with two chapters devoted to different views of what constitutes property and what are the attributes of property. Once the text hits the Rule Against Perpetuities, however, theory apparently stops, and I suspect that theory <b>stops</b> in classroom <b>instruction</b> as well. Property texts attempt to streamline presentation of the rule more through problems than through cases. Most property teachers gear their teaching of the rule to its basic mechanics, simply to get their students through the material, prepare them for the questions that they might face on the bar exam, and thus help them avoid embarrassment. Because of its complexity, the rule has generated its own set of specialized secondary study materials simply to explain how the rule works. Students can use CALI exercises or buy supplemental texts, workbooks, flashcards, outlines, or sample problems, to help them through these rough waters, all in an effort to avoid embarrassment on the final exam or on the bar exam. Property teachers whose primary field is not property or trusts and estates might also hew closely to the text and prepared problems to avoid being embarrassed themselves because they do not know the answer to a variation on one of the problems. There is, however, another deeper embarrassment that the rule creates: no major school of jurisprudence can comprehensively explain the origins of the rule, why such a complicated rule continues to persist, why the rule does not appear in jurisdictions other than those with an English common law heritage but why it does not appear in all of those, and why it has not been abolished or reformed until recently, and why reform or abandonment has occurred where it has occurred and when it has occurred. Each school of jurisprudence may be able to answer one or more of the preceding questions, but none provides a comprehensive explanation for the existence and persistence of this complicated conundrum. The rule thus provides property teachers an opportunity to invite their students to take a step back from staring into the abyss of perpetuities problems and consider different theoretical attempts to define why the law looks the way it does and whether different schools of theory accurately capture the entire picture. The Rule Against Perpetuities might embarrass not just law professors and law students; it might also embarrass schools of legal thought. In this essay I start by briefly describing the history of the rule, the standard problems that students confront, and some of the places where the rule is found geographically. The conclusions of this discussion are that the rule is fairly incoherent from a policy perspective and that it has not been widely adopted except in portions of the British Commonwealth and the United States. I then identify a few modern schools of jurisprudence [...] specifically law and economics, public choice theory, critical legal/race/feminist studies, the theory of legal transplants, and comparative institutional analysis [...] and show how each fails to explain the rule comprehensively...|$|R
