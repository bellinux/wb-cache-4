These {{ratings are based}} on a set of ratings that were obtained from a wide <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> Predicting the ratings can be formulated as a regression problem. Ensemble regression methods are effective tools that improve the results of simple regression algorithms by iteratively applying the simple algorithm to a diverse set of inputs. The present paper describes a simple and effective ensemble regressor for the prediction of missing ratings in recommender systems. The ensemble method is an adaptation of the AdaBoost regression algorithm for recommendation tasks. In all iterations, interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors are simultaneously derived by minimizing the root mean squared error. From iteration to iteration instances that are hard to predict are reinforced by manipulating their weights in the goal function that needs to be minimized. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the ensemble methodology significantly improves the predictive performance of single neighborhood-based collaborative filtering.

In the process of land acquisition for the formal housing, many home and landowners remained occupying their lands that created enclave settlements in the new modernized development areas. This is an interesting phenomenon to be examined because the enclave settlements have outlived for more than 20 years which revealed sosial and cultural characteristics of sub-urban homogeneous community life, despite being phisically and socially scattered in the midst of spread enclave settlements. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of sosial activities by all components of the enclave settlement in providing spaces which lead to the use, the type, and the hierarchy of those spaces. The research method used in this study is analytical descriptive by identifying all the facts associated with social activities of the community and the use of spaces for social activities focusing on the characteristics of the users, the frequency of use, and the scope of activities. The result of the study shows that there are types of hierarchy and the use of social spaces coupled with the frecuency of use and the various <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> even by involving community members outside of the enclave but with historical and family ties. The use of the court yard as semi-private social spaces around the house is strongly associated with the cultural characteristics and cocial values of the society by considering neighbours are brothers.

We examined basically the device and measured EMG of three subjects’ rectus under two different conditions: not using any device and using the developed device. As the result, there is statistically {{significant difference in the}} reduction in rectus femoris muscle activity when using the device. And we found that although the activity isn’t reduced in some initial posture, the suitable initial posture is bending forward and tilting to an armrest. Moreover, we made an upper body model in frontal plane that shows the relationship between the degree of body tilt and the supporting force to the user from the developed device’s armrest under the condition of upper body is stable. And we found the experimental values approximately match the theoretical values. Finally, {{it is likely to be}} a possibility of in use an elbow-supporting device to assist standing-up motion. However, it is not clearly that the suggested device might lead some bad conditions of body because of the mechanism different on right and left human body, or not. Thus, we expect not long usage of our device but temporary usage for people who feel some difficulty in standing-up motion because they have an injury or some trauma. We showed in this paper that in spite of a very compact size of device, our suggested method seems to be effective method to assist standing-up motion. In addition, all results in this paper are in subjects without physical disability. We need to continue further in-depth examination of the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and the size of the device for individuals.|$|E

This project is exploring ways to utilize a new IPv 6 protocol that allows for multicast messages to be sent and routed throughout the network so that multiple users may receive the same message. It is a revolutionary way of approaching conferencing software; however it relies on a technology that is not widely used throughout the current network. As a means of incorporating both old and new technology, the software includes a Reflector Service that enables networks using the old IPv 4 {{to interact with the}} software on a peer to peer basis so that a virtual multicast can be utilized. By allowing for the old network to be incorporated, the Reflector Service broadens the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> so that many can be involved in a single conference. Our goal is to test and possibly improve the Reflector Service so that it is able to accomplish the goals set forth by its creators. Testing will include setting up a Reflector Service on a server that is connected to the current IPv 6 network, connecting through it from an IPv 4 network connection, and monitoring its ability to act as an intermediary between the two networks. Source code is readily available {{due to the fact that}} ConferenceXP {{is an open}} source project. Development will generally include tools for testing the connections and performance but may delve into the improvements on the service itself. This research will provide further incite into the workings of the Reflector Service and improve the usability of the ConferenceXP software so that organizations on any network will be able to utilize it.

40|$|The {{diasporic}} {{movement of}} Chinese people to South Africa, through time and space, unfolds the current discourse of cultural identity within the multicultural flows of our society. Diluting the Chinese culture into {{a hybrid of}} Chinese and South African identity, results in a disconnection to their homeland and their loss of “Chineseness. ” However, the global realities of diaspora in the 21 st century render this condition inevitable and so, consequently, this thesis aims to celebrate the Chinese culture {{as well as the}} fusion of Chinese culture, through the creation of culturally integrative spaces. Sited at Ferreirasdorp in Johannesburg’s city centre, this project involves the design of a Chinese Cultural Institute in conjunction with retail and informal trade. The broad intention is to provide a catalyst for the revival of the earliest Chinatown within this historical corner of the city. Chinese migratory movement to South Africa occurred at different times, for different reasons and from a number of places in China, and this variation has resulted in the dispersal of these migrants throughout Johannesburg. The earliest Chinatown is one of these dispersed spaces. In addition to this larger scale diaspora, there are subcultural conflicts that exist between these Chinese communities that have further increased their dispersal. However, in this present-day atmosphere of celebrating cultural difference in Johannesburg and in light of the business relationship formed between China and Africa, {{there is a need to}} bring these diverse yet segregated Chinese communities together. The principal research question is: Can architecture become a translator that can facilitate communication across cultures and subcultures?” The building therefore consists of flexible spaces that can easily adapt and transform to suit the users’ needs. This includes meeting spaces, whether it be a formal office space or under tree in the courtyard, so that Chinese businessmen can communicate with businessmen from local industries. The project also provides a variety of cultural activities. This includes Chinese cooking classes for anyone interested in learning about the richly diverse cuisines across China. Pan-Asian activities such as Karaoke Bars and Thai Massages are also provided in order to acknowledge the existing variety of Asian cultures in the city, and to accommodate for a larger <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> This thesis therefore explores how spaces can facilitate interaction between these cultures as well as distinguish and celebrate the various Chinese subcultures that exist in metropolitan Johannesburg. In accomplishing the goals of this design, the building becomes a place of exchange. Through connections of movement and visibility, it allows new spatial and social opportunities to develop in order to create a variety of identities in our contemporary African city. The building encourages the Chinese communities to claim it as their own while simultaneously providing accessibility to a variety of other users who can experience cultures reverberating off each other, through a mixture of activities, from moment to moment...|$|E

However, they have not reached consensus on the nature and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> experience and its relationship to learning, decision making, and action.

Besides the instrumental dimensions, researches <b>of</b> <b>user</b> experience also cover users’ needs, emotions, and the experience itself (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006).

Online carbon calculators can help consumers prioritize among dietary behaviors to minimize personal "carbon footprints," leveraging against emissions-intensive industry practices. We reviewed the fitness of selected carbon calculators for measuring and communicating indirect GHG emissions from food consumption. Calculators were evaluated based on the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> behaviors accounted for, data sources, transparency of methods, consistency with prior data and effectiveness of communication. We found food consumption was under-represented (25 %) among general environmental impact calculators (nÂ =Â  83). We identified eight carbon calculators that accounted for food consumption and included U. S. users among the target audience. Among these, meat and dairy consumption was appropriately highlighted as the primary diet-related contributor to emissions. Opportunities exist to improve upon these tools, including: expanding the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> behaviors included under calculations; improving communication, in part by emphasizing the ecological and public health co-benefits of less emissions-intensive diets; and adopting more robust, transparent methodologies, particularly where calculators produce questionable emissions estimates. Further, all calculators could benefit from more comprehensive data on the U. S. food system. These advancements may better equip these tools for effectively guiding audiences toward ecologically responsible dietary choices.

Further, concepts for misuse detection in DBS have not been adequately addressed by existing research in misuse detection. Even though there are available means to guard the information stored in a database system against misuse, they are seldom used by security o cers because security policies of the organization are either imprecise or not known at all. This paper presents a misuse detection system called DEMIDS which is tailored to relational database systems. DEMIDS uses audit logs to derive pro les that describe typical behavior <b>of</b> <b>users</b> working with the DBS. The pro les computed {{can be used to}} detect misuse behavior, in particular insider abuse. Furthermore, the pro les can serve asavaluable tool for security reengineering of an organization by helping the security o cers to de ne/re ne security policies and to verify existing security policies, if there are any. Essential to the presented approach is that the access patterns <b>of</b> <b>users</b> typically form some working scopes which comprise sets of attributes that are usually referenced together with some values in queries. DEMIDS considers domain knowledge about the data structures and semantics encoded in a given database schema through the notion of distance measure. Distance measures are used to guide the search for frequent itemsets describing the working <b>scopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> In DEMIDS such frequent itemsets are computed e ciently from audit logs using the data management and query processing features of the database management system. ...|$|R
