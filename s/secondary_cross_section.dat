40|$|The {{sole purpose}} of the study is to carve out the {{performance}} and structure of the small and medium scale manufacturing sector of Pakistan in terms of employment and productivity. The present study has incorporated the transcendental logarithmic cost function to apply on <b>secondary,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> data of the 3 -digit forty nine SMEs of Pakistan. This functional form allows for and assists in exploring the true production structure of the firms. It has been revealed that structure of SMEs in Pakistan is based on Non-homothetic, Non-homogeneous, Variable returns to scale and Non-unitary elasticities. It has further been found that SMEs are overwhelmingly efficient as the pro- SMEs advocate them, in terms of employment generation and productivity, as capital and labor are found to be substitutes, which means employment generation is possible without the expansion in capital in a densely populated country like Pakistan. The conclusion suggests that although public policy should be targeted to provide parallel support to capital and labor yet distinguished favor should be given to labor to generate employment in SMEs of Pakistan...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} {{and promotion of}} the SMEs {{is considered to be}} the solution to many of the problems of the developing economies. This SME panacea compels the researchers to observe how this sector contributes in the economy of Pakistan. The core objective of the present paper remains to analyze the Input output relationship in this sector. So the study contains the productivity analysis of the small and medium scale manufacturing sector of Pakistan. This will unleash the role of the various inputs in production here. Extended Cobb Douglas Production Function has been utilized on the <b>secondary,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> data of the 3 -digit forty eight SMEs of Pakistan for the year 2005 - 2006. Different variables like labor male and female, local and imported material, sales tax, excise duty, advertisement and capital are selected to analyze their effects on output of SMEs. Most of the variables are significant having expected relationship with output, however female labor both production and non-production have shown negative relationship with output. Heteroscedasticity is checked by White test, concluding no evidence found for its presence in the data. The policy recommendations are that government should {{play a vital role in}} hand holding and development of SMEs in Pakistan so that productivity of factors of production can be increased. Especially the measures should be taken to increase the productivity of women who make 52 % of Pakistan’s population. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} regional development, {{the central government}} imposed a system of fiscal decentralization. Where local governments can regulate and allocate regional income independently. Fiscal decentralization policiy have been implemented in 2001 which serves to increase regional income and develop all economic potentials that exist, so it can spur an increase in output and increase economic activity, and finally will impact on improve social welfare. During 5 years of fiscal decentralization {{in the province of}} Central Java is known that the period 2005 - 2009, economic growth of 35 districts/cities in Central Java province increased every year, but the increases are not occurring at the same time reducing the gap in each region.
