5|$|The swifts {{are small}} birds, <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their lives flying. They have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, {{perching}} instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have very long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.|$|E
5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of assignments, and participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his time in photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the liberation}} of Monaco by the Allied forces, the 75-year-old Prince Louis did little for his principality and it began to fall into severe neglect. By 1946 he was <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his time in Paris, and on 27 July of that year, he married for the first time.

5|$|Göring {{remained}} in aviation after the war. He tried barnstorming and briefly worked at Fokker. After <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> 1919 living in Denmark, {{he moved to}} Sweden and joined Svensk Lufttrafik, a Swedish airline. Göring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, {{he was hired by}} Count Eric von Rosen to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, Göring may at this time have first seen the swastika emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in {{relative}} poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, {{but not enough to}} substantially change their situation. Despite <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E

5|$|Preoccupied with {{military}} matters and <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{his time at}} his military headquarters on the eastern front, Hitler came to rely {{more and more on}} Bormann to handle the domestic policies of the country. On 12 April 1943, Hitler officially appointed Bormann as Personal Secretary to the Führer. By this time Bormann had de facto control over all domestic matters, and this new appointment gave him the power to act in an official capacity in any matter.|$|E
5|$|With an {{interest}} in art and drawing, Wiesenthal chose to study architecture. His first choice was to attend the Lwów Polytechnic (Polish: Politechnika Lwowska), but he was turned away because the school's Jewish quota had already been filled.

He began 2008 with the Detroit Tigers bullpen but had an injury and {{was traded to the}} Pittsburgh Pirates during the year. He re-signed with Pittsburgh in 2009 but only {{appeared}} in 14 games, <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the year in the minors. Bautista posted a 3.74 ERA with the San Francisco Giants in 2010 but was never on their playoff roster and was released during the playoffs. In 2011, he signed with the Seattle Mariners but was assigned to the minor leagues. Halfway through the season, he joined the Hanwha Eagles of the Korea Baseball Organization.

5|$|After <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the next}} decade in duties in the Western Pacific, Yancey was {{decommissioned}} in March 1958 and placed in reserve at Olympia, Washington. Yancey was reactivated {{in the aftermath of}} the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and recommissioned in November. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis she sailed in support of the U.S. blockade of Cuba, and during the April 1965 U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic she carried almost a quarter of all of the evacuees from Santo Domingo.

5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|Bautista grew up {{receiving}} {{instruction on}} pitching from his second cousin, Pedro Martínez. The Florida Marlins signed him in 2000 but traded {{him to the}} Baltimore Orioles before Bautista reached the major leagues. He debuted with the Orioles in 2004, appearing in two games before getting traded to the Kansas City Royals. Bautista was ranked Kansas City's number two prospect by Baseball America entering the 2005 season, but he made just seven starts before missing {{the rest of the}} season with an injury. He posted a 5.66 earned run average (ERA) for the Royals in 2006 before getting traded to the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in nine games (all in relief) for the Rockies in 2007, <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the year in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|During the 1935 offseason, Day {{traveled}} to Puerto Rico {{to participate in}} the country's winter ball league. Beginning with his first trip in 1935, he played six seasons of winter ball in Puerto Rico, <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his time with the Aguadilla Sharks. Like with the Negro leagues, records of games were poorly documented, but some statistics show Day went 34–26 in his career with the team, and he established the league's record for most strikeouts in a game, posting 19 in 1939. In 1940, Day spent parts of the winter playing in the Venezuelan League, and for the Veracruz Red Eagles of the Mexican Baseball League, where he finished the season with a record of 6–0.|$|E

5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense <b>spending.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, Thơ became Interior Minister in the French-backed State of Vietnam under former Emperor Bảo Đại. Following the {{withdrawal}} of France from Indochina after the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, Vietnam was partitioned into a communist north and anti-communist south. Following the proclamation of the Republic of Vietnam—commonly known as South Vietnam—by President Ngô Đình Diệm, who had dethroned Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum, Thơ was appointed the inaugural ambassador to Japan. Despite <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his time in Tokyo confined to his bed by a fractured hip, Thơ secured reparations from Japan for its imperial occupation of Vietnam during World War II.|$|E
