25|$|Folklore {{seems to}} have favoured the loser {{in the battle of}} the giants, as Goram is commemorated in the {{features}} Goram’s Chair and Footprint (some versions seem to treat these as the same thing, saying that the Chair was formed by the giant stamping his foot) and <b>Soap-Dish</b> in the gorge of the Hazel Brook. Perhaps the nearby feature Lover’s Leap also recalls the legend, but this is a conventional name for precipices which often have unsubstantiated tales of lovers' suicides attached. A pub of the early 1960s on the Lawrence Weston housing estate in west Bristol is called The Giant Goram, and there was formerly (from about 1954 sporadically to 1996) a funfair bearing Goram’s name on the Blaise Castle landed estate (by then in the hands of Bristol City Council) in Henbury.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War, Wigram was {{involved}} in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. He was shot in the back, but was not aware of it at the time. He only found out later when he opened his backpack to find a bullet embedded in his <b>soap-dish.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The legend also {{provides}} a basis for explaining the existence of other geographical features. When Goram woke up, he was distraught at losing Avona’s affections. He first stamped his foot in a pet, creating The Giant's Footprint in the Henbury gorge, and then drowned himself in the Severn. The two islands in the Severn estuary, Steep Holm and Flat Holm, are his head and shoulder. Goram also has his <b>Soap-Dish,</b> which is a short pillar capped with earth, and a pool also in the Henbury gorge; this name has no obvious relation to the legend in its current forms. (For other features in the Bristol area, see also below.) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{washstand}} or basin {{stand is}} a piece of furniture consisting of a small table or cabinet, usually supported on three or four legs, and most commonly made of mahogany, walnut, or rosewood, and made for holding a wash basin and water pitcher. The smaller varieties were used for rose-water ablutions, or for hair-powdering. The larger ones, which possessed receptacles for <b>soap-dishes,</b> were the predecessors of the modern bathroom wash basin, or sink. Both varieties, often of very elegant form, were in extensive use throughout {{a large part of the}} 18th century and early-19th century, eventually disappearing with the advent of modern indoor plumbing.|$|R
50|$|With the {{beginning}} of the 19th century and the expansion of ideals of personal cleanliness, the washstand grew in size and importance. It acquired the form of an oblong wooden table provided, like its smaller predecessors, with orifices for basins and fitted with a brad shelf-like stretcher upon which the jugs were placed when they were removed from the basins. Ample space was provided for <b>soap-dishes</b> and water-bottles. These tables were single or double, for the use of one or two persons. In {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century, the wooden top of the washstand was replaced by marble, unpierced, the basins being placed upon the slab, which, in {{the beginning}} almost invariably white, were later made of red or other warm-tinted marble.|$|R
6000|$|I bathed bewilderedly. The toy duck {{was still}} in the <b>soap-dish,</b> but I was too preoccupied to give it a thought. Still at a loss, I {{returned}} to my room, and there was Jeeves. And it is proof of my fogged condish that my first words to him were words not of reproach and stern recrimination but of inquiry: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's an {{aggravating}} thing, {{just as we}} got {{the beds}} so snug,' said the chaplain, looking at three dirty mattresses, each rolled up in a blanket; which occupied {{one corner of the}} room during the day, and formed a kind of slab, on which were placed an old cracked basin, ewer, and <b>soap-dish,</b> of common yellow earthenware, with a blue flower--'very aggravating.' ...|$|E
60|$|Heaven {{knows that}} I had no {{intention}} of touching the child's work then or later; but, that evening, a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it; so that I trampled, before I knew, marigold-heads, dust-bank, and fragments of broken <b>soap-dish</b> into confusion past all hope of mending. Next morning I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to himself over the ruin I had wrought.|$|E
60|$|It is {{difficult}} to wash in these little places, because the cars shake so; {{and when you have}} got both your hands and half your head in the basin, and are unable to protect yourself, the sides of the room, and the water-tap and the <b>soap-dish,</b> and other cowardly things, take a mean advantage of your helplessness to punch you as hard as ever they can; and when you back away from these, the door swings open and slaps you from behind.|$|E
6000|$|The meek little barber stood {{gazing at}} him with the brush and <b>soap-dish</b> in his hand, {{stirring}} them round and round in a ludicrous uncertainty, {{as if he were}} disabled by some fascination from beginning. At last he made a dash at Mr Bailey's cheek. Then he stopped again, as if the ghost of a beard had suddenly receded from his touch; but receiving mild encouragement from Mr Bailey, {{in the form of an}} adjuration to 'Go in and win,' he lathered him bountifully. Mr Bailey smiled through the suds in his satisfaction. 'Gently over the stones, Poll. Go a tip-toe over the pimples!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Though {{the house}} was not large it had, like all houses on Floral Heights, an {{altogether}} royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and metal sleek as silver. The towel-rack was a rod of clear glass set in nickel. The tub was long enough for a Prussian Guard, and above the set bowl was a sensational exhibit of tooth-brush holder, shaving-brush holder, <b>soap-dish,</b> sponge-dish, and medicine-cabinet, so glittering and so ingenious that they resembled an electrical instrument-board. But the Babbitt whose god was Modern Appliances was not pleased. The air of the bathroom was thick {{with the smell of}} a heathen toothpaste. [...] "Verona been at it again! 'Stead of sticking to Lilidol, like I've re-peat-ed-ly asked her, she's gone and gotten some confounded stinkum stuff that makes you sick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Heaven {{knows that}} I had no {{intention}} of touching the child's work then or later; but, that evening, a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it; so that I trampled, before I knew, marigold-heads, dust-bank, and fragments of broken <b>soap-dish</b> into confusion past all hope of mending. Next morning I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to himself over the ruin I had wrought. Some one had cruelly told him that the Sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden, and had scattered his rubbish using bad language the while. Muhammad Din labored for an hour at effacing every trace of the dust-bank and pottery fragments, and it was with a tearful apologetic face that he said, [...] "Talaam Tahib," [...] when I came home from the office. A hasty inquiry resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that by my singular favor he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased. Whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the ground-plan of an edifice which was to eclipse the marigold-polo-ball creation.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they had}} drunk that special Chinese tea, all the rage, but {{which no one}} really liked, in the inner morning, or {{afternoon}} room--for the drawing-rooms were too large to be comfortable except at week-ends--they {{went to see the}} children, a special blend of Stanley and Clara, save the little Francis, who {{did not seem to be}} entirely body. Then Clara took them to their rooms. She lingered kindly in Nedda's, feeling that the girl could not yet feel quite at home, and looking in the <b>soap-dish</b> lest she might not have the right verbena, and about the dressing-table to see that she had pins and scent, and plenty of 'pot-pourri,' and thinking: 'The child is pretty--a nice girl, not like her mother.' Explaining carefully how, because of the approaching week-end, she had been obliged to put her in 'a very simple room' where she would be compelled to cross the corridor to her bath, she asked her if she had a quilted dressing-gown, and finding that she had not, left her saying she would send one--and could she do her frocks up, or should Sirrett come? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “He was awfully disgusted, {{as you may}} imagine, {{with his}} craft, and he applied for two twelve-pounders, {{to be used for}} stern-chasers. When he got them on board he found that there was not room for them to be worked. He had them fired off a few times, but the brig was so weakly built that the timbers would not stand the concussion. He was {{therefore}} obliged to send them on shore again. There was only a height of five feet even in the captain’s cabin, and I remember that Cochrane used to open the skylight and put his head up through it in order to shave himself, placing the <b>soap-dish</b> in front of him on the quarter-deck. However, we were a pleasant party on board. Cochrane was strict in the performance of duty, but an excellent fellow to sail with, anxious for the comfort of men and officers, and without a shadow of nonsense about him. His first lieutenant had served for a few months in that rank, Rogers and I were acting-lieutenants, and there was a doctor, and one midshipman, Lord Cochrane’s brother. Lord Cochrane at that time was twenty-four, or nearly so, his first lieutenant was a year older, Rogers and I twenty-one.|$|E
60|$|Then he jumped. The {{head was}} lying a little {{clear of the}} water-jar, under the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced {{his back against the}} bulge of the red earthen-rare to hold down the head. This gave him just one second's purchase, and he made the most of it. Then he was {{battered}} to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the floor, up and down, and round in great circles; at his eyes were red, and he held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the tin dipper and the <b>soap-dish</b> and the flesh-brush, and banged against the tin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter, for he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honour of his family, preferred to be found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy, aching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a thunderclap just behind him; a hot wind knocked him senseless, and red fire singed his fur. The man had been wakened by the noise, and had fired both barrels of a shot-gun into Nag just behind the hood.|$|E
6000|$|At the {{entrance}} of the two ladies, there rose at once a faint buzz and murmur. Lady Valleys, whose ample presence radiated suddenly a businesslike and cheery confidence, went to a bedside and sat down. But Barbara stood in a thin streak of the July sunlight, uncertain where to begin, amongst the faces turned towards her. The poor dears looked so humble, and so wistful, and so tired. There was one lying quite flat, who had not even raised her head to see who had come in. That slumbering, pale, high cheek-boned face had a frailty as if a touch, a breath, would shatter it; a wisp of the blackest hair, finer than silk, lay across the forehead; the closed eyes were deep sunk; one hand, scarred almost to the bone with work, rested above her breast. She breathed between lips which had no colour. About her, sleeping, was a kind of beauty. And there came over the girl a queer rush of emotion. The sleeper seemed so apart from everything there, from all the formality and stiffness of the ward. To look at her swept away the languid, hollow feeling with which she had come in; it made her think of the tors at home, when the wind was blowing, and all was bare, and grand, and sometimes terrible. There was something elemental in that still sleep. And the old lady in the next led, with a brown wrinkled face and bright black eyes brimful of life, seemed almost vulgar beside such remote tranquillity, while she was telling Barbara that a little bunch of heather in the better half of a <b>soap-dish</b> on the window-sill had come from Wales, because, as she explained: [...] "My mother was born in Stirling, dearie; so I likes a bit of heather, though I never been out o' Bethnal Green meself." ...|$|E
60|$|They were shaved by twenty at a time, {{and while}} one lot was being {{operated}} on, another twenty, who were next destined {{to fill the}} chairs, were kept standing against the wall. The long hair was first cut off with scissors, and then the head and whiskers were closely shaved. The first candidates for the <b>soap-dish</b> were very unruly under the operation, but they only got their ears snipped and their skin chipped, and {{had to return to}} their prisons with their polls all bloody as well as bald. Those who looked on, took a lesson from the folly of their comrades, and most of them remained quiet. The manoeuvres of the men however were very different during the process; some took it with good humour, and endeavoured to laugh as their locks were falling; some sat still as death; others looked fierce and warlike; some were even moved to tears; some fought, and kicked and scratched, and at last had to be corded to their seats. One unfortunate went down upon his knees, and implored Chapeau by the memory of his mistress, if ever he had been in love, by his regard for his wife, if he chanced to be married, not to shave his head. He was engaged to be married, he said, to a young girl at Angers, who had many lovers; she had preferred him for the beauty of his hair: if he returned back bald, he knew that he would be rejected. Chapeau for a time was moved, but the patriot and the royalist triumphed over the man, and Jacques, turning away his face on which a tear was gleaming, with a wave of his hand motioned the young man to the chair.|$|E
6000|$|With the {{assistance}} of Tanis's Bunch, the Doppelbraus, and other companions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks {{when he did not}} return home late and shaky. With his other faculties blurred he yet had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could scarce walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching cars. He came wambling into the house. If Verona and Kenneth Escott were about, he got past them with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their level young glances, and hid himself up-stairs. He found when he came into the warm house that he was hazier than he had believed. His head whirled. He dared not lie down. He tried to soak out the alcohol in a hot bath. For the moment his head was clearer but when he moved about the bathroom his calculations of distance were wrong, so that he dragged down the towels, and knocked over the <b>soap-dish</b> with a clatter which, he feared, would betray him to the children. Chilly in his dressing-gown he tried to read the evening paper. He could follow every word; he seemed to take in the sense of things; but a minute afterward he could not have told what he had been reading. When he went to bed his brain flew in circles, and he hastily sat up, struggling for self-control. At last he was able to lie still, feeling only a little sick and dizzy--and enormously ashamed. To hide his [...] "condition" [...] from his own children! To have danced and shouted with people whom he despised! To have said foolish things, sung idiotic songs, tried to kiss silly girls! Incredulously he remembered that he had by his roaring familiarity with them laid himself open to the patronizing of youths whom he would have kicked out of his office; that by dancing too ardently he had exposed himself to rebukes from the rattiest of withering women. As it came relentlessly back to him he snarled, [...] "I hate myself! God how I hate myself!" [...] But, he raged, [...] "I'm through! No more! Had enough, plenty!" ...|$|E
