Two criteria have been formulated to assign some key resources in <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>system.</b> The process of finding some compromise solutions from Pareto-optimal solutions has been illustrated.

30|$|With {{smartphones}} becoming everyday items, {{the concept}} of crowd sourcing information from users of mobile application has significantly gained traction [8]. Roitman et al. [9] presents a <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>system</b> where the crowd can send eye witness reports thereby creating deeper insights for city officials. Szabo et al. [10] takes this approach one step further and employs the sensors built into smartphones for gathering data for city services such as live transit information. Ghose et al. [11] utilizes the same principle for gathering information on road conditions. Pan et al. [12] uses a combination of crowd sourcing and social media analysis for identifying traffic anomalies.|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} aspect of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>system</b> networking is management of the thousands or even millions of devices {{that are involved in}} many applications. For example, to achieve energy management in smart buildings thousands of sensor and actor devices can be deployed in each building. Efficient protocols are needed to provide effective management of fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) aspects of these devices. The Light-weight machine-to-machine (LWM 2 M) [31] standard is being done by the Open Mobile Alliance to specify the interface between M 2 M devices and servers. On the other hand, the NETCONF Light protocol [32] is designed by IETF to provide mechanisms to install, manipulate and delete the configuration of network devices. Similar efforts are encouraged for smart city systems in order to offer standard mechanisms and services to efficiently manage and control the communication of devices at the various levels of the architecture.|$|E

Hence, devising a fault tolerant mechanism is very important because of construction and deployment characteristics of these smart low powered sensing devices. In this paper, we propose a fault detection and error correction scheme based on redundant residue arithmetic, which provides a low complexity, delay tolerant and energy-efficient data transmission solution.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> <b>system</b> needs reliable and smoothly operating electronic equipment. The study is aimed at developing a nondestructive testing method for electronic equipment and its components. This method {{can be used to}} identify critical design defects of printed circuit boards (PCB) and to predict their service life, taking into account the nature of probable operating loads. The study uses an acoustic emission method to identify and localize critical design defects of printed circuit boards. Geometric dimensions of detected critical defects can be determined by the X-ray tomography method. Based on the results of the study, a method combining acoustic emission and X-ray tomography was developed for nondestructive testing of printed circuit boards.

40|$|Smart City ” is a {{powerful}} paradigm that applies the most advanced communication technologies to urban environments, with the final aim of enhancing {{the quality of life}} in cities and provide a wide set of value-added services to both citizens and administration. A fundamental step towards the practical realization of the Smart City concept consists in the development of a communication infrastructure capable of collecting data from a large variety of different devices in a mostly uniform and seamless manner, according to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. While the scientific and commercial interest in IoT has been constantly growing in the last years, practical experimentation of IoT systems has just begun. In this paper, we present and discuss the Padova <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> <b>system,</b> an experimental realization of an urban IoT system designed within the Smart City framework and deployed in the city of Padova, Italy. We describe the system architecture and discuss the fundamental technical choices at the base of the project.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} have increasingly become contributors of very {{large amounts of}} data. The recent deployment of wireless sensor networks in Smart City infrastructures have led to very large amounts of data being generated each day {{across a variety of}} domains, with applications including environmental monitoring, healthcare monitoring and transport monitoring. The information generated through the wireless sensor nodes has made possible the visualization of a Smart City environment for better living. The Smart City offers intelligent infrastructure and cogitative environment for the elderly and other people living in the Smart society. Different types of sensors are present that help in monitoring inhabitants ’ behaviour and their interaction with real world objects. To take advantage of the increasing amounts of data, {{there is a need for}} new methods and techniques for effective data management and analysis, to generate information that can assist in managing the resources intelligently and dynamically. Through this research a Smart City ontology model is proposed, which addresses the fusion process related to uncertain sensor data using semantic web technologies and Dempster-Shafer uncertainty theory. Based on the information handling methods, such as Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), an equally weighted sum operator and maximization operation, a higher level of contextual information is inferred from the low-level sensor data fusion process.

40|$|Spatial Information Infrastructure (SDI) {{has great}} {{potential}} to support smart city by providing framework dataset and real-time information services in urban informational infrastructure, the social infrastructure and citizen's participation practices. Bandung City and Jakarta City are maintaining their SDI for {{various kinds of}} decision-making at different domain within their jurisdiction. In smart cities, {{it is crucial to}} have a data management systems which allow more stakeholders to participate in collecting, updating, maintaining, evaluating and utilizing urban information. A smart city should open their data to its citizen following Open Government Data (OGD) principles through SDI. As a member of Open Government Partnership, Indonesia is in the beginning phase of extending its SDI systems not only to serve government entities but also to citizens, academia, and private sectors. In reality, smart cities cannot rely on government entities only in producing spatial information. Heterogeneity of spatial information quality produced by citizens, academia, and private sectors create some difficulties in urban data management. However, most of the smart cities in Indonesia, namely Bandung City and Jakarta City, have not yet connected their SDI to their <b>Smart</b> <b>City</b> <b>system</b> due uncoordinated policies and technical limitation. Specification of Multi-domain Master Spatial Information Management (MSIM) will be the key factor for improving SDI in Indonesian Smart Cities to able to accommodate citizens, academia, and private sectors to enrich urban information.

40|$|Structured Abstract Purpose – In {{this paper}} we will {{investigate}} different organizational models and roles delivered by actors in smart city systems. A smart city strategy aims at using technology {{to increase the}} quality of life in urban space, both improving the environmental quality and delivering better services to the citizens. Our case study analysis referring to smart city platforms takes place within a research project (Orchestra - ORganization of Cultural HEritage for Smart Tourism and Real-time Accessibility) meant to develop a set of technological and organizational solutions to foster the smart, sustainable and ecologically compatible exploitation of cultural heritage and touristic resources in the city of Napoli. Design/methodology/approach – Our research was based on a qualitative investigation. In particular we analyze a set of international cases analyzed during a research project funded by the Italian Ministry for University and Research. The selected cases are representatives of different governance structures, technologies adopted and phases of maturity in the development of integrated smart city applications. The collection of empirical data was carried out using a heterogeneous plurality of instruments. The methods include: document analysis, semi-structured interviews and participant observations. Fieldwork was carried out between September 2012 and early July 2013. Originality/value –This research present a preliminary view of a smart city developments. Analyzing different cases from Europe, USA and Asia we recognize common features and different characteristics in cities’ smart planning and development. The paper presents a first attempt to study different stages of maturity in the development of a <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>system.</b> Practical implications – First, from the analyses carried out, it would seem that models for development of integrated systems for smart city tourism-mobility are still under developed. Moreover, in many cases, ”archipelago" logic of specialization seems to prevail, with the proliferation of separate and distinct applications for application domains rather than aiming towards integration. The development of inter-organisational relationships with service and technology providers by local public transport companies has proved much easier, as there is a strong incumbent operator with consolidated experience as a catalyst for innovation...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} for <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> {{to be able to}} accommodate new devices without appreciable loss in the quality of the provided services and associated network traffic flows. This can be accomplished through virtualization and extensibility in the platforms and their operations. An extensible IoT architecture was proposed in [33], which consists of three layers: Virtual object, Composite virtual object, and Service layer. The design must have objectives of automation, intelligence, and zero-configuration for objects and related devices in order to achieve scalability and interoperability. More research is desirable in order to extend this strategy to <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
30|$|These <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> {{services}} do {{not only}} need the various advanced technologies discussed here, but also need reliable and robust {{networking and communication}} infrastructures to enable efficient exchange of messages among the different components of the systems that provide a particular service. <b>Smart</b> <b>city</b> services are designed at different scales, which require various networking and communication technologies for their implementation and operations. Furthermore, different network and communication models and approaches can be utilized for <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> services. This paper investigates the communication and network issues of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b> It also investigates networking technologies, architectures, and communication requirements for such systems. The suitability of existing network protocols for different <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> services will be discussed. Although there are significant research efforts to investigate different issues in <b>smart</b> <b>cities</b> and provide solutions for these issues, very {{little research has been}} done to investigate the networking and communication parts of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems,</b> which constitute the main objective of this paper.|$|R
30|$|Software and {{hardware}} availability are essential components of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> {{due to the}} criticality and real-time nature {{of a lot of}} the related applications. Software availability can be achieved by ensuring that the various services are available to the corresponding applications. On the other hand, hardware availability is obtained by ensuring that the various devices that are needed to provide networking contestability and efficient performance are readily available anytime and anywhere. One way to accomplish these objectives is through redundancy of both software {{and hardware}} components and systems. This was already considered and studied for IoT devices [29, 30]. Furthermore, considerations to attain availability need to be incorporated as a part of the design objectives of networking and communication protocols for <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Innovation in <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> {{is based}} on the {{principle}} that devices, places and everyday things can each be enabled to serve people in a real-time and responsive manner. This chapter presents a novel approach to the design of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> that takes into account not only technical installations in a future Internet of Things environment, but also the power of human storytelling in an always-on networked world. It is only when environments are both sensor-driven and socially-aware that a more holistic, and therefore more useful, urban narrative can emerge in the future Internet context. The present chapter proposes a new narrative-aware design framework and applies it to a hypothetical city scenario in order to highlight its main components and the benefits it may offer to a future Internet city's actors...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} natural {{disasters}} is growing. A {{considerable number of}} them derives directly from climate changes and generates a deep impact on cultural heritages. As a result, the need for solutions {{able to cope with}} uncertain weather conditions and increased natural disasters is getting urgent. STORM is a European Research and Innovation Action co-funded in the H 2020 framework that is aimed at creating intelligent tools which will gather data from libraries, sensors and crowd-sensing techniques in order to enable cultural heritage stakeholders (e. g., the organisations which have to manage the sites) to implement the most appropriate actions in the prevention, response and recovery phases of emergencies which could impact on cultural heritages. More specifically, the project aims at addressing those risks deriving from climate change, which in the near future is going to worsen most of the present hazards, as flash floods, heat waves and forest fires. As such, the approach adopted by the project is particularly fit for the purpose of being integrated with <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> which are increasingly growing in number and variety. Even if safety issues are not considered central in the overall concept of <b>smart</b> <b>city,</b> it’s plain that the huge quantity of data that can be gathered and processed in any future STORM-like urban cultural heritage compound should feed into the available <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b> On the other way round, the mass of data produced or processed by <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> have the potential to impact dramatically on emergency management and prevention activities to be implemented by cultural heritage stakeholders.

40|$|Sensing {{technology}} is a key enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) and could produce huge volume data to contribute the Big Data paradigm.

30|$|Huge {{amounts of}} data is {{collected}} by <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> and the corresponding IoT devices that are spread out over a considerably larger geographic area. Analyzing and extracting useful information from this data can provide considerable advantages for businesses and government institutions. In addition, communication and collection {{of a very large}} number of messages in a timely fashion according to their priority, delay-tolerance, and size is vital to the efficient operation of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to reduce the amount of exchanged traffic, local processing, compression, and aggregation of the generated messages need to be done at the lower and intermediate levels of the node hierarchy and geographic areas. Consequently, More research is needed to provide proper convergence and mapping of the networking parameters between the various layers of the networking stack at the data-generating nodes (e.g. sensors, IoT devices, etc.), the intermediate routers, processing servers (typically in the cloud), and actor nodes at the other end of the communication cycle.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{mobility}} {{is another}} important characteristic of <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> applications. The table shows that some systems have low or medium mobility such as smart grid, gas and oil pipeline monitoring, and smart water networks. Other systems have high mobility such as intelligent transportation, and UAVs. Consequently, the networking protocols {{that are used to}} connect medium to high mobility <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> must be robust and adapt well to node mobility without consuming too much bandwidth on control messages and related processing to readjust to changes in the network topology.|$|R
30|$|Most <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> include {{networking}} protocols, which {{connect the}} various components within the system. Examples of such systems include include smart buildings, and intelligent transportation. In such cases, these protocols {{must be able}} to co-exist without interfering with each other. In addition, appropriate mapping of the various control information inside the headers at the various layers of the networking stack of the different heterogeneous protocols and networks must be done to ensure seamless and efficient operation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the issues of}} policy and trust {{in the context of}} IT infrastructures for <b>Smart</b> <b>Cities.</b> This paper proposes that trusted <b>Smart</b> <b>city</b> policies can lead {{to the development of a}} set of trusted foundational services underlying all <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> solutions. Such services are critical to ensure that the architectural choices used to drive efficient integration among data and service consumers and providers to use within <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> domains, and will lead to the development of a marketplace where service providers and consumers engage in a free and fully informed exchange to choose worthy and reliable experiences addressing everything from reporting street light outages to identifying economic advantages during city planning. It argues that two usually mutually exclusive architectural meta-models; Centralization and Federation, are both required to achieve a robust set of trusted foundational services. It reviews a scale of options for implementing the marketplace component of the foundational services to support a matrix of consuming scenarios from fully isolated well known analytics to the anonymous access that allows potential users to browse for services without any controls before requesting access. It concludes that Trusted Policies are highly important as successful ingredients in the development of foundational services during the developmental stage and in the operations and maintenance stages for integrated <b>Smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b> It is critical that <b>Smart</b> <b>cities</b> <b>systems</b> implement city-wide policies and similarly policy driven marketplaces that improve and sustain trust and in turn help <b>Smart</b> <b>cities</b> manage the multitude of systems that are continuously both developmental and operational, and will be so for many decades to come...|$|R
30|$|Performance {{is always}} an {{important}} consideration for any type of architecture, and {{this is also the}} case for <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to achieve this essential objective, more evaluation needs to be done for the various networking protocols at the various layers of the architecture, especially at the data link, network and transport layers. These three layers are critical components in order to support traffic of various QoS requirements. In addition, the middleware layer can be used to provide proper interface and convergence services between these layers and the application layer.|$|R

40|$|The most {{representative}} form of Cyber-physical systems (CPS) involves {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) as {{the main}} means to interact with physical entities. This chapter reviews a number of such WSN-CPS applications and reveals how these applications {{bridge the gap between}} sensing information in the cyber world and diverse entities in the physical world. We divide these applications into five categories: smart space systems, health-care systems, emergency response systems, human activity inference and <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Smart</b> space systems monitor energy usage, temperature, and various other attributes of appliances in an indoor space. Health-care systems assist people to improve physical and emotional well-being through automatic sensing and sense-making technologies. Emergency response systems search and rescue people as soon as possible in emergency situations such as fire outbreaks. Human activity inference systems interpret human intention behind sensing information to facilitate human daily activities related to social events, road safety, mood detection, interactive games etc. <b>Smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> concentrate on <b>city</b> dymanics such as urban environmental monitoring, human mobility, and transport information. Our discussion in this chapter is steered from simple to complex systems in terms of networking technologies, service ranges, system integration, and human engagement.

30|$|In addition, <b>smart</b> <b>city</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be used}} {{to protect}} water {{networks}} and to make them smarter, more efficient, more reliable, and more sustainable. CPS systems can be embedded within water networks to provide some monitoring and control mechanisms and to add smart features to the operations of water distribution [24]. One of these functions is to provide early warning mechanisms to identify problems in water networks. For examples, leaks and pipe bursts can be easily detected while fast and temporary solutions can be applied to reduce water waste and to minimize further risks or damages to the network.|$|R
