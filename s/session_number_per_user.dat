40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the vulnerability to eavesdropping on-off-keying based OCDMA scheme, a new multi-code keying reconfiguration is presented to enhance confidentiality over two dimensional time-spreading and wavelength-hopping (2 D TS/WH) optical {{code division multiple access}} (OCDMA) schemes. The time-shifted carrier-hopping prime codes (CHPCs) are proposed and assigned as signature address code. This proposed scheme provides the integration of electronic and optical layer domain, which inherently comes from the data encryption and spectrum-spreading of the transmitted signals, and then achieves data-confidential enhancement in synchronous networks. Moreover, multi-code keying reconfiguration in a set of distinct codeword is assigned to individual user and random selection by using thin film filter, tunable delay line and optical switch. Here, the probability of interception performance in terms of various multi-code key <b>numbers</b> <b>per</b> <b>user</b> is analyzed. The result shows that the confidentiality is enhanced to combat against eavesdropping while signature address code <b>number</b> <b>per</b> <b>user</b> is increased in proposed multi-code key reconfiguration scheme...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cloud Computing is one {{the famous}} {{technology}} {{that are used}} today. It provides on-demand access through internet to computing different services. Privacy and Security are big issues in Cloud Computing. The cloud environment is a large open distributed system. It is important to preserve the data, as well as, privacy of users. Access Control methods in Cloud Computing ensure that only authorized the user to access system and data that helps to increase the security in the Cloud. Nowadays researchers devoted their work access control method to enhance the security on Cloud. Various access control models are in use, including the most common Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and Role Based. Access Control (RBAC). This paper proposes the security enhancement in Role Based Access Model using Reference Ontology to restricts the <b>number</b> of <b>user</b> <b>per</b> role, <b>number</b> of transaction <b>per</b> <b>user</b> and adds the feature of backup and restoration.

40|$|Abstract. Affiliation-Hiding Authentication (AHA) {{protocols}} {{have the}} seemingly contradictory property of enabling users to authenticate {{each other as}} members of certain groups, without revealing their affiliation to group outsiders. Of particular interest in practice is the group-discovering variant, which handles multiple group memberships <b>per</b> <b>user.</b> Corresponding solutions were only recently introduced, and have two major drawbacks: high bandwidth consumption (typically several kilobits <b>per</b> <b>user</b> and affiliation), and only moderate performance in scenarios of practical application. While prior protocols have O(n 2) time complexity, where n denotes the <b>number</b> of affiliations <b>per</b> <b>user,</b> we introduce a new AHA protocol running in O(n log n) time. In addition, the bandwidth consumed is considerably reduced. We consider these advances a major step towards deployment of privacy-preserving methods in constraint devices, like mobile phones, to which the economization of these resources is priceless. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{millimeter}} wave bands {{emerging as}} a strong candidate for 5 G cellular networks, next-generation systems {{may be in a}} unique position where spectrum is plentiful. To assess the potential value of this spectrum, this paper derives scaling laws on the per mobile downlink feasible rate with large bandwidth and number of nodes, for both Infrastructure Single Hop (ISH) and Infrastructure Multi-Hop (IMH) architectures. It is shown that, for both cases, there exist critical bandwidth scalings above which increasing the bandwidth no longer increases the feasible rate per node. These critical thresholds coincide exactly with the bandwidths where, for each architecture, the network transitions from being degrees-of-freedom-limited to power-limited. For ISH, this critical bandwidth threshold is lower than IMH when the <b>number</b> of <b>users</b> <b>per</b> base station grows with network size. This result suggests that multi-hop transmissions may be necessary to fully exploit large bandwidth degrees of freedom in deployments with growing <b>number</b> of <b>users</b> <b>per</b> cell.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a K-cell multiple access channel with inter-symbol interference. The primary finding {{of this paper}} is that, without instantaneous channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT), the sum degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the considered channel is β - 1 /βK with β≥ 2 when the <b>number</b> of <b>users</b> <b>per</b> cell is sufficiently large, where β is the ratio of the maximum channel-impulse-response (CIR) length of desired links to that of interfering links in each cell. Our finding implies that even without instantaneous CSIT, interference-free DoF per cell is achievable as β approaches infinity with a sufficiently large <b>number</b> of <b>users</b> <b>per</b> cell. This achievability is shown by a blind interference management method that exploits the relativity in delay spreads between desired and interfering links. In this method, all inter-cell-interference signals are aligned to the same direction by using a discrete-Fourier-transform-based precoding with cyclic prefix that only depends on the number of CIR taps. Using this method, we also characterize the achievable sum rate of the considered channel, in a closed-form expression. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communication...|$|R
