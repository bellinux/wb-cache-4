40|$|The International Partnership for Ice Core Sciences (IPICS) {{identified}} the retrieve of an "Oldest-Ice" ice core {{as one of}} the most important scientific challenges in ice core research for the near future. As the outcome of an "Oldest-Ice" workshop a general approach was recently suggested how to combine geophysical reconnaissance, numerical ice-flow modelling and <b>sample</b> <b>drilling</b> to identify the most promising sites where about 1. 5 Ma old ice could most likely be found (Fischer et al., CP, 2013). The most critical unknown parameter is the geothermal heat flow underneath the ice, followed by bed topography and integrity of internal layering. Here, we propose the combined application of geophysical methods in conjunction with existing ice-core data to improve the knowledge on physical properties of the ice and the underlaying strata. It builds on (i) conventional application of potential field geophysics (gravimetry and magnetics) to estimate subglacial geology; (ii) radar internal architecture to determine layer integrity and bedrock topography; (iii) combination of ice-core profiles with radar to determine the origin - and thus confirm isochronity and age - of internal radar layers, complemented by layer attributes; (iv) extrapolation of ice-core impurities and the related attenuation of radar waves in space along internal layers; and (v) radar and seismic wave attenuation analyses to determine the englacial temperature distribution. This approach has the potential to improve our capabilities to estimate the spatial variation of geothermal heat flux and provide spatially distributed age-depth constraints for ice-flow models...|$|E
40|$|The key to {{understanding}} the history of planetary and asteroidal bodies is the accurate and precise determination of the timescale over which they developed. Absolute dating of planetary materials remains a primary goal of planetary research. Given the success of recent unmanned missions to Mars (e. g., Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity) in understanding geological processes, development of an in situ numerical dating instrument packages for future robotic missions is a logical next step. Several ongoing programs of research are seeking to develop instrument packages for in situ application of the K-Ar technique (e. g., [1, 2]). For terrestrial rocks, the K-Ar method has largely {{been replaced by the}} 40 Ar/ 39 Ar technique, which can determine thermal histories and provide internal reliability assurance. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method is the most promising geochronometer for obtaining accurate ages and thermal histories for rocks on the Martian surface but relies on the 39 K(n,p) 39 Ar reaction so that 39 Ar can be measured as a proxy for the parent element K. As the mass and power requirements of a nuclear reactor are not compatible with spaceflight, an alternative neutron source must be employed. Here, we examine the potential of 252 Cf, which generates neutrons through its decay by spontaneous fission. We will present initial results from neutron modeling and technological considerations towards the development of an in situ dating package, including a 252 Cf neutron source, a subcritical 235 U neutron multiplier, quadrupole noble gas mass spectrometry, and <b>sample</b> <b>drilling</b> and handling strategies...|$|E

40|$|In {{the years}} 2011 – 2013 the ESA mission Rosetta will explore the short period comet 46 P/Wirtanen. The {{aims of the}} mission include {{investigation}} of the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the cometary nucleus and also the evolutionary processes of comets. It is planned to land a small probe {{on the surface of the}} comet, carrying a multitude of sensors devoted to in situ investigation of the material at the landing site. On touchdown at the nucleus, an anchoring harpoon will be fired into the surface to avoid a rebound of the lander and to supply a reaction force against mechanical operations such as <b>sample</b> <b>drilling</b> or instrument platform motion. The anchor should also prevent an ejection of the lander due to gas drag from sublimating volatiles when the comet becomes more active closer to the Sun. In this paper, we report on the development of one of the sensors of the MUPUS instrument aboard the Rosetta Lander, the MUPUS ANC-M (mechanical properties) sensor. Its purpose is to measure the deceleration of the anchor harpoon during penetration into the cometary soil. First the test facilities at the Max-Planck-Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, are briefly described. Subsequently, we analyse several accelerometer signals obtained from test shots into various target materials. A procedure for signal reduction is described and possible errors that may be superimposed on the true acceleration or deceleration of the anchor are discussed in depth, with emphasis on the occurrence of zero line offsets in the signals. Finally, the influence of high-frequency resonant oscillations of the anchor body on the signals is discussed and difficulties faced when trying to derive grain sizes of granular target materials are considered. It is concluded that with the sampling rates used in this and several other space experiments currently under way or under development a reasonable resolution of strength distribution in soil layers can be achieved, but conclusions concerning grain size distribution would probably demand much higher sampling rates. ...|$|E
