5|$|However it was {{not until}} the Wujing Zongyao that the exact {{chemical}} formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed. The Wujing Zongyao contains three formulas for gunpowder: one for an explosive bomb launched from a trebuchet, another for a similar bomb with hooks attached so that it could latch on to any wooden structure and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly {{to win in the}} upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended {{the house and}} the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out {{until the end of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 2015, amid {{a wave of}} {{violence}} between Palestinians and Israelis, dozens of Palestinians overran the tomb {{and a group of}} them <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire with petrol bombs. Palestinian security forces dispersed them and extinguished the flames; and although the tomb itself was not apparently damaged, the women's section was reported to be heavily damaged. Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene. According to a Palestinian official, the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the Israeli Army, but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb.|$|E
5|$|When Leakey {{took the}} position, the {{organization}} had 12 tons of confiscated illegal ivory in its possession, {{which he was}} urged to sell in order to fund conservation efforts. Instead, he piled all of it together and, with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire. Ivory does not easily burn, but the choice to use fire rather than other means to destroy it was intentional as Leakey wanted the event to produce powerful images for the global media. To make the destruction spectacular, Leakey worked with a Hollywood special effects professional to devise an innovative pyrotechnics technique using jet fuel and flammable glue.|$|E

5|$|A {{year later}} Francisco de Castellanos {{set out from}} Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now {{relocated}} to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition recruited further forces on the march north to the Cuchumatanes. On the steep southern slopes they clashed with between four and five thousand Ixil warriors; a lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry outflanked the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish besieged the city, and their indigenous allies penetrated the stronghold and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire. This allowed the Spanish to break the defences. The victorious Spanish branded surviving warriors as slaves. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them. The Spanish continued east towards Uspantán to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cunén, Sacapulas and Verapaz. Although heavily outnumbered, the Spanish cavalry and firearms decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspantán and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 {{marked the end of}} the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.|$|E
5|$|British {{reinforcement}} entered Basque Roads at 15:20, just as {{the crew}} of Calcutta abandoned the ship, withdrawing across the shoal. Forming a line of battle, the British opened a heavy fire on the nearby, and still grounded, Ville de Varsouvie while Beagle, armed with heavy carronades, nosed close inshore and took up station across the bow of Aquilon and raked the French ship repeatedly. For two hours these immobile French ships were battered by the British line with little reply, until at 17:30 both raised Union flags as an indication that they had surrendered. Shortly afterwards {{the crew of the}} wrecked Tonnere abandoned their ship and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire. The French ship was destroyed by a magazine explosion at 19:30, followed at 20:30 by Calcutta, which had been mistakenly set on fire by an over-enthusiastic British boarding party. The storeship was carrying a large quantity of munitions, reportedly worth over half a million pounds in value, and produced an enormous explosion. Most of the British ships had suffered only minor damage and casualties from fire from the gun batteries on Île-d'Aix, where Revenge had temporarily grounded during the night and suffered 18 casualties. The French losses were minor except on Ville de Varsouvie, which had taken about 100 casualties in the exchange.|$|E

Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.|$|E

5|$|On 14 May 1940, Lützow {{claimed his}} first two aerial {{victories}} of World War II. Flying out of Hargimont, his flight was tasked with providing fighter cover in the area northwest of Dinant. At 8:00pm, the flight encountered 15 to 20 Armée de l'Air (French Air Force) Curtiss P-36 Hawk fighter aircraft. Without loss, I. Gruppe claimed seven Curtisses shot down, including two claimed by Lützow. The next day, he claimed another P-36 southeast of Charleroi, his third victory of the war. On 19 May in combat north of Arras, he claimed a Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft. Lützow claimed his fifth and sixth victory {{of the war on}} 31 May 1940, shooting down two Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighter aircraft south of Amiens. This was followed by another P-36 on 3 June. On 6 June, he claimed a Bristol Blenheim light bomber followed by another Blenheim shot down on 8 June. This latter Blenheim was shot down when Lützow was returning from a Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber escort mission. The Blenheim IV was flying alone unescorted and Lützow <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire. The bomber exploded in midair near Abbeville.|$|E
5|$|The {{sight of}} the burning wrecks in the night once again spread panic {{throughout}} the French fleet, the grounded ships opening a heavy fire on the scuttled ships in the assumption that they were fireships. Captain Lacaille of Tourville was so unnerved that he immediately ordered his crew to abandon ship and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire. The evacuation was so hasty however that the fires did not spread effectively, and the following morning the ship was found to still be intact, the crew returning to their prematurely abandoned vessel. There {{they found that the}} ship's quartermaster Eugéne-Joseph-Romain Bourgeois had remained aboard, unconvinced by Lacaille's order, and had single-handedly driven off an attempt by a British boat to board and capture the ship. During the night about 30 sailors had joined him, keeping Touville in French hands until dawn came {{and the rest of the}} crew returned.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Francisco de Castellanos {{set out from}} Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now {{relocated}} to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition against the Ixil and Uspantek, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition rested at Chichicastenango and recruited further forces before marching seven leagues northwards to Sacapulas and climbed the steep southern slopes of the Cuchumatanes. On the upper slopes they clashed with a force of between four and five thousand Ixil warriors from Nebaj and nearby settlements. A lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry managed to outflank the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish force besieged the city, and their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the Spanish to storm the entrance and break the defences. The victorious Spanish rounded up the surviving defenders {{and the next day}} Castellanos ordered them all to be branded as slaves as punishment for their resistance. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them. The Spanish continued east towards Uspantán to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cunén, Sacapulas and Verapaz. The Spaniards were barely able to organise a defence before the defending army attacked. Although heavily outnumbered, the deployment of Spanish cavalry and the firearms of the Spanish infantry eventually decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspantán and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.|$|E
