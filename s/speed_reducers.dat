40|$|Gears with {{involute}} profile {{have been used}} broadly as power transmission mechanisms. High speed reduction ratios can be obtained with trains of gears, resulting in high power losses due to friction. Compound planetary gears allow obtaining high speed reduction ratios with a lower number of gears involved in the power transmission, hence transmitting it with higher efficiency. Although high efficiency is a main requisite for <b>speed</b> <b>reducers,</b> for some applications it may be desirable to have an irreversible mechanism. A modern trend in power transmission systems is to use cycloidal profile gears. These systems present low backlash, high load capability and higher efficiency due to the rolling motion. Furthermore, their large transmission ratio in single stage allows more compact designs. The present paper deals {{with the development of}} a simplified model for the calculation of efficiency of cycloidal <b>speed</b> <b>reducers.</b> The followed approach takes into account the main parameters influencing the efficiency, in particular, the friction and the geometrical properties of the components.

40|$|Planetary <b>speed</b> <b>reducers</b> {{are applied}} {{in a wide}} range of applications. Their main {{advantages}} are the compact design and high power density. For this reason, the demand for high effi ciency gearboxes is continuously increasing and this is also why models to predict the additional churning loss, characteris-tic of this kind of gearing, are required. The particular confi guration of the planetary <b>speed</b> <b>reducers,</b> in fact, entails an additional motion with a circular path around the gearbox axis of the planetary gears due to the rotation of the planet carrier on which they are mounted and this induces an additional source of loss. Having effi ciency prediction models allows, in fact, comparison of different solutions during the design step. Literature provides some prediction models for ordinary gears but no models are still avail-able for planetary gears. This report introduces a computational and experimental analysis of this kind of loss. Many simulations have been performed and the infl uence of many operating conditions like lubricant level and temperature and the rotational speed of the planet carrier have been studied. More-over, the results of an experimental testing campaign on a specially designed gearbox are presented and compared with the computational ones to validate the model.

30|$|The {{small-scale}} CAES has {{a relatively}} lower power output, {{leading to a}} lower air flow. Therefore, the impeller is relatively smaller and the rotation rate of the turbine is higher. Meanwhile, the expansion of turbine will be greater due to the demand of increasing the energy storage capacity per gas storage volume unit, causing {{the decline in the}} specific enthalpy-drop ratio of the air. In this case, the linear velocity of wheel circumference of the impeller rises, indicating the increase in the rotation rate of the turbine.

Principles of the design for manufacturability are applied to Speed-o-Cam and a unified method for obtaining the optimum parameters satisfying the curvature constraints and pressure-angle bounds is developed.

Cam-mechanism balancing is also studied because unbalance in a high-speed rotating element can cause severe vibrations and greatly affect the bearings and hence, the performance of the machine.
