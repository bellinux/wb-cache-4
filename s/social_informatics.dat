The fundamentals of <b>social</b> <b>informatics</b> in the USA were laid by Kling in 1996 with his colleagues and students from Indiana University.

There are several approaches, which were historically named or classified as social informatics: American, Russian, British, Norwegian, Slovenian, German and Japanese.

40|$|We {{construct}} a two species evolutionary game model of an online society consisting of ordinary users and behavior enforcers (moderators). Among themselves, moderators play a coordination game choosing between being "positive" or "negative" (or harsh) while ordinary users play prisoner's dilemma. When interacting, moderators motivate good behavior (cooperation) among the users through punitive actions while the moderators themselves are encouraged or discouraged in their strategic choice by these interactions. We show the following results: (i) We {{show that the}} ω-limit set of the proposed system is sensitive both {{to the degree of}} punishment and the proportion of moderators in closed form. (ii) We demonstrate that the basin of attraction for the Pareto optimal strategy (Cooperate,Positive) can be computed exactly. (iii) We demonstrate that for certain initial conditions the system is self-regulating. These results partially explain the stability of many online users communities such as Reddit. We illustrate our results with examples from this online system. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to 2012 ASE Conference on <b>Social</b> <b>Informatic...</b>|$|R

40|$|Polarization in American {{politics}} {{has been extensively}} documented and analyzed for decades, and the phenomenon became all the more apparent during the 2016 presidential election, where Trump and Clinton depicted two radically different pictures of America. Inspired by this gaping polarization and the extensive utilization of Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign, {{in this paper we}} take the first step in measuring polarization in social media and we attempt to predict individuals' Twitter following behavior through analyzing ones' everyday tweets, profile images and posted pictures. As such, we treat polarization as a classification problem and study to what extent Trump followers and Clinton followers on Twitter can be distinguished, which in turn serves as a metric of polarization in general. We apply LSTM to processing tweet features and we extract visual features using the VGG neural network. Integrating these two sets of features boosts the overall performance. We are able to achieve an accuracy of 69 %, suggesting that the high degree of polarization recorded in the literature has started to manifest itself in social media as well.

40|$|Handheld {{computers}} {{will become an}} increasingly compelling choice of technology for K- 12 classrooms because they will enable a transition from occasional, supplemental use to frequent, integral use [1, 2]. Early evaluations suggest teachers and students respond to handhelds favorably [3]. At the same time, these devices will become communication enabled, through wireless technologies such as infrared beaming or radio-based local area networks. The clarity {{with which we can}} see the potential has led some to declare that the revolution has arrived and that by rapidly moving to this new technological platform, innovators could achieve large scale impact on learning. Perhaps. But perhaps not. Every new generation of learning technology brings with it a new deep conceptual issue that learning technologists must entangle in order to unlock the learning value of raw technological potential [4]. The field of computer supported collaborative learning has already successfully tackled two key issues, control and representation [5]. This current research base, however, is insufficient to unlock the value of wireless internet learning devices (WILDs). A third issue, hinted at but not fully explored in prior work [6], now must become our central focus of attention. The issue {{is the nature of the}} coupling between <b>social</b> and <b>informatic</b> worlds, and within the <b>social</b> and <b>informatic</b> worlds [4]. ([URL]...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{a lot of}} {{progress}} has been made in rumor modeling and rumor detection for micro-blogging streams. However, existing automated methods do not perform very well for early rumor detection, which is crucial in many settings, e. g., in crisis situations. One reason for this is that aggregated rumor features such as propagation features, which work well on the long run, are - due to their accumulating characteristic - not very helpful in the early phase of a rumor. In this work, we present an approach for early rumor detection, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks for learning the hidden representations of individual rumor-related tweets to gain insights on the credibility of each tweets. We then aggregate the predictions from the very beginning of a rumor to obtain the overall event credits (so-called wisdom), and finally combine it with a time series based rumor classification model. Our extensive experiments show a clearly improved classification performance within the critical very first hours of a rumor. For a better understanding, we also conduct an extensive feature evaluation that emphasized on the early stage and shows that the low-level credibility has best predictability at all phases of the rumor lifetime.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{historical and}} literary documents in Chinese to gain insights into research issues, and overview our studies which utilized four different sources of text materials in this paper. We investigated {{the history of}} concepts and transliterated words in China with the Database for the Study of Modern China Thought and Literature, which contains historical documents about China between 1830 and 1930. We also attempted to disambiguate names that were shared by multiple government officers who served between 618 and 1912 and were recorded in Chinese local gazetteers. To showcase the potentials and challenges of computer-assisted analysis of Chinese literatures, we explored some interesting yet non-trivial questions about two of the Four Great Classical Novels of China: (1) Which monsters attempted to consume the Buddhist monk Xuanzang in the Journey to the West (JTTW), {{which was published in}} the 16 th century, (2) Which was the most powerful monster in JTTW, and (3) Which major role smiled the most in the Dream of the Red Chamber, which was published in the 18 th century.
