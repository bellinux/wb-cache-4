The cross-border terminal was completed in December 2015. The project had an initial estimated cost of $78 million US dollars and a final completion cost of $120 million US dollars, funded by Mexican and U.S. private investors and Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico. Building E of Tijuana's Terminal 1 was retrofitted to support the new bridge structure on the Mexican side. During the construction phase, a temporary border waiver between the U.S. and Mexico had to be issued by mutual legislation to allow U.S. construction cranes and U.S. fabricated steel bridge <b>structural</b> <b>sections</b> to cross the U.S.-Mexico boundary and be set over the six-lane Mexican Federal Highway 2.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{concrete}} filling offers a practical alternative for achieving the required fire resistance in steel hollow <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> columns. However, the current prescriptive-based approach which evaluates fire resistance based on standard fire exposure {{does not account}} for realistic fire scenarios in the design {{of concrete}}-filled hollow <b>structural</b> <b>section</b> (CFHSS) columns. This article presents a methodology for evaluating the fire resistance of CFHSS columns under design fire scenarios without the need for costly computational models. The proposed approach is a derivative of the equal area concept, and evaluates the equivalent fire resistance of the column by comparing the time temperature curve of the standard fire exposure with that of the design fire exposure. The method has been validated against the results generated from finite element analysis (coupled heat transfer and strength analysis) on numerous CFHSS columns under a large number of design fires. The applicability of the approach in design situations is illustrated through a numerical example, and it is concluded that the proposed approach offers an attractive alternative for deriving equivalent fire resistance of CFHSS columns exposed to design fire scenarios.
