50|$|The IUE was {{designed}} to have a minimum lifetime of three years, and carried consumable sufficient for a five-year mission. However, it lasted far longer than its design called for. Occasional hardware failures caused difficulties, but innovative techniques were devised to overcome them. For example, the spacecraft was equipped with six gyros to stabilise the spacecraft. Successive failures of these in 1979, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1996 ultimately left the spacecraft with a single functional gyro. Telescope control was maintained with two gyros by using the telescope's <b>Sun</b> <b>sensor</b> to determine the spacecraft's attitude, and stabilisation in three axes proved possible even after the fifth failure, by using the <b>Sun</b> <b>sensor,</b> the Fine Error Sensors and the single remaining gyro.

40|$|Abstract: {{this paper}} {{describes}} the attitude determination and control system for a nanosatellite (30 kg), using geomagnetic field data and solar panels as <b>sun</b> <b>sensors,</b> applied to a spinning nanosatellite (Penn State Univer-sity’s LionSat). LionSat will map plasma densities in the ram and wake of the vehicle’s path, using two hybrid plasma probes that rotate with the spacecraft. Attitude will be determined {{using a combination of}} voltage out-puts from contiguous solar panels and a three-axis magnetometer (TAM). To correct for spin-axis drift due to orbital plane nodal regression (approximately five degrees per day), two magnetic torque rods will provide the necessary control actuation. To avoid corrupting the TAM and plasma probe measurements, periodic quiescent intervals for the torque rods are required. Initial design concepts for this mission employed an extended Kalman filter, implemented onboard to predict attitude during the passive control intervals; making use of digital <b>sun</b> <b>sensors</b> as part of the attitude determination scheme; however, budget limitations have resulted in the need to employ the body-mounted solar panels (sides and end caps) to estimate the sun vector. Simulation results indi-cate that the solar-panel <b>sun</b> <b>sensors</b> (in conjunction with the TAM) can produce the required attitude knowledge for processing the scientific data; the pointing accuracy for spin-axis control (nominally within 5 degrees of or...|$|R

50|$|ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System)An ADCS {{designed}} {{from scratch}} around STM32F4 MCU, determining attitude and position through sensor fusion (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, <b>sun</b> <b>sensor).</b> The sensor fusion algorithm used {{is based on}} an alternative implementation of Wahba’s problem, in order to accommodate gyro measurements, as introduced in. This implementation uses a virtual vector base, propagated by the gyro reading, fused with the vectors provided by the <b>sun</b> <b>sensor</b> and the magnetometer, as per Wahba’s problem. This forms essentially a complementary filter in SO(3) between the gyro and the vector measurements. The reference vectors in ECI frame are calculated by and IGRF model, respectively, given the satellites position is known by the GPS and SGP4 model.The control system is based on a spin torquer, which is used as a reaction wheel for pitch control and also to stiffen roll and yaw to the satellite's orbit plane (Gyroscopic torque and momentum bias). Magneto-torquers are also used to dampen the roll and yaw motion while also control pitch angle.|$|E
