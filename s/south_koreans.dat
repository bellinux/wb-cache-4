5|$|Opposing the US 24th Infantry at Battle Mountain was the NK 6th Division, {{which had}} been {{engaging}} Task Force Kean since August 5. The division, which had originally numbered 10,000, had suffered 4,000 casualties thus far fighting at the Pusan Perimeter. However it brought in 3,100 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> forcibly conscripted from neighboring towns to replenish its ranks. The <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> fought as ordered, though the North Koreans dispatched rearguard soldiers with them to shoot any who attempted to desert, defect, or surrender.|$|E
5|$|At noon on October 30, the 15th Corps bombarded the Koreans with 133 large-caliber guns, 22 rocket {{launchers}} and 30 120mm heavy mortars in {{the largest}} Chinese artillery operation of the Korean War. When the bombardment ended at midnight, 10 infantry companies from the 45th and the 29th Divisions swarmed over the ROK 31st Regiment's positions and pushed the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> off the summit. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, only 175 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> survived the onslaught out of the three defending infantry companies. With the PVA 91st Regiment of the 31st Division, 12th Corps, arriving as reinforcement on November 1, the Chinese forces chased the remaining South Korean defenders off Jane Russell Hill and beat off the subsequent counterattack. Responding to the losses, the US IX Corps ordered the ROK 30th Regiment of the ROK 9th Infantry Division to take back Triangle Hill on October 31. The <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> launched continuous attacks for the next five days to no avail. Although the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> failed to recapture the hill, the resulting heavy casualties forced the Chinese to call in the 93rd Regiment of the 31st Division as reinforcement on November 5. On the same day, Lieutenant General Reuben E. Jenkins, commander of the US IX Corps, suspended further attacks on Triangle Hill to prevent more casualties and to protect Sniper Ridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, about 20,000 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> filed two {{separated}} {{lawsuits against}} U.S. companies, seeking more than $5 billion in damages. After losing {{a decision in}} 2002, they filed an appeal.|$|E

25|$|North Korea {{continued}} {{to claim that}} any <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POW who stayed in the North did so voluntarily. However, since 1994, <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs have been escaping North Korea on their own after decades of captivity. As of 2010, the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Ministry of Unification reported that 79 ROK POWs escaped the North. The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> government estimates 500 <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs continue to be detained in North Korea.|$|R
5|$|On 25 October at 10:30, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{attacked}} north {{with its}} 12th Regiment {{on the western}} bank of Samtan River while the 15th Regiment was {{trying to reach the}} eastern bank. But when the 15th Regiment was about to cross the river, the PVA 120th Division intercepted the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> with heavy artillery fire. The <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> first believed the resistance to be the last remnants of the KPA, but the perception soon changed with the capture of the first Chinese prisoner in the Korean War. The prisoner revealed that there were 10,000 Chinese soldiers waiting to join the fight north of Unsan.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division {{was holding}} firm against the Chinese 39th Army to the east, and the {{withdrawal}} of the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> had left their flank exposed. However, with the Chinese 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the Chinese did not exploit this opportunity and the Americans remained relatively unmolested. Yet with the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the Chinese exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the Kansas Line in the mid-morning. Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines to form a new defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new position to be occupied by the South Korean 6th Division. Hoge's plan relied on the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps' reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> were unable to hold, tasking them with blocking the two approaches to the village and to prevent the Chinese from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important main supply route.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 25, 1950, 10 {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. Advancing with 89,000 men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the South Korean Army by surprise, resulting in a disastrous rout for the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> who were disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> who could muster just 38,000 men to the front-line to oppose them. The majority of the South Korean forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the capital Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw further southwards.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> {{men over}} the age of 18, {{including}} foreigners of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> descent, were subject to compulsory military service in the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> armed forces. From a law that was effective since 2005, a male dual citizen could not be allowed to abandon his <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> citizenship until he finished his military service, or had received a special exemption from military service. In several cases, American men of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> descent had been drafted into the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> army upon visiting the country, despite having never been to South Korea before. At least two of the aforementioned cases had involved individuals whose names had, without their knowledge, been recorded in the Hoju, the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Family Census Register, which does not automatically remove the names of former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> citizens.|$|R

5|$|Attempting {{to capture}} Taegu {{as part of}} the Great Naktong Offensive, the North Korean People's Army's 1st and 13th Divisions {{advanced}} to the hill masses north of the city where they confronted the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK Army's 1st Division. The North Koreans sought to occupy a number of hill masses, most prominently Hill 902, known to <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> as Ka-san, for the ancient fortress situated atop it.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00 {{that evening}} {{a large number}} of <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> were {{retreating}} in disarray through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the Australians. The South Korean 6th Division later regrouped in positions behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the Chinese main effort against Seoul, the Chinese 118th Division continued its secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating <b>South</b> <b>Koreans.</b> Racing down the northeast running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the Australian positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, and most likely unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the Chinese vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting as they approached a long, low north-south running ridge that rose like an island in the mouth of the valley.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division {{was heavily}} engaged with the NK 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The {{divisions}} clashes {{centered on the}} town of Yongdok, with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On 5 August, the North Koreans launched their attack, again taking the town from the South Korean forces and pushing them south. At 19:30 on 6 August, the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> launched a counteroffensive to retake the hill.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the NK 6th Division {{was ordered}} to await {{reinforcements}} before continuing the attack. The division's 13th, 15th and 14th regiments stretched from north to south. The first replacements arrived at Chinju on about August 12. Approximately 2,000 unarmed <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> conscripted in the Seoul area joined the division by August 15. At Chinju, the 6th Division issued them grenades and told the recruits {{they would have to}} pick up weapons from killed and wounded soldiers on the battlefield. Another group of 2,500 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> joined the 6th Division on August 21, bringing the division strength to approximately 8,500 men. In the last week of August and the first week of September, 3,000 more recruits conscripted in southwest Korea joined the division. The 6th Division used these last recruits in labor details at only later employed them as combat troops. As part of the North Korean build-up in the south, the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan with another 10,000 men. The 7th Division occupied key ports to protect the 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in its rear.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on August 11, one 300-man {{battalion}} of the 766th Regiment entered {{the village of}} P'ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with small-arms fire until noon. At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> out of the village.|$|E

5|$|The Korean War began {{early in}} the morning of 25 June 1950, {{following}} the surprise invasion of the Republic of Korea (ROK) by its northern neighbour, the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Numerically superior and better-equipped, the Korean People's Army (KPA) crossed the 38th Parallel and rapidly advanced south, easily overcoming the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans.</b> In response, the United Nations (UN) decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea, inviting member states to send forces to restore the situation. As a consequence, American ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> from collapsing, however they too were under strength and poorly equipped, and by early August had been forced back by the North Koreans to an enclave around Pusan, known as the Pusan Perimeter. Key US allies—Britain, Canada and Australia—also committed forces, although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in the US. Under diplomatic pressure the British agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in July, and would later dispatch a second brigade as the crisis worsened. The Canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade, although the first battalion would not arrive until December 1950. A total of 21 UN member states eventually contributed forces.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean forces {{suffered}} {{a shortage of}} men and equipment; their divisions were far understrength. Opposing the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans,</b> from west to east, were the 8th, 12th, and 5th Divisions and the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment. On 5 August, the NK 8th Division was estimated to have 8,000 men, the NK 5th Division had 6,000 men, the NK 12th Division had 6,000 men and the 766th Independent Regiment had 1,500 men, giving these units a total strength of at least 21,500.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> law {{defines the}} term [...] "Overseas Korean" [...] as {{referring}} to <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationals who reside overseas {{as well as}} [...] "Koreans with a Foreign Nationality." [...] The latter group is composed of former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationals who gave up their <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality (but barring those who did so to deliberately evade military service, at least until age 36) and children and grandchildren of former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationals. It {{is important to note}} that not every descendant of a <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> can be counted as an [...] "Overseas Korean" [...] or [...] "Korean with a Foreign Nationality" [...] under this law. For example, a 25-year-old man who was born a <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> national overseas but whose birth was unreported will have no documentation to prove his status as a former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> national, and can only gain status as an Overseas Korean if one of his parents or grandparents gave up <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality. Also, those who fall under Article 7 of the Addenda (Special Cases of Acquisition of Nationality for Persons of Maternal Line By Adoption of Jus Sanguinis to Both Lines of Parents) but failed to acquire <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality are not able to gain the status of an Overseas Korean unless the mother or a maternal grandparent has lost <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality.|$|R
50|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> soldiers were captured by the North Korean and Chinese forces during the Korean War (1950-53) but were not returned during the prisoner exchanges under the 1953 Armistice Agreement. Most are presumed dead, but the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> government estimates some 560 <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> prisoners of war still survive in North Korea. The issue of unaccounted <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs from the Korean War has been in dispute since the Armistice in 1953. North Korea continues to deny it holds these <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs. Interest in this issue has been renewed since 1994, when Lt. Cho Chang-ho, a former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> soldier presumed to {{have been killed in}} the war, escaped from North Korea. As of 2008, 79 former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> soldiers have escaped from North Korea.|$|R
50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> National Liberation Front - Preparation Committee {{was created}} by <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> leftists, in order to {{propagate}} socialist and communist ideas to the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> masses. The eventual goal of the SKNLF-PC was to organize the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> people and wage a guerrilla war {{similar to that of}} the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, hoping to eventually create a socialist state and reunify with North Korea. The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> National Liberation Front was dissolved after many members were exposed and arrested by the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> military regime, including poet Kim Nam-ju. The National Liberation Front Incident is often compared to other instances where the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> state exposed (or at least claimed to have exposed) clandestine communist organization, such as the Revolutionary Reunification Party Incident and the People's Revolutionary Party Incident.|$|R
5|$|With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all {{advanced}} steadily {{south along}} the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an advance force, attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor communication equipment, and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure {{they would not be}} threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> valuable time to build up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was moving toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong in order to block communications between Daegu and Busan, where United States Army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.|$|E
5|$|With the US forces {{accepting}} the North Korean attack {{as an act}} of war, it became imperative to evacuate civilians and American diplomats from Korea, as the forces of the north and south were battling across the peninsula. On June 27 the <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> were losing the First Battle of Seoul. Most of South Korea's forces retreated {{in the face of the}} invasion. The North Koreans would capture the city the next day forcing the South Korean government and its shattered army to retreat further south.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden {{appearance}} of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan.

The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress, and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E
