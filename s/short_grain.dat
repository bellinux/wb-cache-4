We observe differences in layer velocity profile and in net grain velocity for grains that are composed of one, two, or three colinear spheres. In the case of mixtures of different species of grains, we demonstrate layer-by-layer variation in the average velocity as well as layer segregation of species, and show that horizontal separation of the species can be achieved using this geometry. We also find that {{the addition of a}} small number of <b>shorter</b> <b>grains</b> to a sample of long grains provides a lubrication effect that increases the velocity of the long grains.

30|$|Indica and japonica are the {{two major}} types of Asian {{cultivated}} rice (Oryza sativa L.). There are significant differences between them in many morphological and physiological traits associated with the processes of indica-japonica differentiation (Morishima and Oka 1981). Among them, the differentiation in vascular bundle system is an important parameter that defines differentiation between the two subspecies. Indica varieties {{tend to have more}} large vascular bundles in peduncle than japonica varieties, and have significant higher ratio of the LVN to the number of primary rachis branches (ranged from 1.3 to 2.2) than japonica (nearly 1.0) (Fukuyama and Takayama 1995). Our studies showed that LVN in peduncle of indica (averaged 21 in 2015 and 19.9 in 2016) was also significantly higher than those of japonica (averaged 16.1 in 2015 and 15.5 in 2016) (Additional file 4 : Figure S 3). In japonica-type cultivars, each of the large vascular bundles is directly connected to a primary rachis branch (PRB), resulting almost in same quantity of LVN in the peduncle and number of PRBs. On the other hand, in indica-type some large vascular bundles are directly connected to the secondary rachis branches due to surplus large vascular bundles (Fukushima and Akita 1997; Terao et al. 2010). The different vascular bundle characteristics between indica and japonica probably explained inherently <b>shorter</b> <b>grain</b> development phase (Osada et al. 1983) or <b>shorter</b> <b>grain</b> filling period (Nagato and Chaudhry 1969) in indica than japonica resulting from more rapid multiplication of endosperm cells (Nagato and Chaudhry 1969) and dominant transportation efficiency of photosynthetic products (Weng and Chen 1987) in indica. Rice grain yield is highly positively significantly correlated with spikelet number on first rachis branches especially secondary rachis branches. So, genetic mechanisms and their genetic relationships between the number of rachis branches and vascular bundle related traits in rice need further explored.|$|R

50|$|White {{rhinoceroses}} {{are found}} in grassland and savannah habitat. Herbivore grazers that eat grass, preferring the <b>shortest</b> <b>grains,</b> the white rhinoceros {{is one of the}} largest pure grazers. It drinks twice a day if water is available, but if conditions are dry it can live four or five days without water. It spends about half of the day eating, one third resting, and the rest of the day doing various other things. White rhinoceroses, like all species of rhinoceros, love wallowing in mudholes to cool down. The white Rhinoceros is thought to have changed the structure and ecology of the savanna's grasslands. Comparatively based on studies of the African elephant, scientists believe the white Rhino is a driving factor in its ecosystem. The destruction of the megaherbivore could have serious cascading effects on the ecosystem and harm other animals.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{industry}} standards {{express the}} direction of the grain last when giving dimensions (that is, 17 × 11 inches is <b>short</b> <b>grain</b> paper and 11 × 17 inches is long grain paper), although alternatively the grain alignment can be explicitly indicated with an underline (11 × 17 is <b>short</b> <b>grain)</b> or the letter [...] "M" [...] for [...] "machine" [...] (11M × 17 is <b>short</b> <b>grain).</b> Grain is important because paper will crack if folded across the grain: for example, if a sheet 17 × 11 inches is to be folded to divide the sheet into two 8.5 × 11 halves, then the grain will be along the 11-inch side. Paper intended to be fed into a machine that will bend the paper around rollers, such as a printing press, photocopier or typewriter, should be fed grain side first so that the axis of the rollers is along the grain.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{recrystallization}} annealing was operated in 3 %(mass fraction) Si CGO steels. Different annealing holding time {{was set up}} in experiments. Microstructure, dislocations and texture distribution were analysed by OM, TEM and EBSD techniques. Evolution of microstructure and texture in primary recrystallization was studied. Results indicate that as the annealing holding time prolongs, recovery and recrystallization occur gradually. When the holding time increases to 300 s, recrystallization is almost fully realized and grains are equiaxed. With the extension of holding time, the dislocation density decreases. Primary recrystallization texture is affected by holding time. As the holding time extends, { 111 } texture and { 110 } texture are weakened and Goss texture is strengthened. { 111 } texture is reduced firstly and then increases. The intensity of cube texture and rotated cube texture is stable.

30|$|Two rice dwarf mutants, dwarf 1 (d 1; [4]) and dwarf 11 (d 11; [72]), were {{identified}} and found to have very similar seed phenotypes, exhibiting <b>shorter</b> <b>grains</b> with dramatically reduced seed length. At the same time, Fujisawa et al. [23] used transgenic rice with antisense suppression of the D 1 gene that produced dwarf rice plants with a similar seed phenotype to the d 1 mutant. The d 1 mutant has phenotypes characteristic of GA deficiency [59], and D 1 is the only gene in rice encoding a prototypical heterotrimeric G protein α-subunit, which presumably functions in the GA signal transduction pathway [4]. The G protein is thought to transmit the gibberellin signal(s) responsible for the normal development of rice internodes and seeds [23], whereas d 11 is a novel cytochrome P 450 gene mutant implicated in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis [72]. However, mechanisms underlying seed-size regulation are still unclear for both mutants. Other BR-biosynthesis-defective mutants in rice, such as ebisu dwarf (dwarf 2 /d 2; [33]), BR-deficient dwarf 1 (brd 1; [32]), and BR-deficient dwarf 2 (brd 2; [31]), also bear smaller seeds than the wild type; therefore, GA signal transduction and the BR biosynthesis pathway affect crop grain size.|$|R

GS 3 was identified from the progeny derived from a cross between Minghui 63 with large grain and Chuan 7 with small grain, which show remarkable difference in grain length and weight. According to map-based clone, the researchers found GS 3 encodes a putative transmembrane protein containing a plant-specific organ size regulation (OSR) domain, a tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR/NGFR) family cysteine-rich domain, and a von Willebrand factor type C (VWFC) domain (Fan et al. 2006; Mao et al. 2010; Zuo and Li 2014). The large grain variety, Minghui 63, has a base difference, which is adenine (A) compared with small grain variety, Chuan 7 with cytosine (C) at the second exon. The single nucleotide mutation detected at the GS 3 gene between these two different grain-length groups, which changed a cysteine codon (TGC) in the small-grain group to a termination codon (TGA) in the large-grain group. This nonsense mutation lead to premature termination of transcription at the long grain variety, indicating that long grain resulted {{from the loss of}} the function of the protein otherwise producing <b>short</b> <b>grains</b> (Fan et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the statistics {{of the transformation}} strains that arise in random martensitic polycrystals as boundary conditions cause its component crystallites to undergo martensitic phase transitions. In our laminated polycrystal model {{the orientation of the}} n grains (crystallites) is given by an uncorrelated random array of the orientation angles θ_i, i = 1,...,n. Under imposed boundary conditions the polycrystal grains may undergo a martensitic transformation. The associated transformation strains ε_i, i = 1,...,n depend on the array of orientation angles, and they can be obtained as a solution to a nonlinear optimization problem. While the random variables θ_i, i = 1,...,n are uncorrelated, the random variables ε_i, i = 1,...,n may be correlated. This issue is central in our considerations. We investigate it in following three different scaling limits: (i) Infinitely long grains (laminated polycrystal of height L = ∞); (ii) Grains of finite but large height (L » 1); and (iii) Chain of <b>short</b> <b>grains</b> (L = l_ 0 /(2 n), l_ 0 « 1).
