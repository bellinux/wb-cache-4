5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with <b>skepticism</b> and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and <b>skepticism</b> (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Hinduism {{there has been a}} strong {{tradition}} of philosophic speculation and <b>skepticism.</b>|$|E
5|$|American attitudes {{regarding}} government {{surveillance and}} privacy, constitutionally guaranteed rights to confront one's accuser in criminal prosecutions, and <b>skepticism</b> towards government power {{might also have}} a role in concerns about transportation safety in the United States.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{discussed}} {{in the context of}} virtual reality, ontology, existentialism, and skepticism; it has also been used in Christian religious education classes to initiate discussion about angels, <b>skepticism,</b> science, and faith.|$|E
5|$|Pericles' {{manner of}} thought and rhetorical {{charisma}} {{may have been in}} part products of Anaxagoras' emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble and <b>skepticism</b> about divine phenomena. His proverbial calmness and self-control are also often regarded as products of Anaxagoras' influence.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{philosophical}} {{concept of}} Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient Indian philosophy, {{in the areas}} of <b>skepticism</b> and relativity. The epistemology of anekāntavāda and syādvāda also {{had a profound impact on}} the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The deep-rooted hostility between Aboriginals and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal {{communities}} effective KMT networks, {{contribute to}} Aboriginal <b>skepticism</b> against the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Aboriginals tendency {{to vote for}} the KMT.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the movie}} {{is set in the}} fashion world, most {{designers}} and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories {{to be used in the}} film, making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial <b>skepticism,</b> saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his <b>skepticism</b> about prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some <b>skepticism.</b> The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards {{the center of the}} cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock {{discovered}} transposition {{and used}} it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to <b>skepticism</b> of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his <b>skepticism</b> about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.|$|E
5|$|However, {{since this}} initial <b>skepticism,</b> {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E
5|$|I had viewed Hitler and his {{movement}} with some <b>skepticism,</b> {{but when the}} abolition of the multi-party mess removed the obscenity of unemployment, and the first 1,000 kilometers of autobahns opened up a new era of mobility, I too saw the light: this was the time when Churchill said he hoped Great Britain would have a man like Hitler in time of peril, and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid the Führer homage.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with <b>skepticism</b> the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women. Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the risk}} parity {{approach}} has increased since the late 2000s financial crisis as the risk parity approach fared better than traditionally constructed portfolios, {{as well as many}} hedge funds. Some portfolio managers have expressed <b>skepticism</b> about the practical application of the concept and its effectiveness in all types of market conditions but others point to its performance during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 as an indication of its potential success.|$|E
5|$|Paine's creed encapsulates many of {{the major}} themes {{of the rest of}} his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a <b>skepticism</b> {{regarding}} most supernatural claims (here the afterlife, later in the text, miracles); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.|$|E
5|$|Project Cirrus was {{the first}} attempt to modify a hurricane. It was a {{collaboration}} of the General Electric Corporation, the US Army Signal Corps, the Office of Naval Research, and the US Air Force. After several preparations, and initial <b>skepticism</b> by government scientists, the first attempt to modify a hurricane began on October 13, 1947 on a hurricane that was heading west to east and out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Péladan {{agreed to}} lecture {{in front of}} Societatea Ileana at the Atheneum, and his subject of choice was The Genius of the Latin Race. His mystical {{doctrine}} was received with much <b>skepticism</b> and amusement by the Romanian literary chroniclers. The visit then turned to scandal: Péladan issued a call for all Romanians to embrace Catholicism, and left the country on pain of being deported.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{proposed}} that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which {{is thought to have}} originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago. This proposal has been met with <b>skepticism,</b> and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} <b>skepticism</b> about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E
5|$|William Bell, Seward's butler, {{answered}} the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10p.m. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's <b>skepticism,</b> Powell made {{his way up the}} stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward, to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} was long met with <b>skepticism</b> in Germany, and official matches were {{banned by the}} DFB until 1970. However, the women's national team has grown in popularity since winning the World Cup in 2003, as it was chosen as Germany's Sports Team of the Year. The current head coach is Steffi Jones, replacing Silvia Neid {{who was in charge}} from 2005 until 2016. As of June 2017, Germany is ranked 2nd in the FIFA Women's World Rankings.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his <b>skepticism</b> about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Beverly Chappell founded The Dougy Center in 1982 {{in tribute}} to Dougy Turno, who died of a brain tumor at age thirteen. In August 1981, Dougy {{wrote a letter to}} {{psychiatrist}} and author Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a pioneer in near-death studies, on the subject of his own death. This prompted Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Despite Kübler-Ross' early influence on the organization, The Dougy Center does not subscribe to the Kübler-Ross model (a series of five emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) and has even expressed <b>skepticism</b> about the model.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (seasons 1–present, main) {{is portrayed}} by Gillian Anderson. Scully is an FBI special agent, a medical doctor, and {{scientist}} who is Mulder's partner. In {{contrast to his}} credulity, Scully is a skeptic, basing her beliefs on scientific explanations. However, despite her otherwise rigid <b>skepticism,</b> she is a Catholic, and her faith {{plays an important role}} in several episodes. As the series progresses, she becomes more open to the possibility of paranormal happenings. In the latter part of the eighth season, her position in the X-Files office is taken by Agent Monica Reyes, and Scully moves to Quantico to teach new FBI agents. She appeared in both The X-Files feature films.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial <b>skepticism</b> in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be {{committed}} to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening <b>skepticism</b> that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new <b>skepticism</b> and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed <b>skepticism</b> that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to causing {{about two-thirds of}} its members to quit between 1906 and 1910, the radicalization of the FVdG also correlates to a slight change in the milieu, industries, and regions from which the organization drew its members. Many metal and construction workers, who had a localist tradition, left {{as a result of}} the syndicalist and anarchist tendencies in the FVdG. Miners, who worked mostly in the Ruhr area, did not have this tradition but developed a certain <b>skepticism</b> of bureaucratic structures. About 450 of them joined the FVdG before World War I, a sign of what was to come after the war.|$|E
5|$|Kaladze became {{involved}} in the politics of Georgia {{as a member of the}} opposition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister of Energy in the cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili on 25 October 2012. The appointment was met with <b>skepticism</b> in professional energy circles. More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a conflict of interest arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent. Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.|$|E
5|$|Mania {{initially}} expressed <b>skepticism</b> of the show's {{combination of}} gothic lolita, dolls, magic, and comedy but later {{calls it a}} successful experiment and praised the character interactions and the dolls' designs. In their Rozen Maiden: Träumend review, Mania praised the visuals and characters but criticized the unbalanced comic and dark comments and described the revelations and finale as rushed. Anime News Network's review of Rozen Maiden: Träumend were mostly negative and addressed several points: the failed attempts at serious drama which were considered cliché and resulted in cheesy and melodramatic dialogue; the recycled background music; and the ending which was described as inconclusive and slapdash.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2002, a Halo {{port for}} Windows was {{announced}} {{to be under}} development by Gearbox Software. Its showing at E3 2003 was positively received by some critics, with <b>skepticism</b> by others. It was released on September 30, 2003, and included support for online multiplayer play and featured sharper graphics, but had compatibility issues that caused poor performance. Halo was later released for Mac OS X on December 11, 2003. On December 4, 2007, the game became available for the Xbox 360 via download from the Xbox Live Marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy {{attacked}} him but her assurance that {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite <b>skepticism.</b> Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E
5|$|Romney's {{liabilities}} included having run {{for senator}} {{and serving as}} governor {{in one of the}} nation's most liberal states and having taken positions in opposition to the party's conservative base during that time. Late during his term as governor, he had shifted positions and emphases to better align with traditional conservatives on social issues. Skeptics, including some Republicans, charged Romney with opportunism and a lack of core principles. As a Mormon, he faced suspicion and <b>skepticism</b> by some in the Evangelical portion of the party.|$|E
