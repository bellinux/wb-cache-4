5000|$|In the Riefler escapement, {{the energy}} {{required}} to keep the pendulum swinging is instead supplied by bending the short straight <b>spring</b> <b>strip</b> which suspends the pendulum. [...] The {{upper end of the}} suspension spring is not attached to a fixed support as in most clocks, but instead is attached to a heavy metal bearer, which pivots on two aligned knife-edges on its underside which rest on flat agate plates. The bending point of the suspension spring is in alignment with the line of contact of the knife-edges. When the pendulum passes its bottom point, the escape wheel is unlocked and pushes the bearer, and the bearer pivots suddenly on its knife edges by a small angle, flexing the spring. The spring is bent by a small amount in addition to that caused by the swing of the pendulum, and thus provides the impulse for the next swing. So the suspension spring is used for two functions: suspending the pendulum and giving it impulse.|$|E

We conducted a study from 1995 to 1999 on a Decatur silt loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Paleudults) to develop a practical conservation tillage system with competitive yields for the region. Treatments included a factorial combination of fall ridging (ridged and nonridged) and fall non-inver sion deep tillage (none, in-row subsoiling, paratilling), along with <b>spring</b> <b>strip</b> tillage and conventional tillage (fall chisel-spring disk). All treatments, except conventional tillage, were established with a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{can reduce}} cotton yields by restricting root development necessary for nutrient and water uptake. This condition can be partially avoided by maintaining or improving {{soil organic matter}} content. Many soils in central Alabama have hard pans within the top 12 inches of soil, intensified by low organic matter contents. A field experiment was started in fall 2003 to evaluate a factorial treatment combination of conservation tillage systems (no tillage, fall paratill, spring paratill, and <b>spring</b> <b>strip</b> tillage) and winter cover crops (no cover, rye, and wheat) that might increase organic matter content and soil moisture availability, reduce soil compaction, while improving cotton profitability. Soil moisture was monitored {{to a depth of}} 12 inches every 15 minutes during the growing season. Cotton leaf temperature was determined in the uppermost fully extended leaf with an infra-red thermometer five times during the fruiting period.

These structures {{are designed to}} be lightweight, to be compactly stowable, and to be capable of springing to stable configurations at full extension once released from stowage. Conceived for use as self-deploying structures in outer space, portable structures of this type may also be useful on Earth in applications in which there are requirements for light weight and small transportation volume. The elements common to these structures are <b>spring</b> <b>strips</b> with curved cross sections [...] similar to <b>spring</b> <b>strips</b> of the type commonly used as compactly stowable carpenters' measuring tapes. These structures exploit the nonlinear mechanical properties of such tapes, namely (1) strong resistance to axial buckling while they are straight and (2) ease with which they can be wound into compact rolls once they have been initially bent. For a structure that contains multiple such strips, the net effect of the combined nonlinear characteristics is the following: (1) When at full extension, the structure is in a stable state, in which it is rigid and strong. (2) When stowed compactly, the structure is in a state that is semistable in the sense that only a small force is needed to restrain the structure against deployment. (3) The strain energy stored in the <b>spring</b> <b>strips</b> during compaction is sufficient to deploy the structure to full extension when the restraint is removed...|$|R

40|$|Soils {{with low}} organic matter are {{susceptible}} to soil compaction, which inhibits root development and subsequent nutrient and water uptake. Previous surveys have identified fields with low organic matter contents and shallow compacted zones in the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production region of central Alabama, USA. We initiated a field experiment in 2003 on a Lucedale fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Paleudult) to determine how conservation tillage systems and winter cover crops affect yields and moisture availability. Treatments were a factorial combination of tillage systems (no tillage, fall paratill, spring paratill, and <b>spring</b> <b>strip</b> tillage) and winter cover crops [no cover, rye (Secale cereale L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ] in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Soil moisture was monitored continuously {{during the growing season}} to a depth of 30 cm. In 2004, results indicate that tillage had no effect on lint yields, while rye and wheat increased lint yields 12 and 5 % compared to no cover. Soil moisture contents were generally 5 % higher than soil moisture contents measured from no cover plots. In 2005, some form of non-inversion tillage was superior to no-tillage. Lint yields across cover crops averaged 1512 kg ha- 1 for wheat, 1444 kg ha- 1 for rye, and 1299 kg ha- 1 for no cover. Trends in soil moisture contents across tillage systems and covers were similar to 2004, but not as dramatic. These results indicate that a high residue cover crop is required on degraded soils of central Alabama to maximize lint yields and soil moisture...|$|E

2500|$|The M3 {{operating}} sequence is as follows: the bolt is cocked {{to the rear}} using the cocking handle located {{on the right side}} of the ejector housing. When the trigger is pulled, the bolt is driven forward by the recoil <b>springs,</b> <b>stripping</b> a round from the feed lips of the magazine and guiding the round into the chamber. The bolt then continues forward and the firing pin strikes the cartridge primer, igniting the round, resulting in a high-pressure impulse, forcing the bolt back against the resistance of the recoil springs and the inertial mass of the bolt. By the time the bolt and empty casing have moved far enough to the rear to open the chamber, the bullet has left the barrel and pressure in the barrel has dropped to a safe level. The M3's comparatively low cyclic rate was a function of the relatively low pressure generated by the [...]45 ACP round, a heavy bolt, and recoil springs with a lighter-than-normal compression rate.|$|R

The slide continues to the rear and the return spring, located under the barrel, is fully compressed. The slide rides over a retarder lever which snaps up and holds the slide to the rear. The rate-reducing device, an inertia buffer {{in the rear of the}} slide, continues rearward under its own momentum and compresses the buffer spring. When the spring is fully compressed it throws the retarder forward and this pushes the retarder lever down out of engagement with the slide and, provided the trigger is still depressed and ammunition remains in the magazine, the slide goes forward to repeat the firing cycle.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the design and {{prototyping}} of a compact external pipe-crawling device that aids the inspection of pipes in hazardous environments and areas that are inaccessible to humans. The novel aspect of the design is a compliant mechanism that is actuated using Ni-Ti-Cu shape memory alloy (SMA) wire and strip. The device consists of two rings that are attached to each other along the longitudinal axis of the pipe by three pairs of circumferentially arranged U-shaped SMA and spring steel (AISI 1080) strips. Each ring consists of a compliant mechanism and housing. The compliant mechanism transforms the circumferential motion to radial motion at three points that are in contact with the pipe. The design of this compliant mechanism is derived from a radially deployable linkage. The SMA wire attached to the compliant mechanism and embedded within the housing with proper electrical isolation creates the circumferential motion for the compliant mechanism. When there is no actuation, the contact points of the compliant mechanisms of the two rings tightly hold the pipe. When an SMA wire of a ring is activated, that ring releases the grip on the pipe. At this time, the SMA strips are actuated to bring the rings closer together. After this, the first ring is de-activated to create the grip again. This is followed by releasing the grip on the second ring by the SMA wire activation. The <b>spring</b> steel <b>strips,</b> which are compressed during the SMA strip actuation, now extend back creating a displacement along the pipe. This cycle is repeated to create a...|$|R
