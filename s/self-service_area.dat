50|$|The term {{over-the-counter}} may {{be somewhat}} counterintuitive, since, in many countries, these drugs are often placed on shelves in <b>self-service</b> <b>areas</b> of stores, like any other packaged products. In contrast, prescription drugs are almost always passed over a counter from the pharmacist to the customer. Some drugs may be legally classified as over-the-counter (i.e. no prescription is required), but may only be dispensed by a pharmacist after {{an assessment of the}} patient's needs or the provision of patient education. In many countries, a number of OTC drugs are available in establishments without a pharmacy, such as general stores, supermarkets, and gas stations. Regulations detailing the establishments where drugs may be sold, who is authorized to dispense them, and whether a prescription is required vary considerably from country to country.|$|R

50|$|On 22 June 1965 the {{foundation}} stone {{for a new}} building was laid. By 1967, a modern Fichtelberg House with an austere, typically East German concrete architecture and integrated, plain, 42 metre-high observation tower had been completed. The GDR made 12 million marks available for its construction. The new Fichtelberg House had seating for around 600. On the ground floor was a large self-service restaurant, on the upper floor was a grill bar, a concert café and a conference room. Well known artists helped design the interior. The wooden walls of the vestibule and the room dividers in the <b>self-service</b> <b>area</b> were by Hans Brockhage. Carl-Heinz Westenburger created a mural for the end wall of the conference room, on which he depicted sporting life on the Fichtelberg. At {{the end of the}} 1990 the Fichtelberg House was converted to resemble the old building and re-opened on 18 July 1999. The newly built observation tower is only 31 metres high.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify the characteristics of what makes retail pharmacies able to guarantee and ensure better customer satisfaction. We have identified the core attributes of retail pharmacies as well as the factors that can contribute to better customer satisfaction in a regulated economic context (pharmacies being in a monopolistic situation regarding the sales of medicines). The aim of this analysis is to check if pharmacies customers behave as patients or consumers. If the factors linked to the consumption of pharmaceutical products have similar contributions to those noticed for traditional consumer goods (food, clothes and so on), pharmacists will be able to regard their customers as consumers. If it is not the case, the customers will be assimilated to patients, regarding pharmaceutical products as non-traditional consumer goods. The tetra-class model (Llosa, 1997) of factors contributing to satisfaction during a pharmacy service experience will serve as the tool for apprehending the role of different pharmacy characteristics in the satisfaction process. We found that French customers seem to behave more as patients than customers in pharmacies. Managerial implications can be deduced. In front of the counter, this research shows that merchandizing at the sales outlet has no effect on the patients satisfaction. However, it is worth noticing that the <b>self-service</b> <b>area</b> does contribute to consumer satisfaction. Behind the counter, pharmacies customers behave as patients when purchasing drugs; medecines still remaining a nontraditional product. French customers do not seem ready to purchase medecines from a <b>self-service</b> <b>area.</b> As a result, pharmacy owners can adjust pharmacy service elements to increase the satisfaction level of their customers...|$|E
40|$|A host {{of health}} {{problems}} are associated with consumption of refined sugar. Sauces such as ketchup, mayonnaise [...] . contained higher level of refined sugar. Using behavioural influence techniques it could be possible to encourage consumer to reduce their consumption of refine sugar. In this study, the mirror exposure procedure was used in order to decrease students’ sauces consumption in a university cafeteria. A mirror was stand or not in a <b>self-service</b> <b>area</b> with various sauces (mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard). People were unobtrusively observed and noticed which of the sauces was taken by each customer {{and the number of}} times the customer pressed on the sauce dispenser in order to obtain one dose of sauce. In the mirror exposure, the observers noted if the customer looked at the mirror when using the sauce dispenser. Results showed a decrease in consumption but only with individuals who look at them when using the sauce-dispensers. In a field setting, {{it was found that the}} mirror technique is an efficient method to decrease sauce consumption, and by extension, the consumption of refined sugar. The practical and the theoretical interest of this procedure are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>self-service</b> <b>area</b> of {{the library}} reading rooms it is {{necessary}} to organise the collections in the simplest way possible. This is an important feature for readers making it possible to get direct access to the material without necessarily having to go via the library catalogue to retrieve the call number. A typical example will be that a collection is organised so that a reader can easily get directly from an article reference to the article itself in a library where the journal collection simply is organised alphabetically. This requirement seems to have been forgotten by many of the most important actors in the digital library, both by the commercial publishers and many of the bodies producing grey literature. How are the users supposed to get directly to report xyz without having to navigate through n different web pages? This is on top happening in "The Library" which is intended to be close to 100 % based on self-service! CERN Library has developed a mechanism, "Go direct", which handles the problem. So far it only processes articles published in journals, due to it's success it will however be extended to also include grey literature issued in series holding a report number. CERN Library catalogue uses "Go direct" to automatically generate links from bibliographic information to the corresponding fulltext of a document. The talk gives an overview of the present situation concerning link managers and URL architecture in the field of electronic publishing within high-energy physics.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of industries are choosing to provide self-service technology delivery options for their customers. There {{are at least three}} <b>self-service</b> application <b>areas</b> that have benefitted from a collaborative effort in technology advancement: online (e-commerce), kiosk (k-commerce), and vending (v-commerce). Efficient e-commerce companies provide a platform that allows customers to research products, order goods and services, process payments, and/or access online customer support. The success of web-based self-service depends upon {{the quality and quantity of}} information available and the ease with which it can be located. The kiosk has become a retailing option that has proven to be an effective unattended point of sale. A recent report noted that the number of installed kiosks has quadrupled in the past several years with no end in the short term. While the vending industry has been stagnant in recent years, newer machines have replaced traditional glass-front panels with interactive digital displays capable of enhancing the customer interface. As the convergence of these three self-service technologies continue to progress, an innovative service delivery model is evolving. Technology is an investment that, if made wisely, can produce a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace...|$|R
