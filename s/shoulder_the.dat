2500|$|<b>The</b> human <b>shoulder</b> {{is made up}} {{of three}} bones: the {{clavicle}} (collarbone), <b>the</b> scapula (<b>shoulder</b> blade), and <b>the</b> humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. [...] The articulations between the bones of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> make up <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joints. <b>The</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. In human anatomy, <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint comprises <b>the</b> part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid cavity. <b>The</b> <b>shoulder</b> is <b>the</b> group of structures in the region of the joint.|$|R
50|$|Other {{muscles in}} the back are {{associated}} with the movement of <b>the</b> neck and <b>shoulders.</b> <b>The</b> trapezius muscle, which is named from its trapezium-like shape, runs between the neck, the anterior chain, <b>the</b> two <b>shoulders,</b> and <b>the</b> thoracic vertebra, T12. The large latissimus dorsi make a triangle from <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> to <b>the</b> hip.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{with the}} Bactrian camel, the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Senators {{unveiled}} a new logo, taking the head, {{which had been}} in profile, and rotating {{it so that it}} was face-first. The new logo was unveiled with a new red 'third' jersey, prominently using 'curved' or 'swoosh' stripes. On the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>the</b> original logo was used as a shoulder patch. The original dark jersey, (then the 'away' jersey) which was mostly black, was retired after the season. The red jersey became the home jersey and it remained in use {{until the end of the}} 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

The Steelers drove from their 20-yard line in the fourth quarter, Ward received an 8-yard touchdown pass to put the Steelers up by 5points with 1:53 remaining in regulation, however, the 2-pt conversion failed. Roethlisberger received the AFC offensive {{player of the week}} award for his 309-yard, 3touchdown pass performance, despite having an injured throwing <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> NFL selected the game as the league's Week Five Game of the Week.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded {{as something of}} a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to <b>shoulder</b> <b>the</b> expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E

5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to <b>shoulder</b> <b>the</b> cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to proceed with the deployment as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|In Lancashire's first innings, King bowled 27 overs {{and took}} 5 wickets for 46 runs. The Philadelphians passed Lancashire's first innings score, but their lead was quickly {{overtaken}} in Lancashire's second innings. With the wind strong over King's left <b>shoulder,</b> <b>the</b> scene {{was set for}} him to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break on day two of the match, he yorked one of Lancashire's opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. He clean bowled two more batsmen in his second over, and bowled a stump {{out of the ground}} in the third. In 3 overs, he had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested in the field. One batsman was run out before King returned to take 4 more wickets, ending the innings with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets.|$|E

5|$|Memorials to Ball in {{his native}} Nottingham include a {{monument}} and statue in the grounds of Nottingham Castle. The monument, which was commissioned by the city council and funded by public subscription, consists of a bronze group on a carved pedestal of Portland stone and granite. The bronze group, by the sculptor Henry Poole, shows a life-size figure of Ball with an allegorical female figure at his <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> monument was unveiled on 8 September 1921 by Air Marshal Trenchard, with military honours including a flypast by a squadron of RAF aircraft. In 1929 the bronze model for Ball's statue was presented by his father to the National Portrait Gallery in London, where it is on display. In further remembrance of his son, Albert Ball, Sr. commissioned {{the building of the}} Albert Ball Memorial Homes in Lenton to house the families of local servicemen killed in action. The Lenton War Memorial, located in front of the homes, includes Ball's name and was also paid for by the Ball family. The homes were Grade-II listed for historic preservation in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa, the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, began on 22June 1941. On the same day, the Ustaše began arresting communists and their known sympathisers in the towns of Bosanska Krajina, including Prijedor. The communists had predicted this, {{and most of them}} avoided capture by escaping to the villages or hiding in the towns. Stojanović {{was one of the few}} communists arrested in Prijedor. He was imprisoned with the Serb hostages on the second floor of a school in the town. They were subjected to forced labour, being led each morning through the town to repair the road to Kozarac. The column of hostages was usually headed by Stojanović carrying a shovel on his <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> Croatian Home Guards guarding the prison treated him well. While detained, Stojanović lectured a group of hostages about Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to <b>shoulder</b> <b>the</b> burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains the}} same white angular rails as the mid-grounds of his 1949 Head II, Head VI, and Study for Portrait {{of the same}} year. In this panel, the rails are positioned just below {{the area where the}} horizontal and vertical bars of the cross intersect. The rail begins with a diagonal line which intersects the chimera at {{what appears to be the}} creature's <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> horizontal angular geometrical shape is sketched in white and grey in the mid-ground, and represents an early form of a spatial device Bacon was to develop and perfect during the 1950s, when it effectively became a cage used to frame the anguished figures portrayed in Bacon's foregrounds. In the mid-ground, the artist has sketched a street scene, which features walking stick figures and cars. The pedestrians appear oblivious to the slaughter before them.|$|E

The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a red car into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
