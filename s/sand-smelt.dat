5000|$|... 63 {{species of}} fish have been listed for the water body, {{including}} 7 introduced species. Common commercial fish in the estuary are gobies, <b>sand-smelt,</b> and Black Sea sprat. Until 1979 fish such as roach, zander, carp, goldfish were numerous and caught for fishing. Now, fishing in the estuary consists of haarder, which comes from the sea through the canal, and also <b>sand-smelt</b> and gobies.|$|E
40|$|A {{fragment}} of the mitochondrial control region {{was used to}} assess phylogeographic patterns and historical demography of the <b>sand-smelt</b> Atherina presbyter in the North-eastern Atlantic, covering its geographical range. A striking result is the highly marked differentiation between the Canary Islands population and western European ones. A genetic structure among European populations of A. presbyter was revealed, with a pattern of isolation-by-distance or a gradient effect at a scale of hundreds kilometres, an uncommon pattern likely related to the biological and life-history traits of the <b>sand-smelt.</b> The northern European populations present a much lower genetic diversity when compared to southern populations, which is consistent with a recent colonization from southern populations. The results showed signs of Pleistocene signatures, with the population age estimates for the European populations being clearly older than the Last Glacial Maximum (18, 000 years bp). Nevertheless, paleotemperature reconstructions show that the <b>sand-smelt</b> could not have inhabited the western European shores during the last glacial phas...|$|E
40|$|Swimming {{abilities}} of wild-caught <b>sand-smelt</b> Atherina presbyter larvae were assessed as critical swimming speed (Ucrit) throughout ontogeny. The mean Ucrit increased with size, ranging from 3 ⋅ 6 to 18 ⋅ 7 cms− 1, over {{the size range}} of 6 ⋅ 6 – 21 ⋅ 0 mm LT. This indicates that at hatching A. presbyter larvae, far from being passive floaters, are already capable of active behaviours, which may influence their dispersal patterns. This work {{was supported by the}} project MATRIX (PTDC/MAR/ 115226 / 2009), a post-doc grant to A. F. (SFRH/BPD/ 68673 / 2010) and through the Pluriannual Program (PEst-OE/MAR/UI 0331 / 2011), financed by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia...|$|E

40|$|The genus Atherina (<b>Sand-smelts)</b> is {{distributed}} in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, extending south along the African coast into the Indian Ocean (Quignard and Pras, 1986). It is a genus of small inshore fishes with many populations living in brackish and freshwater. The taxonomy of the genus has been troublesome due to the intraspecific variability {{of some of its}} species, the overlap of characters among many of them and because many nominal species were apparently described based on individuals originating from different localities...|$|R
40|$|Species with {{dispersal}} {{mediated by}} planktonic larvae {{are expected to}} be more likely to show temporal genetic variation, due to differences in larval mortality and dispersal ability. The shanny Lipophrys pholis is a typical benthic rocky intertidal fish and its dispersion is limited to its long larval stage. In contrast, the <b>sand-smelt</b> Atherina presbyter has a very short planktonic life, small size and weak swimming capabilities, which translates into reduced dispersion potential. A total of 226 specimens of L. pholis (collected in 2003, 2013 and 2014) and 281 of A. presbyter (collected in 2005, 2012, 2013 and 2014) were screened for genetic variation using the mitochondrial control region. Only 12 (out of 171) and 25 (out of 155) haplotypes found were shared between sampling periods for the shanny and the sand smelt, respectively. For both species, haplotype networks showed a deep genealogy with multiple levels of diversification and no temporal structure. Interestingly, some of the previously inferred missing haplotypes were sampled in more recent years. The genetic diversity indices showed little variation among sampling periods and were generally high. For L. pholis significant genetic differentiation was detected between 2013 and 2014, while no significant differences were detected between sampling periods in A. presbyter. The shanny showed lower effective population size per generation when compared to the <b>sand-smelt</b> (which yielded lack of evidence for genetic drift for the first and second period of the study). These results highlight the fact that temporal changes in the gene pool composition need to be considered when evaluating population structure, especially for species with long pelagic larval dispersion, more vulnerable to fluctuations in the recruitment...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} compounds {{of highly}} commercialised fresh Mediterranean seafood species, including seven fish (<b>sand-smelt</b> Atherina boyeri, picarel Spicara smaris, hake Merluccius merluccius, pilchard Sardina pilchardus, bogue Boobps boops, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and striped-mullet Mullus barbatus), squid (Loligo vulgaris), shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) and mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), {{were evaluated by}} simultaneous steam distillation-extraction and subsequent GC-MS analysis. A total of 298 volatile compounds were detected. The mussels contained the highest total concentration of volatile compounds, while pilchard among fish species contained the highest number and concentrations of volatile compounds. Individual patterns of volatile compounds have been distinguished. The fish species {{when compared to the}} shellfish species studied, contained 6 to 30 times more 1 -penten- 3 -ol, higher quantities of 2 -ethylfuran, and 2, 3 -pentanedione, which was absent from the shellfish species. Pilchard is characterized by a high concentration of alcohols, shrimps by the high presence of amines and S-compounds, while mussels by high amounts of aldehydes, furans, and N-containing compounds (pyridine, pyrazines and pyrrols).

40|$|The 2 m {{beam trawl}} and 1. 5 m push net {{were used to}} sample the small epibenthic fish {{assemblage}} during September on the east and south coasts of England. Fishing stations were distributed along the entire coast within four depth bands to 20 m. A total of 104 species were caught between 1973 and 1995, and these included infrequent Lusitanean species such as the big-scale <b>sand-smelt</b> (Atherina boyeri), and the undulate ray (Raja undulata), and infrequent boreal species such as the Norway haddock (Sebastes viviparus). Fifty-four taxa were selected as representative of the small, demersal inshore fish community that would be most vulnerable to capture by the two sampling gears, and were used in subsequent analyses of community structure. The north-east coast assemblage was the least diverse (H*= 1. 58) and least even (J*= 0. 47). It also supported the least number of species (55), and the variation in catch of the only dominant genus, Pomatoschistus spp., was partly responsible for large year-to-year variations in diversity and in the total population abundance of selected demersal species. On the east and south-east coasts, both diversity (H*= 1. 78 and 1. 93) and evenness (J*= 0. 50 and 0. 51) were greater than in the north, {{as a result of}} large...|$|E
25|$|The Sillaginidae, {{commonly}} known as the smelt-whitings, whitings, sillaginids, sand borers and <b>sand-smelts,</b> are a family of benthic coastal marine fish in the order Perciformes. The smelt-whitings inhabit a wide region covering much of the Indo-Pacific, from the west coast of Africa east to Japan and south to Australia. The family comprises only five genera and 35 species, of which a number are dubious, with the last major revision of the family in 1992 unable to confirm the validity of a number of species. They are elongated, slightly compressed fish, often light brown to silver in colour, with a variety of markings and patterns on their upper bodies. The Sillaginidae are not related to a number of fishes commonly called 'whiting' in the Northern Hemisphere, including the fish originally called whiting, Merlangius merlangus.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sand-smelts</b> {{are small}} fishes inhabiting inshore, {{brackish}} and freshwater environments {{and with a}} distribution in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, extending south into the Indian Ocean. Here, we present a broad phylogenetic analysis of the genus Atherina using three mitochondrial (control region, 12 S and 16 S) and two nuclear markers (rhodopsin and 2 nd intron of S 7). Phylogenetic analyses fully support the monophyly of the genus. Two anti-tropical clades were identified, separating the South African Atherina breviceps from the north-eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Atherina' species. In European waters, two groups were found. The first clade formed by a well supported species-pair: Atherina presbyter (eastern Atlantic) and Atherina hepsetus (Mediterranean), both living in marine waters; a second clade included Atherina boyeri (brackish and freshwater environments) and two independent lineages of marine punctated and non-punctated fishes, recently proposed as separate species. Sequence divergence values strongly suggest multiple species within the A. boyeri complex. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Enriched (δ 13 C values (annual average - 11 · 2 %) {{suggest that}} in the study site (Stagnone di Marsala, Italy) the sand smelt Atherina boyeri {{exploited}} benthic prey throughout the year. In particular, Mysidacea and Isopoda seemed to dominate the diet. Stomach content data from the literature was in partial agreement with the present isotopic analysis suggesting that, while Mysidacea and Isopoda are exploited by A. boyeri, Copepoda Harpacticoida and Amphipoda are the dominant food items of the sand smelt diet. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain such partially different results from the two techniques. Both season and size influenced the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of A. boyeri. Although throughout the sampling year, A. boyeri showed very enriched δ 13 C and δ 15 N values consistent with a diet based on benthic resources, it showed significant seasonal differences in both nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios. Such a finding suggests that the food preferences of A. boyeri undergo small seasonal differences, probably {{as a consequence of}} prey availability. Size also affected the isotopic composition of the <b>sand-smelt</b> indicating that this species shows ontogenetic diet shifts in the study site. Compared with other Mediterranean trophic data of the sand smelt these results substantiate the great adaptability of A. boyeri to the local environmental resources and its trophic plasticity. © 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.
