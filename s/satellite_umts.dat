40|$|The recent European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) {{decision}} to endorse for the Universal Telecommunication Radio Access (UTRA) techniques based upon Wideband-CDMA approaches for terrestrial UMTS (T-UMTS) paired frequency duplexing band will certainly constitute an important driver {{to steer the}} corresponding choice for the <b>satellite</b> <b>UMTS</b> (S-UMTS) component. In this paper it is shown how a similarity in the S-UMTS access solution not only contributes to making dual-mode user-terminals more cost-effective but also represents a good technical choice. This is {{despite the fact that}} the <b>satellite</b> <b>UMTS</b> component faces a number of unique challenging requirements, such as very scarce RF power resources compared to T-UMTS, significant propagation delay, high frequency variations due to Doppler shift (especially for the Low-altitude Earth Orbit (LEO) case), larger cell size. This paper describes the main ETSI UTRA modifications required to obtain an efficient S-UMTS air interface capable of suiting the above listed constraints, while keeping maximum commonality with the T-UMTS. 1...|$|E

40|$|W-CDMA and SW-CDMA air {{interfaces}} {{require that}} a user equipment {{in a given}} cell acquires slot and frame synchronization, and identifies the primary scrambling code used by the target cell before starting communications. This synchronization procedure is identified as cell search procedure in W-CDMA and beam search procedure in SW-CDMA. Notwithstanding the extensive commonalities between the two air interfaces, the two procedures are actually different. This paper aims at {{the evaluation of the}} false acquisition probability achievable by the two procedures in a scenario in which the receiver may experience both satellite and terrestrial radio propagation conditions. This is a sensible evaluation scenario since in the delivery of multicast-broadcast multimedia services, the <b>satellite</b> <b>UMTS</b> network represents an efficient complement to terrestrial UMTS, since its coverage is extended to indoor and urban areas through, for example, the use of terrestrial intermediate repeaters. In the paper, Rayleigh fading, Rice fading, and vehicular multipath propagation channels are used for the performance assessment...|$|E
40|$|The SAILOR {{project will}} {{implement}} a demonstrator, aiming at a complete integration between T-UMTS & S-UMTS. The demonstrator will add new functionalities that will exploit more efficiently {{the utilization of}} the satellite segment, provide a meaningful environment to implement more advanced multimedia services (broadcast, multicast) and allow a more advanced implementation of the UMTS Core Network. The demonstrator will consist of a real UMTS Core Network, to be developed through a completely innovative approach and of two emulated Access Networks. Moreover, {{in the framework of}} SAILOR project, an advanced Call Admission Control algorithm and an innovative Cellular Planning tool will be designed and implemented. At this purpose a proper Terrestrial and <b>Satellite</b> <b>UMTS</b> Access Network software simulator will be developed and implemented, with the goal of validating the abovementioned algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulated performance of several joint source and channel coding designs, for a <b>satellite</b> <b>UMTS</b> application involving {{audio and video}} telephony. For these services, source coding standards of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are combined with matched channel coding techniques. Two speech coding scenarios are proposed; a high quality design with a raw data rate of 8 kbits/s, using the ITU-T G. 729 standard, and a slightly lower quality design, using the ITU-T G. 723. 1 standard {{at a rate of}} 6. 3 kbits/s. In both designs, voice activation is assumed and simulated. The aggregate source coding bit rate for video telephony (voice plus video) is 64 kbits/s. In this multimedia service, the G. 723. 1 standard is used at 6. 3 kbits/s for the voice channel, while the ITU-T H. 263 standard is selected for video coding at 51. 2 kbits/s. The three mobile telephony services are studied through computer simulations, in slow and fast fading conditions typical of mobile satellite communications, with and without satellite diversity. The performance is expressed in terms of bit error rate (BER) before and after channel decoding, and in terms of subjective and objective quality measures. 1...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{on-board}} switches {{for space}} applications {{is not yet}} widespread because efficient switches for space applications do not exit yet. Unlike terrestrial switches, basically gigabit switches with almost unlimited buffer capacity, switches used inside a satellite payload suffer from {{the constraints of the}} space environment and from the following limitations: weight, power consumption, buffer capacity, frequency and temperature of functioning, available technology. Therefore, the architecture of the on-board switch should remain quite simple, and simultaneously the switch should provide some good performance. Moreover interoperability between the satellite system and the terrestrial networks should be provided. The satellite system possibly acts as an access network for the terminal (e. g. <b>Satellite</b> <b>UMTS)</b> or as a portion of the backbone. In any cases, it should be transparent to the top level applications and end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) should be provided. It means that the satellite system should support efficiently and transparently the QoS mechanisms implemented in all the overlying terrestrial networks. Especially, the satellite system should provide compatibility with connection oriented QoS mechanisms such as Integrated Services (Intserv [2]) and aggregated QoS mechanisms such as Diffserv [3] for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Therefore, it is quite straightforward that the on-board switch should fulfil two opposite requirements: on the one hand, as a key component of the satellite system, it should contribute to the QoS support for the high layer applications but o...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous {{wireless}} networking {{technologies such}} as <b>satellite,</b> <b>UMTS,</b> WiMax and WLAN {{are being used to}} provide network access for both voice and data services. In big cities, the densely populated areas like town centres, shopping centres and train stations may have coverage of multiple wireless networks. Traditional Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection algorithms are mainly based on the ¿Always Best Connected¿ paradigm whereby the mobile nodes are always directed towards the available network which has the strongest and fastest link. Hence a large number of mobile users may be connected to the more common UMTS while the other networks like WiMax and WLAN would be underutilised, thereby creating an unbalanced load across these different wireless networks. This high variation among the load across different co-located networks may cause congestion on overloaded network leading to high call blocking and call dropping probabilities. This can be alleviated by moving mobile users from heavily loaded networks to least loaded networks. This thesis presents a novel framework for load balancing in heterogeneous wireless networks incorporating the IEEE 802. 21 Media Independent Handover (MIH). The framework comprises of novel load-aware RAT selection techniques and novel network load balancing mechanism. Three new different load balancing algorithms i. e. baseline, fuzzy and neural-fuzzy algorithms have also been presented in this thesis that are used by the framework for efficient load balancing across the different co-located wireless networks. A simulation model developed in NS 2 validates the performance of the proposed load balancing framework. Different attributes like load distribution in all wireless networks, handover latencies, packet drops, throughput at mobile nodes and network utilization have been observed to evaluate the effects of load balancing using different scenarios. The simulation results indicate that with load balancing the performance efficiency improves as the overloaded situation is avoided by load balancing...|$|E
40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} rapid penetration of multimedia broadcast and multicast services over wire line networks (i. e. fixed networks) and this has largely been due to user demands and the technological advances in IP multicast. However, 2 nd Generation mobile networks {{have not been able}} to meet user demands for these services due to their inability to support high data rate services, or to provide efficient multicast techniques over mobile cellular networks. The 3 rd generation mobile terrestrial networks (T-UMTS) overcame one of the issues by allowing point-to-point high data rate services, but initial standardisation did not support an efficient way to deliver multimedia services, on a point-to-multipoint basis and this is only recently being addressed via the Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Services (MBMS) bearer model. With their inherent broadcast capabilities and larger geographical coverage, satellite networks form an attractive platform as a compliment to the terrestrial networks for delivery of such services. However, the standardisation process is still in early stages (compared to T-UMTS) of introducing similar MBMS bearer models to the 3 rd generation mobile satellite network (S-UMTS). To this end, this research investigates the possible improvements required to exiting S-UMTS specifications to facilitate MBM content over the satellite radio interface whilst addressing the reliability of the content delivery. The thesis presents; A comprehensive study of applicable reliability mechanisms to improve delivering of MBM content over the S-UMTS network. Development and performance demonstration of a novel Dynamic Rate Matching (DRM) procedure to improve the S-UMTS downlink power utilisation (proposed modification to the exiting specification). Proposal for S-UMTS RLC layer based PLFEC mechanism and performance evaluation. Proposal for and the performance demonstration of a power aware Adaptive PLFEC method to improve the reliability of the MBM content via S-UMTS network 9 whilst improving the radio resource utilisation. Finally, presented results have shown that when the proposed DRM procedure associates with the power aware APLFEC will; more efficiently utilise the scarce radio resources whilst providing better error protection levels (i. e. higher user satisfaction level) compared to the exiting MBM content delivery mechanisms used via <b>Satellite</b> <b>UMTS</b> radio access network...|$|E
