5000|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of polymerization {{is concerned}} with the difference in atom connectivity and spatial orientation in polymers that has the same chemical composition.Staudinger studied the stereoisomerism in chain polymerization of vinyl monomers in late 1920s, and it took another two decades for people to fully appreciate the idea that each of the propagation steps in the polymer growth could give rise to stereoisomerism. The major milestone in the stereochemistry was established by Ziegler and Natta and their coworkers in 1950s, as they developed metal based catalyst to synthesize <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymers.</b> The reason why the stereochemistry of the polymer is of particular interest is because the physical behavior of a polymer depends not only on the general chemical composition but also on the more subtle differences in microstructure. [...] Atactic polymers consist of a random arrangement of stereochemistry and are amorphous (noncrystalline), soft materials with lower physical strength. The corresponding isotactic (like substituents all on the same side) and syndiotactic (like substituents of alternate repeating units on the same side) polymers are usually obtained as highly crystalline materials. It is easier for the <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymers</b> to pack into a crystal lattice since they are more ordered and the resulting crystallinity leads to higher physical strength and increased solvent and chemical resistance as well as differences in other properties that depend on crystallinity. The prime example of the industrial utility of <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymers</b> is polypropene. Isotactic polypropene is a high-melting (165 °C), strong, crystalline polymer, which is used as both a plastic and fiber. Atactic polypropene is an amorphous material with an oily to waxy soft appearance that finds use in asphalt blends and formulations for lubricants, sealants, and adhesives, but the volumes are minuscule compared to that of isotactic polypropene.|$|R

Within the present RE series, the complex of the largest ion (Dy 3 +) exhibits the highest activity, achieving a high turnover frequency of 390 min- 1, and also produces the highly isotactic polymer PβMMBL (mm = 91. 0 %). This <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymer</b> is thermally robust, with a high glass-transition temperature of 280 C, and is resistant to all common organic solvents. Other half-sandwich RE catalysts of the series are also highly active and produce polymers with a similarly high isotacticity. Intriguingly, even simple homoleptic hydrocarbyl RE complexes, RE(CH 2 SiMe 3) 3 (THF) 2 (RE = Sc, Y, Dy, Lu), also afford highly isotactic polymer PβMMBL, despite their much lower polymerization activity, except for the Lu complex, which maintains its high activity for both types of complexes. Computational studies of both half-sandwich and simple hydrocarbyl yttrium complexes have revealed a stereocontrol mechanism that well explains the observed high stereoselectivity of βMMBL polymerization by both types of catalysts. Specifically, the experimental stereoselectivity can be well rationalized with a monometallic propagation mechanism through predominantly chain-end stereocontrol in the coordination-addition polymerization. In this mechanism, formation of an isotactic polymer chiefly originates from interactions between the methyl groups on the chiral β-C atom of the five-membered ring of both the coordinated monomer and the last inserted βMMBL unit of the chain, and the auxiliary ligand on the metal makes a negligible contribution to the stereocontrol of the polymerization. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E

Preparation of amine containing polymers is usually not straightforward due to the high reactivity of amino functionality. A feasible route to synthesize a simple amine polymer through hydrogenation of pyridine rings was demonstrated. Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of poly(vinylpyridine) s was carried out using various platinum metal catalysts to obtain saturated polymers, poly(vinylpiperidine) s. The hydrogenated polymers retain their well defined structures inherited from the precursor polymers, while they obtain unique characters such as water solubility, high basicity, and improved thermal stability which the precursor polymers do not possess. The <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymer,</b> isotactic poly(2 -vinylpiperidine) exhibits some helical conformation order in the solid state and in the solution state. ^ Heterogeneous hydrogenation of block copolymers containing vinylpyridine could yield polymers with fully hydrogenated for both blocks or selectively hydrogenated for one block. When the block copolymer has an olefinic unsaturated structure, hydrogenation reaction occurred in both olefinic and pyridine blocks. Hydrolysis and hydrogenation on poly(t-butylacrylate-b- 2 -vinylpyridine) gave us two kinds of polymers, poly(acrylic acid-b- 2 -vinylpyridine) and poly(acrylic acid-b- 2 -vinylpiperidine). The former was an amphiphilic polymer and the latter was a water soluble, amphoteric polymer. Poly(styrene-b- 2 -vinylpyridine) was hydrogenated selectively by tweaking of the reaction conditions. In stoichiometrically acidic condition, pyridine block was exclusively hydrogenated over styrene block. When hydrogenation was carried out in the selective solvent with strong acidic condition, the styrene block was selectively reduced. The morphology of well defined poly(styrene-b- 2 -vinylpiperidine) was investigated using TEM, STXM, and RSXS which shows a unique phase separation where piperidine blocks aggregate in sphere forms dispersed in polystyrene matrix. This morphology and thermal behavior of the hydrogenated block copolymer were found to be similar to those of ionomeric block copolymers. ^ Various vinyl polymers and diallyl amino cyclopolymers having heteroaromatic rings were also synthesized and hydrogenated. Poly(2 -vinylpyrazine) was readily hydrogenated to yield poly(2 -vinylpiperazine). Poly(2 -vinylpyrimidine), poly(2 -amino- 5 -vinylpyrimidine), poly(N,N-diallylamino- 2 -pyridine), and poly(N,N-diallylamino- 2 -pyrimidine) were partially hydrogenated to yield tetrahydro compounds. The resulting guanidine or amidine structures endowed these polymers with highly basic characters in aqueous solution.

40|$|Rh {{complexes}} such as [Rh(COD) Cl] 2 can polymerize phenylacetylene (PA) and p-methylphenylacetylene (p-MePA) in aqueous {{medium to}} give highly <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymers.</b> Additives such as NaCl reduce the stereoregularity of the polymers. As high yield {{has been reported}} for the polymerization of PA in triethylamine, the catalytic properties of Rh complexes with nitrogen containing ligands were studied. Our result shows that though the yields were improved, the stereoregularity of these polymers were reduced. Also, we have developed two water-soluble Rh-based catalyst systems capable of producing highly stereoregular (100 % cis-content) polymers in high yields. Moreover, a homogeneous and free-standing poly(phenylacetylene) membrane can be prepared directly by dropping the monomer at {{the surface of the}} catalyst solution within several seconds. New monomers of 3 -bromo- 4 -ethynylthiophene and 3 -ethynyl- 4 -(trimethylsilyl) thiophene were successfully polymerized using Mo- and W- based catalyst systems. Effects of catalysts, cocatalysts and temperature on their polymerizations were studied and the polymerization conditions for producing poly(thienylacetylenes) with minimum thiophene polymerization were optimized. In our studies on optical properties of substituted polyacetylenes, we found that transmission spectra of polyacetylenes shift horizontaIly to longer wavelengths when the concentration of the polymer solutions (c) increase. The transmission spectra at all the investigated concentrations are structureless, much like transmission curves of cut-off filters. The cut-off wavelength (λc) is defined as the wavelength at which light transmittance is 0. 1 %. Interestingly enough, by using different substituted polyacetylenes, λc can move over the whole visible spectral range. Besides, the experimental data for all the investigated polyacetylenes suggest an optical transmission relationship of λc=αlog 10 (bc) +k where α and k are constants and b is pathlength. The novel optical property of the substituted polyacetylenes may find usage in various aspects such as light filtration and colour imaging. Furthermore, as some of the polymerization systems employ water rather than organic solvents as polymerization medium, the process is environment friendly and the production cost is low. Hence, they have high potential in industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Slowly {{convergent}} or divergent sequences and series occur abundantly {{in quantum}} physics and quantum chemistry. These convergence {{problems can be}} overcome {{with the help of}} nonlinear sequence transformations (Wynn's epsilon or rho algorithm, Brezinski's theta algorithm, Levin's transformation, etc.) as for instance described in E.

A detailed description of the mathematical properties of these transformations is given. The nonlinear sequence transformations are applied for the evaluation of special or auxiliary functions by summing divergent asymptotic expansions via rational approximants, for the evaluation of complicated molecular multicenter integrals, for the summation of the divergent perturbation expansions of the anharmonic oscillators, or for the extrapolation of quantum chemical cluster calculations on <b>stereoregular</b> quasi-one-dimensional <b>polymers</b> to the infinite chain limit.

40|$|Polyaniline has {{attracted}} much interest {{due to its}} unusual physical properties. A polycondensation route to polyanilines is a desirable alternative to the currently used non-discriminating oxidative polymerization. The oxidative synthesis does not allow structural diversity in the monomer and the polymer's structure is not well defined. A synthetic route to polyanthraquinone diimines was recently developed in this laboratory. These pernigraniline analogs are similar in structure to the fully oxidized polyaniline and may display electrical conductivity and optoelectronic properties. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the incorporation of solubilizing substituents into the polyquinone diimine backbone, determine the molecular dynamics and microstructure of the polyquinone diimine through the use of model compounds, and reduce the polyquinone diimines to the emeraldine oxidation level. This dissertation accomplished the condensation polymerization of 1, 5 -di(oligo-(ethyleneoxy)) anthraquinones (EOn n = 1 - 3) and 1, 4 -, 1, 5 -, and 2, 6 -dioctyloxy-anthraquinones with both phenylenediamine and 4, 4 '-thiodianiline. Higher molecular weights were accomplished due to increased solubility. The polymers' microstructure and molecular dynamics were determined by X-ray crystallographic structure analysis and through NMR studies of model compounds. Model compounds and polymers were reduced by a hydrazine reduction method. <b>Stereoregular</b> <b>polymers</b> with molecular weights Mw, of 30, 000 were obtained with 4, 4 '-thiodianiline and polymers having Mw 10, 000 - 20, 000 were obtained with phenylene-diamine. Model compounds were synthesized from aniline and the corresponding anthraquinone to provide structural characterization for the polymers. The model compounds revealed that an anti configuration is obtained with 1, 5 -disubstituted anthraquinones, while a syn configuration is obtained with 1, 4 -disubstituted anthraquinones. X-Ray crystal structure determinations were essential in determining the conformations of the model compounds. Variable temperature NMR studies gave detailed information about the molecular dynamics of the polymer chains for all polyquinone diimines. A syn/anti-isomerization was identified for unhindered anthraquinone diimines and a unique butterfly inversion was discovered for all anthraquinone diimines. A reduction method using hydrazine and palladium was applied to the reduction of quinone diimines to produce the corresponding diamines. Polymer studies indicate no generation of an emeraldine analog upon reduction. 2, 6 - and 2, 5 -Dimethyl and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetramethyl benzoquinones were investigated as alternative quinones for obtaining emeraldine analogs...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{and mechanisms}} of the ring-opening polymerization of oxetane were studied using cationic and coordinated anionic catalysts. The cationic initiators used were BF 30 Et 2 !/ethanol, BF 30 Et 2 !/ethanediol and BF 30 Et 2 /propantriol. Kinetic determinations with the BF 30 Et 2 /diol system {{indicated that a}} 1 : 1 BF 3 : 0 H ratio gave the maximum rate of polymerization and this ratio was employed to detenmne the overall rates of polymerization. An overall second-order dependence was obtained when the system involved ethanediol or propantriol as co-catalyst and a 3 / 2 -order dependence with ethanol, in each case the monomer gave a first-order relationship. This suggested that two mechanisms accounted for the cationic polymerization. These mechanisms were investigated and further evidence for these {{was obtained from the}} study of the complex formation of BF 30 Et 2 and the co-catalysts by 1 H NMR. Molecular weight studies (using size-exclusion chromatography) indicated that the hydroxyl ion acted as a chain transfer reagent when the [OH] > [BF 3]. A linear relationship was observed when the number average molecular weight was plotted against [oxetane] at constant [BF 3 : 0 H], and similarly a linear dependency was observed on the BF 3 : 0 H 1 : 1 adduct at constant oxetane concentration. Copolymerization of oxetane and THF was carried out using BF 30 Et 2 /ethanol system. The reactivity ratios were calculated as rOXT = 1. 2 ± 0. 30 and rTHF = 0. 14 ± 0. 03. These copolymers were random copolymers with no evidence of oligomer formation. The coordinated anionic catalyst, porphinato-aluminium chloride [(TPP) AICl], was used to produce a living polymerization of oxetane. An overall third-order kinetics was obtained, with a second-order with respect to the [(TPP) AICl] and a first-order with respect to the [oxetane] and a mechanism was postulated using these results. The stereochemistry of [(TPP) AlCl] catalyst was investigated using cyclohexene and cyclopentene oxide monomers, using extensive 1 H NMR, 2 -D COSY and decoupling NMR techniques it was concluded that [(TPP) AlCl] gave rise to <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rh-mediated {{polymerization}} of carbenes gives {{access to}} new highly substituted and <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymers.</b> While this reaction {{is of interest}} for the synthesis of syndiotactic polymers that are functionalized at every carbon atom of the polymer backbone, the catalyst activation, chain-initiation, and chain-termination processes were so far poorly understood. In this publication we present new information about these processes {{on the basis of}} detailed end-group analyses, dilution-kinetic studies, and a comparison of the activity of well-defined catalysts containing a preformed Rh-C bond. All data point toward complex catalyst activation processes under the applied reaction conditions. The use of well-defined RhI(cod) -alkyl, aryl, and allyl complexes does not lead to better initiation efficiencies or higher polymer yields. MALDI-ToF MS of the oligomeric fractions indicates that during the incubation time of the reaction, the precatalysts are first transformed into oligomer forming species with a suppressed tendency toward β-hydrogen elimination, and accordingly a shift to saturated oligomeric chains that are terminated by protonolysis. Further catalyst modifications lead to a shift from atactic oligomerization to stereoregular high molecular weight polymerization activity. Dilution-kinetic studies reveal that under diluted conditions two different active species operate that differ largely in their chain-termination behavior. Analysis of the reaction products by MALDI-ToF MS also allows conclusions about chain-initiation and chain-termination. Chain-initiation can occur by insertion of a preformed carbene into a Rh-ligand or Rh-hydride bond or by (internal or external) nucleophilic attack of water and/or alcohol on a Rh-carbene moiety. Chain-termination takes place mainly by (nucleophilic) protonolysis involving water or alcohols, while β-H elimination plays only a minor role and is only observed for the shorter oligomers. The detection of ethoxy and hydroxyl end-groups demonstrates the importance of trace amounts of water and ethanol toward chain-initiation. Alcohols further function as a chain-transfer agent, and increasing the alcohol concentration accelerates the chain-transfer process (which remains however relatively slow compared to chain-propagation). On the basis of the chemical properties of the alcohols, we propose a chain-transfer mechanism involving nucleophilic attack of the alcohol (nucleophilic, σ-bond metathesis type, protonolysis). This further allows us to draw some (careful) new conclusions about the oxidation state of the actual polymerization species...|$|R
40|$|Films {{constituted}} by an achiral host polymer and an achiral guest chromophore, which exhibit intense chiral optical responses for both host and guest {{peaks in the}} infrared {{as well as in}} the UVvisible regions, have been obtained. Such films can have any thickness from the nanoscale up to the macroscopic scale. This unexpected chiral optical behavior is easily achieved by crystallization of a robust commercial <b>stereoregular</b> host <b>polymer</b> (syndiotactic polystyrene, s-PS) from the amorphous phase as induced by a nonracemic guest, followed by exchange of the nonracemic guest with the achiral guest, leading to the formation of polymer-host/chromophore-guest cocrystalline phases. This finding opens the possibility to achieve s-PS-based films with chiral optical response at selected wavelengths. It has been also found that the chiral optical cocrystalline phase of s-PS with azulene exhibits a monoclinic δ-clathrate form with equal proportions of left- and right-handed helices. This confirms that the observed chiral optical behavior arises by the nonracemic native morphology of the crystalline regions, which has been induced by the temporary nonracemic guest...|$|R
40|$|Publications about olefin {{metathesis}} {{will generally}} discuss how the discovery {{and development of}} well-defined catalysts {{to carry out this}} unique transformation have revolutionized many fields, from natural product and materials chemistry, to green chemistry and biology. However, until recently, an entire manifestation of this methodology had been inaccessible. Except for a few select examples, metathesis catalysts favor the thermodynamic trans- or E-olefin products in cross metathesis (CM), macrocyclic ring closing metathesis (mRCM), ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and many other types of reactions. Judicious choice of substrates had allowed for the direct synthesis of cis- or Z-olefins or species that could be converted upon further reaction, however the catalyst controlled synthesis of Z-olefins was not possible until very recently. Research into the structure and stability of metallacyclobutane intermediates has led to the proposal of models to impart Z-selectivity in metathesis reactions. Having the ability to influence the orientation of metallacyclobutane substituents to cause productive formation of Z- double bonds using steric and electronic effects was highly desired. The first successful realization of this concept was by Schrock and Hoveyda et al. who synthesized monoaryloxide pyrolidine (MAP) complexes of tungsten and molybdenum that promoted Z-selective CM. The Z-selectivity of these catalysts was attributed to the difference {{in the size of the}} two axial ligands. This size difference influences the orientation of the substituents on the forming/incipient metallacyclobutane intermediate to a cis-geometry and leads to productive formation of Z-olefins. These catalysts have shown great utility in the synthesis of complicated natural product precursors and <b>stereoregular</b> <b>polymers.</b> More recently, ruthenium catalysts capable of promoting Z-selective metathesis have been reported by our group and others. This thesis will discuss the development of ruthenium-based NHC chelated Z-selective catalysts, studies probing their unique metathesis mechanism, and synthetic applications that have been investigated thus far. Chapter 1 will focus on studies into the stability of NHC chelated complexes and the synthesis of new and improved stable chelating architectures. Chapter 2 will discuss applications of the highly active and Z-selective developed in Chapter 1, including the formation of lepidopteran female sex pheromones using olefin cross metathesis and highly Z- and highly E-macrocycles using macrocyclic ring closing metathesis and Z-selective ethenolysis. Chapter 3 will explore studies into the unique mechanism of olefin metathesis reactions catalyzed by these NHC chelated, highly Z-selective catalysts, explaining observed trends by investigating the stability of relevant, substituted metallacyclobutane intermediates. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ring-opening}} polymerizations of the dilactones glycolide and the S,S- and S,R-stereoisomers of lactide {{were studied}} using quantum mechanical methods. The ring strain and the conformational distribution of these cyclic monomers {{and of the}} polymers were calculated, {{and the effect of}} the medium on the polymerization was predicted, for both bulk and solution. The polymerizability of the three monomers in the gas phase, that is, nonpolar medium, is much greater than that of d-valerolactone or 1, 4 -dioxan- 2 -one. This difference vanishes in the polar medium chloroform, which is attributed to the fact that, while all of these monomers possess polar cis-lactone bonds, the three dilactones possess small dipole moments. The data are combined to give polymerization enthalpy and free energy values. The four <b>stereoregular</b> lactide <b>polymers</b> did not differ significantly in energy. Accordingly, the ability to synthesize any one of these rests on catalyst specificity (‘‘polymer chain-end control’’). Although introduction of sterically demanding methyl groups into glycolide is expected to favor coiled conformations and decrease polymerizability, this was not found to be the case. Good agreement of calculated values with experimental data from the literature was achieved. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
