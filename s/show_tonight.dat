500|$|In 1993, Bana {{made his}} {{television}} debut on Steve Vizard's late night talk <b>show,</b> <b>Tonight</b> Live. His performance gained {{the attention of}} producers from the sketch comedy series, Full Frontal, who invited him to join the show {{as a writer and}} performer. During his four years on the show, Bana wrote much of his own material, and based some of his characters on members of his family. His impressions of Columbo, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Tom Cruise made Bana popular with the show's audience. This success led him to record the comedy album Out of Bounds in 1994 and to host his own television special, titled Eric, in 1996. The show, a collection of sketches featuring everyday characters, prompted him to launch a sketch comedy series The Eric Bana Show. The series, written and performed by Bana, featured skits, stand-up and celebrity guests, but failed to attract a substantial audience and was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings. Even so, in 1997, he received a Logie Award for [...] "Most Popular Comedy Personality" [...] for his work on the show.|$|E
