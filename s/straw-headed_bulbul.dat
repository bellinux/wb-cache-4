50|$|The <b>straw-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Sturnus. Alternate names for the <b>straw-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> include the star-crowned bulbul, straw-crowned bulbul and yellow-crowned bulbul.|$|E

50|$|The <b>straw-headed</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus zeylanicus) is {{a species}} of {{songbird}} in the bulbul family, Pycnonotidae. It is found from the Malay Peninsula to Borneo. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, arable land, plantations, and rural gardens. It is threatened by habitat loss and poaching.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened. These include vulnerable Chinese egrets, greater spotted eagles and <b>straw-headed</b> <b>bulbuls,</b> endangered Nordmann's greenshanks and critically endangered spoon-billed sandpipers, as well as greater crested terns.|$|R
50|$|The greater racket-tailed drongo {{is one of}} {{the most}} common birds at Bukit Timah (Dicrurus paradiseus). The drongos often follow monkeys through the forest and eat insects that are exposed by the monkeys' actions. Other bird species include the Asian fairy bluebird (Irena puella), the red-crowned barbet (Megalaima rafflesii) and the common emerald dove (Chalcophaps indica). Bukit Timah is one of only two places in Singapore where the red-crowned barbet is found, the other being the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. The reserve, along with the {{adjacent}} Central Catchment Nature Reserve, has been identified by BirdLife International as the Central Forest Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of vulnerable <b>straw-headed</b> <b>bulbuls</b> and brown-chested jungle flycatchers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nature reserve}} boasts a rich {{biodiversity}} with over 500 animal species including crab-eating macaque, colugo, common treeshrew {{and even the}} Sunda pangolin. The critically endangered species of Raffles' banded langur (banded leaf monkeys) can only {{be found in the}} Central Catchment Nature Reserve. [...] Wild birds such as crimson sunbird, greater racket-tailed drongo and kingfishers are found in the reserve, too. Some species of critically endangered bats have also been spotted. The reserve has many species of butterflies. It is home to some 1,600 species of flora. The reserve, along with the adjacent Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, has been identified by BirdLife International as the Central Forest Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of vulnerable <b>straw-headed</b> <b>bulbuls</b> and brown-chested jungle flycatchers.|$|R
5000|$|Bulbuls are short-necked slender passerines. The tails {{are long}} and the wings short and rounded. In almost all species the bill is {{slightly}} elongated and slightly hooked at the end. They vary in length from 13 cm for the tiny greenbul to 29 cm in the <b>straw-headed</b> <b>bulbul.</b> Overall the sexes are alike, although the females tend to be slightly smaller. In a few species the differences are so great {{that they have been}} described as functionally different species. The soft plumage of some species is colorful with yellow, red or orange vents, cheeks, throat or supercilia, but most are drab, with uniform olive-brown to black plumage. Species with dull coloured eyes often sport contrasting eyerings. Some have very distinct crests. Bulbuls are highly vocal, with the calls of most species being described as nasal or gravelly. One author described the song of the brown-eared bulbul as [...] "the most unattractive noises made by any bird".|$|E
40|$|The bulbuls {{are one of}} {{the bird}} {{families}} most threatened by the bird trade, with the <b>Straw-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> Pycnonotus zeylanicus being the most sought after (Nash 1993, Shepherd 2006, BirdLife International 2013) â€”its rich, melodious song makes it extremely popular in songbird competitions and to hobbyists, which has resulted in intense trapping for both the domestic and the international trades (BirdLife International 2001, 2013, Shepherd et al. 2004, Jepson & Ladle 2005). Whilst habitat loss has played a subsidiary role in the demise of this species, demand from the trade has decimated the <b>Straw-headed</b> <b>Bulbul</b> throughout much of its range (Shepherd 2006, BirdLife International 2013). The species was formerly native to souther...|$|E
