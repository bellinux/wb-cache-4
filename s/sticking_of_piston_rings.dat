40|$|Automotive {{engine is}} one of the {{internal}} combustion engines in which combustion of mixture (air-fuel) burn internally. It contain different parts which are to relate together to have required engine efficiency. Among these parts is the piston which contains the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> that maintains a perfect seal between the cylinder wall and the piston. The dimensional relationship <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> determines the degree by which their seats in the groove <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> thereby determine the efficiency of the compression of the engine which affects the output of the engine.

With the failure time as a criterion, the rank order is as follows: NCM/Fe > CKS/Fe.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is concerned with developing a greater understanding <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> lubrication and consists of both experimental and theoretical components. It begins with a review <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> and ring pack lubrication studies, describing how {{the understanding of the}} operation <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> has progressed since the late 19 th Century. A well-established method of analysing the hydrodynamic lubrication <b>of</b> a single <b>piston</b> <b>ring,</b> utilizing coordinate data to describe the ring face profile, is then presented. Calculation of mixed/boundary friction, when the lubricant film thickness falls below a pre-determined level, is included. The predictions of this program are then compared to results obtained by other workers to validate its operation. This analysis is then developed to investigate the influence of the circumferential variation in <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> face profile on the lateral motion <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> centre. The complex relationship between variation in ring face profile, angular ring gap position and bore shape is then examined. These features are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the calculation of ring centre locus, oil transport and lubricant film thicknesses. The model is then applied to predict the influence of the distorted bore shape of a cylinder from an experimental engine apparatus. Following this, the development, testing, calibration and performance of a capacitance based measurement system capable <b>of</b> recording <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> face profiles on a single pass, is described. This system was used with twenty-one transducers, of novel design, to allow the axial and circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness to be monitored on an engine liner. This liner was fitted in an engine apparatus which had the additional facility of being able to measure the instantaneous friction between the piston assembly and cylinder liner using a "floating liner" technique. Experimental measurements of instantaneous friction force and the circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness are then compared to theoretical predictions for a range of operating conditions. The comparisons reveal a reasonable level of agreement between measurements with consistent overall trends. The effect of varying bore distortion is also examined theoretically. It is shown that an increase in the severity of bore distortion does not necessarily result in an increase in net oil transport...|$|R

In this paper, the {{finite element method}} (FEM) was applied to study the non-uniform pressure distributions among the <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> and the friction process between the self-lubricating <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> and the cylinder wall, which influence the failure <b>of</b> the self-lubricated <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> most.

40|$|Problem formulation. <b>Piston</b> <b>rings</b> {{are subject}} to wear while in operation. Insufficient wear {{resistance}} of materials limits the growth of machines productivity {{as well as the}} terms of their exploitation. The required complex <b>of</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> made <b>of</b> cast iron cannot be always reached by applying traditional methods of heat treatment or chemical heat treatment processing. Thus, application of traditional borating methods associated with diffusion of boron into the solid phase leads to the formation of the working layer exhibiting high brittleness. Therefore, the problem of increasing the wear resistance <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> without embrittlement is challenging. The use oflaser heating during borating provides the formation of a new layer with special properties. However, the optimum properties can be achieved only after determining the relationship between the parameters of running a process and the depth of the borated layer. Goal of research. To determine the influence of laser heating parameters on the depth of the borated layer, as the properties <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> depend on the depth of the latter. Conclusions. Increase in the speed of displacing parts during laser heating reduces the depth of the borated layer, and increase of the spot diameter enhances the depth of the layer. The phases and structural components of the borated layer were interpreted by means of X-ray and metallographic methods. The results of investigations can be applied to other machine parts, which {{are subject to}} intensive wear...|$|R

40|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, steam engines, air compressors, and so forth, the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> {{plays an important}} role. Especially, the recent development of Diesel engines which require a high compression pressure for their working, makes, nowadays, the packing action <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> {{far more important than}} ever. Though a number of papers have been published in regard to researches on the problem <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>ring,</b> none has yet dealt with an exact measurement of pressure exerted on the cylinder wall at any given point of the ring. The only paper that can be traced on this subject so far is Mr. Nakagawa's report on the determination of the relative distribution of pressure on the cylinder wall, but the measuring method adopted therein appears to need further consideration. No exact idea has yet been obtained as to how the obturation of gas between the piston and cylinder, the frictional resistance <b>of</b> the <b>piston,</b> and the wear of the cylinder wall are affected by the intensity and the distribution of the radial pressure <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>ring.</b> Consequently, the author has endeavored, by employing an apparatus of his own invention, to get an exact determination of the pressure distribution <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>ring.</b> By means <b>of</b> a newly devised ring tester, to which piezoelectricity of quartz was applied, the distribution of the radial pressure of many sample rings on the market was accurately determined. Since many famous <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> show very irregular pressure distribution, the author investigated and achieved a manufacturing process <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> which will exert uniform pressure on the cylinder wall.
