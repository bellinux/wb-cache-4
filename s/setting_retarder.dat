The aim of this work is finding the suitable retarder that most extends the time of setting and also preserves the mechanical properties of alkali-activated material. In experimental section were prepared samples of blast furnace slag, water glass, water and additives in various weight addition. Testing samples have undergone of flexural and compressive strength tests. Then the setting time was determined using the Vicat device. The samples were measured calorimetrically because of monitoring the setting process.

40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of magnesium potassium phosphate cement (MKPC) {{during the early}} reaction period has been monitored by isothermal conduction calorimetry at 298 K. It is found that the typical heat evolution curve of the MKPC hydration has one endothermic valley and two distinct exothermic peaks. It is believed that the endothermic valley corresponds to the dissolution of potassium dihydrogen phosphate and the exothermic peaks {{are related to the}} dissolution of magnesia and the formation of magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate, respectively. The influences of the water to powder ratio, the magnesium to phosphate molar ratio and the <b>setting</b> <b>retarder</b> content on the reaction can be reflected in a change of shape and intensity of the peaks on the heat flow curve. The variation trend is consistent with the change of the setting time of MKPC pastes...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{physical}} properties and hydration products of slag cement that was prepared by activating ground granulated {{blast furnace slag}} with commercial lime and plaster of Paris (POP) as activators. The consistency, setting times and soundness of various mixes of slag-lime-POP is reported. The hydration products and formation of bonds in the paste during setting were studied {{with the help of}} SEM, FTIR and XRD tests and the same are correlated to the hydration process. The setting times of the mixes are found to be lower than that of the value prescribed for ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Borax is used as a <b>setting</b> <b>retarder</b> and a borax content of 0.4  % by mass gives setting times that are normally prescribed for OPC. In the early stages of setting C–A–S–H gels are found in this cementing material instead of C–S–H gel, as generally observed in the OPC.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the possible displacement of natural gypsum (CaSO(4) (.) 2 H(2) O) in cement with an alternative <b>setting</b> <b>retarder,</b> such as the industrial by-product derived from flue gas desulfurization process called FGD gypsum. These calcium-sulfate-bearing materials (CSBM), alone or in mixtures, were ground with clinker both in laboratory and industrial scale to examine their influence on the physical and mechanical properties of cement, as well as on the industrial production line of cement. From the present work, it is extracted that the use of mixtures of sulfate-bearing materials with gypsum seems to be advantageous for the actual control of setting time. The addition of FGD gypsum increases setting time without affecting compressive strength profile. During the industrial trial, the formation of hemihydrate form of calcium sulfate dihydrate has a profound regulatory effect on the setting and strength performance of the cement partially replaced with FGD gypsum.

40|$|The use {{of boron}} {{compounds}} as composites of cementitious, {{except for the}} limited usage conditions like <b>setting</b> <b>retarder</b> has not become widespread because of the hardening and the related problems. In this study, {{the effects of the}} boron compounds into hydration process of the different cement types and controllability of these effects was investigated. Portland cement, boron modified active belite cement, and calcium aluminate cement were used in the mortar mixtures as binder material. Except for the control mixture, boric acid (BA) was used at the ratios of 0. 25 – 1. 00 % of weight of cement in mortar mixtures with Portland cement. Setting times dependent on pH, EC and T changes of fresh mortars were measured. With increasing BA concentration, setting times of the mortars rather increased, pH, electrical conductivity, and T values of the mortars significantly reduced. To suppress the affect of BA on the hydration process, the two various stabilizers were used in the mortars, setting times, pH, electrical conductivity, and T values of these mortars were measured again. As a result, the optimum workability times and the parameters of the hydration reaction taking into account, the most suitable type and usage ratio of stabilizer were determined for mortars with BA...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium {{potassium}} phosphate cement (MKPC) {{is a kind}} of cementitious binder in which the chemical bond is formed via a heterogeneous acid-base reaction between dead burned magnesia powder and {{potassium phosphate}} solution at room temperature. Small amount of boron compounds can be incorporated in the cement as a <b>setting</b> <b>retarder.</b> The final reaction product of MgO-KH 2 PO 4 -H 2 O ternary system is identified as magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate, MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O. However, the mechanisms and procedures through which this crystalline product is formed and the conditions under which the crystallization process would be influenced are not yet clear. Understanding of the reaction mechanism of the system is helpful for developing new methodologies to control the rapid reaction process and furthermore, to adjust the phase assemblage of the binder, and to enhance the macroscopic properties. This study is mainly focused on the examination of the reaction mechanism of MKPC. In addition, the formulation optimization, microstructure characterization and field application in rapid repair are also systematically studied. The chemical reactions between magnesia and potassium dihydrogen phosphate are essentially an acid-base reaction with strong heat release, the pH and temperature variation throughout the reaction process could provide useful information to disclose the different stages in the reaction. However, {{it would be very difficult}} to conduct such tests on the cement paste due to the limited water content and fast setting. In the current research, the reaction mechanism of MKPC is investigated on the diluted MKPC system through monitoring the pH and temperature development, identification of the solid phase formed, and measurement of the ionic concentration of the solution. The reaction process can be explained as follows: when magnesia and potassium phosphate powder are mixed with water, phosphate is readily dissolved, which is instantly followed by the dissociation of magnesia. With the increase of magnesium ions in the solution, MgHPO 4 · 7 H 2 O is the first product precipitated, and its crystallization is accompanied with the increase of both pH and temperature. Beyond pH of 7, MgHPO 4 · 7 H 2 O is transformed to Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O, leading to a slight decrease of pH. The following dramatic increase of pH may be due to the formation of Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O. Finally, Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O gradually transforms to MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O and leads to the second decrease of pH. Both increasing molar ratio of magnesium to phosphate (M/P) and decreasing the weight ratio of liquid to solid can speed up the reaction rate while addition of small amount of boron compounds can prolong the process even though the products are not changed. The retarding mechanism of boron compounds is related to their buffering effect on the pH of the solution, i. e. decreasing pH development rate, leads to delaying the formation of reaction products. The performance of MKPC based cementitious materials can be significantly influenced by M/P molar ratio, addition of <b>setting</b> <b>retarder,</b> water content, fly ash replacement of magnesia and aggregate usage. Therefore, the formulation of MKPC based materials is optimized in terms of workability, compressive strength, and cost consideration. With optimized formulation, MKPC mortars show high early compressive and flexural strength, superior bond strength to ordinary Portland cement mortar/concrete substrate, and low drying shrinkage. Undoubtedly, the mechanical properties of this cement is closely related to its inner composition and microstructure. The microstructure examination shows that the phase assemblage and the morphology characteristics of MKPC paste vary with the different formulae. In the formulation with lower M/P ratio of 2, KH 2 PO 4 residues can be found in a flat, smooth, and bulky mass form. The reaction product MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O, can be observed as acicular crystal habit with large aspect ratio of 30. With the increase of M/P ratio, MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O is crystallized in a larger size and the morphology is changed from acicular to bladed and then prismatic shape. The magnesia residues can be well identified in all of the formulations...|$|E

In this research, the viscosity of plasticized cement pastes has been investigated for different dosages of sodium gluconate (SG). Isothermal calorimetric measurements confirmed the delay in hydration kinetics due to the SG addition. Viscosity measurements showed that the increasing dosage of SG lowered the viscosity of the cement paste. The adsorption of the SG was quantified and {{it appeared that the}} lower viscosity was a result of the lower particle volume fraction due to the exclusion of water for high dosages of SG. Moreover, zeta-potential measurements were performed and it was elaborated that for a similar degree of hydration lower viscosity was achieved, due to better electrostatic repulsion.

40|$|The authors {{provide their}} {{research}} findings concerning lightweight masonry mortars with hollow glass microspheres and antifreeze admixtures. These mortars {{are used in}} the construction of filler structures at negative temperatures. The application of multilayer filler structures causes reduction of their thermal homogeneity factor. Therefore, single-layer filler structures have the strongest potential. There is a need to employ lightweight masonry mortars to ensure the thermal homogeneity of structures made of lightweight concrete blocks. The masonry mortar that has traditional weight reduction fillers (such as inflated pearlite, vermiculite etc.) demonstrate low strength properties, as such fillers have a high water content. Hollow glass (or ceramic) microspheres are known as efficient fillers for lightweight mortars. Multiple research undertakings contain information on the masonry mortar that has the following properties: average density of dry mortar - 450 kg/m 3, thermal conductivity factor - 0. 17 W/(m·°C), compressive strength at the age of 28 days - 3. 2 MPa, water retention rate - over 90 %. The climatic conditions of Russia determine the need to perform masonry works at negative temperatures. Adding antifreeze admixtures is an easy and cheap method that guarantees hydration of the Portland-cement at negative temperatures. The subject of this research covers masonry mortars that have a 15 % hollow glass microsphere content and antifreeze admixtures. Contemporary antifreeze admixtures are multifunctional. Therefore, traditional antifreeze admixtures such as sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, sodium formate, potash were used in the research. The per-cent content of antifreeze admixtures was calculated. The following properties of masonry mortars with a 15 % content of hollow glass microspheres and antifreeze admixtures were identified: average mortar and mortar mixture density, setting time, water retention, compressive and bending strength, and water absorption. Standard research methods were employed. Every mortar has an 8 cm mobility. The benchmark mixture has an average density of 1. 085 kg/ m 3, average cement stone density of 980 kg/m 3, compressive strength at the age of 28 days - 19. 8 MPa, water retention rate - 97 %, setting time - 4. 5 hours. The attention was driven to the strength analysis of mortars with hollow glass microspheres and antifreeze admixtures at positive and negative temperatures. The authors proved that antifreeze admixtures demonstrated a negative influence on the strength and setting time of the mortar if hardened at 20 °C. The strength of mortars with antifreeze admixtures was below that of the benchmark mortar. Mortars that had sodium nitrite and sodium chloride demonstrated better results, while the mortar with calcium chloride showed the lowest strength. Sodium nitrite, sodium formate and potash were mostly efficient at negative temperatures. The mortar with sodium nitrite demonstrated the highest strength, as it had hardened at the positive temperature. Optimal mixtures for the temperature of - 10 °C were developed by the math planning method. The results of the microstructure analysis for optimized mixtures are provided in the article. The finding of the authors are that at the temperature of - 10 °С the following mixtures have the best properties: lightweight masonry mortars with hollow glass microspheres and sodium nitrite (7 %), or sodium formate (5 %), or potash (7 %) with a <b>setting</b> <b>retarder</b> added.

This approach may help eliminate the environmentally polluting black liquor waste. It also provides a low cost by-product, which can be widely used in the construction industry. The properties of black liquor and its performance on concrete at two different ratios of water to cement have been studied. The results revealed that black liquor from rice straw pulp increases concrete workability, improves compaction, and reduces honeycombing. Moreover, it retards the initial and final set time and enhances uniform compaction. The effect of incorporating small portions of silica fume has been investigated.

40|$|Synopsis [...] The heat of {{hydration}} {{in massive}} concrete structures can raise the temperature to a level where thermal cracks etc can pose a problem. Hardening retarders are admixtures that lower the rate of hydration, distribute the heat release over time and lower maximum temperature in concrete. Such admixtures will inherently lead to lower early strength, but should lead to comparable 28 days strength to reference concrete. Relative large amounts of urea works, in particular when the additional retardation of setting (not hardening) is counteracted by the set accelerator calcium nitrate. However, these dosages are high, and urea will also slowly decompose to ammonia that may limit the urea application to outdoor use, if any. The latest potential admixtures are combinations of minor amounts of strong <b>setting</b> <b>retarders</b> like organic acids (0. 1 - 0. 3 %) with the setting accelerator calcium nitrate (1 - 3 %), where a true synergy between the two leads to hardening retardation.

The hardened materials were characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray computed tomography, and combined scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and tested for mechanical strength. With increasing temperature, a higher number of phase transitions in non-retarded specimens was found as a result of fast cement hydration. The differences in the phase compositions were also attributed to tartaric acid interactions with metal ions released by the blend in retarded samples. The retarded samples showed higher total porosity but reduced percentage of large pores (above 500 µm) and greater compressive strength after 300 °C curing.

The sulphate content within SMCA was utilised in this investigation as: (A) a <b>set</b> <b>retarder,</b> replacing calcium sulphate in PC and (B) a sulphate activator of pulverised fuel ash (PF A) in PF AlPC blends. Results demonstrated that SMCA was effective at both retarding set in PC and chemically activating PF A in PF AlPC blends. Moreover, in both applications, mineralogical changes and compressive strength results during the fIrst 24 hours of hydration indicated {{that the presence of}} SMCA in PC accelerated the early hydration and strength development (lday) compared to PC without SMCA. However, the long-term strength (at 90 days) was detrimentally affected when SMCA was present within either PC or PCfPF A blends.

40|$|Sodium {{gluconate}} {{is known}} to be a strong <b>set</b> <b>retarder</b> of cement. Many studies have been devoted to the interactions between cement and gluconate at early ages but the true mechanisms of this retardation is not yet elucidated. The most important phase in cement is alite which is a tricalcium silicate containing impurities. Tricalcium silicate hydration leads to the nucleation and growth of calcium silicate hydrates which are responsible for setting and hardening of cement paste. This work is devoted to the influence of sodium gluconate on the early hydration, period during which calcium silicate hydrates should nucleate and begin to grow on anhydrous grains. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} delay before acceleration of hydration, i. e. calcium silicate hydrates growth, mainly depends on this period. The systematic follow up of ionic concentrations of diluted system suspensions during hydration of pure C 3 S and also cement enable to study the C-S-H nucleation-growth period. During hydration of pure C 3 S, a complex calcium-gluconate adsorbs on first C-S-H nuclei and prevents them from growing. During hydration of cement, there is mainly formation of a complex aluminium-gluconate, aluminium coming from aluminate phases dissolution. This complex also prevents first precipitated C-S-H nuclei from growing...|$|R
40|$|Various {{additives}} {{were tested}} as <b>setting</b> <b>retarders</b> of the beta-tricalcium phosphate-monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (beta-TCP-MCPM) cements. Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP), {{calcium sulphate dihydrate}} (CSD) and calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CSH) were found to increase the setting time from 30 s to about 10 min. Moreover, the use of CSH resulted in a marked increase of the final diametral strength of the cement, which could be raised from 1 MPa to about 3 MPa. The best results were obtained when CSH and CPP were added together to the cement, while the addition of CSD and CPP alone only retarded the setting, without improving the final strength. A particular cement composition (64 wt% beta-TCP, 16 wt% MCPM, 15 wt% CSH and 5 wt% CPP), selected for its optimum final strength, was aged in vitro for 8 d at 37 degrees C in saline solution (0. 9 wt% NaCl in water). After a moderate decrease, the diametral strength of the specimen was found to level off at about 60 % of its initial value (3. 2 MPa), for ageing times beyond 1 d. This behaviour has been ascribed to the progressive dissolution of the CSD fraction of the hardened cement, compensated by the crystallization of further amounts of DCPD...|$|R

In this work, a new process of synthesis of an iodate-substituted hydroxyapatite {{by means of a}} cementation route is described. This material was obtained from a mixture of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP), tricalcium phosphate (αTCP) and sodium iodate (NaIO 3), taken in a molar ratio of 1 / 2 / 0. 5. The progress of the reaction leading to the setting and hardening of cement paste was monitored by combined measurements of electrical conductivity and heat flux release, together with XRD characterization of materials at definite times of hydration. Sodium iodate acts as a <b>set</b> <b>retarder,</b> by leading to the precipitation of non-cohesive transient phases, which are then destabilized when the massive precipitation of hydroxyapatite occurs.

The insoluble solids took longer to settle in the new sample which was interpreted as indicating finer particles in the current sample. The saltstone formulation developed for the September 2005 Tank 50 Batch 0 sample was confirmed for the May 2006 sample with one minor exception. Saltstone prepared with the Tank 50 sample collected in May 2006 required 1. 5 times more Daratard 17 set retarding admixture than the saltstone prepared with the September In addition, a sample prepared with lower shear mixing (stirring with a spatula) had a higher plastic viscosity (57 cP) than samples made with higher shear mixing in a blender (23 cP). The static gel times of the saltstone slurries made with low shear mixing were also shorter ({approx} 32 minutes) than those for comparable samples made in the blender ({approx} 47 minutes). The addition of the various waste streams (ETP, HEU-HCAN, and GPE-HCAN) to Tank 50 from September 2005 to May 2006 has increased the amount of <b>set</b> <b>retarder,</b> Daratard 17, required for processing saltstone slurries through the Saltstone facility. If these streams are continued {{to be added to}} Tank 50, the quantity of admixtures required to maintain the same processing conditions for the Saltstone facility will probably change and additional testing is recommended to reconfirm the Tank 50 Saltstone formulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Auxiliary brake sets {{had been}} widely used for heavy duty trucks and {{advanced}} buses. They {{played a role}} of split-flow braking load of main brake system. As one of auxiliary brake <b>sets</b> eddy current <b>retarder</b> had good braking performance and braking stability, and it is automotive and maintain constant speed by its continual braking. In this paper, key technologies of eddy current retarder, such as braking torque, working volt and current, magnetic circuit, material of rotor plate and iron, heat dissipation performance of rotor plate, match between eddy current retarded and automobile, and effect of temperature rise on its braking performance were presented and discussed in detail. Meanwhile, advantage and disadvantage of eddy current retarder were analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The cleanup {{activities}} of the Hanford tank wastes require stabilization and solidification of the secondary waste streams generated from the processing of the tank wastes. The treatment of these tank wastes to produce glass waste forms will generate secondary wastes, including routine solid wastes and liquid process effluents. Liquid wastes may include process condensates and scrubber/off-gas treatment liquids from the thermal waste treatment. The current baseline for solidification of the secondary wastes is a cement-based waste form. However, alternative secondary waste forms are being considered. In this regard, Ceramicrete technology, developed at Argonne National Laboratory, is being explored as an option to solidify and stabilize the secondary wastes. The Ceramicrete process has been demonstrated on four secondary waste formulations: baseline, cluster 1, cluster 2, and mixed waste streams. Based on the recipes provided by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the four waste simulants were prepared in-house. Waste forms were fabricated with three filler materials: Class C fly ash, CaSiO{sub 3 }, and Class C fly ash + slag. Optimum waste loadings were as high as 20 wt. % for the fly ash and CaSiO{sub 3 }, and 15 wt. % for fly ash + slag filler. Waste forms for physical characterizations were fabricated with no additives, hazardous contaminants, and radionuclide surrogates. Physical property characterizations (density, compressive strength, and 90 -day water immersion test) showed that the waste forms were stable and durable. Compressive strengths were > 2, 500 psi, and the strengths remained high after the 90 -day water immersion test. Fly ash and CaSiO{sub 3 } filler waste forms appeared to be superior to the waste forms with fly ash + slag as a filler. Waste form weight loss was {approx} 5 - 14 wt. % over the 90 -day immersion test. The majority of the weight loss occurred during the initial phase of the immersion test, indicative of washing off of residual unreacted binder components from the waste form surface. Waste forms for ANS 16. 1 leach testing contained appropriate amounts of rhenium and iodine as radionuclide surrogates, along with the additives silver-loaded zeolite and tin chloride. The leachability index for Re was found to range from 7. 9 to 9. 0 for all the samples evaluated. Iodine was below detection limit (5 ppb) for all the leachate samples. Further, leaching of sodium was low, {{as indicated by the}} leachability index ranging from 7. 6 - 10. 4, indicative of chemical binding of the various chemical species. Target leachability indices for Re, I, and Na were 9, 11, and 6, respectively. Degradation was observed in some of the samples post 90 -day ANS 16. 1 tests. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) results showed that all the hazardous contaminants were contained in the waste, and the hazardous metal concentrations were below the Universal Treatment Standard limits. Preliminary scale-up (2 -gal waste forms) was conducted to demonstrate the scalability of the Ceramicrete process. Use of minimal amounts of boric acid as a <b>set</b> <b>retarder</b> was used to control the working time for the slurry. Flexibility in treating waste streams with wide ranging compositional make-ups and ease of process scale-up are attractive attributes of Ceramicrete technology...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present a {{prototype}} of the first <b>set</b> of vortex <b>retarders</b> made of liquid crystal polymers recorded by polarization holography. Vortex retarders are birefringent plates characterized by a rotation of their fast axis. Liquid crystals possess birefringent properties and they are locally orientable. Their orientation {{is defined by the}} perpendicular to the local orientation of the recording field. Polarization holography is a purely optical recording method. It is based on the superimposition of coherent and differently polarized beams. It is used to shape the electric field pattern to enable the recording of vortex retarders. The paper details the mathematical model of the superimposition process. The recording setup is exposed; it is characterized by a nearly common path interferometer. Two sets of measurements allowing the prediction of the retarder’s features are presented and compared. Finally, the experimentally recorded retarder is shown, its characteristics are investigated and compared to the predicted ones. Peer reviewe...|$|R
