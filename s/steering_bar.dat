5000|$|PPCs {{are often}} {{considered}} to be safer than normal fixed-wing aircraft because of their inherent stability, limited response to control inputs, and stall resistance. There are two primary means to control a PPC: increasing or decreasing engine power (which controls vertical rate of climb) and deflecting the right or left trailing edge of the parachute—typically by moving the <b>steering</b> <b>bars</b> with the feet—which turns the aircraft right or left. If {{the trailing edge of}} the wing is pulled in on both sides at the same time, the aircraft [...] "flares", i.e., slows and temporarily gains additional lift. The flare is generally used to make fine adjustments in altitude when flying close to the ground and, in particular, when landing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power-off}} {{glide ratio}} of a powered parachute ranges from 3:1 to 6:1. Glide ratio {{varies depending on}} the chute size and shape, and the weight that the chute is carrying. Engine-off landings are generally safe, provided that the aircraft is within glide range of a suitable landing zone and the pilot is properly trained {{in the use of}} proper [...] "flaring" [...] technique. [...] "Flaring", in terms of powered parachuting, refers to the usage of the <b>steering</b> <b>bars</b> pushed out simultaneously, causing the aircraft to rock forward. This is caused by the reshaping of the rear of the wing or parachute, which is pulled downwards. This results in the entire aircraft rocking on the lateral axis, thus slowing the aircraft momentarily, allowing an engine-out landing to become less brutal within the last few feet off the ground. Done properly, flaring will allow an engine-out landing to be much smoother than simply relying on the lift of the ram-air canopy to cushion the landing.|$|R

5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe track-bridge {{interaction}} {{is a widely}} discussed and important topic today, as the modern railway bridges commonly exceed the maximum dilatation lengths allowed for the continuous welded rail. In this case, the Meyer-Wunstorf <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> {{is one of the}} suitable solutions that can move the fixed point of the bridge {{to the middle of the}} span and thus exceed the possibility of the application of the continuous welded rail without any rail expansion devices. However, this solution is new in the Czech Republic and its functionality and durability should be verified. The paper deals with the extensive load tests, made on the first Czech railway bridge with the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> Meyer-Wunstorf. The two-track railway arch bridge on the Tábor - Sudoměřice track crosses the D 3 highway with the span of 100 m. The load tests were focused on the horizontal brake and acceleration forces with the heavy train (totally 1056 t) and four locomotives of weight 318, 6 t. During the test, a number of values were measured, such as stresses in the rail and MW system, movements of the MW and the bridge, temperature. The behaviour of the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> and the bridge – track {{interaction is}} described and compared with the design and theoretical assumptions.

40|$|The major {{advantage}} of a motorcycle {{with respect to a}} passenger car is the possibility of the driver to tilt during cornering and thereby maintaining stability whereas a passenger car will suffer from the risk of capsizing at high speed. This observation has lead Brink Dynamics to create and develop a new concept of a man-wide vehicle that is able to tilt like a motorcycle but which offers the comfort of a passenger car, allowing further downsizing of vehicle enabling higher fuel efficiency. This resulted into a three-wheeled passenger car referred to as the MWV, with two seats in a row consisting of two bodies, a two-wheeled rear-assembly and a front assembly being the passenger compartment including the front-fork assembly, that tilts with respect to the rear assembly. Tilting is controlled by the driver through a <b>steering</b> <b>bar.</b> This paper includes a mathematical treatment of the behaviour of the MWV. The tilting mechanicsm is discussed and included in the model. The sensitivity of some further design characteristics will be discussed. In particular the MWV will be compared with a motor-cycle and a passenger car. Finally the dynamic performance of the vehicle will be examined based on the full dynamic equations for the MWV. within this paper, this analysis will be restricted to step-steer where the dynamic vehicle behaviour will be discussed with reference to its steady state performance...|$|E

The second is a classic control layer that moves the <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> by means of an actuator to achieve the position targeted by the first layer. Real-time kinematic differential global positioning system (RTK-DGPS) equipment is the main sensor input for positioning. It is accurate to about 1 cm and can finely locate the vehicle trajectory. The developed systems are installed on a Citroën Berlingo van, which is used as a testbed vehicle. Once this control architecture has been implemented, installed, and tuned, the resulting steering maneuvering is very similar to human driving, and the trajectory errors from the reference route are reduced to a minimum.

40|$|This report aims {{to explain}} the full design and {{analysis}} of the front upright -the car component which links suspension wishbones and <b>steering</b> <b>bar</b> with wheels- of the TAU Racing’s 2012 car. The first step is to find the worst load case that might affect the upright. Due {{to the fact that the}} study only covers the front ones, the worst load case occurs when the car is cornering and braking at the same time (load transfer effect). Once the loads are studied, the next step is to design the upright and all the components involved in the assembly which will link the wishbones and the wheels. The first problem appears in this point because there is not enough space for all the components. A little change in the suspension geometry (increase of the scrub radius length), solves the problem. The next step is to carry out the bearings life calculations and the finite element analysis (stress and displacements). The results are correct but, after showing to the team leaders the design, another problem appears: the assembly is heavier than expected. The solution agreed is to reduce the bearings size which affects all the assembly. Therefore, another full design is suggested. The bearings life is calculated and the finite element analysis is carried out once again. This time the results are worse: the bearings life is short but, since the competition only lasts a weekend, it is accepted; and the upright has a factor of safety lesser than expected. Hence the last step is an optimization of the upright and, as a result, the factor of safety increases above the minimum required. The overall weight is reduced in almost 20...|$|E
