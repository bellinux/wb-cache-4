40|$|A {{variety of}} {{pressures}} mapping technologies {{have been used}} to assess contact pressures between human tissues and solid flat surface materials. However, research on the accuracy, repeatability, and creep for these technologies is limited. Three commonly used technologies were evaluated for accuracy, repeatability, and creep on a flat surface under highly controlled laboratory conditions. The systems tested included a resistive ink technology known as the F-scan F-socket (Tekscan Incorporated), a piezoresistive technology known as the FSA <b>seat</b> <b>mat</b> (Vista Medical, Limited), and a capacitance technology known as the XSENSOR ® <b>seat</b> <b>mat</b> (XSENSOR ® Technology Corporation). Loads between 9. 392 kg and 19. 627 kg were placed on each sensor using three standardized protocols: an incremental, a low threshold and a creep protocol. For overall accuracy during incremental loading, FSA mat measured a pressure that was 74. 5 % of the actual applied pressure, the F-scan measured a pressure that was 247. 0 % of the actual applied pressure and the XSENSOR ® measured a pressure that was 75. 1 % of the actual applied pressure.

40|$|Dielectric {{elastomer}} sensors (DES) offer extended {{possibilities for}} the detection of strains and forces under tensile load, using a capacitive measuring principle. However, for the measurement of pressure loads, they are very insensitive due to the small deformations. To close this gap, novel <b>sensor</b> <b>mats</b> have been developed, which react very sensitively to pressure loads. The basic design of the <b>sensor</b> <b>mats</b> consists of two elastomer profiles, between which an elastomer film is located. Under compression of the <b>sensor</b> <b>mat,</b> the profiles penetrate into each other and stretch the elastomer film strongly. This effect causes strong changes of the electrical capacitance. For the design of the <b>sensor</b> <b>mats,</b> multiple possibilities of variation are available, with which the characteristics of the dependence of capacitance on load can be influenced and tuned. This includes geometrical parameters such as the shape of the profiles and the location of the electrodes as well as materials parameters like the hardness of the profiles and the elastomer film. These correlations are outlined in the paper by means of some examples. The new <b>sensor</b> <b>mats</b> can be beneficially exploited in all scenarios, in which pressure measurements on extended compliant surfaces such as seats, beds or shoes are required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a sensor system that predicts behavior patterns that occur {{when a patient}} leaves a bed. We originally developed plate-shaped sensors using piezoelectric elements. Existing sensors such as clip <b>sensors</b> and <b>mat</b> <b>sensors</b> require that patients be restrained. The features of our sensors are that they require no power supply or patient restraint for privacy problems. Moreover, we devel-oped machine-learning algorithms to predict behavior patterns without setting thresholds. We evaluated our system for ten subjects at an experimental environment constructed in reference to a clinical site. The mean recognition accuracy was 75. 0 % for seven behavior patterns. Especially, the recognition accuracies of lateral sitting and terminal sitting were 90. 0 % and 96. 7 %, respectively. We consider that these capabili-ties are useful for bed-leaving prediction in practical use...|$|R

Existing sensors such as clip <b>sensors</b> and <b>mat</b> <b>sensors</b> require restraint of patients. Moreover, these sensors present privacy problems. The features of our sensors {{are that they}} require no power supply or patient restraint. We evaluated our system using a basic experiment to predict seven behavior patterns. We obtained a result of predicted behavior patterns related to bed-leaving using only six sensors installed under a bed. Especially, our system can correctly detect behavior patterns of lateral sitting, which is a position that occurs when a patient tries to leave from the bed, and terminal sitting, which is the position immediately before bed-leaving. They were discerned from other behavior patterns...|$|R
40|$|Beside their {{application}} in actuation and energy harvesting, dielectric elastomers (DE) have also strong capabilities for stretch-sensing based on capacitive measurements. However, for compression detection the simple state-of-the-art DE films are too insensitive. In order to close this gap, a novel class of DE sensors for compression measurements has been developed. The new <b>sensor</b> <b>mats</b> consist of two flexible elastomer profiles, between which an elastomer film is squeezed, converting the compression to a stretch load. With this mechanism, very high sensitivities of the capacitive measurement under compression load are achieved. Furthermore, various parameters which influence {{the characteristics of}} the <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> have been identified. Most relevant are the shape of the profiles, the number and design of the electrode layers as well as the hardness of the profiles and of the elastomer film. The high variability of the <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> design offers farreaching possibilities to tune {{the characteristics of the}} compressions sensor in terms of the dependence of capacitance on the load force. The basic principles of the design of the new compression <b>sensor</b> <b>mats</b> are outlined and various examples of such flexible sensors are introduced in this paper...|$|R

The counting {{performance of}} two light beam sensors and three camera sensors, all direction sensitive, was simultaneously evaluated at an indoor location. Direction insensitive <b>sensors</b> (two <b>mat</b> <b>sensors</b> and one light beam sensor) were additionally tested as a reference. Bidirectional counting data of free people flow was collected for 36 days in one-hour resolution, including five hours of manual counting. Compared to the manual results, one of the light beam sensors had the most equally balanced directional overall counting errors (4. 6 % and 5. 2 %). The collected data of this sensor was used to model the air transportation energy consumption of visitor counting sensor-based DCV and constant air volume ventilation (CAV). The results suggest that potential savings in air transportation energy consumption could be gained with the modeled DCV as its total daily airflow during the test period was 54 % of the total daily airflow of the modeled CAV on average. A virtually real-time control of ventilation could be realized with minute-level counting resolution. Site-specific calibration of the visitor counting sensors is advisable and they could be complemented with presence detectors to avoid unnecessary ventilation during unoccupied periods of the room. A combination of CO 2 and visitor counting sensors could be exploited in DCV to always guarantee sufficient ventilation with a short response time...|$|R
40|$|Passenger airbags are {{currently}} {{designed for the}} optimal support of a 50 -percentile adult in a crash, {{reducing the risk of}} severe injury for a maximum range of occupants. However, such a fixed-level, high-energy airbag deployment can be extremely dangerous for very small occupants, for example the 5 -percentile woman or children in infant seats. For this very reason, new standards such as FMVSS 208 (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208) include differentiated airbag deployment strategies according to occupant classification. IEE, Luxemburg, develops and manufactures such occupant classification systems. An example of which are the <b>sensor</b> <b>mats</b> made by IEE, which tier one automotive suppliers use globally for their <b>seating</b> systems.
