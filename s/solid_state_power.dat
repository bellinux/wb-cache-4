By 1963, solid state electronics development allowed Crown {{to produce a}} more robust tape recorder, and in 1964, their first <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> amplifier: the low-profile SA 20-20. In 1967, the DC300 was introduced as the first AB+B circuitry amplifier with 150 watts per channel at eight ohms. The DC300 proved very popular with sound reinforcement system owners and moved Crown into a leadership position in terms of power amplifier sales worldwide. As well, the DC300 {{was seen as a}} breakthrough product by commercial sound system contractors seeking to power their constant voltage speaker systems without the frequency response limitations and power losses associated with output power transformers which had previously been required. In November 2007, after 40 years of service, the Crown DC300 was inducted into the TEC Awards TECnology Hall of Fame in New York on the opening day of the Audio Engineering Society's 123rd convention. George Peterson, executive editor of Mix magazine, said of the DC300 that it [...] "was a classic that really ushered in and defined the era of the modern power amplifier." ...|$|E

50|$|The high {{working voltage}} makes them {{well suited for}} radio {{transmitters}} and valves remain in use today for very high power short wave radio transmitters, where <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> techniques would require many devices in parallel, and very high DC supply currents.
