I think when she <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> harp, which she played beautifully, she was an inspiration to those who saw her. A great favorite in society, she was generous in contributing her skill on the harp for charitable purposes. She loved her art and was always willing to help others".|$|E

From {{the time of his}} burial in 1985, a single {{tombstone}} <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> grave, the epitaph reading: [...] "The grave of the prophet Elijah Ahn Sahng-hong." [...] After the death of his wife Hwang Won-sun 23 years later on 4September 2008, she {{was buried in}} the plot beside Ahn, and a new tombstone carrying both their names (as well as their children's on the back) replaced the 1985 stone, repeating the epitaph.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{endeavour}} {{to build}} a sanctuary for [...] {{on the site of}} the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the Battle of Marathon (c. 490–488BC) upon a solid limestone foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the Acropolis summit. This building replaced a hekatompedon (meaning [...] "hundred-footer") and would have <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> archaic temple dedicated to Athena Polias ("of the city"). The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480BC and razed the Acropolis.|$|E

[...] "We have come to find , the Big Giant," [...] said the twins. [...] "He is huge, and very powerful," [...] said Holy Boy. [...] "Each day he comes late in the day to , to drink from the lake." [...] The next day at dawn the brothers walked to [...] and <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> large lake. [...] They took one of the chain lightning arrows their father had given them and shot it at a slab of high rock overhanging the base of Tsoodził. [...] The arrow struck the rock with such force that it shattered and fell where it remains today. [...] "With such weapons as these we cannot fail," [...] they said.|$|E

2500|$|The Jo Jo Zep album Cha, was {{released}} in October 1982; It was produced by Peter Solley The lead single, [...] "Taxi Mary" [...] (a duet between Camilleri and Jane Clifton) reached No.11 on the Australian singles chart. Later, their moody, synth-driven cover version of [...] "Walk on By" [...] was a hit in Australia, and peaked at No.6 in New Zealand in June 1983. Another Jo Jo Zep single, [...] "Losing Game", was issued in 1983, and was produced by Split Enz member Eddie Rayner and Camilleri. [...] "Losing Game" [...] {{was released}} in the United States but was the last single by {{this version of the}} group, which by this point was essentially a solo project of Camilleri that the pub crowds and Australian public were not ready for. They played for 120,000 peeps at a Huge Rock Concert at Sydney Horden Pavilion with INXS, the new rising Goanna Band, Australian Crawl, Jimmy Barnes and Swanee and this hi-powered, precision Latin Rock Line-up really impressed The Rock Press, the crowd and the other bands, who <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> stage open jawed! ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the Louvre, the statue was reassembled, but the {{fragments}} of the left hand and arm were dismissed initially as being a later restoration because of the rougher workmanship. It now is accepted that the left hand holding the apple and the left arm are in fact original to the statue, but were not so well finished {{as the rest of}} the statue since they would have been somewhat above visible level and difficult to see. This was a standard practice for many sculptors of the era—less visible parts of statues often were not so well finished since typically, they would be invisible to the casual observer. Sculptures and statues from this era normally were carved out of several blocks of stone and carefully pieced together. The Venus de Milo was found to have been carved from at least six or seven blocks of Parian marble: one block for the nude torso, another for the draped legs, one for each arm, a small block for the right foot, a block for the inscribed plinth, and the separately carved herm that <b>stood</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> statue.Initially, the plinth was found to fit perfectly as part of the statue, but after its inscription was translated and dated, the embarrassed experts who had publicized the statue as a possible original work by the artist Praxiteles dismissed the plinth as a later addition. The inscription read: [...] "...(Alex)andros son of Menides, citizen of Antioch on the Maeander made this (statue)..." [...] The inscribed plinth would have moved the dating of the statue from the Classical period to the Hellenistic period because of the style of lettering and the mention of the ancient city of Antioch on the Maeander, which did not exist in the early fourth century BC, when Praxiteles lived. At that time, the Hellenistic Age was considered a period of decline for Greek art. The quality of workmanship of the carving would not have fit the incorrect assessment of Hellenistic art. The plinth mysteriously disappeared shortly before the statue was presented to King Louis XVIII in 1821, and evidence of it survives in only two drawings and an early description. The king eventually presented the statue to the Louvre museum in Paris.|$|E
