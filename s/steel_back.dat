50|$|When the French and Belgians {{occupied}} the Ruhr in January 1923, {{in order to}} take coal and <b>steel</b> <b>back</b> to their own countries, there was passive resistance, which later became known as the Battle of the Ruhr (Ruhrkampf). In Erkelenz this passive resistance was carried out especially by railwaymen, in the course of which the Belgian secret police expelled 14 families, including small children, who had been reported by narks. They were abandoned, in some cases using force, in remote places at night and in fog.|$|E

5000|$|Construction on {{the bridge}} began in 1908. As there were no cranes big enough to carry <b>steel</b> <b>back</b> then, a massive false bridge and {{scaffolding}} was built out of wood. The steel bridge itself was completely pre-fabricated in Scotland. The Scottish engineer assembled the bridge in Scotland, ran their tests on it, and then carefully dismantled it. The bridge was shipped in pieces across the Atlantic, and brought out to Entwistle on the railway. The pieces began arriving in 1909, and the steel bridge was slowly assembled. The engineers’ measurements were so accurate, that no modifications were needed on site.|$|E
5000|$|The watch has a {{reliable}} rubber seal between its <b>steel</b> <b>back</b> and case, {{but does not}} have any seals for its buttons. Since they fit tight enough, surface tension prevents the water from getting inside, but only to a certain point of water pressure. Therefore, the watch front is marked WATER RESIST, but Casio reports different values for different variants of the watch. The black version (F91W-1) [...] is [...] "30 meter / 3 bar", the ISO standard meaning of which is: [...] "Suitable for everyday use. Splash/rain resistant. NOT suitable for showering, bathing, swimming, snorkeling, water related work and fishing", but the colored versions (e.g. F-91WC-2AEF) are [...] "DIN 8310 / ISO 2281- resistant to minor splashing". Even though the black version will resist an occasional water submersion if the buttons are not pressed, the watch should not be used in such conditions on a regular basis.|$|E
50|$|Wins early {{against the}} West Coast Fever, Canterbury Tactix and Central Pulse {{suggested}} Steel could back up its semi final berth {{from last season}} again. Steel took on some tougher opponents {{during the middle of}} the competition. Losses to the Waikato/BOP Magic, Adelaide Thunderbirds and Queensland Firebirds at home saw them slip in form. The Firebirds became the first Australian team to win at Stadium Southland in the history of the ANZ competition. Coach Broughton rallied her troops. The bye came at a handy time for the team, and re-grouped before gaining momentum. Crucial wins against the Waikato/BOP Magic, Melbourne Vixens and Canterbury Tactix all at home with a rallied Invercargill crowd, saw the <b>Steel</b> <b>back</b> in the finals frame. And backed it up with a season decider against the Northern Mystics in Auckland, ending the Mystics season and confirming the Steel a spot in the play offs 50-42 the final score.Again like in 2009, the Steel couldn't make it past the semi final stage, going down to the Waikato/BOP Magic in a reverse from their last meeting.|$|E

5000|$|Vandal Savage is seen {{in several}} episodes of the {{animated}} series Justice League voiced by Phil Morris. In this version, {{in addition to being}} an ageless immortal, Savage also has superhuman regenerative powers; allowing him to heal and regenerate any injuries instantly to leave no trace of damage. His origin is {{the same as that of}} his comic book counterpart, except it is revealed in the episode [...] "Maid of Honor" [...] his age is half of that in the comics - 25,000 years. He first appears in [...] "The Savage Time," [...] where Vandal's future self goes back in time and gives his past self technology to help the Germans win World War II. His plans are thwarted by the Justice League, along with the help of the Blackhawks and Easy Company. He next appears in [...] "Maid of Honor," [...] where he claims to be his own grandson and is betrothed to Princess Audrey in order to become the ruler of Kasnia, seeking command of a satellite rail gun before it is destroyed by the Justice League. The two part episode [...] "Hereafter", features a version of Savage from an alternate future, in which he succeeded in destroying all life on Earth. Having lived alone for 30,000 years, he regrets his earlier actions. Working with a time displaced Superman- who had been seemingly killed by the Superman Revenge Squad a few months before Vandal destroyed humanity but had really been sent to the future- Vandal is able to reset the timeline by sending the Man of <b>Steel</b> <b>back</b> to the 20th century via his new time machine (something that he couldn't do himself as the machine prevented him going back to a time where he already existed). As a result of the timeline being reset and his destruction of life on Earth undone, the alternate future Vandal Savage quietly thanked his friend, Superman, before peacefully being erased from existence, finally at peace with his newfound redemption. What has happened with his 20th century counterpart after he was stopped by the League, however, is not known.|$|E
40|$|Philops P. M. F. in the Netherlands has {{improved}} the heat treatment process (blackening) of <b>steel</b> <b>back</b> caps for television sets. This treatment changes the crystalline {{structure of the}} metal, so that the caps shield the tubes from {{the influence of the}} earth's magnetic field. The treatment has three stages: recrystallising and decarbonising, steamblackening and controlled cooling. The three separate kilns, in which the process used to take place, have now been replaced by a single tunnel kiln. Since the process is now continuous and no more energy is lost during the cooling down period between th different stages, substantial energy savings have been achieved. ...|$|E

5000|$|Multiple design {{variations}} {{are possible}} {{but the most}} common example of a slide plate (in structural applications) has glass-filled PTFE [...] bonded to a <b>steel</b> <b>backing</b> plate. In these applications a two-part system is used which has an upper element with stainless steel surface face-down and bearing on a lower element with its PTFE <b>steel</b> <b>backing</b> surface face-up. [...] In most applications, the upper element {{is larger than the}} lower element by the amount of movement expected. This has a two-fold advantage of maintaining a constant bearing area and preventing the lower surface from being exposed to dirt, grit or other contaminants throughout the range of motion.|$|R
