5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of autosomal (not <b>sex-linked)</b> dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E
5|$|There are six known genetic {{disorders}} in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia {{of the affected}} animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three {{are thought to be}} autosomal recessive conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not <b>sex-linked</b> and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian.|$|E
25|$|In dogs, CA is also {{usually an}} {{autosomal}} recessive gene, {{but in a}} few breeds, such as the English Pointer, the gene is <b>sex-linked.</b>|$|E
25|$|They {{performed}} additional notable {{research on}} the role of chromosomes in hereditary, <b>sex-linked</b> characteristics. This research was conducted in New York City using earthworms. Strobell and Foot strongly opposed Stevens and Wilson's theory that chromosomes exist as individual structures because they appeared too variable in shape and size. Although they were ultimately wrong, their photographs of chromosomes helped to advance the field.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Alving {{and colleagues}} {{showed that in}} some African Americans the {{antimalarial}} drug primaquine induces hemolytic anemia, and that those individuals have an inherited deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes. G6PD deficiency is <b>sex-linked,</b> and common in Mediterranean, African and other populations. In Mediterranean countries such individuals can develop a hemolytic diathesis (favism) after consuming fava beans. G6PD deficient persons are also sensitive to several drugs in addition to primaquine.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan {{began using}} fruit flies in {{experimental}} studies of heredity at Columbia University in 1910 in a laboratory known as the Fly Room. The Fly Room was cramped with eight desks, each occupied by students and their experiments. They started off experiments using milk bottles to rear the fruit flies and handheld lenses for observing their traits. The lenses were later replaced by microscopes, which enhanced their observations. Morgan and his students eventually elucidated many basic principles of heredity, including <b>sex-linked</b> inheritance, epistasis, multiple alleles, and gene mapping.|$|E
25|$|Because {{mitochondrial}} diseases (diseases due {{to malfunction}} of mitochondria) can be inherited both maternally and through chromosomal inheritance, {{the way in}} which they are passed on from generation to generation can vary greatly depending on the disease. Mitochondrial genetic mutations that occur in the nuclear DNA can occur in any of the chromosomes (depending on the species). Mutations inherited through the chromosomes can be autosomal dominant or recessive and can also be <b>sex-linked</b> dominant or recessive. Chromosomal inheritance follows normal Mendelian laws, despite the fact that the phenotype of the disease may be masked.|$|E
25|$|It has {{previously}} been interpreted that variation in ankylosaurid tail club shape is due to sexual dimorphism, which assumes that tail club morphology has a <b>sex-linked</b> intraspecific function. This is possible if the tail club was used for agonistic behaviour. However, a sexual dimorphism theory would predict roughly equal numbers of individuals with two distinct sizes of tail clubs. Obvious sexual dimorphism has not been documented, but if the clubs of one sex are much larger, {{then there would be}} a bias for preservation and discovery towards that sex.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of fetal sex {{for women who}} are carriers of X-linked diseases is advantageous for the family. X-linked diseases occur at a rate of 5 in 10,000 live births. The most commonly published <b>sex-linked</b> diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia. Ultrasonography is unreliable during the first trimester of pregnancy, as the genitalia are not fully developed. Other methods for sex determination before the use of cffDNA are invasive and performed at 11 weeks of gestation. There is a small risk of miscarriage. The main method is to target the SRY gene on the Y chromosome and DYS14 sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarlet-chested parrot}} is {{becoming}} more common in captivity, {{and is one of}} the more popular species of the genus Neophema in captivity both in Australia and overseas. Their quiet temperament and small size increase their appeal as aviary birds. Many mutations are seen, including the red-fronted, par blue, sea green (Sydney Blue), white fronted blue (Recessive), cinnamon (<b>sex-linked),</b> and more rarely lutino and fallow. Opaline (sex-link) and Edged (dominant) mutations are also now available in most countries. Although the species has more mutations than any other member of the genus, they tend to be frail healthwise and short-lived. Scarlet-chested parrots are also vulnerable to Candida infections in aviculture.|$|E
25|$|This {{question}} has been studied in isolated populations where antimalarial drugs were not used in Tanzania, East Africa and in the Republic of the Gambia, West Africa, following children during the period when they are most susceptible to falciparum malaria. In both cases parasite counts were significantly lower in G6PD-deficient persons than in those with normal red cell enzymes. The association has also been studied in individuals, which is possible because the enzyme deficiency is <b>sex-linked</b> and female heterozygotes are mosaics due to lyonization, where random inactivation of an X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD deficient red blood cells coexisting with normal red blood cells. Malaria parasites were significantly more often observed in normal red cells than in enzyme-deficient cells. An evolutionary genetic analysis of malarial selection of G6PD deficiency genes has been published by Tishkoff and Verelli. The enzyme deficiency is common in many countries that are, or were formerly, malarious, but not elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|The ruff {{has three}} male forms, which differ in mating {{behaviour}} and in appearance: the typical territorial males {{which have a}} dark neck ruff, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and the very rare cryptic males known as [...] "faeders" [...] which have female-like plumage. [...] The behaviour and appearance of each individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by a simple genetic polymorphism. Territorial behaviour and appearance is recessive to satellite behaviour and appearance, [...] while preliminary research {{results suggest that the}} faeder characteristics are genetically controlled by a single dominant gene. [...] It was originally thought that the difference between territorial and satellite males was due to a <b>sex-linked</b> genetic factor, but in fact the genetic locus relevant for the mating strategy is located on an autosome, or non-sex chromosome. That means that both sexes can carry the two different forms of the gene, not just males. The female does not normally show evidence of its genetic type, but when females are given testosterone implants, they display the male behaviour corresponding to their genotype.|$|E

2500|$|Following C. W. Woodworth and William E. Castle, around 1908 Morgan {{started working}} on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and {{encouraging}} students to do so as well. With Fernandus Payne, he mutated Drosophila through physical, chemical, and radiational means. He began cross-breeding experiments to find heritable mutations, {{but they had no}} significant success for two years. [...] Castle had also had difficulty identifying mutations in Drosophila, which were tiny. Finally in 1909, a series of heritable mutants appeared, some of which displayed Mendelian inheritance patterns; in 1910 Morgan noticed a white-eyed mutant male among the red-eyed wild types. When white-eyed flies were bred with a red-eyed female, their progeny were all red-eyed. A second generation cross produced white-eyed males—a <b>sex-linked</b> recessive trait, the gene for which Morgan named white. Morgan also discovered a pink-eyed mutant that showed a different pattern of inheritance. In a paper published in Science in 1911, he concluded that (1) some traits were <b>sex-linked,</b> (2) the trait was probably carried on one of the sex chromosomes, and (3) other genes were probably carried on specific chromosomes as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Catharus {{species are}} either long-distance {{migrants}} or fairly resident birds. They were sometimes split {{according to this}} and morphological characters, the migrant group occasionally also including the wood thrush. Comparison of mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 as well as nuclear β-fibrinogen intron 7 sequence data indicates that this is incorrect. A later study by Gary Voelker and colleagues (2013) utilized 10 genes (two mitochondrial, two <b>sex-linked</b> and six autosomal) to compare the 12 species of Catharus and Hylocichla mustelina.|$|E
2500|$|In horses, CA is {{believed}} to be linked to an autosomal recessive gene. [...] This means it is not <b>sex-linked,</b> and the allele has to be carried and passed on by both parents in order for an affected animal to be born. Horses that only carry one copy of the gene may pass it on to their offspring, but themselves are perfectly healthy—without symptoms of the disease. [...] Because it is recessive, the allele for CA may pass through multiple generations before it is expressed.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Michael Gartler used X {{chromosome}} inactivation {{to demonstrate}} the clonal origin of cancers. [...] Examining normal tissues and tumors from females heterozygous for isoenzymes of the <b>sex-linked</b> G6PD gene demonstrated that tumor cells from such individuals express only one form of G6PD, whereas normal tissues are composed of a nearly equal mixture of cells expressing the two different phenotypes. [...] This pattern suggests that a single cell, and not a population, grows into a cancer. However, this pattern has been proven wrong for many cancer types, suggesting that some cancers may be polyclonal in origin.|$|E
2500|$|The HFEA {{strictly}} prohibits {{sex selection}} for social or cultural reasons, but {{allows it to}} avoid <b>sex-linked</b> disorders. They state that PGD is not acceptable for, [...] "social or psychological characteristics, normal physical variations, or any other conditions which are not associated with disability or a serious medical condition." [...] It is however accessible to couples or individuals with a known family history of serious genetic diseases. Nevertheless, the HFEA regards intersex variations as a [...] "serious genetic disease", such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a trait associated with some elite women athletes. Intersex advocates argue that such decisions are based on social norms of sex gender, and cultural reasons.|$|E
2500|$|PRA can be {{detected}} at any time but usually does not show up until the dog is around two years of age. Breeding dogs should be tested for genotype for this condition before breeding and only animals found [...] "clear" [...] {{should be used for}} breeding. PRA can occur in most breeds of dog including mix breeds. In most breeds it is also an autosomal recessive condition, however it has been found in other breeds to be autosomal dominant and <b>sex-linked</b> in others. As the name suggests, it is a progressive disease which will eventually result in total blindness. [...] Like CEA, an affected dog should not be bred with but these dogs can live happily as pets. Currently there is no treatment for either disease, but as both diseases (CEA and PRA) are hereditary it is possible to eliminate them using selective breeding.|$|E
2500|$|A white-eyed [...] "albino" [...] {{horn fly}} was {{discovered}} in a colony maintained at the Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory in Kerrville, Texas. This is apparently a spontaneous mutation, as tests including crosses were performed that determined the white-eye mutation was not <b>sex-linked</b> and the white-eyed flies actually have decreased amounts of eye pigment present within the head. This {{appears to be an}} inherited simple Mendelian autosomal recessive with complete penetrance. A colony of white-eyed horn flies was established from this single individual and has been maintained in the laboratory as visible genetic markers such as an eye color mutation in an economically important species like the horn fly may be useful for behavior and population dynamic studies, as well as release and recapture studies. No other differences from the wild-type flies were detected in the external characteristics of the mutant phenotype or in egg viability. However, white-eyed flies had significantly lower amounts of the pigment dihydroxyxanthommatin in their heads suggesting either the lack of xanthommatin production, or a failure of transport and storage within the head of the mutant phenotype.|$|E
2500|$|No {{uniform system}} for {{regulation}} of assisted reproductive technologies, including genetic testing, {{exists in the}} United States. The practice and regulation of PGD most often falls under state laws or professional guidelines {{as the federal government}} does not have direct jurisdiction over the practice of medicine. To date, no state has implemented laws directly pertaining to PGD, therefore leaving researchers and clinicians to abide to guidelines set by the professional associations. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that all clinics providing IVF must report pregnancy success rates annually to the federal government, but reporting of PGD use and outcomes is not required. Professional organizations, such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), have provided limited guidance on the ethical uses of PGD. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) states that, [...] "PGD should be regarded as an established technique with specific and expanding applications for standard clinical practice." [...] They also state, [...] "While the use of PGD for the purpose of preventing <b>sex-linked</b> diseases is ethical, the use of PGD solely for sex selection is discouraged." ...|$|E
50|$|As the ino locus {{is on the}} X-chromosome the <b>Sex-linked</b> Clearbody gene {{is linked}} to all other <b>sex-linked</b> mutations, {{including}} Opaline, Slate, and Cinnamon.

50|$|Dwarfism in {{chickens}} {{has been}} found to be controlled by several simple genetic factors. Some types are autosomic while others are <b>sex-linked,</b> but when poultry breeders make reference to dwarf chickens they usually refer implicitly to <b>sex-linked</b> recessive dwarfism due to the recessive gene dw, located on the Z chromosome. As <b>sex-linked</b> dwarf broiler breeder hens can bring about normal sized broiler chickens, <b>sex-linked</b> recessive dwarfism found application in poultry industry since the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|In birds, the cock has two X {{chromosomes}} and the hen has one X and one Y chromosome. So in hens whichever allele {{is present}} on the single X chromosome is fully expressed in the phenotype. Hens cannot be split for <b>Sex-linked</b> Clearbody (or any other <b>sex-linked</b> mutation). In cocks, because <b>Sex-linked</b> Clearbody is recessive to wild-type and dominant to Ino, the <b>Sex-linked</b> Clearbody allele must be present on both X chromosomes (homozygous) or present on one with an Ino allele on the other to be expressed in the phenotype.|$|E
50|$|It {{is on the}} X {{gene that}} the genetic {{information}} for <b>sex-linked</b> recessive traits is passed. As a <b>sex-linked</b> trait is a recessive trait, each X in a chromosomal pairing must have the recessive trait encoded within it, or the trait will not show visually. However, a female bird only has one X gene, and that gene is paired not with another X, but rather with a Y. Because of this, if a female bird inherits an X from her father that has the <b>sex-linked</b> information attached to it, the female will be visual for the <b>sex-linked</b> recessive trait, {{because there is no}} second X to match up with the X passed from the father. This is only true of female birds; since male birds, by genetic definition, must have two X genes (XX), both X genes must have the same <b>sex-linked</b> recessive information in order to show that <b>sex-linked</b> recessive trait visually.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sex-linked</b> {{mutations}} such as Cinnamon, Ino, Opaline (Pearl), Pallid (incorrectly {{known as}} Platinum) and/or <b>sex-linked</b> yellowcheeks {{have a higher}} ratio of female to male offspring due to the mode of inheritance.|$|E

The cross-over or recombination values between Opaline and these linked genes has not been measured accurately, but results collected by C Warner and T Daniels found 41 crossovers in 113 between Cinnamon and Opaline, giving a recombination ratio of 36±6%. Since the ino locus {{is known to be}} very close to the cin locus, the recombination ratio between Opaline and both Ino and <b>Sex-linked</b> Clearbody must also be around 36%. The opinion has been expressed that there is a close link between Opaline and Slate.|$|E
