40|$|AbstractMulti-gripper {{flexible}} <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> {{is a novel}} {{sheet metal}} forming process aimed at improving the conformability of sheet metal to forming die, material utilization and forming quality of sheet metal. Straight jaws in traditional <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> machines are replaced {{by a pair of}} opposed clamping mechanisms movable relative to each other during the forming process. In the present study, a wave-like surface part was selected as the study object, and the forming processes of traditional <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> and multi-gripper flexible <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> were performed using a commercially available finite element analysis software to show their influences on conformability of sheet metal. In addition, three levels of transition lengths in multi-gripper flexible <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> were chosen to investigate their influence on forming results. The simulation results show that multi-gripper flexible <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> would result in an easier conformability of sheet metal than traditional <b>stretch</b> <b>forming.</b> It is also found that the sheet metal can be formed without a transition length, which could significantly improve the material utilization.

Genetic or RNAi screenings in yeast, C. elegans or Drosophila {{have identified}} multiple genes modifying polyQ aggregation, {{a few of}} which are confirmed effective in mammals. However, the overall molecular mechanism underlying polyQ protein aggregation in mammalian cells still remains obscure. We here perform RNAi screening in mouse neuro 2 a cells to identify mammalian modifiers for aggregation of mutant huntingtin, a causative protein of HD. By systematic cell transfection and automated cell image analysis, we screen, 12000 shRNA clones and identify 111 shRNAs that either suppress or enhance mutant huntingtin aggregation, without altering its gene expression. Classification of the shRNA-targets suggests that genes with various cellular functions such as gene transcription and protein phosphorylation are involved in modifying the aggregation.

Fragments of human huntingtin protein having an expanded polyglutamine <b>stretch</b> <b>form</b> aggregates and cause cytotoxicity in yeast cells bearing endogenous QN-rich proteins in the aggregated (prion) form. Attachment of the proline(P) -rich region targets polyglutamines {{to the large}} perinuclear deposit (aggresome). Aggresome formation ameliorates polyglutamine cytotoxicity in cells containing only the prion form of Rnq 1 protein. Here we show that expanded polyglutamines both with (poly-QP) or without (poly-Q) a P-rich stretch remain toxic {{in the presence of}} the prion form of translation termination (release) factor Sup 35 (eRF 3). A Sup 35 derivative that lacks the QN-rich domain and is unable to be incorporated into aggregates counteracts cytotoxicity, suggesting that toxicity is due to Sup 35 sequestration. Increase in the levels of another release factor, Sup 45 (eRF 1), due to either disomy by chromosome II containing the SUP 45 gene or to introduction of the SUP 45 bearing plasmid counteracts poly-Q or poly-QP toxicity {{in the presence of the}} Sup 35 prion. Protein analysis confirms that polyglutamines alter aggregation patterns of Sup 35 and promote aggregation of Sup 45, while excess Sup 45 counteracts these effects.
