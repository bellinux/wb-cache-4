40|$|ABSTRACT 0 Recent trends toward earlier {{retirement}} have {{exacerbated the}} financial {{problems facing the}} Social Security system and many other public and private pension plans. The massive commitment {{of public and private}} funds to Social Security and pension funds is-partly responsible for the,trend to early retirement. This, in fact, was one of the early goals of Social Security: to induce old 9 r workers out of the weaklabor-markets of,the 1930 's. Now, however, the age distribution has changed and the population of retirees has risen. There are three general approaches to bolstering the Social Security System: (1) an increase in employee contributions; (2) a decrease in the <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> or delay of eligibility; and (3) an alteration in public policy to induce later retirement. The benefit structure oi Social,Secueity and Rehsion plans often provides strong financial incentives to retir...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesDuring {{the last}} decade, {{endovascular}} repair (EV) has replaced open surgical repair (OSR) as the preferred {{method of treatment}} of blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs) at many trauma centers. This has resulted in reductions in mortality, length of stay, and major complications, including paraplegia, with the added expense of the initial endograft, subsequent surveillance, and reinterventions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to conduct an economic evaluation comparing these two methods of repair. MethodsWe performed an economic comparison of EV and OSR for the treatment of BTAI using a decision tree analysis with transition points derived from our institution's experience and through a review of the literature. Over a 15 -year period (1991 - 2006), 28 patients with BTAI were treated at our center (15 EV, 13 OSR). Costs were obtained from our hospital's case costing center, the Ontario Case Costing Initiative, Ontario's Drug Benefit Formulary, and Ontario's <b>Schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Benefits</b> for physician costs. Our center's results were then combined with those from the literature to arrive at an economic model. ResultsThese combined results revealed that EV, when compared to OSR, resulted in decreased early mortality (7. 2 % vs 22. 5 %), decreased composite outcome of mortality and paraplegia (7. 7 % vs 27. 6 %) and decreased composite outcome of mortality and major complication (42. 5 % vs 69. 8 %). Patients undergoing EV also had shorter intensive care unit stays (12. 2 vs 15. 3 days), total hospital length of stays (22. 5 vs 28. 6 days), and ventilator days (8. 0 vs 9. 2 days). Additionally, patients undergoing EV had decreased total 1 -year costs compared with OSR ($ 70, 442 vs $ 72, 833). ConclusionsEV repair of BTAIs offers a survival advantage as well as a reduction in major morbidity, including paraplegia, compared with OSR, and results in a reduction in costs at 1 year. As a result, from the cost-effectiveness point of view, EV is the DOMINANT therapy over OSR for these injuries...|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to mention {{the relevance of the}} public unconditional cash transfer programme administered by the Social Welfare Fund (SWF). IPC-IG and UNICEF (2014) and UNICEF (2014 a) showed that the benefit is the only source of income for some families. Without the SWF, these families {{would not be able to}} buy even the most basic food items. However, the payment <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> was not followed, with the transfers often made in a lump sum rather than quarterly. Irregular payment cycle seems to not allow households to smooth their consumption over the year, which in turn reduces the effectiveness of the cash transfers in helping families to cope with economic crisis. This may be one of the reasons why we found the SWF to be only marginally significant towards explaining stunting. Exploring the possibility of increasing transfer frequency or making the payment schedule more flexible would be strongly recommended.|$|R

5000|$|The {{financial}} {{condition of the}} Social Security and Medicare programs remains challenging. Projected long run program costs are not sustainable under current program parameters. Social Security's annual surpluses of tax income over expenditures are expected to fall sharply this year and to stay about constant in 2010 {{because of the economic}} recession, and to rise only briefly before declining and turning to cash flow deficits beginning in 2016 that grow as the baby boom generation retires. The deficits will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets until reserves are exhausted in 2037, at which point tax income would be sufficient to pay about three fourths <b>of</b> <b>scheduled</b> <b>benefits</b> through 2083. Medicare's financial status is much worse. As was true in 2008, Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is expected to pay out more in hospital benefits and other expenditures this year than it receives in taxes and other dedicated revenues. The difference will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets. Growing annual deficits are projected to exhaust HI reserves in 2017, after which the percentage <b>of</b> <b>scheduled</b> <b>benefits</b> payable from tax income would decline from 81 percent in 2017 to about 50 percent in 2035 and 30 percent in 2080. In addition, the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund that pays for physician services and the prescription drug benefit will continue to require general revenue financing and charges on beneficiaries that grow substantially faster than the economy and beneficiary incomes over time.|$|R
40|$|Background. Adalimumab is {{effective}} {{for the maintenance}} of remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Currently, biologic therapies are used in cases where patients fail conventional medical therapies. If biologic therapies are not available, patients often choose to remain in an unwell state rather than undergo colectomy. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with UC where adalimumab was readily available compared to not available. Methods. A previously validated Markov model was used to simulate disease progression of patients with UC who are corticosteroid-dependent and/or did not respond to thiopurine therapy. Utility scores and transition probabilities between health states were determined by using data from randomized controlled trials and real-life observational studies. Costs were obtained from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative and the Alberta Health <b>Schedule</b> <b>of</b> Medical <b>Benefits.</b> Results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for readily available adalimumab treatment of UC were $ 40, 000 and $ 59, 000 per quality-adjusted life year, compared with ongoing medical therapy in an unwell state, at 5 -year and 10 -year treatment time horizons, respectively. Conclusion. Considering real-life patient preferences to avoid colectomy, adalimumab is cost-effective according to a willingness-to-pay threshold of $ 80, 000 for treatment of UC...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> electricity locational marginal pricing (LMP) {{that arise from}} better coordination of day-ahead commitment decisions and real-time balancing markets in adjacent power markets when there is significant uncertainty in demand and wind forecasts.

In the unit commitment stage, the models optimise day-ahead generation schedules under either the full set of network constraints or a simplified net transfer capacity (NTC) constraint, where the latter represents the present approach for limiting forward electricity trade in Europe.

This paper presents the Timed Hybrid Petri net (THPN) as a suitable tool for modelling and <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> hybrid systems. One <b>of</b> the major <b>benefits</b> over traditional methods is {{a significant reduction in}} complexity during problem formulation. A sugar milling plant containing both batch and continuous processing units is considered as a case study by which the application <b>of</b> the proposed <b>scheduling</b> algorithms is illustrated...|$|R
