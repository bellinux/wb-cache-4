40|$|Nowadays, the {{determinants}} of disease are mostly behavioral and social. Millions of individuals loose their lives due to these factors. Accident {{is one of them}} that are more prevalent among teenagers because of their nature. Thereby, this study was conducted to identify risk behaviors in Tabriz high school teenagers. This study was conducted in Tabriz private and public high schools in 2006. Five hundred students were selected by random sampling method. To analyze the data, we used SPSS, Chi-square and Fisher`s Exact and Compare mean tests. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} mean point value of risk behaviors of teenagers was 44. 04 of 100. The most risky behaviors were not using <b>safety</b> <b>hat</b> in bicycle riding: (77. 6), not paying attention to bicycle speed: (58) and using drugs without doctor prescription: (51. 2). Identification of behaviors causes of such behaviors and comprehensive planning is necessary to prepare strategies in order to prevent and decrease the risk behaviors that impose a substantial cost to society. One of the most effective means is to promote and develop health promoting schools to improve and promote healthy behaviors in teenagers...|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} forms of Carols by Candlelight began in the 19th century, when Cornish Miners in Moonta, South Australia, gathered on Christmas Eve to sing carols lit with candles stuck to the brims of their <b>safety</b> <b>hats.</b> The tradition spread through Victoria and Melbourne, until it was popularised in 1938 by Norman Banks, a radio announcer, then with Melbourne radio station 3KZ. Whilst walking home from his night-time radio shift on Christmas Eve in 1937, he passed a window and saw inside an elderly woman sitting up in bed, listening to Away in a Manger being played {{on the radio and}} singing along, with her face being lit by candlelight. Wondering how many others spent Christmas alone, he had the idea to gather a large group of people to all sing Christmas carols together by candlelight. The first ever such event was held in Alexandra Gardens the following Christmas, 1938, and was attended by around 10,000 people.|$|R

5000|$|Personal {{protective}} equipment (PPE) includes gloves, Nomex/Uniform, respirators, hard <b>hats,</b> <b>safety</b> glasses, high-visibility clothing, {{and safety}} footwear.

50|$|The {{following}} {{tools are}} considered a minimum: hammer, pliers w/ side-cutters, utility knife, tape measure, locking pliers, crescent wrench, screwdriver, margin trowel, carpenter's pencil or soapstone, tool belt and one pouch (bag). In addition: a five gallon bucket with additional tools, toolbelt suspenders, water jug and lunchbox are recommended. Most safety equipment that is consumed or work specific, for example hard <b>hat,</b> <b>safety</b> glasses, hearing protection, gloves, fall protection, High-visibility clothing, concrete boots, respirator/dust mask and toe guards are provided by the employer as part of construction site safety. Personal safety equipment, for example full leather boots (some long time laborers believe steel toes are dangerous on the construction site; {{it is better to}} have crushed toes than toes cut off by the crushed steel), high strength pants - Carhartt or jeans (some modify thighs with a sacrificial second layer of jean fabric cut from an old pair) - socks, lip balm, and climate specific outerwear (unless laborers are instructed to work in a climate different from what they typically reside in, for example high elevation), are provided by the individual.|$|R
40|$|On June 4, 2003, a 49 year-old male {{millwright}} {{employed at}} a magnetic powder manufacturing company sustained fatal injuries when an {{aerial work platform}} (an extensible articulating boom lift) he was operating tipped over. On {{the day of the}} incident, the victim and a co-worker operated the lift that was leased from a local leasing company to perform maintenance tasks. The aerial lift was equipped with a stabilizing device: an extendable axle to enhance the vehicle’s stability. The manufacturer stated in the Operators and Safety Manual that all operators must properly position the extendable axle and lock it into position before raising the platform or extending the boom. There were two safety features on the lift that were designed to ensure the use of the stabilizing device: an axle set indicator light and an interlock. A post incident test showed that while the indicator light worked, the interlock was inoperable. The plant maintenance crew did not receive the Operators and Safety Manual from the leasing company nor did they receive any training on how to operate the lift. According to the witnesses, the extendable axle was never set out during the entire day of the incident. At approximately 3 : 30 PM, the victim was performing a visual inspection of the exterior of a bucket elevator that was about 70 feet high. He wore a harness with a lanyard that was attached and secured to the platform attachment point, a hard <b>hat,</b> <b>safety</b> glasses and steel-toe...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the urgency}} of {{improving}} safety in Hong Kong's construction sites, a research project concentrating on the impact strength of hard hats, weathering effect on the helmet materials and analysis of head-neck injuries had been investigated for two years. This thesis summarizes the investigation results of the project. First, the current situation of hard hat utilization in Hong Kong was reviewed and analyzed by a social survey performed at the various construction sites. The standards and literature for hard hats are also briefly reviewed as well. More than 100 impact tests on new hard hats and used ones were performed under various conditions, i. e. standard, over-loading, off-central, pre-cracked, pre-warmed and pre-soaked etc. Although all the new hard hats of various brands in Hong Kong's market can successfully pass the standard tests, their safety factor is quite different. The dynamic performance of various hard hats depends on their material properties and structural configurations. Several failure modes of hard hats of different brands under various impact conditions were observed. In particular, the disconnection or fracture of suspension {{would result in a}} fatal injury to the user. Besides, the residual impact strength of hard hats significantly declines after certain years' service, and the used hats may not provide wearers with the expected protection. The hard hat materials were also experimentally studied; uni-axial tensile tests, Charpy impact tests, stress relaxation tests and SHPB tests etc were performed. DTA and SEM studies were conducted to understand the aging mechanisms of hard hat materials. Accelerated weathering processes, i. e. high temperature, high humidity and high UV lighting, were made before conducting some of these tests. The weathering conditions have remarkable influence on the hard hats made of plastics. The impact strength of all the hard hat materials decreased evidently after the simulated weathering treatment Specially, the effect of UV lighting on ABS, i. e. material of hard shell of Super Quality™ brand, is most serious. Neck injuries caused by impact on the hard hats were assessed {{for the first time in}} Hong Kong. Excessive compression and bending are two causes of neck-spine injuries, which may appear in central impact and off-center impact, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the impact energy, slightly higher than 50 J, sometimes is already dangerous enough to cause a cervical spine injury for certain brands of hard hats, like JSP[registered trade mark][registered trade mark] A simple mechanical model of a hard hat subjected to a striker impact has been proposed. The model can predict the dynamic performance of a hard hat under impact according to the material property and structural configuration. It may help to optimize the design of hard hat just by adjusting the model parameters. Also it is useful in predicting relevant neck injuries. Finally, a safety assessment, including the performance comparison of hard hats of three popular brands used in Hong Kong, and some suggestions on hard hat selection and use are given. Key words: hard <b>hats,</b> <b>safety</b> assessment, impact strength, weathering effects, head-neck injurie...|$|R
