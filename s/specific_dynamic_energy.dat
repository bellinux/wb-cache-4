40|$|Standard {{metabolic}} rate (SMR, {{closely related to}} basal and resting metabolism) varies by up to threefold among juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., of similar size at common temperature. Here, consequences of this variation are predicted by combining empirically derived relationships between SMR, <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> action, <b>energy</b> budgets, water velocity, food level in the environment and food availability to fish. The range of velocities across which growth is predicted to occur is inversely related to a fish's SMR. Growth is positively related to SMR at high but negatively related to it at low-food levels. The relationship between food level {{and the range of}} velocities over which lower SMR fish can grow but higher SMR fish cannot is asymmetrically bi-phasic and peaked. It is predicted that maternal manipulation of offspring SMR would generate fitness benefits through bet-hedging against unpredictability in food level and increases in the overall range of velocities that the family of offspring can occupy and thrive i...|$|R

Aggressive speculative execution {{results in a}} significant wastage of <b>dynamic</b> <b>energy</b> due to useless computation {{in the event of}} mis-speculation. As energy consumption is becoming an important constraint in microprocessor design, it is extremely important to reduce such wastage of <b>dynamic</b> <b>energy</b> in SpMT processors in order to achieve a better performance to power ratio. Dynamic instruction criticality information can be effectively applied to control aggressive speculation in SpMT processors. In this paper, we present a model of micro-execution for SpMT processors to determine dynamic instruction criticality. We also present two novel techniques utilizing criticality information, namely delaying non-critical loads and criticality based thread-prediction for reducing useless computation and energy consumption. Our experiments show 17. 71 % and 11. 63 % reduction in <b>dynamic</b> <b>energy</b> for criticality based thread prediction and criticality based delayed load scheme respectively while the corresponding improvements in <b>dynamic</b> <b>energy</b> delay products are 13. 93 % and 5. 54 %...|$|R

The closed-form results for the dynamic field intensity factors are {{used to evaluate the}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>energy</b> release rate through the crack-tip dynamic contour integral. The permeability of the interior fluid region relative to the cracked solid region significantly affects the magneto-electro-mechanical coupling coefficient in the Bleustein–Gulyaev wave function and, consequently, the horizontal shear surface wave speed, the dynamic field intensity factors and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>energy</b> release rate. It is revealed from dynamic fracture mechanics analysis that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>energy</b> release rate thus obtained has an odd dependence on the dynamic electric displacement intensity factor and the dynamic magnetic induction intensity factor. It is also found that the horizontal shear surface wave speed provides the limiting velocity for the propagation of a Mode-III crack in a magneto-electro-elastic solid when there is only applied traction loading...|$|R
