40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that prolonged copulatory mate guarding coexists with last male sperm precedence was {{tested for the}} <b>sugarcane</b> <b>rootstalk</b> <b>borer</b> <b>weevil,</b> Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Male D. abbreviatus showed a long copulatory guarding. Both males and females {{were less likely to}} remate when prolonged guarding occurred compared with terminating copulation early. Guarding was generally terminated by the struggling behavior of the female. Mating experiments using normal and sterile (X-ray irradiated) males revealed a similar value of last-male sperm precedence for both irradiated and normal males. The P 2 values of normal and sterile males were similar when all oviposited eggs were counted over 30 days. These data made it possible to calculate the expected gain to a male from prolonged guarding compared with leaving a female early and seeking out an additional mate. We show that guarding has the higher fitness. Eggs were deposited in clutches in which normal fertilized eggs were grouped together and were attached to a group of sterile eggs. This, together with identifying the form of the cul-de-sac type spermatheca, allowed us to suggest a unique repositioning process, which has not been described elsewhere, as the likely mechanism by which last-male sperm precedence was achieved. Key words: copulation guarding, cul-de-sac spermathecae, sperm precedence. [Behav Ecol 14 : 89 – 96 (2003) ] P rolonged copulatory guarding is a well-described phe-nomenon in insects and is usually explained as a male adaptation to avoid sperm competition (Simmons, 2000; Thornhill and Alcock, 1983). Mate-guarding involves tradeoffs for males because it consumes time and energy {{that could be used for}} finding and mating additional females. It evolves when a male that remains with a single female has greater fitness than a male that seeks additional mating opportun-ities. Under this explanation, copulatory guarding is expected only when last-male sperm precedence occurs (McLain, 1989...|$|E

30|$|Same-sex pairing {{occurs in}} a wide variety of species and {{contexts}} (for reviews, see Thornhill and Alcock [1983]; Bagemihl [1999]; Harari et al. [2000]; Bailey and Zuk [2009]). In many insects, same-sex pairing is not thought to have any direct benefit to the mounting male, that is, they are making mistakes (e.g., Harari et al. [2000]). However, although same-sex pairings may be mistakes, in some species, these mistakes do not appear to be the result of random pair formation. For instance, studies of three species - a water bug (Palmacorixa nana; Aiken [1981]), the sugarcane root <b>borer</b> <b>weevil</b> (Diaprepes abbreviatus; Harari et al. [2000]), and the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica; Switzer et al. [2004]) - found that male-male pairs tended to consist of smaller males that had mounted larger males. In all three species, females tend to be larger than males, and these studies suggested that males might use the imperfect cue of body size for determining the individuals they would mount. In other words, the homosexual mounting is a result of mistaken sexual identity.|$|R

40|$|Manuring plantains with {{a compost}} of poultry manure, {{household}} wastes and wood ash improves yields and reduces pest attacks. In fact, such composts help to give yields {{that are just}} as good as those obtained with the use of inorganic fertilizers. Traditionally Nigerian households have always used waste products such as wood ash and livestock manures to mulch their plantains. Recent trials at Owerri have compared the traditional way with the commercial system, which uses inorganic fertilizers and chemical nematicides. Plantains manured with compost at 16 t/ha yielded 10. 9 kg of plantains per plant. Those that received 320 kg/ha of a balanced inorganic fertilizer yielded slightly less, at 10. 6 kg per plant. Other plots that received lower quality compost yielded much less. The compost was more effective at controlling nematodes and <b>borer</b> <b>weevils</b> than the chemical nematicide, Furadan. In all the treatments that received wood ash pest problems were reduced from 17 % to 2 % infestation. It is thought that wood ash impedes nematode egg hatching and larva movement. The wood ash also adds mineral nutrients to the soil. It is doubtful whether enough compost could~be made from household wastes. It will therefore be necessary to develop a balanced compost if the system is to be used on a large scale.

40|$|The genus Musa is not {{native to}} Africa. It evolved in {{tropical}} Asia, from southwest India eastward {{to the island}} of New Guinea. There is a growing circumstantial evidence {{which suggests that the}} East African Highland banana and the tropical lowland plantain were cultivated on the African continent since before 1 AD. It is also probable that ABB cooking and AB and AAB dessert cultivars were brought to the continent from India by Arabian traders from 600 AD, and that these were disseminated throughout East Africa. During the colonial era, the main centres of distribution for banana cultivars were botanical gardens, such as Zomba in Malawi, Entebbe in Uganda and Amani in Tanzania. It appears that the very early introductions of Highland banana and plantain arrived in Africa as a relatively clean material without the conspicuous pests and diseases that affect them in Asia. In contrast, several devastating problems now impact the crop in Africa, including nematodes, the <b>borer</b> <b>weevil</b> and diseases, most notably banana bunchy top, banana streak, Sigatoka leaf spots, Xanthomonas wilt and Fusarium wilt.

In total, these production constraints threaten banana and plantain production throughout the continent and impact those who can ill afford lost production, the small-holder producer. Our intent in this review is to highlight the significance of these problems and the great importance that infested planting materials have played in their development. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Managing stored {{grains and}} seed {{requires}} {{the use of}} various techniques to ensure the quality of the product entering the storage facility does not deteriorate over time. These techniques include: the use of sanitation, storing sound, dry grain, managing temperature and aeration, using chemical protectants, regular sampling, and the use of fumigation. Bin and storage facilities also {{play an important role in}} determining the quality of the stored grain. Storage facilities should be inspected regularly for deterioration of any type. Proper storage moisture varies depending on type of seed, length of storage and storage conditions. Seed moisture content changes until equilibrium is established with the surrounding environment. The equilibrium moisture is different for each kind of seed. High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature.

Many other tropical fruits may perform well in the subtropics, but considerable research and development must still be conducted before they can become important commercial crops. Management of pests is generally easier and cheaper compared with the tropics due to the constraints of low temperatures and humidity on pathogen activity. This has important relevance for organic cultivation, which can add value to the {{production of}} tropical fruits in the subtropics. Since tropical trees produce fewer annual flushes per year in subtropical climates, tree growth control is easier and suitable pruning techniques allow their cultivation at high density, facilitating high initial yields with optimal management. Proximity to the market is an additional advantage, not only for cost reasons, but also due to a reduced carbon footprint. Special problems and challenges for tropical fruit cultivation in the subtropics include the growing importance of Fusarium wilt and <b>weevil</b> <b>borer</b> on banana in cooler climates, and the impact of low temperatures in relation to flowering, pollination, fruit set, fruit quality and yield in many tropical tree crops. The actual importance of and future prospects for, developing banana and other relevant tropical fruits in the subtropics, is analysed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Several {{important}} pests {{that attack}} fruit in the South Pacific region are being controlled with biological agents instead of chemical sprays. In some cases this {{will mean that}} fruit exports, previously banned because of chemical residues, can soon be resumed. Fruit-piercing moths cause widespread damage to fruit in Western Samoa and Fiji. There is a local parasite of the moth, {{but because it is}} not very effective, another parasite has been imported. Now the two parasites are giving good control. In Papua New Guinea the banana skipper, a butterfly whose larvae defoliate banana plants, is now being attacked by parasitic wasps. The release of these wasps was made only after extensive trials, because there is also a near relative of the banana skipper in Papua New Guinea, which is beautiful but harmless. Scientists wanted to make certain that the parasitic wasps would not attack these harmless butterflies. Extensive tests by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) showed that the parasitic wasps were specific to the pest butterfly. Their release was therefore permitted and it seems that they are already having an effect on the banana skipper population. Scientists from ACIAR are also developing ways of using nematodes to attack and kin pests. In Tonga they are testing 35 different strains of nematodes against the banana <b>weevil</b> <b>borer.</b> One strain of nematode is proving particularly effective. ACIAR has been extending its biological control work to include control of weeds such as the giant sensitive plant (Mimosa in visa) and water hyacinth.

40|$|Sugarcane <b>weevil</b> <b>borer,</b> Acrotomopus atropunctellus (Boheman) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{has been}} {{detected}} across all sugarcane planting {{areas in the}} Argentinian Northwest with increasing population densities. The monitoring for its occurrence and the population density usually is made by visual inspection and consequently demands much effort and time. The objectives {{of this study were}} 1) to describe the sampling distribution pattern of A. atropunctellus adults 2) to develop and validate a fixed-precision sequential sampling plan for density estimation, and 3) to find the optimum inspection time for each sampling unit. On-farm data collection was performed at sugarcane fields located in Ranchillos (Tucumán, Argentina) during 2011 – 2012 to 2013 – 2014 sugarcane growing seasons. Thirty sampling units consisting on one meter of sugarcane furrow were randomly selected at 1 -wk intervals. Within each sampling unit, weevils were counted and recorded independently for five increasing examination time per sampling unit (ETSU) (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min). For each ETSU, the sampling distribution pattern was assessed by Taylor's power law (TPL). The average sample number (ASN) and sampling stop lines were calculated according to Green's sequential sampling model, based on TPL estimated parameters, for fixed precision levels, C = 0. 1 and C = 0. 25. The resampling for validation of sample plans (RVSP) program was used to evaluate the performance of the different sampling plans. Parameters a and b from TPL regressions did not vary significantly between different ETSUs. All estimates of b coefficients were significantly > 1 which can indicate an aggregated sampling distribution pattern. For each precision level, Green's sequential plans predicted very similar ASN between ETSU. This was confirmed through the validation process, with the five sampling protocols providing very similar mean sample sizes and mean precision levels. Variability of these parameters from validation results did not vary significantly among the different ETSUs. The relative net precision was the only performance parameter that varied with the ETSU, with the shortest ETSU resulting in the most efficient sampling plan. We conclude that A. atropunctellus has an aggregated sampling distribution and that the fixed precision sequential sampling plan developed using Green's model and based on a two-minute inspection of the sampling unit is the most convenient choice for estimating its population density in sugarcane. Our analysis of the ETSU effect on the performance of sugarcane weevil sampling protocols could contribute to develop more efficient monitoring plans for other arthropods.
