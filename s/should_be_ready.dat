25|$|Chives {{thrive in}} well-drained soil, rich in organic matter, with a pH of 6-7 and full sun. They {{can be grown}} from seed and mature in summer, or early the {{following}} spring. Typically, chives need to be germinated at a temperature of 15 to 20°C (60-70°F) and kept moist. They can also be planted under a cloche or germinated indoors in cooler climates, then planted out later. After at least four weeks, the young shoots <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to be planted out. They are also easily propagated by division.|$|E

25|$|In May 2008, Woerts {{announced}} further details: {{the club}} is aiming for a stadium with a capacity of around 100,000 seats. If possible, a capacity of over 130,000 should be realized according to Woerts, which would earn the title of biggest stadium in Europe. The club emphasized its efforts {{to make it a}} true football stadium with seats close to the pitch. The stadium will get a retractable roof so that other events can be held as well. According to plans in those days, the stadium <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> in 2016. Due to financial difficulties for all parties involved {{and the fact that the}} Netherlands were chosen to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the plans for a new stadium have been put on hold.

[...] On the same day, Marshall endorsed the memo with the comment, [...] "It {{is not to be}} released over Japan without express authority from the President."

They then observe Gralik Durr and two associates discussing the deal they have to mine the kemocite for Degra. The away team then beams up a canister of kemocite for analysis, and then follow Gralik back to his home, where they confront him.|$|E

Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King Simon of Legree and his pursuit of the runaway slave Eliza. Eliza is saved by Buddha, who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party.

Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way.

500|$|By August5, forecasters were {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} the storm impacting Hawaii. Residents were advised to ensure that their disaster kits were fully stocked and ready. Governor Linda Lingle made a speech to the state of Hawaii the same day. She emphasized that the storm was not an imminent threat but that residents <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> and should know where the nearest emergency shelter is. Since forecasters expected the storm to weaken before it reached the islands, only minor effects—mainly rainfall—were expected. Hawaii County mayor Billy Kenoi was also briefed on the approaching storm and he advised the county to be prepared. Stores reported an influx of shoppers and posted anniversary sales. Blue tarps for roofs were being sold at $1 apiece. The American Red Cross also reported that sales of the [...] "water bob", a water container that can be attached to a bathtub and hold roughly 100 gallons of water, increased significantly. On August6, the Red Cross stated that it was deploying a disaster recovery team, led by the director of the agency, to the islands of Hawaii.|$|E
500|$|Skylon is {{a series}} of designs for a single-stage-to-orbit {{spaceplane}} by the British company Reaction Engines Limited (REL), using SABRE, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system. [...] The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a purpose-built runway, and accelerate to Mach5.4 at [...] altitude (compared to typical airliners' [...] ) using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit. It could carry [...] of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to [...] to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle; or [...] to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), over 30% more than SpaceX F9 RTLS (.) The relatively light vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic composite skin. [...] When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance.

500|$|Starting in November 1943, the Army Air Forces Materiel Command at Wright Field, Ohio, began Silverplate, the codename {{modification}} of B-29s {{to carry the}} bombs. Test drops were carried out at Muroc Army Air Field, California, and the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California. Groves met with the Chief of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), General Henry H. Arnold, in March 1944 to discuss the delivery of the finished bombs to their targets. The only Allied aircraft capable of carrying the [...] long Thin Man or the [...] wide Fat Man was the British Avro Lancaster, but using a British aircraft would have caused difficulties with maintenance. Groves hoped that the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress could be modified to carry Thin Man by joining its two bomb bays together. Arnold promised that no effort would be spared to modify B-29s to do the job, and designated Major General Oliver P. Echols as the USAAF liaison to the Manhattan Project. In turn, Echols named Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as his alternate, and Wilson became Manhattan Project's main USAAF contact.
