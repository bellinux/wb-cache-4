50|$|<b>Solifenacin</b> is a {{competitive}} cholinergic receptor antagonist, selective for the M3 receptor subtype. The binding of acetylcholine to these receptors, particularly M3, plays {{a critical role}} in the contraction of smooth muscle.By preventing the binding of acetylcholine to these receptors, <b>solifenacin</b> reduces smooth muscle tone in the bladder, allowing the bladder to retain larger volumes of urine and reducing the number of micturition, urgency and incontinence episodes. Because of a long elimination half life, a once-a-day dose can offer 24-hour control of the urinary bladder smooth muscle tone.|$|E
50|$|As stated above, <b>solifenacin</b> {{may also}} prolong the QT interval. Therefore, {{administering}} it concomitantly with drugs which also have this effect, such as moxifloxacin or pimozide, can theoretically {{increase the risk}} of arrhythmia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIncontinence has {{a greater}} {{detrimental}} effect on quality of life than other symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) and {{is often difficult to}} treat with antimuscarinic monotherapy. ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy and the safety and tolerability of combination (<b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg and mirabegron 50 mg) versus <b>solifenacin</b> 5 or 10 mg in OAB patients remaining incontinent after 4 wk of <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg. Design, setting, and participantsOAB patients remaining incontinent despite daily <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg during 4 -wk single-blind run-in were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to double-blind daily combination or <b>solifenacin</b> 5 or 10 mg for 12 wk. Patients receiving the combination were initiated on mirabegron 25 mg increasing to 50 mg after week 4. Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe primary end point was a change from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 h (stratified rank analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). Key secondary end points were a change from baseline to EOT in the mean number of micturitions per 24 h (ANCOVA) and number of incontinence episodes noted in a 3 -d diary at EOT (mixed-effects Poisson regression). A trial (BESIDE) comparing combination treatment (<b>solifenacin</b> plus mirabegron) with one treatment alone (<b>solifenacin)</b> tested the superiority of combination versus <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg, noninferiority (and potential superiority) of combination versus <b>solifenacin</b> 10 mg (key secondary end points), and the safety and tolerability of combination therapy versus <b>solifenacin</b> monotherapy. Results and limitationsA total of 2174 patients were randomised to combination (n= 727), <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg (n= 728), or <b>solifenacin</b> 10 mg (n= 719). At EOT, combination was superior to <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg, with significant improvements in daily incontinence (p= 0. 001), daily micturitions (p< 0. 001), and incontinence noted in a 3 -d diary (p= 0. 014). Combination was noninferior to <b>solifenacin</b> 10 mg for key secondary end points and superior to <b>solifenacin</b> 10 mg for improving daily micturitions. All treatments were well tolerated. ConclusionsAdding mirabegron 50 mg to <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg further improved OAB symptoms versus <b>solifenacin</b> 5 or 10 mg, and it was well tolerated in OAB patients remaining incontinent after initial <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg. Patient summaryIn this 12 -wk study, overactive bladder patients who remained incontinent despite initial <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg treatment received additional treatment with mirabegron 50 mg. Combining mirabegron 50 mg with <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg was superior to <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg alone in improving symptoms of incontinence and frequent urination, and it was well tolerated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the dose-response relationship and safety/tolerability of <b>solifenacin</b> succinate (YM 905) {{in the treatment}} of overactive bladder (OAB), and to compare its efficacy and safety/tolerability with tolterodine 2 mg twice daily. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentre study included a 2 -week single-blind placebo run-in, a 4 -week double-blind placebo-controlled active treatment phase, and a 2 -week follow-up. Men and women with an OAB and urodynamic evidence of detrusor overactivity were randomized to placebo or <b>solifenacin</b> 2. 5, 5, 10 or 20 mg once daily, or tolterodine 2 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Of 265 patients enrolled, 225 were randomized and 192 completed the study. <b>Solifenacin</b> 5, 10 and 20 mg produced statistically significant (P < 0. 05) improvements in voids/ 24 h vs placebo, whereas tolterodine did not; the mean change with tolterodine was between those with <b>solifenacin</b> 2. 5 and 5 mg. The outcome was similar for the mean change from baseline to endpoint in mean volume voided/void. For incontinence and urgency episodes/ 24 h the <b>solifenacin</b> dose groups showed numerically superior changes vs placebo; the mean effects with tolterodine were generally smaller than with <b>solifenacin.</b> Most of the efficacy effect of <b>solifenacin</b> was evident at 2 weeks. Quality-of-life outcomes supported the efficacy results. <b>Solifenacin</b> 5 and 10 mg were well tolerated; there were no serious treatment-related adverse events. The incidence of dry mouth was 14 % for <b>solifenacin</b> 5 and 10 mg, 2. 6 % for placebo and 24 % for tolterodine. CONCLUSION: In this study, the 5 - and 10 -mg doses of <b>solifenacin</b> appeared to be the most clinically effective for treating OAB, considering the balance between efficacy, quality of life and tolerability.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of flexible-dose <b>solifenacin</b> 5 / 10 mg with and without simplified bladder training in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS SOLAR (<b>SOLifenacin</b> Alone and with simplified bladder Re-training) was a multicentre, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study in patients with OAB. After a 2 -week, single-blind, placebo run-in, 643 patients were randomized to treatment with either <b>solifenacin</b> 5 mg once daily (od) alone (323) or 5 mg od combined with simplified bladder training (320) for 8 weeks. At week 8, patients in both groups could request a dose increase to <b>solifenacin</b> 10 mg od for the remaining 8 weeks of the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in {{the mean number of}} micturitions/ 24 h after 8 weeks. Secondary efficacy measures were the change in micturition frequency and other voiding diary variables at week 16. Patient-reported outcomes were also assessed, including patient Perception of Bladder Condition, Incontinence Quality of Life, and Treatment Satisfaction using a visual analogue scale score; tolerability was also assessed. RESULTS <b>Solifenacin</b> given alone was effective in improving all measures of OAB evaluated in the study. When simplified bladder training was used combined with <b>solifenacin</b> there was a further significant improvement in micturition frequency at week 8, and this difference was maintained through to week 16. The use of simplified bladder training with <b>solifenacin</b> also significantly improved treatment satisfaction at week 16 over the responses to <b>solifenacin</b> given alone. There {{was no significant difference between}} the treatment groups at week 16 in urgency, incontinence or other secondary variables measured. The most common adverse event reported was dry mouth in both treatment groups; there was a low rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the total study group.

Methods: Meta-analyses were conducted to interrogate the data, to broaden knowledge about <b>solifenacin</b> and overactive bladder (OAB) in general. Before integrating data, datasets from individual studies were mapped to a single format using methodology developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Initially, the data structure was harmonized, to ensure identical categorization, using the CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM). To allow for patient level meta-analysis, data were integrated and mapped to analysis datasets. Mapping included adding derived and categorical variables and followed standards described as the Analysis Data Model (ADaM). Mapping to both SDTM and ADaM was performed twice by two independent programming teams, results compared, and inconsistencies corrected in the final output. ADaM analysis sets included assignments of patients to the Safety Analysis Set and the Full Analysis Set. Results: There were three analysis groupings: Analysis group 1 (placebo-controlled, monotherapy, fixed-dose studies, nÂ =Â  3011); Analysis group 2 (placebo-controlled, monotherapy, pooled, fixed- and flexible-dose, nÂ =Â  5379); Analysis group 3 (all <b>solifenacin</b> monotherapy-treated patients, nÂ =Â  6539).

40|$|The {{effects of}} oxybutynin, <b>solifenacin</b> and {{tolterodine}} on dementia risk {{in patients with}} diabetes mellitus (DM) remain unknown. We investigated the effects of oxybutynin, <b>solifenacin</b> and tolterodine on dementia risk in patients with DM. We conducted a cohort study by using the diabetes dataset of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 1 January, 2002 to 31 December, 2013. We included 10, 938 patients received one type of oxybutynin, <b>solifenacin,</b> or tolterodine, while 564, 733 had not. We included a comparable number of patients not receiving oxybutynin, <b>solifenacin,</b> or tolterodine as controls through systematic random sampling matching by age, gender, and {{the year of the}} index date with 1 to 1 ratio. The dementia risk was estimated through multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression after adjustment for several confounding factors. The dementia event rates were 3. 9 % in the oxybutynin group, 4. 3 % in the <b>solifenacin</b> group, 2. 2 % in the tolterodine group and 1. 2 % in the control group (P< 0. 001). The adjusted HRs compared to nonusers of anticholinergic drugs were 2. 35 (95 % CI, 1. 96 to 2. 81), 2. 16 (95 % CI, 1. 81 to 2. 58), and 2. 24 (95 % CI, 1. 85 to 2. 73), respectively, for patients receiving oxybutynin, <b>solifenacin,</b> or tolterodine. Our study indicates an association between taking oxybutynin, <b>solifenacin</b> and tolterodine and the subsequent diagnosis of dementia in DM patients. Moreover, the patients using oxybutynin had highest risk. The impact of these three drugs on risk of dementia in non-diabetic populations is warrant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract AIMS: Measurement of bladder wall {{thickness}} (BWT) by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) {{may be a}} less invasive method to diagnose overactive bladder (OAB) or detrusor overactivity (DO) and monitor response to therapy. This study assessed whether treatment with <b>solifenacin</b> affects BWT. METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 4 study. Adult women with OAB symptoms received <b>solifenacin</b> 5 or 10 [*]mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were change from baseline to Week 12 in TVUS-measured BWT and urinary nerve growth factor. Only results for BWT are presented here. RESULTS: Overall, 547 patients were randomised, 501 patients had a baseline BWT measurement, and change from baseline could be calculated for 478 patients. Mean BWT at baseline was 5. 08 [*]mm (range 2. 2 - 11. 1, SD[*]=[*] 1. 14) and was normally distributed. A significant reduction in BWT from baseline to 12 weeks versus placebo was observed with <b>solifenacin</b> 5 [*]mg (- 0. 42 vs. - 0. 16 [*]mm, P[*]=[*] 0. 03), {{but not with the}} 10 [*]mg dose or with pooled <b>solifenacin,</b> considered the primary comparison. Both <b>solifenacin</b> doses were associated with improvements in efficacy and patient satisfaction endpoints versus placebo. <b>Solifenacin</b> was well tolerated, with dry mouth being the most common adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: There was no consistent effect of <b>solifenacin</b> on BWT in women with OAB/DO, despite improvements in efficacy endpoints. This study suggests that routine clinical assessment of BWT with TVUS for monitoring the effects of OAB/DO treatment is not clinically useful. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35 : 819 - 825, 2016.

40|$|Overactive bladder {{syndrome}} (OAB) is {{a chronic}} condition characterised by urgency, {{with or without}} associated urge incontinence. <b>Solifenacin</b> succinate is a once daily, bladder selective antimuscarinic available in two doses (5 and 10 mg). The recommended dose is 5 mg once daily and can be increased to 10 mg once daily if 5 mg is well tolerated. This article presents pooled efficacy and safety data from four large, placebo-controlled, multinational phase III trials of <b>solifenacin</b> succinate with a total enrolment of over 2800 patients. Data from these trials show that <b>solifenacin</b> 5 and 10 mg once daily is significantly more effective than placebo at reducing urgency, incontinence, micturition frequency and nocturia and at increasing volume voided per micturition. Adverse events were mainly mild-to-moderate in all treatment groups. The results of these phase III trials {{support the use of}} <b>solifenacin</b> in the treatment of OAB...|$|E
40|$|Persistence and {{adherence}} of overactive bladder (OAB) medication {{have reported}} to be generally lower in real-world setting as compared with those in clinical trials. However, this information in Japanese population has not been well addressed. Medical records were reviewed for <b>solifenacin</b> as an initial treatment for 172 women with OAB symptom to examine medication persistence, switching, adherence, {{and the reasons for}} discontinuation. The associations between persistence and the reasons for discontinuation as well as concomitant conditions regarded as OAB-related risk factors were assessed. The 6 -month and 1 -year persistence rate of <b>solifenacin</b> were 39. 8 % and 27. 8 %, respectively. Consequently, 121 patients (70. 3 %) discontinued <b>solifenacin,</b> of whom 18 (14. 9 %) patients switched to other OAB drugs and 9 (7. 4 %) patients restarted <b>solifenacin.</b> Thus, the adherence rate was 66. 8 %. More women discontinued <b>solifenacin</b> owing to symptom resolution (41. 3 %) rather than unfavorable outcomes such as adverse effects (12. 4 %) and lack of efficacy (21. 5 %). However, such reason for discontinuation was not the determinant of persistence of <b>solifenacin.</b> There was a non-significant trend towards higher persistence for those with OAB-related risk factors. Japanese women discontinued solofenacin treatment with various reasons in real-world practice, resulting in much lower persistence as compared with clinical trials. A further prospective study in a larger cohort of patients is awaited to better assess their persistence and adherence and understand exact efficacy and tolerability of antimuscarinics for Japanese patients with OAB...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: With the {{availability}} of the once daily oral antimuscarinic agent <b>solifenacin</b> (5 mg), we started to use it for therapy resistant overactive bladder. We evaluate side effects and efficacy. Material and Methods: We reviewed the charts of children treated with <b>solifenacin</b> succinate between August 2005 and August 2008 for therapy resistant OAB. Incontinence was compared at study entry and study end. Results: During the study period 84 boys and 54 girls {{with a mean age of}} 9 years 2 months received <b>solifenacin.</b> Mean followup was 22. 59 months. While on <b>solifenacin,</b> side effects were observed in 9 of 138 patients (6. 5 %). Efficacy evaluation included only 99 patients after 3 months of therapy. Mean voided volume after treatment was 253. 5 ml, showing a significant 25 % increase compared to the mean value before therapy (50. 5 vs 203. 0 ml, p < 0. 01). Of the patients 84 (85 %) were considered responders, including 45 who were completely dry (full response) and 39 who had fewer nocturnal enuresis or diurnal incontinence symptoms (partial response). Of these 39 patients 17 became dry during the day, I became dry during the night and 21 had more than a 50 % decrease in nocturnal enuresis and diurnal incontinence symptoms. In 15 patients the outcome was unchanged or worse (no response). Conclusion: In this group of children with OAB we noted favorable results with <b>solifenacin</b> with few side effects. Despite the uncontrolled, retrospective study design the effect is attributable to <b>solifenacin</b> intake...|$|E
40|$|Storage {{symptoms}} are particularly bothersome in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) {{but may not}} be adequately treated by Î±-blocker monotherapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of <b>solifenacin</b> and an oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) formulation of tamsulosin compared with placebo and compared with tamsulosin OCAS (TOCAS) monotherapy in men with moderate to severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms. A double-blind 12 -wk phase 3 study in 1334 men with storage and voiding LUTS: total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) â¥ 13, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) 4. 0 - 12. 0 ml/s, two or more urgency episodes per 24 h of Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale grade 3 or 4, and eight or more micturitions per 24 h. Patients were randomised to placebo, TOCAS 0. 4 mg, FDC <b>solifenacin</b> 6 mg plus TOCAS 0. 4 mg, or FDC <b>solifenacin</b> 9 mg plus TOCAS 0. 4 mg. Primary efficacy end points were (1) total IPSS and (2) Total Urgency and Frequency Score (TUFS). An FDC met the success criteria if it demonstrated superiority compared with placebo and noninferiority compared with TOCAS for total IPSS, as well as superiority compared with TOCAS for TUFS. Reductions in total IPSS and TUFS were observed with both <b>solifenacin</b> 6 mg plus TOCAS (- 7. 0 and - 8. 1, respectively) and <b>solifenacin</b> 9 mg plus TOCAS (- 6. 5 and - 7. 6, respectively) compared with TOCAS (- 6. 2 and - 6. 7, respectively) and placebo (- 5. 4 and - 4. 4, respectively). <b>Solifenacin</b> 6 mg plus TOCAS met all prespecified success criteria for both primary end points, while <b>solifenacin</b> 9 mg plus TOCAS met success criteria compared with placebo but not compared with TOCAS. Both FDCs improved quality of life (QoL) measures and were well tolerated, with low incidences of acute urinary retention. The FDC of <b>solifenacin</b> 6 mg plus TOCAS significantly improved storage and voiding symptoms, as well as QoL parameters, compared with placebo. This FDC also improved storage symptoms and QoL compared with TOCAS alone in men with moderate to severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms, and it was well tolerate...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} effects of the antimuscarinic agent <b>solifenacin</b> on urinary urgency, using a range of novel and {{established}} outcome measures, as urgency is the principal symptom of the overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study (SUNRISE, <b>solifenacin</b> in the treatment of urgency symptoms of OAB in a rising dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, efficacy trial) was a randomized, double-blind, 16 -week, placebo-controlled, multicentre study of <b>solifenacin</b> 5 / 10 mg in 863 patients with symptoms of OAB for > or = 3 months. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to endpoint in the number of episodes of severe urgency with or without urgency incontinence per 24 h, as measured using the Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale, grade 3 + 4. Secondary efficacy variables included patient-reported outcomes for bladder condition, urgency bother and treatment satisfaction. A 3 -day voiding diary was used to record micturition frequency and episodes of urgency and incontinence. A 7 -day diary was used to assess speed of onset of effect. RESULTS: <b>Solifenacin</b> 5 / 10 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the mean number of episodes of severe urgency with or without incontinence per 24 h from baseline to endpoint (- 2. 6 vs - 1. 8, P < 0. 001). There were also statistically significant differences in favour of <b>solifenacin</b> 5 / 10 mg over placebo for all secondary variables measured at endpoint, including patient-reported outcomes. There was a significant improvement in urgency as early as day 3 of treatment. Treatmente-mergent adverse events with <b>solifenacin</b> 5 / 10 mg were mainly mild or moderate in severity, and only led to discontinuation in 3. 6 % of patients. CONCLUSION: <b>Solifenacin</b> significantly reduced the number of urgency episodes and the extent of urgency bother, and was well tolerated; it was effective as early as day 3 of treatment...|$|E
