5|$|A bike remains upright {{when it is}} <b>steered</b> so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being <b>steered,</b> and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and <b>steered.</b> In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is <b>steered</b> in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E

5000|$|When the <b>steer</b> wrestler {{is ready}} he [...] "calls" [...] for the <b>steer</b> by {{nodding his head}} and the chute man trips a lever opening the doors. The {{suddenly}} freed <b>steer</b> breaks out running, shadowed by the hazer.

5|$|After her repairs were completed, Tiger {{served as}} the {{temporary}} flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron while Lion was under repair. In the meantime, {{on the evening of}} 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet <b>steered</b> north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer <b>steered</b> south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake the Germans then <b>steered</b> for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home; the British had lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and a German dreadnought had been damaged by a torpedo.|$|E

40|$|Revalor® {{implants}} (containing {{trenbolone acetate}} plus estradiol) were evaluated in a grazing-finishing system using <b>steers</b> with a known previous implant history. Grazing gains were not improved by either Ralgro® or Revalor implants, suggesting that previously implanted <b>steers</b> may {{not respond to}} implants during a later growing phase. During the finishing phase, <b>steers</b> implanted with Revalor gained 5. 4 to 8. 0 % faster (P<. 05) than <b>steers</b> implanted with Synovex-S®. Gain efficiency in the finishing period was improved 4. 8 % (P<. 10) for <b>steers</b> receiving no pasture implant and a Revalor implant during the finishing phase (0 R), compared with <b>steers</b> receiving Ralgro/Synovex (RS) or Revalor/Revalor (RR) implants in the pasture/feedlot phases. <b>Steers</b> implanted with RR had larger (P<. 05) ribeye areas than RS <b>steers,</b> with 0 R <b>steers</b> intermediate. However, RR <b>steers</b> had a 20 percentage unit reduction (P<. 05) in carcasses reaching the choice grade compared to RS <b>steers.</b> Revalor can improve <b>steer</b> feedlot performance, but multiple implantation may reduce quality grade...|$|R
40|$|A feedlot {{demonstration}} utilizing Encore®, a new longterm implant product, {{was completed}} at the Allee Demonstration Farm at Newell, Iowa in 1999. Seventyone <b>steers</b> (697 lbs.) were allotted by weight and hide color and {{assigned to one}} of three treatments: 1) Encore® (43. 9 mg estradiol = E) on day 0; 2) Encore® plus Component® TS (140 mg trenbolone acetate = ETS 0) on day 0; or 3) Encore® on day 0 followed by Component® TS (ETS 100) on day 100. Due to wide standard deviation in the weight of <b>steers</b> {{at the beginning of the}} demonstration, cattle were harvested in two groups. Approximately half of each treatment group was sorted by visual appraisal as to market readiness. Statistical interactions existed within treatment group between first and second harvest dates, therefore data were split and analyzed accordingly. In the first harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had higher marbling scores than ETS 100 <b>steers,</b> and lower average daily gain than E <b>steers</b> and ETS 100 <b>steers.</b> In the second harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had more fat at the 12 th/ 13 rib than ETS 100 <b>steers,</b> but did not differ from E <b>steers.</b> Marbling scores were also higher for ETS 0 <b>steers</b> than either ETS 100 or E <b>steers</b> in the second harvest group. Pooled data reveal that ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had higher marbling scores than ETS 100 <b>steers</b> and tended to have higher marbling scores than E <b>steers.</b> First harvest E and ETS 100 <b>steers</b> had greater average daily gain than ETS 0 <b>steers.</b> In the second harvest group, ETS 0 <b>steers</b> had heavier final ending weights than E <b>steers</b> but did not differ from ETS 100 <b>steers.</b> Final ending weights, rib eye area, fat thickness at the 12 th/ 13 th rib, KPH fat, and calculated yield grades did not differ among treatment groups in the pooled data...|$|R

5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and <b>steered</b> straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and <b>steered.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being <b>steered</b> towards the Atlantic coast.

5|$|Cyclone Dovi {{developed}} on February 5 {{from an area}} of circulation within the SPCZ near the northern Cook Islands. Dovi therefore saw favourable conditions throughout much of its existence. Due to a mid–level ridge to the east, the cyclone progressed on a southward track. Dovi eventually <b>steered</b> to the southwest, and continued to intensify steadily after fluctuating due to diurnal temperature variations, becoming a Category1 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on February 8. An anticyclone positioned {{to the west of}} the system moved closer to Dovi, providing an improved environment. After developing an eye later that day, Dovi attained its maximum wind speeds of 205km/h (125mph) sustained over 10minutes. The cyclone then again <b>steered</b> towards the south, encountering high wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. As a result, Dovi quickly weakened as its convection was displaced. While its outflow in its western and southern quadrants remained favorable, elsewhere outflow was deteriorating. On February 10, Dovi's minimum barometric pressure was 980mbar (28.94inHg) as it moved south-southeast at 11km/h (7mph). The weakening Dovi became an extratropical cyclone on February 11. The remnants continued drifting southwest; the Meteorological Service of New Zealand in Wellington stopped issuing information on it on February 13.|$|E
