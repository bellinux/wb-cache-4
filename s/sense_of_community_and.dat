40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{classroom}} <b>community</b> <b>and</b> social presence on learning satisfaction in a cyber learning setting. The subjects in this study were 172 sixth graders in M elementary school in the city of D, who studied in a cyber setting at home. A survey was conducted to gather data, and multiple regression analysis were carried out to determine the influence <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> <b>and</b> social presence on learning satisfaction. As a result, it is found that a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> classroom <b>community</b> <b>and</b> social presence had a significant correlation to learning satisfaction.

25|$|Feldman's {{influence}} was far reaching. He fostered a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> {{was held in}} great respect by most, if not all, of the congregation. He focused on building a congregation that people stayed {{in for a long}} time and celebrated all their life events as a congregation. His long service as Rabbi meant that many people were born, confirmed, and married under his leadership. Indeed, even at the beginning of the 21st century, a number of older congregants would use his leadership and rabbinate as an example.|$|E

25|$|He {{was educated}} at Columbia University {{and at the}} Collège de France in Paris. At Columbia, Collier began to develop a social {{philosophy}} that would shape his later {{work on behalf of}} American Indians. He was concerned with the adverse effects of the industrial age on mankind. He thought society was becoming too individualistic and argued that American culture needed to reestablish a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> responsibility. From 1907 to 1919, he worked as secretary of the People's Institute, where he developed programs for immigrant neighborhoods, emphasizing pride in their traditions, sponsoring lectures and pageants, and political awareness.|$|E
25|$|Beijing {{is famous}} for its siheyuans, a type of {{residence}} where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called hutongs. The hutongs are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, siheyuans and hutongs are rapidly disappearing, as entire city blocks of hutongs are replaced by high-rise buildings. Residents of the hutongs are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> street life of the hutongs cannot be replaced, and these properties are often government owned.|$|E

25|$|Like other {{immigrant}} groups, Filipino immigrants clustered together {{both out}} of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> in response to prejudice against them. This created the first Little Manilas in urban areas. As time passed, immigration policies changed, and prejudice diminished, leading {{to a decline in}} the presence of Little Manilas. Between 1965 and 1985, more than 400,000 Filipinos immigrated to the United States. In 1970, immigrants made up more than half (53 percent) of all Filipino Americans. In 1980, Filipino Americans were the largest group of Asian Americans in the entire United States; half a million of the Filipino American population were Filipino immigrants, making up 3.6 percent of all immigrants in the United States, outnumbering United States-born Filipino Americans two to one. In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s {{more than half a million}} Filipinos obtained legal permanent resident status in the United States during each decade. In 1992, the U.S. Navy ended the Philippines Enlistment Program due to the end of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement; the program allowed about thirty-five thousand Filipinos to join the U.S. Navy, many of whom immigrated to the United States. Filipino Americans trended to settle in major metropolitan areas, and in the West. Filipino Americans had a tendency to settle in a more dispersed fashion, and to intermarry more than other Asian Americans.|$|E
