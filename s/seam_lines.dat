50|$|Vinyl siding is also {{considered}} one of the more unattractive siding choices by many. Although some newer styles eliminate this complaint, more widespread varieties often have visible <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> between panels and generally do not have the quality appearance of wood, brick, or masonry. The fading and cracking of older types of plastic siding compound this issue. In many areas of newer housing development, particularly in North America, entire neighbourhoods are often built with all houses clad in vinyl siding, given an unappealing uniformity. Some cities now campaign for house developers to incorporate varied types of siding during construction.|$|E

The presented algorithm is based on the identification induced by the correlation and the direction of tie points. Tie points were selected from two geometrically distored spatial ortho-images. And the identification of selected tie points were represented by FOM. Additionally, four factors were taken into account for weights of the directed graph. These five factors were adjusted finely to work equally on selecting <b>seam</b> <b>line.</b> Then, the Dijkstra algorithm was executed repeatedly after each line adjustment.

40|$|A {{sub-block}} {{algorithm is}} usually {{applied in the}} super-resolution (SR) reconstruction of images because of limitations in computer memory. However, the sub-block SR images can hardly achieve a seamless image mosaicking because of the uneven distribution of brightness and contrast among these sub-blocks. An effectively improved weighted Wallis dodging algorithm is proposed, aiming at the characteristic that SR reconstructed images are gray images with {{the same size and}} overlapping region. This algorithm can achieve consistency of image brightness and contrast. Meanwhile, a weighted adjustment sequence is presented to avoid the spatial propagation and accumulation of errors and the loss of image information caused by excessive computation. A <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> elimination method can share the partial dislocation in the <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> to the entire overlapping region with a smooth transition effect. Subsequently, the improved method is employed to remove the uneven illumination for 900 SR reconstructed images of ZY- 3. Then, the overlapping image mosaic method is adopted to accomplish a seamless image mosaic based on the optimal <b>seam</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

Results of the experimentation on mosaicking black and white orthorectified aerial images and on mosaicking multi-resolution color infrared SPOT- 2 and Landsat- 5 satellite images show that the implementation of automated conjugate point extraction and image matching algorithms automates the establishment of geometric registration among overlapped images, while the <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> selection and two-step look-up table histogram matching approaches facilitate creating globally smooth and qualitative mosaics.

50|$|In antiquity, jewelry often contains, in {{the form}} of chains and applied decoration, large amounts of wire that is {{accurately}} made and which must have been produced by some efficient, if not technically advanced, means. In some cases, strips cut from metal sheet were made into wire by pulling them through perforations in stone beads. This causes the strips to fold round on themselves to form thin tubes. This strip drawing technique was in use in Egypt by the 2nd Dynasty. From the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE most of the gold wires in jewellery are characterised by <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> that follow a spiral path along the wire. Such twisted strips can be converted into solid round wires by rolling them between flat surfaces or the strip wire drawing method. The strip twist wire manufacturing method was superseded by drawing in the ancient Old World sometime between about the 8th and 10th centuries AD. There is some evidence for the use of drawing further East prior to this period.|$|E

We propose a new image mosaic method by wavelet multiresolution analysis and variational calculus. We first project the images into wavelet spaces. The projected images at each wavelet space are then blended. In our approach, variational calculus techniques are applied to balance the quality between the smoothness around the <b>seam</b> <b>line</b> and the fidelity of the combined image relative to the original images in image blending. A mosaic image is finally ob-tained by summing the blended images at the wavelet spaces. Experimental results based on our method are demonstrated. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The front {{projection}} screen - custom made {{from thousands of}} pentagonal-shaped Scotchlite pieces to eliminate <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> which might show on the finished film - sits {{at the far end}} of the stage. Despite its formidable size, a four-man crew could mount the screen on its tubular steel frame and erect the system in about two hours. On the opposite end of the stage is the compact projector/camera unit. As with other front-projection systems, Introvision made use of the light reflectance characteristics of the Scotchlite screen, which returns light to its source virtually undiminished, but only directly in line with that source. At oblique angles, the light intensity drops off drastically and the image dissipates. Therefore, in order to apply this phenomenon photographically, both projector and camera must be positioned along precisely the same axis - a physical impossibility sidestepped by the employment of a beam splitter. The beam splitter, mounted at a 45-degree angle to the projector axis, aligns the projected image directly to the camera's focal plane, even though the camera and projector are actually positioned at right angles to each other. The mirrored beam-splitter kicks part of the projected image up onto the screen, but being semi-transparent, also allows the camera to see through it, and thereby record the image reflected back.|$|E
5000|$|The {{making of}} {{industrial}} patterns {{begins with an}} existing block pattern that most closely resembles the designer's vision. Patterns are cut of oak tag (manila folder) paper, punched with a hole and stored by hanging with a special hook. The pattern is first checked for accuracy, then it is cut out of sample fabrics and the resulting garment is fit tested. Once the pattern meets the designer's approval, a small production run of selling samples are made and the style is presented to buyers in wholesale markets. If the style has demonstrated sales potential, the pattern is graded for sizes, usually by computer with an apparel industry specific CAD program. Following grading, the pattern must be vetted; the accuracy of each size and the direct comparison in laying <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> is done. After these steps have been followed and any errors corrected, the pattern is approved for production. When the manufacturing company is ready to manufacture the style, all of the sizes of each given pattern piece are arranged into a marker, usually by computer. A marker is an arrangement {{of all of the}} pattern pieces over the area of the fabric to be cut that minimizes fabric waste while maintaining the desired grainlines. It's sort of like a pattern of patterns from which all pieces will be cut. The marker is then laid on top of the layers of fabric and cut. Commercial markers often include multiple sets of patterns for popular sizes. For example: one set of size Small, two sets of size Medium and one set of size Large. Once the style has been sold and delivered to stores [...] - [...] and if it proves to be quite popular [...] - [...] the pattern of this style will itself become a block, with subsequent generations of patterns developed from it.|$|E

30|$|Several {{approaches}} to ensure smooth transition of DEMs {{have been proposed}} {{in the context of}} global DEM mosaicking and DEM void filling. Gruber et al. [12] fused interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) DEMs by the means of weighted average based on derived height errors. As the errors are higher at the borders, decreased weights towards the borders allow for smoother transitions between DEMs. A different approach proposed by Reuter et al. [10] creates <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> along landscape features such as waterways or roads to merge non-overlapping patches of DEMs with minimum geometric discontinuities. Such <b>seam</b> <b>lines</b> can be automatically identified by morphological image compositing [13], frequently used for mosaicking satellite imagery, but rarely used for DEM mosaicking due to the complexity of the method and possible lack of suitable landscape features for the seam line. Achieving seamless transitions is also crucial when filling missing data in DEMs with a DEM from different source. The transition zone between the auxilary and the main DEM is typically interpolated using inverse distance weighting (IDW) [14], or estimated as a local average of neighboring elevation pixels [15]. However, depending on the complexity of landscape features the transition zone can be much smoother than its surrounding and become a visible artifact.|$|E
