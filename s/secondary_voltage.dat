25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the <b>secondary</b> <b>voltage</b> into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor.

40|$|Abstract – It is {{well known}} that typical voltage {{transducers}} utilized on E. H. V. power transmission lines have a limited bandwidth and that the frequency of traveling wave components of the fault induced transients is inversely proportional to fault distance along the lines. Frequencies to be expected can range from hundreds of Hz to infinite (for close in faults).
