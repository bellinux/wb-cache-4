40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In {{the early}} twentieth century in Australia, health and hygiene were {{considered}} by the medical profession to be of the utmost importance for a nation. Government medical doctors recognised that, in creating a healthier generation, their claim for new knowledge would best success based on scientific discoveries, and was therefore vital. Private medicate practitioners, as members of the medical profession, shared the concern {{for the future of the}} nation: the development of <b>school</b> <b>medical</b> services was allowed in a controlled way. The child was identified to be at risk from physical and mental defects and specific childhood problems, which were perceived to be affecting attendance and performance at school. Government primary schools were introduced to the concepts of health and hygiene, as part of a compulsory health strategy, through a scientific model of efficiency. The strategy focused on numerous areas of health including physical and mental defects, anthropometrical studies, nutritional values, physical education requirements, school environment standards and child health research. <b>School</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> through the strategy gained control of child health. Goals were set and Australian children were identified, as the generation in the eugenic sense, and would be a healthier, stronger and more intellectually developed people for the nation. The need was for the youth of Australia for the war effort, and work production during the economic depression, and influenced the health developments in school. This provided a momentum for the <b>school</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> and the <b>medical</b> profession to further the notion of preventive health. It required stringent regulations in the school for conditions for learning. To highlight these activities the study will demonstrate a Foucauldian argument where strategies for surveillance for maintaining control are central. Standards for all aspects of health and hygiene became essential. <b>School</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> sought recognition and control, and provided a platform for clinical expertise in child health. The medical profession also claimed the role as an authoritative health body whilst the psychologist, dentist, nurse and social worker contributed to the health professional role, and emerged as experts in their own field. These developments had a far-reaching effect in the school, home and the community. The study will attempt to demonstrate how medical doctors, from 1900 until 1939, used government primary school systems to highlight the problems affecting the school child. School health in Australia was directly and indirectly assisted by English precedents to develop standards for child health. During this period the emergence of a professional health group assisted Australian <b>school</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> to introduce health and hygiene into the school and the community. A team effort was essential to address a range of health problems. Yet, for <b>school</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> social efficiency was the key to their success or failure, and can be measured in the establishment of a medical curative model...|$|R

Although he exercised active but respectful involvement in his housemasters' running of their houses, Bradfield also saw the first signs of real problems caused by his administrative or communicative carelessness; heads of departments could find new staff appointed under them without being informed, much less consulted, staff accommodation arrangements were sometimes random, and he found the important consideration of the school timetable arrangements to be completely outside his sense of priorities.|$|E

2500|$|... "At any {{one time}} there must be five or six supremely {{intelligent}} people on the earth," [...] The New Yorker poetry editor Howard Moss wrote shortly after Auden's death, [...] "Auden was one of them". Auden's family roots were strongly tied to the West Midlands and he grew up {{from the age of}} six months in the Birmingham area, first in Solihull and then in Harborne, the son of George Augustus Auden, the <b>Schools</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Officer</b> for Birmingham City Council. Auden's early poetry carried strong social, political and economic overtones, reflecting an interest in the thought of Marx and Freud inherited from his father, but his later work was characterised by a greater interest in religious and spiritual issues. The huge range of form, style and subject exhibited by his work, the variety of its outlook and its accessibility and emotional directness initially provoked scepticism amongst modernist critics who placed greater value on consistency and objectivity, but his reputation grew as modernist orthodoxy waned, and he has since increasingly come to be viewed as the first writer of the postmodern era. By 2011 the American critic Edward Mendelson could write: [...] "at the start of the twenty-first century Auden's stature had reached the point where many readers thought it not implausible to judge his work the greatest body of poetry in English of the previous hundred years or more".|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Ninety two school {{children}} in south east London aged 5 - 15 years {{and with a}} diagnosis of epilepsy were identified from the Handicap register kept by the community child health services. Medical information was obtained from hospital discharge summaries. Information about support services for these {{children and their families}} by psychiatrists, physiotherapists, educational psychologists, educational welfare officers, and social workers was obtained from questionnaires completed by school doctors and from <b>school</b> <b>medical</b> records. There was {{a significant increase in the}} use made of these support services by epileptic children placed in special schools compared with those attending ordinary schools. This is probably due to the additional disabilities of the former (mental subnormality, cerebral palsy etc) rather than epilepsy per se, as there was no significant difference in seizure frequency between the two groups of children. Prevalence studies 1 2 have indicated that epilepsy among {{school children}} is a considerable problem and that behavioural and educational problems are more common among epileptic children and their families. 3 4 A multidisciplinary approach to manage-ment is therefore required. We considered the different community support services for children with epilepsy in a mobile, inner city, working class population with a high incidence of single parent families. Method All children aged between 5 and 15 years (on 1 September 1981), who had ever been diagnosed as epileptic, and who lived or attended a school within the Camberwell Health District of London were identified from the community child health services Handicap register. Clinical details on the type of epilepsy, age of onset, seizure frequency, past and present drug treatment, and presence of other handicaps were obtained from the community health service notes and hospital notes (where available). <b>School</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> were asked to complete a questionnaire for each child stating the current position.

40|$|Best medical {{evidence}} indicates that surgical treatment of significant congenital cataracts is required within the first 3 months of life for optimal visual outcome. The aim {{of the present study}} was to review when the diagnosis of congenital cataracts was made in our region, by whom it was made, and the visual outcome at 2 years of age or more. This was a retrospective study in a region with a population of 546, 000 and approximately 8500 births per annum, served by a single Regional Ophthalmology centre. All children under 15 years, diagnosed with Congenital Cataract over a 10 -year period (1991 - 2002), were identified using the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry [HIPE] database. Children with cataract(s) from infancy from a congenital cause and those first presenting outside infancy but with salient clinical features indicating early cataract were included in the study. 27 cases of congenital and infantile cataract 15 (56 %) males, 12 (44 %) females were retrieved. 17 infants (63 %) were diagnosed with bilateral disease, while the remainder were unilateral 10 (37 %). Most of the cases 17 (63 %) were diagnosed following presentation with parental/carer concerns about visual function (usually a squint). However only 2 of these 17 cases presented before 3 months of age. The remaining cases of congenital cataracts were diagnosed by general practitioners 8 (24 %), paediatricians 4 (12 %), ophthalmologists 3 (9 %) or <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Officer</b> (1, 3 %). No case of congenital cataract was diagnosed by newborn screening examination. Six of 8 infants diagnosed with congenital cataracts before three months of age had a good visual outcome, (visual acuity < 6 / 24 at 2 years or more). In contrast only 3 of 19 cases who were diagnosed after 3 months of age had good visual outcomes. Despite their relative rarity, it is imperative that congenital cataracts are diagnosed and treated within 3 months of birth. The onus of diagnosis rests with newborn screening examiners at birth and with general practitioners at the 6 - 8 week checks. Parental concerns about a possible squint should be addressed by performing a red light reflex examination and urgent specialist ophthalmological referral if a flaw is detected...|$|E
