25|$|Astaire's {{last major}} musical film was Finian's Rainbow (1968), {{directed}} by Francis Ford Coppola. Astaire shed his white tie and tails {{to play an}} Irish rogue who believes that if he buries a crock of gold {{in the shadows of}} Fort Knox the gold will multiply. Astaire's dance partner was Petula Clark, who played his character's skeptical daughter. He described himself as nervous about singing with her, while she said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> dancing with him. The film was a modest success both at the box office and among critics.|$|E
25|$|Rumiko Takahashi {{stated that}} Ranma ½ was {{conceived}} to be a martial arts manga that connects {{all aspects of}} everyday life to martial arts. Because her previous series had female protagonists, the author decided that she wanted a male this time. However, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> writing a male main character, and therefore decided to make him half-female. Before deciding on water for initiating his changes, she considered Ranma changing every time he was punched. It was after deciding this that she felt Jusenkyo had to be set in China, {{as it is the}} only place that could have such mysterious springs. She drew inspiration for Ranma ½ from a variety of real-world objects. Some of the places frequently seen in the series are modeled after actual locations in Nerima, Tokyo (both the home of Takahashi and the setting of Ranma ½).|$|E

25|$|At Granny's, Regina is in {{mourning}} during a wake for Robin. Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> him {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma wants to talk to Regina but suddenly they hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina figure out that Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan to wake her. Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and suddenly, it appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{initially}} {{viewed the}} Bolshevik revolution {{in a positive}} light. She wrote in Mother Earth that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented [...] "the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being". By the time she neared Europe, however, she expressed fears about what was to come. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the ongoing Russian Civil War {{and the possibility of}} being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. [...] "I could never in my life work {{within the confines of the}} State," [...] she wrote to her niece, [...] "Bolshevist or otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria was {{exceedingly}} {{protective of}} her son Vladimir, upon whom her {{hopes for the future}} rested. She would not let him attend school because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his safety, and because she wanted him to be brought up as Romanov grand dukes were prior to the revolution. Instead, she hired a tutor for him. She also refused to let him be educated for a future career. In return for her devotion, Vladimir loved and respected his mother. [...] "We adored our parents and their love for us was infinite," [...] Vladimir wrote after their deaths. [...] "All the hardships and bitterness we had to endure in the years were fully covered by our mutual love. We were proud of (them.)" ...|$|E

500|$|Pompeo {{suffers from}} several allergies and asthma. She owns two toy poodles {{with her husband}} because they don't shed: [...] "I have asthma, {{so those are the}} only kinds of dogs I can have." [...] Pompeo follows a healthy lifestyle, meditates twice a day for 20 minutes each, and does so inside her trailer in between takes as well. Pompeo heavily criticised media reports {{suggesting}} that she suffered from an eating disorder, calling the media irresponsible for promoting such rumours. In a 2007 issue of Los Angeles Confidential Magazine, she said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the young girls who look up to her: [...] "I don’t want them to think I starve myself or don’t eat, and that to be like me that’s what they have to do." ...|$|E

[...] She was surprised when the Paralympic Games started at how supportive Australians and international visitors were of athletes at the 2000 Paralympic Games. She won the 400m freestyle and took three bronze medals in the 100m freestyle, 4 x 100m freestyle relay and 4 x 100m medley relay events. After the Games, Cooper believed that they had a long reaching societal impact in terms of creating a better image for disabled people around the country and helping to increase acceptance of them as part of Australian society. [...] She also believed that the Games would help increase spectatorship for Paralympic sports around the country.|$|E
500|$|Millett and Sophie Keir, a Canadian journalist, {{traveled}} to Tehran, Iran in 1979 for the Committee for Artistic and Intellectual Freedom {{to work for}} Iranian women's rights. Their trip followed actions taken by Ayatollah Khomeini's government to prevent girls from attending schools with boys, to require working women to wear veils, and not to allow women to divorce their husbands. Thousands of women attended a protest rally held at Tehran University on International Women's Day, March 8. About 20,000 women attended a march through the city's Freedom Square; {{many of whom were}} stabbed, beaten, or threatened with acid. Millett and Keir, who had attended the rallies and demonstrations, were removed from their hotel room and taken to a locked room in immigration headquarters two weeks after they arrived in Iran. They were threatened that they might be put in jail and, knowing that homosexuals were executed in Iran, Millett also feared she might be killed when she overheard officials discuss her lesbianism. After an overnight stay, the women were put on a plane that landed in Paris. Although Millett was relieved to have arrived safely in France, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the fate of Iranian women left behind, [...] "They can't get on a plane. That's why international sisterhood is so important." [...] She wrote about the experience in her 1981 book Going to Iran.|$|E

500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that person. I know how to be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I {{think is going to be}} to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going for as long as the Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot's secretary, Miss Felicity Lemon, has few human weaknesses. The only {{mistakes}} {{she makes}} within the series are a typing error during {{the events of}} Hickory Dickory Dock and the mis-mailing of an electricity bill, although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> strange events surrounding her sister at the time. Poirot described her as being [...] "Unbelievably ugly and incredibly efficient. Anything that she mentioned as worth consideration usually was worth consideration." [...] She {{is an expert on}} nearly everything and plans to create the perfect filing system. She also worked for the government statistician-turned-philanthropist Parker Pyne. Whether this was during one of Poirot’s numerous retirements or before she entered his employ is unknown. In The Agatha Christie Hour, she was portrayed by British actress Angela Easterling, while in Agatha Christie's Poirot she was portrayed by Pauline Moran. A marked difference from the text exists in Moran's portrayal, where she is an attractive, fashionable, and emotional woman showing an occasional soft corner for Poirot. She also appears far more often in the TV series, making an appearance in most episodes and often being a bigger part of the plot. On a number of occasions, she joins Poirot in his inquiries or seeks out answers alone at his request.|$|E
