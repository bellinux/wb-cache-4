In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor <b>side</b> <b>agreement</b> too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E

In March 2007 the ILO {{ruled in favor of}} UE, and called upon the United States and North Carolina to repeal GS 95-98 and begin discussions with unions to establish “a framework for collective bargaining.” UE’s Mexican ally the FAT, with the support of 52 other US, Mexican, Canadian and global labor organizations, filed a complaint in October 2006 with the Mexican National Administrative Office – a body established to address complaints of labor rights violations under NAFTA.

Separately, the three NAFTA countries [...] the United States, Canada, and Mexico [...] negotiated and entered into two <b>side</b> <b>agreements,</b> the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation. The <b>side</b> <b>agreements</b> allow citizens and governments to raise questions about failures to effectively enforce environmental or labor laws in any of the three countries. This can be accomplished through both a submission process and a government-to-government dispute settlement process. NAFTA also provides protections for investors, such as nondiscriminatory treatment and the right to freely transfer funds related to an investment, as well as a mechanism to settle investor-state disputes through the agreement's chapter 11. This report provides information on the institutional structure, principles, process, cases, and outcomes associated with (1) the environmental <b>side</b> <b>agreement's</b> submission process, (2) the labor <b>side</b> <b>agreement's</b> submission process, and (3) NAFTA's investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.

A recent strand of theoretical and experimental evidence establishes pessimistic predictions concerning the ability of comprehensive global environmental agreements to improve upon the business-as-usual trajectory. We introduce an economic experiment focusing on the dynamics of the negotiation process by observing subjects’ behavior in a Nash bargaining game. Throughout repeated rounds, heterogeneous players bargain over the allocation of a fixed amount of profit-generating emissions with significant losses attached to prolonged failure to reach agreement. We find that the existence of <b>side</b> <b>agreements</b> that constrain individual demands among a subset of like countries does not ensure success; however, such <b>side</b> <b>agreements</b> reduce the demands of high-emission parties.

50|$|The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) is an {{international}} environmental agreement between the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA sought to promote economic growth by lowering most of the existing barriers to trade. While many advocates of NAFTA argued that it would indirectly increase {{the standard of living}} and thus environmental spending on the border, many critics commented on the fact that only a single sentence in the agreement's preamble addressed the environmental impacts of promoting free trade. In order to ensure that NAFTA would pass, the Clinton Administration pushed for NAAEC as a <b>side</b> <b>agreement</b> specifically to aid border environmental issues. From NAAEC came the creation of the Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC), an institution providing a forum for environmental law enforcement disputes to be resolved. Scholars generally agree that the NAAEC's diction is ambiguous and does not clearly define the authority that the organization has; it is also unclear whether violators are obligated to respond to inquiries made by the CEC, and thus few parties have actually been investigated and punished for failing to cooperate.|$|E

5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century there were also sidings to peat moss works on Thorne and Hatfield Moors. Creyke's Siding was originally a small trailing siding {{to the west of the}} line. Its construction was negotiated by Richard Boynton Creyke, and authorised by an agreement dated 7 May 1863. It was close to Moor Road, and there was a signal box to the east of the line at the crossing. The Peat Moss Litter Company built a works to the east of the line in 1886, and agreement was reached for a longer trailing siding to serve the works, on the opposite side of the main line to the original <b>siding.</b> The <b>agreement</b> was dated 11 February 1887. The <b>siding</b> <b>agreement</b> was assigned to William Smith & Co on 9 February 1894, who had taken over the works in 1889. The works was served by a network of [...] gauge horsedrawn tramways, extending onto the moors. Smiths also built a firelighter and disinfectant works near the northern end of the siding. Both products were peat based. The British Moss Litter Co Ltd took over the site in 1896, but failed to notify the North Eastern Railway, who noted the change in 1909. Lengthy correspondence followed, resulting in a new <b>siding</b> <b>agreement</b> being reached on 21 January 1910. The railway company also recorded that the siding was used by a farmer called Mr G Dougherty and by the Nego Firelighting Company in 1908. The peat works operated until 1950-51, and was largely demolished in 1970-71.|$|R

They negotiated a short branch line with a passing look, in an agreement dated 24 April 1889. It ran eastwards from the main line, sweeping round to the south as it entered the works. The peat company merged with the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Co Ltd on 11 May 1893, and the <b>siding</b> <b>agreement</b> was assigned to them on 15 February 1894.

The works were destroyed by a fire in 1922, after which no further peat was processed there, although the remaining buildings were used as a maintenance workshop until 1956.
