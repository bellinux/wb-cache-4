5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E

5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

Among these were items once possessed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron including a pair of andirons with heavy brass heads and a fender, possibly used at Lord Fairfax's Greenway Court estate. White also had a richly inlaid table made of several types of wood, which once belonged to his grandfather, Virginia judge Robert White. Beneath the table's framework was pasted a small <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> paper on which Robert White signed his name and the date, 1789.

40|$|Keyword : <b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> the Tongue, Speaking The {{development}} {{of science and}} technology forces us to learn English. Moreover, it should be given in teaching and learning process in all level of education. In any case, every human being wants to have a good quality in such English skills especially speaking. Nevertheless, sometimes people make a mistake called speech error when they say something. Speech error falls under the category of language production in psycholinguisticsÂ’ field. <b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue can be defined as one of types in speech error which occurs unintentionally. One <b>of</b> phenomena <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue can be recognized when speakers know the word, but it just will not come to be spoken. There are freshmen who have high scores and were active in the class, but they might still make some errors called <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue. Therefore, the writer wants to find out and identify <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue that occur in ESP speaking class of English Department at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. Purpose: The specific {{purpose of the study was}} to find out the kinds <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue found on freshmen in ESP speaking class of English Department at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. Besides, the purpose of this study was to identify how <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue occurred on freshmen in ESP speaking class of English Department at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. Method: The descriptive qualitative research design was employed in this study. The data were collected from freshmen utterances (speech) in ESP speaking class at English department. The instruments used by the writer were observation checklist and interview guide. While taking samples of this study, the writer used purposive sampling. The writer took the freshmen who had high scores and were active in the class. The representative samples in this study consisted of 20 freshmen from ten (10) classes. Findings and Discussion: As the finding of the study, it can be concluded that there are 97 <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue made by the freshmen in ESP speaking class. Some cases in this point were deletion, substitution, addition, anticipation, reversal, and perseveration. Deletion slips are affected by substitutions and anticipations. Besides, the numbers of additions are affected by anticipations, perseveration, and reversal. Yet, there were two types <b>of</b> <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue namely blend and shift/misderivation that did not occur in their utterances. <b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue that occurred in freshmen utterances were affected by several factors. Those factors occurred when the freshmen had problems with vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. Besides, there were also mental conditions such as happy, afraid, shy, and anxious that led the freshmen to make <b>slips</b> <b>of</b> the tongue...|$|R

25|$|The {{instrumental}} scales used {{to describe}} the size of an earthquake began with the Richter magnitude scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale measures the amplitude of the shock, but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his career}} in the Shu government, Meng Guang was notorious for making public outbursts on {{numerous}} occasions and for being very unbridled in his speech. As a result, his colleagues generally disliked or detested him. There were also instances where he carelessly divulged state secrets (probably due to a <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> the tongue) and discussed politics in inappropriate settings. However, he got off lightly because he held much prestige among the literati for his status as a learned Confucian scholar. Meng Guang's behaviour had a huge negative impact on his career: he never made it to higher positions – his highest appointment was Minister of Finance (大司農) – and never received any honours/privileges (e.g., a marquis title). Two of his colleagues, Minister of Ceremonies Xin Cheng (鐔承) and Minister of the Household Pei Jun (裴儁), were younger and less experienced than him, yet they made it to positions higher than his.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E
