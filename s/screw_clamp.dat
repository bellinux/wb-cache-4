50|$|Even though arca-type {{systems from}} various vendors are similar, {{variations}} do create some incompatibilities. The {{width of the}} mounting plates, {{as well as the}} depth and angle of the dovetails, can introduce such incompatibilities when mixing components from different brands. While the traditional <b>screw</b> <b>clamp</b> used to hold plates can accommodate various plate widths, some clamps use a lever-release, which has much lower tolerances. Often the lever-release clamps are only guaranteed to be compatible with plates from the same brand, though they are still considered to be arca-type, and often are compatible with other plates.|$|E

Special cable fittings may be applied to prevent explosive gases from flowing in the interior of jacketed cables, where the cable passes through areas where flammable gases are present. To prevent loosening of the connections of individual conductors of a cable, cables must be supported near their entrance to devices and at regular intervals along their runs. In tall buildings, special designs are required to support the conductors of vertical runs of cable. Generally, only one cable per fitting is permitted, unless the fitting is rated or listed for multiple cables.|$|E

40|$|The {{patient with}} a patent, {{infected}} vascular graft presents a dilemma to the surgeon, who must decide whether revascularization is necessary in addition to removal of the infected graft. When a graft infection points superficially or requires drainage, the graft may be well enough exposed to provide easy access. A technique to determine preoperatively the need for revascularization in two patients with patent, exposed grafts is discussed. Following therapeutic anticoagulation, the exposed grafts were occluded with a <b>screw</b> <b>clamp.</b> Within 1 hour, one patient developed ischemic rest pain, associated with a fall in ankle blood pressure to < 60 mm Hg. Consequently, the patient underwent excision of the infected graft and revascularization with another extraanatomic bypass graft. The second patient, who had moderate intermittent claudication, tolerated clamping of the graft without ischemic symptoms at rest. Revascularization was performed through noninfected tissue, {{with the knowledge that}} the graft could be removed if necessary, without causing ischemic rest pain. This technique helps to determine preoperatively whether patients with exposed, infected grafts require revascularization as well as graft excision...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been made on the cam-clamping device. In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and clamping torque, conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as manual jig, pneumatic clamps, hydraulic fixtures, electric fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline clamp, <b>screw</b> <b>clamp,</b> eccentric circle clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the eccentric circle clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the eccentric circle with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of proteinuria in patients suf-fering from {{congestive heart failure}} is a common clinical occurrence. Since such patients, without any intrinsic renal disease, frequently have both an elevated renal venous pressure and a reduced renal blood flow (1), {{it would seem that}} either one or both of these factors may lead to protein-uria. Proteinuria has been produced experimentally by partial obstruction either of the renal artery or of the renal vein (2 - 5). In most of this work, however, studies of renal hemodynamics were in-complete, or when adequate pressure and blood flow measurements were made (6, 7), the ex-periments were such {{that it was impossible to}} de-termine specifically which hemodynamic factor was responsible for the {{appearance of}} the pro-teinuria. The present study was undertaken in an at-tempt to define further the hemodynamic changes responsible for the excretion of protein by the acutely congested kidney. METHODS Experiments were performed on 26 adult female mon-grel dogs weighing between 10 kg. and 30 kg. The ani-mals were anesthetized by the intravenous administra-tion of 0. 45 to 0. 79 ml. per kilogram of a 6 per cent solu-tion of sodium pentobarbital.

To determine whether beneficial effects of reperfusion are compromised by critical residual coronary stenosis, 14 dogs were instrumented with an external left anterior descending coronary artery balloon occluder, Doppler flow probe and adjustable <b>screw</b> <b>clamp.</b> In {{eight of the}} dogs, critical stenosis (abolition of reactive hyperemia after a 20 s occlusion; 95. 7 ± 1. 0 % cross-sectional area reduction) was induced before occlusion and maintained. In the control group (n = 6), no stenosis was induced Each dog was subjected to 2 h of myocardial ischemia followed by balloon deflation and 24 h of reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow assessed with microspheres was similar during balloon inflation in both groups and indicative of profound ischemia. Transmural {{blood flow to the}} reperfused zone assessed 1 min after balloon deflation was significantly greater in control dogs without residual stenosis (383 % of normal compared with 120 % of normal in dogs with stenosis) (p < 0. 01). Compromise of transmural flow persisted in dogs with stenosis (85 % compared with 121 % of normal in control dogs after 1 h, p < 0. 05; and 49 % compared with 68 % after 24 h of reperfusion, p < 0. 05). Diminution of subendocardial blood Row after reperfusion was particularly marked. The extent of infarction was greater in the heart of dogs with residual stenosis. Thus, residual critical coronary stenosis compromises nutritional perfusion and salvage of reperfused myocardium after recanallzation. These observations underscore the need for prompt identification of patients with high grade residual stenosis early after coronary thrombolysis and the potential value of angioplasty or coronary surgery in selected patients soon after initial recanalization...|$|E
40|$|In another paper (1), {{attention}} has been called to the effect which environmental temperature has in determining the survival or death of the anesthetized dog subjected to crush injury. The {{purpose of the present}} experiments is to deter-mine whether environmental temperature has a similar influence upon the outcome of the shock experiment in a different species, namely, the rabbit, when shock is produced by the tourniquet instead of by the press. Working with burn shock in rats, certain investigators (2) reported an optimal temperature for survival at 750 F. Others (3) published findings that indicated a possible optimum near body temperatures for shock produced by intestinal trauma. We have found (1) that the difference between 160 C. and 280 C. in room temperature makes the difference between survival or death of the dog in crush injury. High temperatures generally are dele-terious, and low temperatures beneficial. No optimum such as that reported by the above-mentioned authors could be detected for the range tested. METHODS Peripheral circulatory failure ("shock") was produced both in anesthetized (Nembutal) and unanesthetized rabbits by means of a tourniquet allowed to remain in place around one hind limb for 5 hours.
