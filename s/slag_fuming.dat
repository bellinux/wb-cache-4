40|$|<b>Slag</b> <b>fuming</b> is a reductive {{treatment}} {{process for}} molten zinciferous slags for extracting zinc {{in the form}} of metal vapour by injecting or adding a reductant source such as pulverized coal or lump coal and natural gas. The process has been operative since 1930 ’s for recovering zinc from lead blast furnace slag. Though <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> is a well-established process and has been industrially operative for over eighty years, there is only limited understanding of the process kinetics and fluid flow behaviour inside the <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> furnace. The {{purpose of this study is}} detailed fluid dynamic analysis including combustion behaviour, gas-liquid momentum interaction, generation of splashing due to gas injection process in <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> furnace, analysis of fuming behaviour at different locations of the furnace by using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling technique. This PhD thesis focuses on the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the zinc <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> process. In the first stage of the present research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the Top Submerged Lance (TSL) gas injection process was carried out in a laboratory scale isothermal air-water model. The multiphase flow simulation, based on Euler-Euler approach, elucidated the effect of swirl and non-swirl flow inside the bath. The effects of lance submergence level and air flow rate were also investigated in that phase. The simulation results for velocity fields and generation of turbulence in the bath were validated against existing experimental data from the previous water model experimental study of Morsi et al. [1]. In the next stage of the research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model of the pilot plant scale top submerged lance <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> furnace was developed to investigate details of fluid flow, combustion behaviour, reaction kinetics and heat transfer in the furnace. The model integrates submerged CH 4 combustion at the lance tip and chemical reactions with the heat, mass and momentum interfacial interaction between the phases present in the system. Commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009. 2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with a number of user defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model is based on 3 -D Eulerian multiphase flow approach and it predicted the velocity and temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence, vortex and plume shape at the lance tip. The model also predicted the mass fractions of slag and gaseous components inside the furnace. The model was validated by adopting the macro – step validation approach by using the zinc fuming rate against the pilot plant scale experimental study on top submerged lance zinc fuming process carried out by Waladan et al. [2]. Finally, the developed CFD model for TSL furnace was extended for submerged coal combustion instead of CH 4 combustion and applied to a conventional tuyere blown <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> furnace. The model considered a thin slice of a conventional tuyere blown <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> furnace consisting two opposing set of tuyere. The model was developed in Eulerian multiphase flow approach by employing 3 D hybrid unstructured orthographic grid system. The aim was to investigate details of fluid flow, submerged coal combustion dynamics, coal utilization behaviour, jet penetration behaviour, bath interaction conditions and generation of turbulence in the bath. The model was developed by coupling the CFD with the kinetics equations developed by Richards et al. for a zinc <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> furnace. The model predicted the velocity, temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence and vortex, coal utilization behaviour from the slag bath. The jet penetration depth at the tuyere tip was validated against the experimental study carried out by Hoefele and Brimacombe [3]...|$|E

The model also predicts the mass fractions of slag and gaseous components inside the furnace. The model predicted that the percent of ZnO in the slag bath decreases linearly with time and is consistent broadly with the experimental data. The zinc fuming rate from the slag bath predicted by the model was validated through macrostep validation process against the experimental study of Waladan et al.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of zinc-containing wastes {{is an important}} sustainability issue facing the metallurgical and wider community as these materials maypose environmental problems and problems related {{to a lack of}} storage space. Major sources of these materials at present are zinc leach residues and electric arc furnace (EAF) dusts, the latter originating from steel recycling practice. The development of technologies that provide technical and economic solutions to the processing of these materials remainsan ongoing problem. One of the technologies currently used to process zinc-containing wastes is zinc <b>slag</b> <b>fuming</b> which relies on the reduction and volatilization of zinc from a molten slag bath. Zinc fuming processes can provide technical and economical solutions to the treatment of zinc-containing residues if they realize high zinc fuming rates. It is now clear as a result ofextensive industrial experience and a number of studies that high process temperatures (about 1350 °C), low oxygen partial pressures and good mixing of the molten bath are essential to obtain high fuming rates down to low zinc concentrations in the slag. High operating temperaturesdrastically shorten the lifetime of refractory linings in conventional zinc fuming furnaces. These limitations may be overcome through the use of water-cooled freeze linings on the smelting reactors, that is a stationary layer of solidified material formed at the inside of the furnace wall as a result of external cooling of the reactor wall. The use of water cooling is characterized by specific challenges in relation to the control of heat losses of the process, the thickness of the freeze lining and the safety of the operations. This Ph. D. text describes a new mathematical model to assist in the optimization of zinc fuming processes, enabling enhanced fuming rates to beachieved whilst maintaining the integrity of the smelting vessel. The model is applied to a new submerged-plasma zinc fuming process. In subsequent chapters, two aspects of the model are further investigated. First,the properties of slag freeze linings in stationary conditions are investigated experimentally. In these experiments, slag freeze layers are produced by solidifying slag onto an air-cooled probe. Second, the heat transfer assumptions in the model are further investigated and integrated into an extended zinc fuming model. New predictions are made using the extended model. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Coal used in {{metallurgical}} processes {{can participate}} in reduction reactions to produce metals and alloys from oxides. Base metals production leads to generation of slag, which contains valuable metals that can be recovered and recycled. There are several options to treat the slag, depending on the metal content in the slag. One is <b>slag</b> <b>fuming,</b> which is a well-established process that is traditionally used to vaporize zinc from zinc containing slags, mainly lead blast furnace slag, but is applied in a few plants for copper smelting slags. In this process reduction is achieved using pulverized coal, lump coal or natural gas. Conventionally pulverized coal injected to the furnace is utilized both to participate in reduction reactions and also to supply heat. On the other hand, the amount of possible alternative reducing agents such as residue plastic material is increasing steadily {{and the issue of}} sustainable disposal management of these materials has arisen. As carbon and hydrogen are major constituents of the residue plastic-containing materials, they have the potential to be an auxiliary source of reducing agents, to partially replace conventional sources such as coal. Shredder Residue Material (SRM) is a plastic-containing residue material after separation of main metals. Utilization of SRM as an alternative reducing agent, would lead to not only decreased dependency on primary sources such as coal but also to an increase in the efficiency of utilization of secondary sources. This calls for systematic scientific investigations, wherein these secondary sources are compared with primary sources with respect to e. g., devolatilization characteristics, gasification characteristics and reactivity. As a first step, devolatilization characteristics of SRM are compared with those of coal using thermogravimetric analysis. To study the reduction potential of the evolved materials, composition of evolved off-gas was continuously monitored using quadrupole mass spectroscopy. To {{gain a better understanding of}} possible interaction of plastics in a mixture, the devolatilization mechanisms and the volatile composition of three common plastics; polyethylene, polyurethane and polyvinylchloride and their mixture have been studied. Furthermore, gasification characteristics and reactivity of char produced from SRM is compared with coal char. The effect of devolatilization heating rate on gasification rate of char was investigated. Proximate analysis has shown that SRM mainly decomposes by release of volatiles, while coal shows high fixed carbon content, which is reported to contribute to reduction reactions. The composition of volatiles shows H 2, CO and hydrocarbons which are known to have reduction potential. Therefore, it is essential that SRM be used in a process that could utilize the evolved volatiles for reduction. The results confirm the interaction between the plastics within the binary and ternary mixtures, which suggests that similar phenomenon may occur during devolatilization of SRM. Although the char produced from SRM contains lower amounts of fixed carbon compared to coal char, it has a porous structure and high surface area, which makes it highly reactive during gasification experiments. In addition to physiochemical properties, the catalytic effect of ash content of SRM char contributes to its higher reactivity and lower activation energy value compared to coal char. Moreover, the gasification reactivity of char produced at fast devolatilization heating rate was highest, due to less crystalline structure of produced char.

The development of low pH cements for use in geological repositories for radioactive waste stem from concerns over the potential for deleterious effects upon the host rock and other EBS materials (notably bentonite) under the hyperalkaline conditions (pH> 12) of cement pore fluids. Low pH cement (also known as low heat cement) was developed by the cement industry for use where large masses of cement (e. g. dams) could cause problems regarding heat generated during curing.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of different industrial waste, by-products or other {{materials such as}} ground granulated blast furnace <b>slag,</b> silica <b>fume,</b> fly ash, limestone, and kiln dust, etc. as supplemen- tary cementing materials has received considerable attention in recent years. A study has been conducted {{to look into the}} performance of laterite as Supplementary Cementing Materials (SCM). The study focuses on compressive strength performance of blended cement containing different percentage of laterite. The cement is replaced accordingly with percentage of 2 %, 5 %, 7 % and 10 % by weight. In addition, the effect of use of three chemically different laterites have been studied on physical performance of cement as in setting time, Le-Chatlier expansion, loss on ignition, insoluble residue, free lime and specifically compressive strength of cement cubes tested at the age of 3, 7, and 28 days. The results show that the strength of cement blended with laterite as SCM is enhanced.

40|$|Supplementary {{cementitious}} {{materials are}} finely divided material that replaces or supplements {{the use of}} Portland cement. Its use reduces the cost and /or improves one or more technical properties of concrete. These materials are generally by-product from other processes or natural materials. These materials include fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace <b>slag,</b> condensed silica <b>fume,</b> lime and natural pozzolan [1]. For use in mortar or concrete supplementary cementitious materials need to meet requirements of established standards [2]. Attempt has been made, here, to study the characteristics and behavior of supplementary cementitious materials, especially the lime and fly ash from Vidarbha Region of Central India, which are local resources...|$|R
40|$|Manganese imparts {{numerous}} beneficial mechanical properties. Hence {{it finds}} extensive application in iron, steel and non-ferrous sector. Prevalently, it {{is incorporated in}} the form of master alloys i. e. 'ferromanganese'. In India, ferromanganese is mainly the inexpensive and paramount source of availability of manganese. Various conventional and non-conventional techniques of ferromanganese production have been adopted in past and present. However, these techniques have demerits viz. high refractory, energy consumption, losses of valuables in <b>slag</b> and <b>fumes.</b> Also geographical co-ordinates of the plant restricted the manufacturer to pre-fer an appropriate process. Accordingly, the industrially implemented methods had reliance on availability of infrastructure, energy, mineral resources, grade of raw material, outlay of labor, environmental compati-bility of technique etc. In view of the liberalized economy and the gap scenario in the supply and demand of ferromanganese, the authors felt it indispensable to explicitly bridge up this vacuum by initially designing a simple energy con-serving, eco-friendly, low capital investment technique for decarburization of ferromanganese. Measurement of the data involved studying the impact of rate governing parameters on the process kinetics. This laboratory scale investigation is expected to escalate the Mn/C quotient of high carbon ferromanganese...|$|R
5000|$|A {{concrete}} plant, {{also known}} as a batch plant or batching plant or a concrete batching plant, is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica <b>fume,</b> <b>slag,</b> and cement. There are two main types of concrete plants: Dry mix plants and Wet mix plants, and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a central mix side while utilizing common material storage points. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either tilt drum or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, batch plant controls, and dust collectors.|$|R
40|$|At {{present in}} India, about 960 {{million metric tons}} of solid was te is being {{generated}} annually as byproducts during industrial, mining, municipal, agricultural and other processes. Advances in solid waste management resulted in alter native construction materials as a substitute to traditional materials like bricks, blocks, tiles, aggregates, ceramics, cement, lime, soil, timber and paint. To safeguard th e environment, efforts are being made for recycling different wastes and to utilize th em in value added applications. The cement industries have been making significan t progress in reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions through improvements in process technology and enhancements in process efficiency, but further improvements ar e limited because CO 2 production is inherent to the basic process of calcinations of limestone. In the past two decades, various investigations have been conducted on industri al wastes like flyash, blast furnace <b>slag,</b> Silica <b>fume,</b> rice husks and other industria l waste materials to act as cement replacements. This paper consist of a review extensively conducted on publications related to utilization of waste materials as cemen t replacement with an intention to develop a process so as to produce an eco-friendly concrete having similar or higher strength and thus simultaneously providing a remedy t o environmental hazards resulting from waste material disposal...|$|R
