50|$|Trichopherophyton was {{described}} from very fragmentary fossils {{found in the}} Rhynie chert, Rhynie, Scotland, which is of Early Devonian, specifically Pragian, age. The overall growth habit of the plant is difficult to construct. Some stems reached 2.5 mm in diameter, but their height is unknown; branching was possibly pseudomonopodial (i.e. one arm of a dichotomous branch continued as a 'main' stem). Uniquely among the Rhynie chert plants, aerial stems bore rigid hairs or spines made up of single cells. Stems appear to have grown from coiled (circinnate) tips, {{in a manner similar}} to modern ferns. Stems contained circular exarch xylem strands with tracheids showing both annular and <b>spiral</b> <b>thickening.</b> The upright spore-forming organs or sporangia were made up of two 'valves', the larger one facing away from the stem and bearing hairs, the smaller facing towards the stem and apparently not bearing hairs. The precise arrangement of the sporangia on the stems cannot be determined; there may have been zones of sporangia. Spores were released through a slit opening along the margins of the two valves of a sporangium. The trilete spores were about 55 µm in diameter.|$|E
40|$|Crataeva tapia Linn. ssp. odora (Jacob.) Almeida, a {{traditional}} medicinal plant, which is valued for its {{benefits in the}} management of urinary and inflammatory disorders. Leaves are externally rubefacient and used in rheumatism; internally they are given as febrifuge and tonic. The leaves also act as anti-periodic. The current study was therefore carried out to provide requisite pharmacognostic details about the leaves of C. tapia. Pharmacognostic evaluation included examination of morphological and microscopical characters; physicochemical properties, phytochemical analysis, fluorescence study and HPTLC finger print. The powder microscopy showed the presence of anomocytic stomata and <b>spiral</b> <b>thickening.</b> Phytochemical screening reported the presence of tannins, steroidal compounds, cardiac glycosides and alkaloids. The Rf value of 0. 35 detected at 300 nm and 600 nm by qualitative densitometric HPTLC fingerprint, can be used as identifying marker for methanolic extract. The present study will provide the information with respect to identification and authentication of crude drug...|$|E
40|$|We present {{evidence}} that isolated growing discs, subject to internal <b>spiral</b> perturbations, <b>thicken</b> due to both heating and radial migration. We show this by demonstrating that the thickness and vertical velocity dispersions of coeval stars {{depend on their}} age {{as well as the}} change in their radii. While the disc thickens due to internal processes, we find that this induces only a minor amount of flaring. We further demonstrate the consequences of such thickening on the structural properties of stellar populations and find that they qualitatively agree with recent studies of the Milky Way disc.

The test is planoconvex to lenticular, trochospiral, with three to four gradually enlarging whorls, seven to eight chambers in the final whorl. Sutures on the <b>spiral</b> side are <b>thickened</b> and curved back toward the periphery, those on the umbilical side radial and incised. The aperture is interiomarginal, midway between umbilicus and periphery, and may be partially covered by the umbilical granules. Test composition is calcareous.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Centella asiatica and Bacopa monnieri {{widely known}} as Brahmi are {{considered}} as ‘Medhya rasayanas ’ in Ayurveda meaning brain tonic. However, these plants are distinctly different. The name Brahmi, Jala-brahmi or water-brahmi {{is assigned to}} Bacopa monnieri whereas "mandukaparni", often confused with Brahmi, refers to Centella asiatica. A detailed investigation of whole plant and roots of both the crude drugs was carried out. The diagnostic characteristics includes presence of stomata, vessels with <b>spiral</b> <b>thickening,</b> rosette crystals of calcium oxalate in Centella asiatica and xylem vessels with reticulate thickening, glandular hairs, simple, round and oval starch grains, measuring 4 - 14 μ in diameter in Bacopa monnieri. Various physicochemical parameters were also established. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many therapeutically important classes of phytoconstituents such as glycosides, alkaloids, saponins, protiens and carbohydrates. The present work was undertaken to generate information regarding relevant pharmacognostical, phytochemical and physicochemical data needed for proper identification and authentification of two crude drugs belonging to two different families, mainly focusing and exploring the aspects leading to common effect of improving memory...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{fuel wood}} {{analysis}} {{based on the}} ‘Principle of Least Effort’ helps to decipher the ecological limitations imposed on prehistoric hunter-gatherers. This study is based on botanical identification of wood charcoal from ‘Swedish middle Mesolithic’ archaeological sites dating from between ca. 9650 and 8300 cal. yr BP in northern Sweden, a period when the land was freshly released from ice cover. Charcoal fragments were analysed based on their anatomical and morphological features and anomalies. Tree-ring thickness gives {{an indication of the}} growing conditions experienced by woody plants, the tree-ring curvature provides an indication of the diameter of the pieces of wood used for fuel and the percentage of fragments with <b>spiral</b> <b>thickening</b> indicates the importance of compression or tension wood, which is related to branches or trunks stressed by snow burden or wind. Among the main woody species, the assemblages are dominated by Pinus sylvestris with some Salicaceae trees (Populus, Salix). Large wood pieces including branches were used as fuel. Several taxa were rarely recorded (Betula, Sorbus, Ericaceae) or not observed (Juniperus, Hippophae, Alnus) although their presences were expected based on other local palaeobotanical records. Because (1) charcoal of Pinus sylvestris abounds despite not being a good fuel wood and (2) certain consumable or combustible taxa are scarce (Betula) or are only present at certain sites (Salicaceae), it appears that Mesolithic hunters were not selective when choosing wood for fuel, although wood was not a limiting factor for the first settlers in northern Sweden. Pine tree-ring width range is within the modern range for the same species, indicating growing conditions similar to those experienced today. The results suggest the occurrence of woodland, probably in the lowlands. During the early-Holocene, trees rapidly covered the land after the ice-sheet melted, facilitating the life of Mesolithic hunters following reindeer herds...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{taxonomy of}} the Symplocaceae in Taiwan was studied {{according to the}} characters of pollen, venation, and wood. According to pollen morphology and sculpture, the Symplocaceae was classified into two types and seven subtypes. The results of the wood anatomy indicated that all species {{divided into two groups}} in terms of the existence of the <b>spiral</b> <b>thickening</b> on vessel walls and fiber-tracheids. The results of numerical taxonomy based on the 127 morphological characters were coincident with the morphological methods. Among the 28 species of Symplocaceae in Taiwan, 11 species have been found in mainland China, 8 species in Ryukus, 4 species in Japan, and 1 species in Philippines. This study concluded that there was one genus(Symplocos), including two subgenus and 28 species(including variety), in the family in Taiwan. Only one species(S. sonoharae var. formosana) was classified to subgen. Symplocos, and the other 27 species were categorized as to subgen. Hopea. The species of subgen. Hopea were further classified into eight sections: sect. Palura, sect. Lodhra, sect. Bobua, sect. Lancifoliae, sect. Glaucae, sect. Glomeratae, sect. Palaeosymplocos, sect. Wikstroemifoliae C. C. Wang sect. nov [...] The key, note on habitat, general distribution maps, synonyms, and description for each species and variety were presented in this paper. 本研究檢視臺灣產灰木科植物之標本，並觀察各分類群之形態特徵，包括花粉粒形態與表面雕紋、葉脈特徵分析及木材顯微構造觀察，並描述本科植物與鄰近地區之關係及在臺灣的分布模式。 根據花粉粒特徵之研究結果，可將臺灣產灰木科植物區分為 2 型 7 亞型；依木材導管是否具有螺旋狀增厚特徵可區分為 2 型。根據各分類群之 127 個性狀資料，以數據分類所得之歸群結果和形態分類之結果頗為一致。就臺灣自生的灰木科 28 種植物種類而言，其中有 11 種與中國大陸的種類相同，琉球次之(8 種亦見於琉球) ，再次為日本(4 種) ，僅有蘭嶼灰木(S. cochinchinensis var. philippensis) 1 種亦產於菲律賓。 本研究主張將臺灣的灰木科植物區分為灰木屬 (Symplocos) 1 屬；灰木亞屬(subgen. Symplocos) 、深裂灰木亞屬(subgen. Hopea) 2 亞屬及 28 種(含變種) ，其中臺灣南嶺灰木歸於灰木亞屬，其餘 27 種歸於深裂灰木亞屬。並可進一步將深裂灰木亞屬劃分為錐序節(sect. Palura) 、光頂山礬節(sect. Lodhra) 、球果山礬節(sect. Bobua) 、披針葉山礬節(sect. Lancifoliae) 、山羊耳節(sect.

5000|$|They {{typically}} {{contain the}} remaining orchids with a single, fertile anther ( [...] = monandrous), {{which is also}} fully incumbent ( [...] = strongly convex) to suberect (= ascending towards the edges). The anther form arises from column elongation or, as in the vandoids, from early anther bending. The incumbent anther forms a right angle with the column axis or is pointed backward in many genera. Most have hard pollinia, i.e. a mass of waxy pollen or of coherent pollen grains. The pollinia are with caudicle and viscidium or without. The stigma are entire or three-lobed; a beak is present. The apical part of the middle stigma lobe forms a stipe ( [...] = pollinium stalk). The ovary is unilocular. The leaves are distichous or <b>spiraling,</b> growing on <b>thickened</b> stems.|$|R
40|$|Progress of {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT) in gastric cancer and the clinical outcome {{are described in}} this paper. (1) We included the whole lesion and a 5 mm margin {{in the field for}} irradiation. Marking by injection of India-ink showing the irradiation field was performed beforehand. (2) We established the standard light dose to be 90 J/cm 2 for an argon dye laser and 60 J/cm 2 for a pulse wave laser. (3) The size of cancerous lesion curable by PDT was expanded from 3 cm in diameter, i. e. 7 cm 2 in area to 4 cm in diameter, i. e. 13 cm 2 by employing a new excimer dye laser model, which could emit 4 mJ/pulse with 80 Hz pulse frequency. (4) The depth of cancer invasion which could be treated by PDT was increased from about 4 mm, i. e. the superficial part of the submucosal layer (SM- 1) to more than 10 mm in depth, i. e. the proper muscular layer. These improvements owe much to the pulse laser, the photodynamic action induced by which permits deeper penetration than that of a continuous wave laser. (5) We employed a side-viewing fiberscope for gastric PDT to irradiate the lesion from an angle of 90 °. (6) We designed a simple cut quartz fiber for photoradiation with a <b>spiral</b> spring <b>thickened</b> toward the end. (7) We developed an endoscopic device for photoradiation in PDT which achieves accurate and efficient irradiation. As a result of these improvements a higher cure rate was obtained even with a lower light dose of irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{nitrogen}} fixation {{has recently been}} demonstrated in Brazilian sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) cultivars known to form associations {{with a number of}} diazotrophs, iricluding Acetobacter diazotrophicus, an acid-tolerant endophytic bacterium which grows best on a sucrose-rich medium. In a series of experiments, aseptically-grown sugar cane plantlets were rooted in a liquid medium and inocu- lated with A. diazotrophicus originally isolated from field-grown sugar cane. After 4, 7, 9, and 15 d, plaflts were examined under light, scanning and transmission electron microscopes and the presence of A. diazotrophicus on and within plant tissues was con- firmed by immunogold labelling. By 15 d, external bacterial colonization was seen on roots and lower stems, particularly at cavities in lateral root junctions. The loose cells of the root cap at root tips were a site of entry of the bacteria into root tissues. Both at lateral root junctions and root tips, bacteria were also seen in enlarged, apparently intact, epidermal cells. After 15 d, bacteria were present in xylem vessels {{at the base of the}} stem, many: -connected via mucus to <b>spiral</b> secondary <b>thickening.</b> There was no obvious patho- genic reaction to the bacteria within the xylem. From these observations, it is proposed that, under experi- mental conditions, A. diazotrophicus firstly colonized the root and lower stem epidermal surfaces and then used root tips and lateral root junctions to enter the sugar cane plant where it was distributed around the plant in the transpiration stream. It is further sug- gested that the xylem vessels in the dense shoots of mature plants are also a possible site of N 2 -fixation by diazotrophs as they provide the low pO 2 and energy as sucrose necessary for nitrogenase activity. 199...|$|R
5000|$|The spire is {{high and}} scalar. The apex, porcelanous and {{scarcely}} iridescent, is small, high, and mammillate, and consists of the one embryonic whorl, {{which is a little}} turned up on its side. The six whorls increase gradually and regularly in size. They are rounded, near the apex a little angulated by one of the spirals. The suture well marked, angulated, but not sharply so. The aperture is rather oblique, rounded, hardly angulated at the upper corner, not in the least descending, brilliantly iridescent within and showing the colored spirals of the outside. The outer lip is thin, slightly puckered at the <b>spirals,</b> a little <b>thickened</b> on the base. The inner lip is thickened and reflected, especially at its junction with the body where it almost covers the umbilicus. The columella is much curved, and thins gradually out to its junction with the base. The umbilicus is large and funnel-shaped on the base, deep, but small further in, contracted by a spiral white columellar pad, and more than half covered over by the columellar lip. The operculum is rather thin, horny, yellow, with ten or twelve very gradual turns, which are strongly defined by a thickened line. It is feebly marked with concentric and with radiating lines.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell is}} of medium size and grows to {{a length of}} 2.7 mm. It is {{strongly}} sculptured, subdiaphanous to milk-white. The nuclear whorls number at least two, and are obliquely {{a little more than}} half immersed. The five post-nuclear whorls are strongly shouldered and subtabulated. They have a strong, broad, spiral keel limiting the anterior edge of the shoulder and an acute raised keel on the middle of the whorls between the sutures, while a thir-d equally acute keel marks the periphery of the last whorl. Two other keels ornament the base, the anterior one of which is not quite as strong as its neighbor. The axial sculpture consists of narrow, more or less lamellar, almost vertical ribs, which render the intersection with the <b>spiral</b> keels somewhat <b>thickened,</b> but not nodulose. These axial ribs extend over the periphery and base of the body whorl to the umbilical region, gradually growing weaker as they approach this point. There are about 18 on the second and 20 upon the penultimate whorl. The spaces between the ribs and keels appear as concave quadrangular depressions. The umbilicus is narrowly perforated. The sutures are deeply channeled by the shouldered whorl. The aperture is suboval. The posterior angle is decidedly obtuse. The outer lip is thick, marked by 5 projections, corresponding to the 5 keels. The columella is almost straight, strongly revolute with a conspicuous oblique fold near its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a faint callus showing both basal keels, the anterior faint and just posterior to the insertion of the columella and the next on the middle of the wall.|$|R
