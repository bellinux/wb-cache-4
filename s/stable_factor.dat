50|$|The fourth paper {{published}} in this series, entitled “The Relationship of Epinephrine and Glucagon to Liver Phosphorylase: IV Effect of Epinephrine and Glucagon on the Reactivation of Phosphorylase in Liver Homogenates”, {{came out in}} 1956 and was the most influential and groundbreaking of those released. In this paper, Sutherland and associates furthered their investigation of epinephrine and glucagon. The key {{to the success of}} this experiment was the use a homogenate of liver cells rather than intact liver cells, as they had been doing in their previous experiments. The general consensus among researchers at that time was that the study of hormones was only possible using intact cells; this was the first instance that a hormone pathway was studied using a cell homogenate. Sutherland and his co-authors were able to observe similar effects in liver homogenate to what was observed in whole liver slices. More importantly, they were able to observe this response in two stages. This stage response was characterized by the particulate fraction producing an unknown heat <b>stable</b> <b>factor</b> {{in the presence of the}} hormones epinephrine and glucagon. This factor then stimulates the formation of liver phosphorylase in a fraction of the homogenate where the hormones are not present. This unknown heat <b>stable</b> <b>factor,</b> which was produced in the presence of hormones and ultimately led to the secondary formation of liver phosphorylase, was later termed cyclic AMP.|$|E

If there is no axial force applied, the straight tubular string lies on the lower side of the wellbore. With the axial compression increasing to a certain value, the tubular string moves up from the wellbore bottom and buckles into a certain configuration. During this process, the axial force, which makes the tubular string become unstable, contends with other <b>stable</b> <b>factors</b> such as the wellbore constraint, perpendicular weight component, and the bending stiffness of the tubular string.

40|$|Psychological {{research}} on behavior has waned in recent decades. One underappreciated {{reason for this}} trend is that the field lacks a general-purpose framework targeted {{to the study of}} behavior. This chapter presents one such framework, a metatheory called the I 3 Model (pronounced “I-cubed model”), which suggests that all behavior emerges from a combination of three orthogonal processes. Instigation encompasses the effects of exposure to a particular target object in a particular context that normatively affords a certain behavior. Impellance encompasses the effects of situational or <b>stable</b> <b>factors</b> that increase the likelihood that (or the intensity with which) the individual enacts the behavior when encountering that target object in that context. Inhibition encompasses the effects of situational or <b>stable</b> <b>factors</b> that increase the likelihood that (or the extent to which) people will override the effects of instigation and impellance on behavior, thereby reducing its enactment. According to “Perfect Storm Theory, ” which is derived from the I 3 Model, the highest likelihood or intensity of behavior emerges when instigation and impellance are strong and inhibition is weak. The generativity and integrative potential of the I 3 Model and Perfect Storm Theory are illustrated with novel reviews of the aggression and eating behavior literatures...|$|R
40|$|In {{controlling}} flexible space structures one always encounters {{the problem}} that the control design {{is based on an}} inaccurate model. The inaccuracy in the models are for instance unknown damping, neglected dynamics and inaccuracy in the position of actuators and sensors. Therefore the control design must be robust. As a simple model for such a structure we will use a partial differential equation for a one-dimensional beam with point actuators and sensors. This beam model belongs to a class of infinite-dimensional systems, which have possibly unbounded, finite-rank input and output operators. For our model we assume that both the damping as the stiffness coefficient are not exactly, known. The problem of robustly stabilizing a linear system subject to respectively additive, multiplicative and <b>stable</b> <b>factor</b> perturbations of its transfer function is considered for our flexible beam model. In particular, we will, discuss the possibility of modelling the uncertainty in the parameters in our model as additive. multiplicative or <b>stable</b> <b>factor</b> perturbations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a systematic hazard interaction classification {{based on the}} geophysical environment that natural hazards arise from – the hazard-forming environment. According to their contribution to natural hazards, geophysical environmental factors in the hazard-forming environment were categorized into two types. The first are relatively <b>stable</b> <b>factors</b> which construct the precondition for the occurrence of natural hazards, whilst the second are trigger factors, which determine the frequency and magnitude of hazards. Different combinations of geophysical environmental factors induce different hazards. Based on these geophysical environmental factors for some major hazards, the <b>stable</b> <b>factors</b> are used to identify which kinds of natural hazards influence a given area, and trigger factors are used to classify the relationships between these hazards into four types: independent, mutex, parallel and series relationships. This classification helps to ensure all possible hazard interactions among different hazards are considered in multi-hazard risk assessment. This can effectively fill the gap in current multi-hazard risk assessment methods which to date only consider domino effects. In addition, based on this classification, the probability and magnitude of multiple interacting natural hazards occurring together can be calculated. Hence, the developed hazard interaction classification provides a useful tool to facilitate improved multi-hazard risk assessment...|$|R
