25|$|At 11:15 that morning, Fred {{formally}} {{admitted to}} police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit {{in an act}} of manslaughter. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage before dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of shock, before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.|$|E
25|$|Between 5 and 8 March, {{police would}} find six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been {{extensively}} mutilated, and each body bore evidence {{of having been}} subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, <b>serrated</b> <b>knife.</b> The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an obvious effort to facilitate her breathing prior to her murder. Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones, although when questioned as to this ominous paradigm, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains.|$|E
2500|$|... 19 June: Heather West, (16). Heather {{was likely}} to have been murdered because Fred and Rose {{considered}} her efforts to leave the household as a threat, as she is known to have divulged to her classmates the extensive physical and sexual abuse which occurred at Cromwell Street. Although Fred claimed he had not meant to kill his daughter, carpet fibers found upon two lengths of rope, discovered with her remains, suggested that Heather had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. Her body was dismembered with a heavy <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> and later buried in a hole in the garden which Fred had his own son dig, under the pretence of installing a fish pond. The 1994 police investigation into Heather's disappearance would lead to the discovery of her body, and the arrest of both her parents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} day, Mike Pryor is {{questioned by}} campus security officer Jim MacVey over the fight with his girlfriend; MacVey's daughter Penny was Dickie Cavanaugh's girlfriend. Later that evening, the campus radio DJ broadcasts the {{clues to the}} scavenger hunt, which are received by the girls on their portable radios. Meanwhile, the killer who is dressed in the bear costume, is armed with <b>serrated</b> <b>knives</b> mimicking bear claws.|$|R
50|$|The two {{brothers}} John and Henrie Clauss, of German origin, started Elyria Shear Works from a one-room building in Elyria, Ohio. Together with five employees, they began manufacturing scissors, shears, straight razors and <b>serrated</b> kitchen <b>knives.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Airedales bearing undercoats are {{generally}} groomed by hand stripping {{where a small}} <b>serrated</b> edged <b>knife</b> is used to pull out loose hair from the dog's coat. [...] Most Airedales require frequent (6 to 8 weeks) clipping or stripping as they do not shed.|$|R
50|$|F. Dick is {{mentioned}} by name in Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential. Specifically, he notes the offset <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> that is manufactured by the company.|$|E
50|$|Angel food cake {{should be}} cut with a <b>serrated</b> <b>knife,</b> as a straight-edged blade tends to {{compress}} the cake rather than slice it. Forks, electric serrated knives, special tined cutters or a strong thread should be used instead.|$|E
50|$|Bread knives {{are usually}} between 15 cm and 25 cm (6 and 10 inches). An offset <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> uses an offset handle {{to ensure the}} cook's {{knuckles}} will not touch the cutting surface when the blade has cut all {{of the way through}} the food.|$|E
5000|$|The Maryland Crab Feast ("Crab Boil" [...] is not {{a phrase}} used in Maryland, as is in Louisiana) is a popular event for small groups of friends. Despite the name, the cooking {{technique}} is actually steaming. Crab pots have a raised bottom that keeps a fitted basket above the liquid. A couple of inches of beer (or water) mixed with vinegar is brought to a boil. The crabs are placed in the basket and sprinkled liberally with a seasoning mix (usually Old Bay), and then placed in the steamer. Twenty minutes later the bright red crabs are pulled up and turned out onto trays or platters. Tables are covered with layers of brown paper and wooden mallets and <b>serrated</b> <b>knives</b> are made available for cracking claws and picking out meat. Typical side dishes are cole slaw and corn on the cob.|$|R
50|$|A tomato knife {{is a small}} <b>serrated</b> kitchen <b>knife</b> {{designed}} to slice through tomatoes. The serrated edge allows the knife to penetrate the tomatoes’ skin quickly and {{with a minimum of}} pressure without crushing the flesh. Many tomato knives have forked tips that allow the user to lift and move the tomato slices after they have been cut.|$|R
5000|$|Available only {{as part of}} the {{headliner}} Kiss Players set, Marissas first-ever toy is a soft-plastic PVC figurine with {{a permanent}} pucker, designed mainly to sit demurely on the robot-mode shoulder of her partner Convoy. Marissa comes with several interchangeable limbs; a pair of legs bent at the knee to allow her to perch on Primes shoulder or sit in his drivers seat, a pair of straight legs to allow her stand upright (but only with the aid of the small stand included), a set of straight arms, and a set of arms bent at the elbow to allow her mime the act of placing her hands on Primes steering wheel while shes sitting in him. She comes with a surfboard that becomes either Optimus Primes [...] "Surfblade" [...] sword or a pair of long <b>serrated</b> <b>knives.</b> The set also comes with a CD containing the first 5 episodes of the Kiss Players radio drama and the exclusive 10-minute audio story, [...] "Someday, Under the Sun". This set was originally intended for release in the Binaltech Asterisk line as [...] "Black Convoy meets Marissa", but was cancelled due to low sales of the previous toys before it was even officially solicited. How much difference there is between the planned Asterisk version of Marissa and the final Kiss Players version is currently unknown.|$|R
50|$|The State Prosecution first {{fought to}} prevent Dr Forman from testifying in the Nazareth court in Roman Zadorov's case. Dr Forman {{eventually}} testified for Zadorov in the Nazareth District Court that the murder was committed using a <b>serrated</b> <b>knife,</b> not a smooth-edged Japanese knife.|$|E
50|$|The {{edge of a}} knife {{gradually}} {{loses its}} sharpness, which can be restored by sharpening. For many types of knives (e.g., butter knives) this is not relevant. Knives with smooth edges can be sharpened by the user; knives with any form of serrated edge should ideally be sharpened with specialist equipment, although the useful life of a <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> can be extended by simple sharpeners, even if they damage the edge.|$|E
50|$|The {{teeth were}} quite large for its size {{containing}} a single cusp per tooth with many serrations as in a <b>serrated</b> <b>knife.</b> These teeth were replaced throughout its life cycle.The eye socket was fairly large and placed near the temporal opening, {{separated by a}} thin postorbital bar. Suminia had grasping hands, which has led researchers to conclude {{that it was a}} tree-climbing animal, the earliest known such vertebrate species found thus far.|$|E
50|$|Specialized steak knives {{emerged in}} America {{following}} World War II. Prior to World War I, all table knives were sharp, but required frequent upkeep—sharpening and polishing. With {{the decline in}} domestic workers (household servants), this upkeep became less feasible. Stainless steel became widespread following World War I, which did not require polishing, but did require sharpening due to manufacturing limits. Following World War II, serrated stainless steel steak knives were introduced which required neither polishing nor frequent sharpening, and proved an instant hit. In the 1950s heat treatment of stainless steel was introduced, allowing knives to remain sufficiently sharp without needing serrations, but by this point <b>serrated</b> steak <b>knives</b> had become well-established and continued to be used.|$|R
5000|$|Variations on {{the device}} {{have since been}} invented by other people, such as a {{disposable}} plastic spatula whose handle holds the box top up; and a plastic tripod, like the design by Vitale, but {{with one of the}} legs <b>serrated</b> like a <b>knife,</b> making for easy cutting of stuck cheese and bread. [...] Some pizzerias have eliminated the use of plastic pizza savers by returning to the old method of simply baking a bread ball into the center of their pizzas.|$|R
5000|$|A {{slicing knife}} serves a similar {{function}} to a carving knife, {{although it is}} generally longer and narrower. Slicers may have plain or <b>serrated</b> edges. Such <b>knives</b> often incorporate blunted or rounded tips, and feature kullenschliff (Swedish/German: [...] "hill-sharpened") or Granton edge (scalloped blades) to improve meat separation. Slicers are designed to precisely cut smaller and thinner slices of meat, and are normally more flexible to accomplish this task. As such, many cooks find them better suited to slicing ham, roasts, fish, or barbecued beef and pork and venison.|$|R
50|$|Bullock {{moved to}} Pittsburgh, {{and in a}} couple of years, perfected a {{printing}} press called the web rotary press. Richard March Hoe had invented the rotary press in 1843, but Bullock's press was an improvement over Hoe's design. Bullock's press allowed for continuous large rolls of paper to be automatically fed through the rollers, eliminating the laborious hand-feeding system of earlier presses. The press was self-adjusting, printed on both sides, folded the paper, and a sharp <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> that rarely needed sharpening cut sheets with rapid precision. The press could print up to 12,000 sheets an hour; later improvements raised the speed to up to 30,000 sheets an hour.|$|E
5000|$|On Saturday afternoon, 18 December 2010, Luken and Wilson were {{hiking in}} the Mata forest, {{near the town of}} Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. They noticed two Arab men, Aiad Fatfata and Kifah Ghanimat, {{approaching}} them and were suspicious of their intentions. The men attacked them armed with a long <b>serrated</b> <b>knife.</b> The women attempted to fight back, Wilson managing to stab an attacker with a pocketknife, before they were subdued. The men stole their money and removed Wilson's necklace. Wilson recalled: [...] "I didn't understand whether they wanted to rape us or mug us. They removed my Star of David. I tried to convince them we weren't Jewish." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2014, former Waukegan {{police chief}} Dan Greathouse, who is {{handling}} the re-investigation of the Staker case, told Rivera's attorneys {{about the existence of}} a knife found near the crime scene. In 1994, a neighbor uprooted a bush between his house and the murder scene and found a <b>serrated</b> <b>knife.</b> Rivera's attorneys were not notified about the existence of the weapon, and it was destroyed without any testing. In the original investigation, police found a broken, straight-edged knife in a nearby yard. No physical evidence connected the weapon to the crime, but prosecutors argued that it was the murder weapon. Rivera confessed that he had broken the knife during the crime and then discarded it.|$|E
5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on blade length. Other designations followed which denoted blade finish, manual or automatic opening, or partially <b>serrated</b> blade. The <b>knife</b> retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, Godwin {{was living}} in Palm Springs, California, working as a {{self-employed}} tool salesman, a mechanic, and a construction worker, with no discernible criminal history. Godwin and his roommate, Frank Soto, Jr., planned to rob a drug dealer and pilot, Kim Robert LeValley, who was once a friend of theirs. Godwin and Soto lured LeValley back to their condominium where Soto held him, Godwin punched and kicked him, tried to strangle him, then ultimately stabbed LeValley 26 times with his butcher knife., however, during the trial, the prosecution said that Godwin used a <b>serrated</b> edge <b>knife.</b> A butcher's knife was not mentioned. After the murder, Godwin and Soto loaded the body into a truck and set off for the desert. Godwin tried {{to blow up the}} evidence by using homemade explosives strapped to the body. The explosion was intended to disguise the murder of LeValley. On August 3, 1980, some Eagle Mountain residents found a blown-up pickup truck with remains of a human body inside of it abandoned in the desert.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985 Carmela Vitale {{was issued}} a patent for a plastic 3-legged tripod stool that {{would sit in}} the middle of the box and keep the top from sagging into the pie. Vitale called her device a [...] "package saver" [...] and used that term also as the title of her patent, but it has since been renamed the [...] "pizza saver". Variations on the device have since been invented, such as a {{disposable}} plastic spatula whose handle holds the box top up; and a plastic tripod like that made by Vitalie, but with one of the legs <b>serrated</b> like a <b>knife,</b> making for easy cutting of stuck cheese and bread.|$|R
5000|$|Studded: a studded cavesson has round or sharp studs on the inside. This cavesson is {{most common}} in Iberia, {{especially}} on young horses, {{so as not to}} [...] "spoil" [...] their mouths, and in Austro-Hungaria. They have also been adopted in other disciplines as a means of controlling a difficult horse, or as a training shortcut, but they are generally illegal in most horse show competition. Blunt studs have a relatively mild effect. Sharp studs, like a <b>serrated</b> <b>knife,</b> are extremely painful and can cut the horse. When used while riding, they act with the normal action of the noseband, which applies pressure to the nose when the horse fails to submit to the bit, and increases the effect of this pressure.|$|E

50|$|Richards has {{a strange}} dream or vision {{involving}} a musical number performed by Quaid and Day. When he awakens, Quaid {{has returned to}} the camp, disoriented and manic. Roja watches over Quaid as Kimble and Richards check the camp; disturbed by Quaid's behavior, Roja calls for assistance, and Quaid bolts into the forest. Richards chases after Quaid, and, in the light, finds blood on Quaid's hands. Quaid runs off again, and Richards finds his body {{at the bottom of a}} cliff. Hauser appears and tells Richards to take a second look at the cliff, this time without his glasses; he does and throws his glasses over the edge. He is then approached by a corpse-like Day, upon whom he can not focus. Richards hallucinates extensively, and, upon returning to the camp, he discovers that Kimble has murdered Roja. Richards puts out Kimble's eyes, opens his skull, and extracts a <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> from Kimble's head. He hallucinates further and cuts out the face from his father's portrait.|$|E
40|$|The tools {{used in both}} {{consumption}} and butchering of animal foods leave signatures {{that can be used}} to distinguish material type. Experiments were conducted to establish the characteristics of cut marks on cattle bone left by a <b>serrated</b> steel <b>knife,</b> a straight-edged steel knife, an obsidian bifacial tool, a chert bifacial tool, an unmodified obsidian flake, and an unmodified chert flake. Comparative analysis of the slicing-marks showed the shape of slice marks created with the steel knives and obsidian flake were generally similar in width, depth and shape. Tool morphology played the largest role in dictating the shape of scrape marks, and tool edges defined by a pattern of bifacial flake scars or serration left clear signatures. Straight-edged tools left subtler characteristic scrape marks in the form of patches and striations, suggesting the direction of the tool stroke. Tool marks left by steel <b>knives,</b> straight-edged and <b>serrated,</b> were the most prominent, uniform, and consistent. The shape of marks left by the bifacial tools were incredibly similar, meaning differentiation between material types is difficult, and thus identification would likely only be able to be made to the level of bifacial stone tool...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experiment {{with a knife}} seized as material evidence in a homicide case. The reason for the experiment was the necessity {{to determine whether the}} injuries of the deceased could have been inflicted with this instrument since {{in the course of the}} investigation doubt arose as to the origin of linear, parallel scratches around one of the wounds and on the abdominal integuments suggesting a <b>serrated</b> blade. The <b>knife</b> found near the crime scene had a smooth blade and small serrations only on the borderline between its blade and hilt. However, the performed experiment showed that if the knife is directed towards the integuments of the body in a special way, its serrations, even though not located on the blade itself, may leave such striated marks on the body, as those found during the autopsy, suggesting their origin from a serrated blade...|$|R
40|$|For {{some species}} certain {{biological}} and ecological data, such as diet and age and growth estimates {{can only be}} obtained through lethal sampling of study animals. Traditionally, commercial fishermen have provided samples of rays caught in nets for use by biologists; however, by-catch exclusion devices now prevent medium and larger-bodied rays (> 100 cm disk width) from being collected in trawl nets. This means that other methods must be used for lethal sampling. We obtained a large suite of biological and ecological data from 170 wild-caught stingrays collected from Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia over two years. Our sampling program was designed to minimize or eradicate any pain and suffering to the animals, while ensuring the safety of researchers undertaking the sampling process. Small rays (< 100 cm disc width; WD) were caught in beach seines and euthanized immediately by destruction {{of the brain and}} severance of the spinal cord with a reinforced, <b>serrated</b> steel <b>knife.</b> Larger rays were euthanized by firing high-powered spears directly into their brains from close range while free diving. Of 170 rays sampled in this manner, 94 % (159) were killed instantly or within an estimated 10 - 30 seconds of capture. The design and application of this lethal sampling program was deemed successful in terms of reducing distress and suffering to the rays caught, as well as ensuring the safety of researchers. The work has provided critical data on the biology and life history of stingrays that could not be obtained by any other means...|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{boards are}} usually called PE ({{polyethylene}}) cutting boards, or HDPE (high-density polyethylene plastic), {{the material of}} which these boards are made. There are basically two types of HDPE boards being made. One version is made from injection-molded plastic, while the other is HDPE from an extrusion line. There are several certifications of plastic cutting boards, one being NSF, that certifies the plastic has passed requirements to {{come in contact with}} food. Unlike wood, plastic has no inherent antiseptic properties. However, unlike wood, plastic boards do allow rinsing with harsher cleaning chemicals such as bleach and other disinfectants without damage to the board or retention of the chemicals to later contaminate food. Most high-density polyethylene plastic (HDPE) boards are specifically designed not to dull the edge of a knife. If a score line is present, the knife is safe. A <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> should not be used on a plastic cutting board. The sharper the knife, the longer the cutting board will last. Semi-disposable thin flexible cutting boards also ease transferring their contents to a cooking or storage vessel.|$|E
5000|$|Serrated blade knives have a wavy, {{scalloped}} or saw-like blade. Serrations {{help when}} cutting {{things that are}} hard {{on the outside and}} soft on the inside (such as bread or tomatoes); the saw-like action breaks the surface more easily than anything except the very sharpest smooth blade. They are also particularly good on fibrous foods such as celery or cabbage. Serrated knives cut much better than plain-edge blade knives when dull, so they do not require frequent sharpening (some serrated blades are claimed never to need sharpening), and are sometimes used to make steak knives which do not need frequent sharpening. However, they are not readily sharpened properly by a user, requiring specialized equipment, and may never be resharpened during their useful life. Serrations are often used to improve the cutting ability of a less-expensive blade not capable of taking and keeping a sharp edge, usually having a thin, polished blade designed to minimise friction. A <b>serrated</b> <b>knife</b> is more practical for a user who is not prepared to sharpen it frequently; a well-maintained and sharpened smooth edge is keener.|$|E
