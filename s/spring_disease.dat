40|$|Summary 	Apple scab, {{caused by}} the fungal {{pathogen}} Venturia inaequalis, is a significant disease in regions of California characterized by <b>spring</b> precipitation. <b>Disease</b> control is typically attained with periodic application of fungicides. We conducted a field experiment near Camino, California to test the effects of several registered and experimental fungicides on control of scab in mature Red Delicious apple trees. In late spring 2009, following four applications (from green tip into post-bloom), we evaluated disease incidence and severity (lesion density). High disease incidence (> 95 %) and high lesion density (> 12 lesions/fruit) on untreated and water-treated fruits suggested significant disease pressure during the preceding months. Generally, fruits and leaves treated with kresoxim-methyl or mancozeb + flutriafol showed the lowest incidence and severity of disease. Flutriafol (used alone) was moderately effective; tea tree oil, parafinnic oil and monopotassium phosphate (fertilizer) showed little to no ability to control scab...|$|R

Although not all crops were {{surveyed}} in each year, the surveys provide a good picture of changes in disease spectra over the years. The most dramatic change in <b>spring</b> barley <b>disease</b> has been the almost complete disappearance of Blumeria graminis (mildew) and its replacement as the dominant disease by Rhynchosporium secalis (leaf blotch).

All grapevines with RG and LSLC also had AGY. The three diseases were persistently expressed in some grapevines and remission of disease was observed in others. The results of PCR detection in the same grapevines indicated that phytoplasmas were more frequently detected in AGY-affected grapevines that also expressed RG and LSLC compared with grapevines expressing AGY alone.

5000|$|Alternaria Black Spot is a {{polycyclic}} <b>disease.</b> <b>Spring</b> infections {{begin with}} either infected seed or spores that survived in crop residues or from cruciferous weeds.

These spots on the leaves can then continue to produce more inoculum in the form of conidia. This secondary inoculum can then infect nearby plants or the same plant again. The cycle will keep occurring as long as conditions are favorable. Seeds can become infected if lesions develop on the pod, or spores can mechanically infect seeds in the combine during harvest.|$|R

The specimens {{from the last}} six patients were subjected to PCR and then sequencing. All of them revealed that the microorganism identified has a high similarity to Vittaforma corneae. Repeated debridement of the epithelial lesions successfully eradicated the microsporidial infection in all nine patients. Microsporidia are tiny, obligate intracellular eukaryotic pro-tozoan parasites that can produce infective spores. The or-ganism iswidespread in the environment (36), and it is considered a waterborne pathogen (9, 16, 31). Many species of microsporidia are pathogenic to animals (7, 28), and these are also confirmed to cause opportunistic infection in humans (36). These organisms cause infection not only of human digestive tracts but also of many other organs, including eyes (25, 36). In past reports, mi-crosporidial keratitis usually was found to occur as epithelial ker-atitis in patients with AIDS (1, 11, 22 – 24, 37) and as stromal dis-ease in immunocompetent individuals (34 – 35).

Observations of these methods were used to compare their effectiveness and capacity, and their effects on the welfare of the birds. Gassing whole poultry houses had a much greater capacity than mobile equipment, and catching live birds to bring them to a mobile killing device caused extra stress and could cause pain due to injuries inflicted when catching and handling them.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that proliferations of opportunistic microbial pathogens in the rhizospheres of GBH-treated weeds or crop residues might {{increase the risk of}} disease for new crops planted subsequently in the same soil [49 – 51, 54 – 56]. Among these, Lynch and Penn [49] found that treatment of quackgrass (Elymus repens) with glyphosate (isopropylamine salt) stimulated rapid colonisation of the roots of this weed by Fusarium culmorum. Enhancement of the rhizosphere F. culmorum population was associated with increased disease damage in barley seedlings planted subsequently in the same soil. An extensive field study conducted by Smiley et al. [50] showed that the inoculum potential for Rhizoctonia solani in cereal fields was at its peak 2 – 3  days after GBH treatment, before gradually declining. Yield depletion and crop damage from Rhizoctonia root rot (caused by Rhizoctonia solani) was most severe when the interval between herbicide treatment of unwanted vegetation and direct drilling of spring barley was shortest, e.g. 2 – 3  days from herbicide treatment to <b>spring</b> planting. <b>Disease</b> damage was least when intervals between weed treatment and spring planting were longest, e.g. weed treatment in the previous autumn with crops sown in spring. Recent studies have yielded similar results; <b>disease</b> damage to <b>spring</b> seedlings of onion [55] and corn [56] was minimised when the time interval between GBH application to cover crops of winter cereals and planting of the spring crop was maximised. For example, when the time interval between GBH application and onion planting increased from 3  days to 19 and 27  days, the total area of onions affected by stunting due to infection by Rhizoctonia solani decreased by 54 – 63 % [55]. Taken together, the above findings are inconsistent with commercial recommendations that sowing may proceed as little as 4 – 72  h after herbicide treatment (see “The fate of glyphosate in the soil”).|$|R

PSA enters plant through wounds and remains dormant in cortex tissue of the branches, and spreads in the tissue to cause severe symptoms from winter to early <b>spring.</b> The <b>disease</b> can be visualized by brown discoloration of buds, dark brown angular spots surrounded by yellow haloes on leaves, cankers with white to reddish (oxydation) exudate on twigs and trunks, fruit collapse, wilting and eventually plant mortality. Current control methods have their own significance in disease control, however there is considerable lack of clear understanding of PSA pathogenicity. Virulence of plant pathogens often relies on the synchronized/coordinated expression of pathogenicity factors via quorum sensing (QS). Therefore, investigations on QS in PSA may lead to develop novel disease control strategies and reliable methods to curb the disease. It is currently unknown whether PSA produces a QS signal molecule thus the aim of this thesis is to investigate whether PSA possesses a QS system. As genome mining did not reveal the presence of any currently known QS system, this study initially by metabolomics was aimed at identifying potentially low molecular weight secondary metabolite QS molecules produced by PSA. Azelaic acid was discovered to be produced by PSA, this is the first report of azelaic acid production by bacteria. The characterization and possible role of azelaic acid in QS is presented.

40|$|The {{project has}} now {{completed}} two crop-years of experimentation. Four more crop-years {{are required for}} all crop rotations to complete a full cycle. This report covers the 2004 - 05 crop-year results. CBARC experiment (Moro) : Grain yields of winter wheat following fallow (conventional or chemical) produced significantly higher yields than yields of annual cropping systems involving winter wheat, spring wheat, spring barley, and winter pea following winter wheat. Downy brome populations increased in direct-seeded winter wheat, with the greatest increase in re-crop direct-seeded winter wheat. Rotation and herbicide applications were effective at reducing knotweed. Prickly lettuce and tumble mustard increased with tumble mustard increasing the most in <b>spring</b> crops. Root <b>diseases</b> caused by Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Pythium, and root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus thornei, and P. neglectus) varied between treatments. Center of Sustainability (Heppner) : Continuous spring barley produced the highest grain yields followed by winter wheat following fallow (conventional or chemical). The lowest yield was obtained from continuous Alpowa spring wheat that was very susceptible to root-lesion nematodes. Objectives The project {{is now in the}} implementation phase. The objective of this phase is to establish and maintain long-term experiments that compare conventional wheat/fallow system with alternate cropping systems with potential crop management practices such as direct seeding that reduce wind and water erosion. Specific objectives include determining systems that • increase residue cover, • increase soil OM, • increase available soil moisture, • reduce wind and water erosion, • reduce soil water evaporation, • sustain soil productivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of grey mould (caused by Botrytis cinerea) and brown rot (caused by Monilinia laxa) {{in the major}} stone fruit regions in the Western Cape Province was studied over a 3 -year period by samplin g reject fruit from the Unifruco Quality Evaluation Scheme and from 11 stone fruit orchards. Flowers and fruit from the orchards were treated to facilitate disease expression by surface conidia and latent mycelia (unsterile vs. surface sterilised; untreated vs. paraquat-treated). B. cinerea {{was found to be}} the most important pathogen causing blossom blight and postharvest decay on stone fruit. The pathogen was most prominent on early and mid-season cultivars. Surface conidia and latent mycelia consistently occurred on fruit in each orchard, although at fluctuating levels. The amount of B. cinerea on fruits was generally higher during <b>spring</b> than summer. <b>Disease</b> expression on fruit was not governed by the amount of B. cinerea occurring on fruit, but by the ability of fruit to resist disease expression. Blossom infection did not contribute directly to postharvest grey mould. Brown rot was exclusively caused by M. laxa and no evidence was found that M. fructicola had been introduced into the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The pathogen was most prominent on the later maturing cultivars. Immature fruit were generally pathogen-free and disease expression only occurred on maturing fruit. Long-term latency therefore does not seem to play a prominent role in M. laxa fruit rot. Articl...|$|R
5000|$|In Aztec mythology and religion, Xipe Totec ( [...] ; Xīpe Totēc) or Xipetotec ("Our Lord the Flayed One") was a life-death-rebirth deity, god of agriculture, vegetation, the east, <b>disease,</b> <b>spring,</b> goldsmiths, silversmiths, {{liberation and}} the seasons. Xipe Totec was also known by various other names, {{including}} Tlatlauhca (...) , Tlatlauhqui Tezcatlipoca (...) ("Red Smoking Mirror") and Youalahuan (...) ("the Night Drinker"). The Tlaxcaltecs and the Huexotzincas worshipped {{a version of}} the deity under the name of Camaxtli, and the god has been identified with Yopi, a Zapotec god represented on Classic Period urns. The female equivalent of Xipe Totec was the goddess Xilonen-Chicomecoatl. According to Bernardino de Sahagún, Xipe Totec has a strong relation to diseases such as smallpox, blisters and eye sickness and if someone suffered from this diseases offerings were made to him. Xipe Totec connected agricultural renewal with warfare. [...] He flayed himself to give food to humanity, symbolic of the way maize seeds lose their outer layer before germination and of snakes shedding their skin. Without his skin, he was depicted as a golden god. Xipe Totec was believed by the Aztecs to be the god that invented war. [...] His insignia included the pointed cap and rattle staff, which was the war attire for the Mexica emperor. He had a temple called Yopico within the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. Xipe Totec is associated with pimples, inflammation and eye diseases, and possibly plague.|$|R
