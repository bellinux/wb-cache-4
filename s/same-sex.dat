5|$|A {{government}} {{motion to}} reopen the <b>same-sex</b> marriage debate failed. The 38th Canadian Parliament, led by the Liberals, had legalized <b>same-sex</b> marriage a year earlier. Several provinces had legalized <b>same-sex</b> marriage before that. During his campaign, Harper promised a parliamentary vote on reopening the issue. The motion failed 175–123 leaving the <b>same-sex</b> marriage legal in Canada and the legal debate about it closed.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{found that}} there were 4,822 <b>same-sex</b> couples in the District of Columbia in 2010; about 2% of total households. Legislation authorizing <b>same-sex</b> {{marriage}} passed in 2009 and the District began issuing marriage licenses to <b>same-sex</b> couples in March 2010.|$|E
5|$|A May 2013 Ipsos {{poll found}} that 76% of {{respondents}} were in favour of <b>same-sex</b> marriage and another 13% supported other forms of recognition for <b>same-sex</b> couples.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} {{ahead of the}} anniversary of the Marriage Equality {{referendum}} on 22 May 2016, the Department of Social Protection released statistics on the number of <b>same-sex</b> marriages that had taken place since November 2015. A total of 412 <b>same-sex</b> marriages were performed in those six months.|$|E
5|$|A {{poll by the}} government-run Centre for Sociological Investigations (Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas), {{published}} in April 2005, reported that 66% of Spaniards favoured legalising <b>same-sex</b> marriage. Another poll taken by Instituto Opina a day before the bill passed placed support of the <b>same-sex</b> marriage bill at 62.1% and support of adoption by <b>same-sex</b> couples at 49.1%. An Instituto Opina poll taken nine months after the bill passed said 61% agreed with the Government's decision.|$|E
5|$|A public {{survey in}} October 2008 {{revealed}} 62% of adults would vote Yes in a referendum to extend civil marriage to <b>same-sex</b> couples. A {{breakdown of the}} results shows that support is strongest among younger people and in urban areas. Women were more supportive at 68% compared to 56% of men. There was slightly less support for <b>same-sex</b> couples being given the right to adopt. A total of 58% of those under 50 believe <b>same-sex</b> couples {{should be able to}} adopt, falling to 33% among the over-50s. A total of 54% believe the definition of the family unit in the Irish Constitution should be changed to include <b>same-sex</b> families.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,500 <b>same-sex</b> couples {{married in}} Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, {{questions}} arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit <b>same-sex</b> marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's <b>same-sex</b> marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Arizona Proposition 107 – On November 7, 2006, Arizona {{rejected}} {{a constitutional amendment}} banning <b>same-sex</b> marriage and civil unions by 52% of the vote. Two years later Arizona voters approved a more narrow amendment banning only <b>same-sex</b> marriage.|$|E
5|$|As a {{candidate}} for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said that he favored legalizing <b>same-sex</b> marriage. By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for <b>same-sex</b> partners, but he opposed <b>same-sex</b> marriages for strategic reasons. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of <b>same-sex</b> marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.|$|E
5|$|As of 16 November 2015, <b>same-sex</b> {{couples who}} married abroad have their marriages {{recognised}} in Ireland. The first marriage ceremonies of <b>same-sex</b> couples occurred the following day, on 17 November 2015.|$|E
5|$|As the Governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing {{limits on}} abortion. Huntsman {{actively}} supported {{legislation that would}} have allowed civil unions for <b>same-sex</b> couples in Utah, but not <b>same-sex</b> marriage.|$|E
5|$|Before {{passage of}} the Civil Marriage Protection Act, the state {{recognized}} <b>same-sex</b> marriages performed in other jurisdictions following the 2010 release of a legal opinion from Attorney General Doug Gansler in his nine-month analysis of comity laws. In 2012, the Maryland Court of Appeals maintained Gansler's analysis and issued a unanimous decision in Port v. Cowan finding that a <b>same-sex</b> marriage performed out-of-state must be considered equal and valid under state law, despite its earlier decision in Conaway v. Deane (2007) in which the court upheld the statutory ban on <b>same-sex</b> marriage as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize <b>same-sex</b> marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After a Maryland House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against <b>same-sex</b> marriage to voters and invalidated <b>same-sex</b> marriages performed in another state or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine <b>same-sex</b> couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning specialist at Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. The plaintiffs had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the state's statutory ban on <b>same-sex</b> marriage violated constitutional protections of due process, equality, and prohibitions against sex discrimination in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E
5|$|During the {{national}} convention in May 2013, the party {{voted in favor}} of both <b>same-sex</b> marriage and <b>same-sex</b> adoption. The party has for several years been a proponent for legalizing blood donation for homosexuals.|$|E
5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of <b>same-sex</b> couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} within the past ten years. A push for <b>same-sex</b> marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer <b>same-sex</b> marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court {{found that}} a Texas law against <b>same-sex</b> sexual {{intercourse}} violated the right to privacy. In Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marriage included <b>same-sex</b> couples being able to marry.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had <b>same-sex</b> experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of <b>same-sex</b> couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in <b>same-sex</b> relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September 2012, the House of Representatives {{voted against}} passing its <b>same-sex</b> {{marriage}} bill {{by a margin}} of 98-42 votes. On 21 September 2012, the Senate also voted down its <b>same-sex</b> marriage legislation, by a vote of 41-26.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2015, the Spanish National Statistics Institute {{revealed}} that 31,640 <b>same-sex</b> couples had married {{since the start}} of July 2005 (when <b>same-sex</b> marriage became legal in Spain) to the end of December 2014. This accounted for 1.72% of all marriages in Spain in that time. In 2015, most <b>same-sex</b> marriages were celebrated in Catalonia (799), Madrid (726), Andalusia (575), Valencia (471) and the Canary Islands (265).|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 2013, it was {{announced}} that a referendum to legalise <b>same-sex</b> marriage would be held {{in the first half of}} 2015. On 1 July 2014, Taoiseach Enda Kenny announced that the <b>same-sex</b> marriage referendum would take place in Spring 2015. The referendum was held on 22 May 2015.|$|E
5|$|On LGBT rights, she {{supported}} {{the right to}} <b>same-sex</b> marriage. Clinton first expressed support for a national right to <b>same-sex</b> marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit <b>same-sex</b> marriages. In 2000, {{she was the first}} First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade. In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts {{became the}} first state in the U.S. to legalize <b>same-sex</b> {{marriage}} after a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in November 2003 determined that the exclusion of <b>same-sex</b> couples from {{the right to a}} civil marriage was unconstitutional. This decision was eventually superseded by the U.S. Supreme Court's affirmation of <b>same-sex</b> marriage in the United States in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Pitt is a {{supporter}} of <b>same-sex</b> marriage. In an October 2006 interview with Esquire, Pitt {{said that he would}} marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry. In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California's 2008 ballot proposition Proposition 8, an initiative to overturn the state Supreme Court decision that had legalized <b>same-sex</b> marriage. In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8'— a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on <b>same-sex</b> marriage— as Judge Vaughn Walker.|$|E
5|$|Romney opposed <b>same-sex</b> {{marriage}} and civil unions, although he favored domestic partnership legislation that gives certain legal rights to <b>same-sex</b> couples, such as hospital visitation. In 2011, {{he signed a}} pledge promising to seek passage of {{an amendment to the}} U.S. Constitution to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman.|$|E
5|$|Ryan opposes <b>same-sex</b> marriage, had {{previously}} supported a constitutional ban on <b>same-sex</b> marriage, opposed {{the repeal of}} the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against <b>same-sex</b> couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against a bill that would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Same-sex</b> {{marriage}} has been legal in Spain since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) Government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, began {{a campaign for}} its legalization, including the right of adoption by <b>same-sex</b> couples. After much debate, a law permitting <b>same-sex</b> marriage {{was passed by the}} Cortes Generales (Spain's bicameral Parliament, composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005. The law took effect the next day, making Spain the third country in the world to allow <b>same-sex</b> couples to marry across the entire country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} law was passed, {{questions}} arose about {{the legal status of}} marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license on the grounds that India did not permit <b>same-sex</b> marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first <b>same-sex</b> marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing <b>same-sex</b> marriage.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to <b>same-sex</b> couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of <b>same-sex</b> couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by <b>same-sex</b> couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by <b>same-sex</b> couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the <b>same-sex</b> marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), <b>same-sex</b> couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E
5|$|State Senator Richard Madaleno {{requested}} in 2009 {{that the}} Attorney General {{answer the question}} of whether <b>same-sex</b> marriages could be recognized by the state. In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid <b>same-sex</b> marriages performed in other states that permit <b>same-sex</b> marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state <b>same-sex</b> marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to be quickly challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} Government {{which took}} office in March 2011 convened a Constitutional Convention to discuss proposed amendments to the Constitution of Ireland, including plans to introduce <b>same-sex</b> marriage. On 10 July 2012, the Dáil, referred {{the issue of whether}} to make provision for <b>same-sex</b> marriage to the Constitutional Convention, to report back in a year. On 14 April 2013, the convention approved provisions allowing for <b>same-sex</b> marriage, to be discussed by the Oireachtas and be put to a public referendum. On 2 July 2013, the Constitutional Convention delivered the formal report to the Oireachtas, which had four months to respond.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>same-sex</b> wedding {{took place}} eight {{days after the}} bill became law, and was celebrated in the council chamber in the Madrid suburb of Tres Cantos by Carlos Baturín and Emilio Menéndez. The first <b>same-sex</b> {{marriage}} between women took place in Barcelona eleven days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{triennial}} Labor {{conference held}} in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on <b>same-sex</b> marriage {{to see the}} party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. Despite Gillard, who had previously stated her personal objection to <b>same-sex</b> marriage, the motion passed narrowly by 208 votes to 184. In February 2012, two bills to allow <b>same-sex</b> marriage in Australia were introduced in the 43rd Parliament.|$|E
5|$|This list only covers bans {{of civil}} unions, private {{contracts}} between <b>same-sex</b> couples and <b>same-sex</b> marriage in state constitutions; state statutes are not listed.

5|$|Though most <b>same-sex</b> couples {{seeking to}} marry are {{required}} to give three months notice (as {{is the case for}} opposite-sex couples), <b>same-sex</b> couples already in a civil partnership are allowed to make use of a 5-day fast track provision in the legislation.|$|E
