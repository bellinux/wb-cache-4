50|$|The <b>slot</b> <b>antenna</b> {{was invented}} in 1938 by Alan Blumlein, while working for EMI.

50|$|The short {{wavelengths}} also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small. High gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and UHF television reception are usually Yagi, log periodic, corner reflectors, or reflective array antennas. At {{the top end}} of the band slot antennas and parabolic dishes become practical. For satellite communication, helical, and turnstile antennas are used since satellites typically employ circular polarization which is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas. For television broadcasting specialized vertical radiators that are mostly modifications of the <b>slot</b> <b>antenna</b> or helical antenna are used: the slotted cylinder, zig-zag, and panel antennas.|$|E

50|$|A <b>slot</b> <b>antenna</b> {{consists}} of a metal surface, usually a flat plate, {{with one or more}} holes or slots cut out. When the plate is driven as an antenna by a driving frequency, the slot radiates electromagnetic waves in a way similar to a dipole antenna. The shape and size of the slot, as well as the driving frequency, determine the radiation pattern. Often the radio waves are provided by a waveguide, and the antenna {{consists of}} slots in the waveguide. Slot antennas are often used at UHF and microwave frequencies instead of line antennas when greater control of the radiation pattern is required. Slot antennas are widely used in radar antennas, for the sector antennas used for cell phone base stations, and are often found in standard desktop microwave sources used for research purposes. A slot antenna's main advantages are its size, design simplicity, and convenient adaptation to mass production using either waveguide or PC board technology.|$|E

He developed methods of regulating the phase velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves along the antenna wire, which have found wide application in the later traveling wave tubes of UHF and microwave bands, as well as a surface wave antennas. He published the monograph [...] "The transmitting antennas", which for a long time served as a guide for the design of these antennas and was used as the textbook. He created a general theory of frequency stabilization, developed a theory of calculation of passive vibrators. He conducted the study of the phenomenon of flare expiration of the antenna wire, the results of it were used in the design of antennas and super-powerful Soviet shortwave radios. He created the general theory of receive antennas based on an electrodynamic principle of reciprocity, and it became conventional in radio engineering. He carried out a number of theoretical and experimental studies of band antennae (in-phase and rhombic), developed the theory of rhombic antennas, invented two advanced systems of rhombic antennas. Also developed the theory of inhomogeneous lines with impedance that varies exponentially. Proposed and developed a general theory and methods of calculation of closed oscillating electromagnetic devices, later known as the [...] "volume resonators", which are the basis of many systems of UHF and microwave bands.

This paper examines techniques such as parasitic coupling and inductive loading to achieve higher BW and further size reduction for this class of miniaturized <b>slot</b> <b>antennas.</b> The overall BW of a proposed double resonant antenna is shown to be {{increased by more than}} 94 % compared with a single resonant antenna occupying the same area. The behavior of miniaturized <b>slot</b> <b>antennas,</b> loaded with series inductive elements along the radiating section is also examined. The inductive loads are constructed by two balanced short circuited slot lines placed {{on opposite sides of the}} radiating slot. These inductive loads can considerably reduce the antenna size at its resonance.
