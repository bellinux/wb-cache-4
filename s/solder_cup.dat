Microorganism staying {{in form of}} suspended referred also solidsuspended liquor mixed (SSLM), work by fastening organic substrate later thenelaborating it with enzyme of exocelluler so that become its dissolve.

Mudsuspended conducted by 1 g {{follow the example of}} Mud or sediment thinned withphysiological condensation (8, 5 NaCl g / L) and dissolve up to 10 - 4,or can be conductedby taking 0, 5 g of sediment into tube reaction of containing 4, 5 physiological saltcondensation then shake to get homogeneous suspended. suspended and disseminated bycontaining <b>solder</b> <b>cup</b> on specific media, and then incubation at temperature 270 C during 24 - 48 hour. Obtained by isolate of RPH 1,RPH 2, PP, SBDG and STT. During process ofseeding measured parameters, there are VSS and COD that measured base on timeduring treatment.
