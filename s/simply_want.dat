25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{said the}} film carried a more {{philosophical}} {{portrait of the}} science fiction genre than did other films, but still managed [...] "to satisfy the cravings {{of the general public}} who <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> to be entertained". Internet reviewer James Berardinelli said Contact is [...] "one of 1997's finest motion pictures, and is a forceful reminder that Hollywood is still capable of making magic." [...] Berardinelli felt the film was on par with Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968) {{to be one of the}} greatest science fiction films ever made. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle largely enjoyed the first 90 minutes of Contact but felt that director Robert Zemeckis was too obsessed with visual effects rather than cohesive storytelling for the pivotal climax.|$|E
500|$|As {{a running}} gag {{throughout}} the half-hour show, Harrison interrupts the sketches, trying to land an acting {{role as a}} pirate (and dressed accordingly), but gets turned down each time by RWT regulars Idle and Neil Innes, who <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> him to play the part of [...] "George Harrison". He then reappears at the end in more normal attire, strumming the well-known introduction to [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] on an acoustic guitar, and backed by the house band; instead of continuing with the song, Harrison finally takes his chance to play [...] "Pirate Bob" [...] by abruptly segueing into a sea shanty – to {{the horror of the}} [...] "greasy" [...] compère, played by Idle. The other musicians follow Harrison's lead, after which a group of dancers appear on stage and the show's closing credits roll.|$|E

500|$|The alpha male stops its {{attack on}} the glass door, making a butterfly-shaped smear on it. Neville realizes the alpha male is {{identifying}} the female upon which he was experimenting by a butterfly tattoo, and the Darkseekers <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> her back. Amazed {{that they have the}} intelligence to try and communicate to him, as he had previously believed the infected had lost all humanity, Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. After Neville wakes the female up, she cries upon seeing the alpha male and they rub heads. Neville softly apologizes, having realised that while the Darkseekers are no longer human, they still retain some of their humanity and emotions. The alpha male keeps the other Darkseekers back and orders them to leave. Shocked by the ordeal, Neville sits down for a moment in his laboratory, realizing that he was the monster in the Darkseekers' eyes. Looking over the pictures of his numerous test subjects, the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him, causing him to feel remorse and relief at the same time. The following day, Neville, Anna, and Ethan drive away from the city under a new broadcast, recorded by Anna, with a message to any human survivors that they [...] "are not alone".|$|E

2500|$|On November 18, 2005, McKinney {{was one of}} {{only three}} House members to vote for H.R. 571, {{introduced}} by House Armed Services Committee chairman Duncan Hunter, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, on which McKinney sat. Hunter, a Republican, offered this resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in place of John Murtha's H.J.Res. 73, which called for redeployment [...] "at the earliest possible date." [...] In her prepared statement, McKinney accused the Republicans of [...] "trying to set a trap for the Democrats. A 'no' vote for this Resolution will obscure {{the fact that there is}} strong support for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq ... In voting for this bill, let me be perfectly clear that I am not saying the United States should exit Iraq without a plan. I agree with Mr. Murtha that security and stability in Iraq should be pursued through diplomacy. I <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> to vote 'yes' to an orderly withdrawal from Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|The third book, The Stone Dogs, {{tells the}} story of the Protracted Struggle—the [...] Cold War between the Domination of the Draka and the Alliance for Democracy. There is a far more intense space race in this world, with nuclear pulse-drive interplanetary spaceships and colonies and {{military}} bases established on the Moon, on Mars and in the asteroid belt. Over a period of several decades, the Alliance secretly constructs an antimatter-driven starship for transporting 100,000 people to Alpha Centauri in the event of a Draka victory. The Draka employ the policy of [...] "No peace beyond Luna," [...] leading to frequent skirmishes in the inner solar system. It is not unknown, although extremely rare, for people from the Domination to defect to the Alliance. Citizens primarily seek asylum due to personal convictions, while serfs <b>simply</b> <b>want</b> to escape their bondage. [...] Any citizen or serf caught attempting to defect would be summarily executed, though the serf would no doubt meet a more hideous death - probably by impalement or breaking on the wheel. These defectors prove valuable to the OSS because of the unique opportunity it offers regarding gathering vital information on Drakan society, the Drakan dialect, which is notoriously difficult to acquire and master, and the Drakan fighting style which is unmatched anywhere in the Alliance.|$|E
