40|$|Introduction: Given {{the rise}} in the {{prevalence}} of <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> in many countries and the lack of published data pertaining to the prevalence and awareness of <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> in Mauritius, this survey is {{the first of its kind}} to provide data on this issue. The aim of this study is to describe the association of <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> with various predisposing factors such as socioeconomic status, personal hygiene and level of awareness and to assess the impact of <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> on quality of life. Material and Methods: A stratified sample of 500 adults was randomly selected for this study. Subjects were administered a questionnaire to elicit information on sociodemographic factors, awareness, family history and prevalence of <b>skin</b> <b>infections.</b> Quality of life was investigated by a validated questionnaire (DLQI). SPSS Software and Microsoft Excel were used to analyse data. Results: Among 500 participants, 166 (33 %) cases of <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> were obtained. Acne was found to be more prevalent (n= 59). It was found that <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> varies with gender and higher prevalence was observed during summer as compared to winter (p= 0. 017). It was noted that family history and income level were associated with an increase incidence of <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> (p= 0. 000). With respect to quality of life, psychological distress was mostly affected. Conclusion: Acne was found to be more prevalent. Respondents with middle income status were mostly affected with <b>skin</b> <b>infection.</b> Those with a family history were more prone to <b>skin</b> <b>infection.</b> The Quality of Life index was found to be an efficient method in assessing the impact of <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> on the respondents’ lives...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> are an {{increasingly}} common problem. However, {{there are no}} data on the efficacy of decolonization regimens. We prospectively evaluated 31 patients with recurrent CA-MRSA <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> who received nasal mupirocin, topical hexachlorophene body wash, and an oral anti-MRSA antibiotic. The mean number of MRSA infections after the intervention decreased significantly from baseline (0. 03 vs. 0. 84 infections/month, P=< 0. 0001). This regimen appears promising at preventing recurrent CA-MRSA infections. 4 Community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> are {{an increasingly}} common reason to seek medical care in clinics, urgent care centers, and emergency departments and appear to have driven up rates of visits to practitioners for <b>skin</b> <b>infections.</b> (5, 10) Patients with CA-MRSA <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> often report recurrent episodes wit...|$|R

40|$|Persistent {{superficial}} <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> {{caused by}} multiple fungi is rarely reported. Recently, {{a number of}} fungi, both opportunistic and persistent in nature were isolated from the foot skin of a 24 -year old male in Malaysia. The fungi were identified as Candida parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Phoma spp., Debaryomyces hansenii, Acremonium spp., Aureobasidium pullulans and Aspergillus spp., This is the first report on these opportunistic strains were co-isolated from a healthy individual who suffered from persistent foot <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> which was diagnosed as athlete’s foot for more than 12 years. Among the isolated fungi, C. parapsilosis has been an increasingly common cause of <b>skin</b> <b>infections.</b> R. mucilaginosa and D. hansenii were rarely reported in cases of <b>skin</b> <b>infection.</b> A. pullulans, an emerging fungal pathogen was also being isolated in this case. Interestingly, {{it was noted that}} C. parapsilosis, R. mucilaginosa, D. hansenii and A. pullulans are among the common halophiles and this suggests the association of halotolerant fungi in causing persistent superficial <b>skin</b> <b>infection.</b> This discovery will shed light on future research to explore on effective treatment for inhibition of pathogenic halophiles as well as to understand the interaction of multiple fungi in the progress of <b>skin</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{carriers}} with S. aureus bacteremia {{may have}} a reduced mortality risk compared to non-carriers. A role for the immune system is suggested. Here, we study in mice the effect of mild S. aureus <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> prior to endogenous or exogenous S. aureus bacteremia, and evaluate protection in relation to anti-staphylococcal antibody levels. <b>Skin</b> <b>infections</b> once or twice by a clinical S. aureus isolate (isolate P) or S. aureus strain 8325 - 4 were induced in mice free of S. aureus and anti-staphylococcal antibodies. Five weeks later, immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in blood against 25 S. aureus antigens were determined, and LD 50 or LD 100 bacteremia caused by S. aureus isolate P was induced. S. aureus <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> led to elevated levels of anti-staphylococcal IgG in blood. One <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> improved the course of subsequent severe endogenous bacteremia only. A second <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> further improved animal survival rate, which was associated with increased pre-bacteremia IgG levels against Efb, IsaA, LukD, LukE, Nuc, PrsA and WTA. In conclusion, S. aureus isolate P <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> in mice reduces the severity of subsequent endogenous S. aureus bacteremia only. Although cellular immune effects cannot be rules out, anti-staphylococcal IgG against specified antigens may contribute to this effect...|$|R

Recommendations: •	Soldiers should be examined routinely for superficial <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> •	Environmental interventions should be planned (e. g. routine disinfection of communal showers) and maintained as a standard in every camp. •	Maintenance {{of personal}} hygiene should be implemented in all soldiers within a military unit •	Further studies using a larger number of samples are warranted to determine the extent and nature of superficial <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> in military recruits more accurately...|$|R

These infections can also be spread through indirect contact, for example, from the skin flora of an infected individual to a wrestling mat, to another wrestler.

40|$|Complications of scabies and {{impetigo}} such as glomerulonephritis and invasive {{bacterial infection}} in Australian Aboriginal children remain significant {{problems and the}} overall global burden of disease attributable to these <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> remains high despite the availability of effective treatment. We hypothesised that one factor contributing to this high burden is that <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> is under-recognised and hence under-treated, in settings where prevalence is high. We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study to assess the burden of scabies, impetigo, tinea and pediculosis in children admitted to two regional Australian hospitals from October 2015 to January 2016. A retrospective chart review of patients admitted in November 2014 (mid-point of the prospective data collection in the preceding year) was performed. Prevalence of documented <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> was compared in the prospective and retrospective population to assess clinician recognition and treatment of <b>skin</b> <b>infections.</b> 158 patients with median age 3. 6 years, 74 % Aboriginal, were prospectively recruited. 77 patient records were retrospectively reviewed. Scabies (8. 2 % vs 0. 0 %, OR N/A, p = 0. 006) and impetigo (49. 4 % vs 19. 5 %, OR 4. 0 (95 % confidence interval [CI 2. 1 - 7. 7) were more prevalent in the prospective analysis. Skin examination was only documented in 45. 5 % of cases in the retrospective review.

Scabies and impetigo infections are under-recognised and hence under-treated by clinicians. Improving the recognition and treatment of <b>skin</b> <b>infections</b> by clinicians is a priority to reduce the high burden of <b>skin</b> <b>infection</b> and subsequent sequelae in paediatric populations where scabies and impetigo are endemic...|$|R
