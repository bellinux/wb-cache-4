5000|$|Regarding Mahesh's {{character}} in the film, Krishna Vamsi said [...] "During that time, I met Mahesh Babu a couple of times. He has such a 'mugdha manohara mohana roopam'. I was impressed {{to such an extent}} that I wanted to add 'Krishna tatvam' to that film, as 'mugdha manohara mohana roopam' is the first quality of Lord Krishna. Just like the way Krishna had herd of cows, hero in this film had an animal (elephant). I wanted to create the atmosphere of Brindavanam. That's the reason why Mahesh is shown to be moving along with and surrounded by girls/women and kids". Sonali Bendre's characterization in the first half was based on Satyabhama and her characterization in the second half was based on Rukmini. Because of that, Krishna Vamsi incorporated a scene similar to Rukmini Kalyanam (Lord Krishna takes Rukhmini away from her place and marries her without the knowledge of her people) in the second half where Murari's character saves Vasundhara from her evil brother and takes away her from her village to marry her. Lakshmi character was based on Yasoda while Prasad Babu and Kaikala Satyanarayana's roles were partially inspired from Balarama's character. According to Krishna Vamsi, the other Yadavas in the film were the brothers and family members of hero while Ravi Babu's character was a mix of characterizations of Sisupala, Karna and Duryodhana. Two <b>separated</b> <b>joint</b> families like that of Pandavas and Kauravas were created though they are on good terms unlike the way portrayed in Lord Krishna's story. Prakash Raj played a cameo as the evil zamindar who was the first victim of the curse while Deekshitulu played the role of the temple's priest named Seshayya.|$|E
30|$|The {{drilling}} {{was done}} by Drilling, Observation, and Sampling of Earth’s Continental Crust (DOSECC), a non-profit organization that works {{in concert with the}} International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) on scientific drilling projects such as this one. DOSECC drilled the corehole with an Atlas-Copco CS 4002 drilling rig. Drilling commenced on 27 September 2010 and continued through 27 January 2011, when a total depth (TD) of 1912.5  m had been reached (Delahunty et al. 2012). A steel liner was inserted into the well and left to equilibrate for 4  months prior to temperature logging. A <b>separated</b> <b>joint</b> in the liner prevented logging below a depth of 1440  m.|$|E
30|$|Temperature logs {{were run}} by the Southern Methodist University (SMU) Geothermal Research Laboratory and the Operational Support Group (OSG) from Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), German Research Centre for Geosciences. SMU and OSG used {{wireline}} logging tools to record the temperature profile in the well. The SMU tool recorded temperatures while running the tool into the well, and the data had to be downloaded to a computer after the tool had been retrieved from the well. The OSG tool gave live readings and recorded the temperature while pulling the tool out of the hole. The SMU log was acquired on 4 May 2011, while the OSG log was acquired sometime between 29 June and 4 July 2011. Unfortunately, as stated previously, the SMU tool was only able to log {{to a depth of}} 1440  m due to a <b>separated</b> <b>joint</b> in the steel liner, while the OSG tool was only able to log to a depth of 1220  m due to subsequent blockage by some unknown cause.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The {{hands are}} often {{involved}} in the osteoarthritic disease process. A radiological grading scale is presented, derived from a published atlas, to assess the prevalence of hand osteoarthritis (OA) involvement in clinical and epidemiological studies and its reproducibility is studied.  METHODS—This hand scale {{is based on the}} radiological feature "joint space narrowing", which represents the macromorphological process of cartilage loss. Osteophytes and sclerosis are less important unless seen in conjuction with joint space narrowing. Nine individual joints per hand (four proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP), four distal interphalangeal joints (DIP), first carpometacarpal joint (CMC- 1)) are scored dichotomously for the presence of OA. To save time and to increase reliability a severity grading of radiological features is not performed. To determine inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the individual joints and the presence of OA in two <b>separate</b> <b>joint</b> groups (⩾  2  PIP or DIP and at least one CMC- 1, used to define "generalised OA" in the ongoing Ulm Osteoarthritis Study) 50  pairs of anteroposterior hand radiographs were read by two investigators twice within one month. The κ coefficient was calculated to quantify the strength of associations.  RESULTS—On average five minutes were needed to score one hand radiograph. Both raters were able to reproduce their own readings in all individual joints and for the presence of OA in two <b>separate</b> <b>joint</b> groups after one month. Reliability was highest for the PIP joints (κ: 0. 56 - 1. 00) it was slightly lower for the DIP joints (0. 38 - 0. 87), for the CMC- 1 joints (0. 58 - 0. 69) and for OA in two <b>separate</b> <b>joint</b> groups (0. 54). The values for inter-rater agreement were good as well, κ coefficients ranged from 0. 52  to 0. 92.  CONCLUSION—This grading scale was shown to be reliable within and between readers for all the individual joints {{as well as for the}} presence of OA in two <b>separate</b> <b>joint</b> groups. Scoring a limited number of joints dichotomously makes this scale efficient and therefore useful for clinical and epidemiological trials, when dealing with large patient samples. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the concept of {{separability}} in multiple nonstationary time series displaying both common stochastic trends and common stochastic cycles. When modeling the dynamics of multiple time series for a panel of several entities such as countries, sectors, firms, imposing some form of separability and commonalities is often required to restrict the dimension of the parameter space. For this purpose we introduce the concept of common feature separation and investigate the relationships between separation in cointegration and separation in serial correlation common features. Loosely speaking we investigate whether a set of time series can be partitioned into subsets such that there are serial correlation common features in the sub-groups and that there do not exist linear combinations of the common cycles which are white noise. The paper investigates three issues. First, it provides conditions for <b>separating</b> <b>joint</b> cointegrating vectors into marginal cointegrating vectors as well as <b>separating</b> <b>joint</b> short-term dynamics into marginal short-term dynamics. Second, conditions for making permanent-transitory decompositions based on marginal systems are given. Third, issues of weak exogeneity are considered. Likelihood ratio type tests for the different hypotheses under study are proposed. An empirical analysis of the link between economic fluctuations in the U. S. and Canada shows the practical relevance of the approach proposed in this paper. separation, cointegration, common features, weak exogeneity, P-T decomposition, consumption function...|$|R
