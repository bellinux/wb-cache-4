2500|$|The {{economic}} {{crisis of the}} early 14th century hit monasteries hard and Shrewsbury was no exception. One response was to evade the risks of demesne farming in favour of the secure income stream from leases: the Shropshire demesnes {{seem to have been}} contracted from [...] 21 carucates in 1291 to 12 in 1355. There were other consolidations. Abbot Adam of Cleobury in 1344 traded the abbey's right to cut timber in the king's woods across the county, which was often hard to exploit because of poor communications, for 240 acres of nearby Lythwood, although the exchange cost £100 at the time and an annual rent of £3. The Black Death brought a much worse crisis. Repeated outbreaks of the plague reduced the labour force so that in 1354 Bishop Northburgh blamed the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> for the disrepair of many buildings, although he warned the abbey to look after its investment in Lythwood. The next abbot, Henry of Alston, died after a short period of office and soon there were not even enough priests. In 1365 Abbot Nicholas Stevens and the prior of Coventry were each granted a faculty by the Pope to ordain ten to make up the numbers. Stevens {{seems to have been a}} fairly effective leader in consolidating the abbey's position.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- In today’s world {{consisting}} of huge population {{due to this}} {{there is a need}} for large scale of production of agricultural products. Agriculture is the backbone of India. In India there is <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>labours</b> in agriculture. Day by day labour wages are increasing and in the same way demand of agriculture products are also increasing and today’s world need large scale of production of agriculture products due to huge population. In today’s world there is a heavy demand for sugar and it’s byproducts. The major states growing sugarcane are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. Now India is the leading producer of sugarcane in the world. This project aims to design and fabricate small scale sugarcane harvesting machine for sugarcane harvesting to reduce farmer’s effort and to increase the output of agricultural products. When compared to manual harvesting, this machine can cut the lower and upper portion of the suger cane containing leaves, simultaneously by setting the optimum movement of the rotary blades. The advanced technology machines are very costlier and cannot be purchased by a middle class farmers. The maintenance cost of these machines are very high and requires skilled labours to operate. Hence this project work overcomes these problems and aims to develop a small scale sugar cane harvesting machine. And this machine is easy to operate, low cost with more efficiency and having less maintenance. The machine is helpful for farmers and it is economical...|$|R

The study employs RIMPhil (Resistance and Integrated Management in the Philippines), a bioeconomic simulation model developed to provide a comprehensive assessment of integrated weed management programmes for the control of annual barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) in rice crops. Results indicate that herbicide application will become increasingly economically attractive, relative to manual weeding, as labour cost increases. This is important since urban migration in the Philippines continues to increase the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> rural <b>labour.</b> Results also show that the onset of herbicide resistance results in substantial losses in farm profit. It may be worthwhile for farmers to take management actions to prevent or delay the onset of herbicide resistance, provided that these changes are effective and not too costly.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four independent papers. Paper I examines the effect of environmental policy on economic growth in a small open economy in a neoclassical framework with pollution as an input. We show {{that the effect of}} environmental policy on growth is stronger in the open economy case relative to the closed economy model if the country has strong aversion to pollution and thus serves as a net exporter of capital in the international capital market. On the other hand, if the agents in the economy have low aversion to pollution and thus import capital, the effect of environmental care on growth is stronger in the closed economy relative to the open economy. Paper II analyses the effect of asymmetry in factor endowments between resource-rich and resource-poor countries on equilibrium bias of technology development and adoption possibilities. First, we show that the bias in equilibrium technology in the resource-poor North is determined by its relative abundance of human capital and physical capital. Secondly, we show that the equilibrium bias in technology in the resource abundant South is dependent positively (negatively) on the relative abundance (<b>scarcity)</b> <b>of</b> skilled (unskilled) <b>labour</b> and the relative abundance (<b>scarcity)</b> <b>of</b> physical (natural) capital in the North. This force is dampened by the relative <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> skilled <b>labour</b> and physical capital in the South. These forces drive wage inequality, high cost of capital and skill technology mismatch in the South, all of which are bad for growth. These effects cumulatively, explains part of the observed differences in growth performance between resource -rich and resource-poor countries. Paper III investigated the relationship between long run economic growth in Ghana and natural resource abundance using time series econometric techniques. Using a number of indicators that could proxy for resource abundance in eight alternative specifications, the results rejected the resource curse hypothesis. Paper IV provides an empirical analysis of the factors accounting for inflation dynamics in Ghana using the bounds test and other econometric approaches. We find that real output, nominal exchange rate, broad money supply, nominal interest rate and fiscal deficit play a dominant role in the inflationary process in Ghana...|$|R

Cuts in unemployment spell duration {{have been the}} main factors to contribute in decreasing the unemployment in the recent years.

Evidence on effectiveness of LMP states that employment services are of high quality and have positive effectiveness, the main LMP programmes have usually positive, but relatively small effectiveness {{with the exception of}} public sector employment programmes which have poor effectiveness. The employment obligations of the late 1980 s and too high a volume of LMP programmes in the recession of the 1990 s are examples of bad lessons. On the other hand, a more coherent LMP strategy with emphasis on the dynamics and prevention-oriented policy is a good lesson as is also the strategy to prepare for the ageing and <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>labour</b> force. LMP is not originally developed for economic downturn, but it can help to create a more employment-friendly economic policy by taking care of the functioning <b>of</b> the <b>labour</b> market and the availability <b>of</b> the <b>labour</b> when demand for it recovers. In downturn, the volume of LMP can be increased to create more dynamics to unemployment, but the selectivity should not be destroyed. Labour Market Policy, economic downturn...|$|R

Regression analysis has revealed that the extent of mechanization, literacy and income of non-agricultural workers are significant and negative determinants <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> availability, while improvement in landholding size and land productivity would significantly improve their supply to the farming sector. At the farm level, labour scarcity has been estimated at 27 per cent in fodder to 70 per cent <b>of</b> total <b>labour</b> requirement in apricot. Labour shortage, especially during critical farm activities, has negative implications on farm profitability and productivity levels. Farmers have adopted various strategies to combat labour scarcity, but an optimum strategy seems to be still absent.
