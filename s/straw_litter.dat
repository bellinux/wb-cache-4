40|$|A {{total of}} 960 day-old Hubbard meat type chicks {{purchased}} {{from a local}} hatchery in Riyadh area were used to study the effect of sand litter compared with <b>straw</b> <b>litter</b> on carcass characteristics of broilers performance. The chicks were weighed and randomly allotted to 32 pens (1. 5 mxlm) with two different stocking density (18 and 22 birds/m 2). Two different litter thickness (5 and 10 cm) and four replicates for each treatment {{were used in the}} study. At 5 and 6 weeks of age, 3 males and 3 females of each replicate were individually weighed and slaughtered. Carcass and abdominal fat weights were obtained and breast blisters and foot pad lesions were recorded. Carcass weight percentage of live weight and abdominal weight percentage of carcass weight were calculated. Data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis. The results indicated that litter type had no significant effect upon all studied traits except foot pad lesions at 5 and 6 weeks of age, but breast blisters were practically not observed. Birds grown on sand litter tended to be better in an studied traits except carcass percentage and had significantly (P ≤S 0. 05) lower foot pad lesions at 5 (2. 1 : 26. 2) and 6 (9. 4 : 43. 7 %) weeks of age compared to their peers grown on <b>straw</b> <b>litter.</b> This might be due to the roughness of <b>straw</b> <b>litter,</b> which might have injured foot pads, particularly at early ages. The results showed that litter thickness, disregarding litter type, had no significant effect upon all studied traits except foot pad lesions at 6 weeks of age which was significantly (P:SO. OI) lower (15. 6 : 37. 5 %) for the birds grown on the Iow litter thickness. They also tended to be better in all studied traits except abdominal fat amount and percentage at 6 weeks of age. This result supports the previous conclusion in the first study, which indicated that 5 cm litter thickness is suitable for broiler production. The results indicated that stocking density had no significant effect upon all studied traits except carcass weight and foot pad lesions at 6 weeks of age. Birds grown in the low density had significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 05) carcass weight (1836 : 1789 g) and lower (P ≤O. OI) foot pad lesions (8. 5 : 14. 6 %) and tended to be better in the other traits except carcass weight percentage than those grown in the high density. This might be due to the less crowdedness and humidity in the low-density pens.

30|$|Mulch {{has been}} into a common use in crop cultivation, yet {{with a number}} of drawbacks, {{such as the use of}} {{environmentally}} unfriendly synthetic materials that are hard to degrade (transparent plastic, PHP, etc.), apart from their high price that are less affordable for farmers (O’Brine and Thompson 2010; Coolong 2012; Kasirajan and Ngouajio 2012; Miles et al. 2012). However, the use of organic mulch from rice <b>straw,</b> <b>litter,</b> and others are unstable at the time. Accordingly, it is urgent to come up with alternative organic materials from the accessible surrounding environment to be made for organic mulch for the farming field with simple technology. Organic mulch requires modification into more effective and efficient forms in usage by modifying it into sheet forms. Besides, the use of paper as mulch has been developed in some patents such as using cellulose fibers with additional materials, cellulosic pulp with biodegradation-retarding agent and addition of fertilizer to optimize mulch function (Wright 1936; Pratt and Medford 1955; Yoko et al. 1986; Peter.

40|$|Sahel {{is a huge}} {{tropical}} arid and semi-arid territory where pastoral activities, most of {{the time}} mobile (nomadic, transhumant) are critical for population economy. Assessing forage resources by remote sensing relies classically on the assessment of herbage growth during the 2 to 4 months of the wet season (e. g. Audaet al. this session). Then, dry herbage degradation during the dry season is left to crude models (e. g. Hiernauxet al. this session). Monitoring forage availability during the 8 to 10 months long dry season at local and regional scales is one of the challenge that remote sensing can address. <b>Straw</b> and <b>litter</b> monitoring is also important for dust emission, surface energy budget and biomass burning emissions estimates. Existing remote sensing studies dedicated to dry herbaceous vegetation detection are mainly motivated by the assessment of soil tillage intensity, of risk of soil erosion, and risk of wildfire linked to the mass of dead fuel. None of these studies have dealt with monitoring of <b>straw</b> and <b>litter</b> degradation during the dry season in Sahel. In the frame of the PAILLASAT and ECLIS projects, we have investigated several remotely sensed reflectancesand indexes to quantitatively assess the standing <b>straws</b> and <b>litter</b> masses using MODIS data from TERRA and AQUA satellites. The short-wave infrared bands (B 6 centered at 1640 nm, B 7 centered at 2130 nm) are especially sensitive to plant dry matter. Several MODIS derived index from literature were tested against a set of field measures carried out in 26 rangeland sites (1 km-long lines) from 2004 to 2011 in the Malian Gourma. The best results are observed for index using MODIS bands from the shortwave infrared. In particular, the Soil Tillage Index (STI), ratio of B 6 on B 7 (Van Deventer et al., 1997), the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), normalized difference of B 6 by B 7 (Van Deventer et al., 1997) and the ratio B 7 on B 6 (Guerschmanet al., 2009) showed good results. For example, STI explains 66 % of the variance of dry masses found over a sample of sandy soils (n= 126). The strong inter-annual variability is well captured. In addition, fire occurrencesmatch with marked fall of the index values, meaning that the method may be suitable even in regularly burned areas. Maps of dry herbaceous mass are shown for the Gourma, with an analysis of the role of distance to water resources on dry masses dynamics (see Diawaraet al this session) through grazing occurrence and intensity...|$|R
40|$|Background Domesticated grazing animals {{including}} {{horses and}} donkeys are frequently housed using deep litter bedding systems, {{where it is}} commonly presumed {{that there is no}} risk of infection from the nematodes that are associated with grazing at pasture. We use two different approaches to test whether equids could become infected with cyathostomines from the ingestion of deep <b>litter</b> <b>straw</b> bedding. Methods Two herbage plot studies were performed in horticultural incubators set up to simulate three straw bedding scenarios and one grass turf positive control. Faeces were placed on 16 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass substrate over 2 - to 3 -week periods. Within each incubator, a thermostat was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 10 °C to 20 °C. To provide further validation, 24 samples of straw bedding were collected over an 8 -week period from six barns in which a large number of donkeys were housed in a deep <b>litter</b> <b>straw</b> bedding system. These samples were collected from the superficial bedding at 16 sites along a “W” route through each barn. Results No infective larvae were recovered from any of the plots containing dry straw. However, infective cyathostomine larvae were first detected on day 8 from plots containing moist straw. In the straw bedding study, cyathostomine larvae were detected in 18 of the 24 samples. Additionally, in the two barns which were sampled serially, the level of larval infectivity generally increased from week to week, except when the straw bedding was removed and replaced. Conclusions We have demonstrated that equine cyathostomines can develop to infective larvae on moist straw bedding. It is therefore possible for a horse or donkey bedded in deep <b>litter</b> <b>straw</b> to become infected by ingesting the contaminated straw. This has implications for parasite control in stabled equids and potentially in housed ruminants, and further investigation is required in order to establish the relative infective pressure from pasture versus straw bedding...|$|R

Our study year was unusually dry, with only half of the mean annual rainfall. Sixteen plots (5 × 6 m) for each of our four treatments, mulches with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) <b>straw,</b> forest <b>litter</b> (SDTF litter), polyethylene and bare soil (control), were used. In each plot, 20 tree saplings were planted of each species. The SVWC was higher in plots mulched with polyethylene than in bare soil plots. The soil pH did not change with mulching, and there were no differences between treatments in the concentrations of soil organic C, total N, NO 3 and total P. However, soil concentrations of NH 4 were highest in plots with alfalfa straw and of bicarbonate P in plots with polyethylene. Sapling survival was higher in polyethylene mulch plots than in other mulching treatments, in the order I. ?wolcottiana > C. eriostachys > L. eriocarinalis. Sapling survival under organic mulches, alfalfa <b>straw</b> and forest <b>litter</b> were similar, and lowest in bare soil. The relative growth rate followed the order L. eriocarinalis < C. eriostachys < I. wolcotiana, and the growth rate of all species was greatest under polyethylene mulch.

Harvesting was done on 45 th day, and the worms were separated from the vermicast. The young worms and cocoons were separated from the soil using 3  mm sieves. The vermicompost contains macro and micro nutrients (Ismail 2005).|$|R
40|$|Although {{reports by}} several workers have {{indicated}} antibiotics {{to be of}} little value in diets for mature chickens, Waibel et al. (1952) have reported supplementa-tion of penicillin to the breeder diet to cause an increased deposition of biotin and folic acid in the egg yolk without producing a measureable effect on egg production, body weight, or hatchability. I t was thus suggested that a diet sub-optimal in biotin, folic acid, or any other nutrient essential for good hatchability might be improved {{by the addition of}} an antibiotic. Herewith reported are a series of experiments with breeder hens which have been conducted under practical conditions and have demonstrated a beneficial effect with the use of penicillin or streptomycin supplements. New Hampshire or White Plymouth Rock pullets from the experiment station flock which had not received antibiotics during the growing period were equally distributed by physical selection into the respective groups as shown in Table 1. Sixty pullets were used per pen with five males of the same stock. The 12 ' by 20 ' pens used were all under one roof in simi-lar locations with access from a central alleyway and were provided with fresh <b>straw</b> <b>litter</b> {{at the start of the}} pre-experi-mental period. The pullets were given the control diet free choice for a two months trial period following the time when most of them had come into production, an...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to evaluate the performance, mortality and the incidence of lesion on the foot-pad of broilers and litter enterobacteriaceae load in two ventilation systems and two litter materials. The experiment {{was carried out in}} four 12 m × 10 m broiler houses, internally divided in 4 pens, with 200 birds/pen for four consecutive flocks, each one with 42 days of duration and interval of 15 days of downtime between flocks. It was evaluated two ventilation systems (stationary and oscillating fans), and two litter materials (soybean straw and rice husks). Performance variables studied were body weight, weight gain, feed conversion ratio and mortality of birds at 21, 35, and 42 days of age. Flock mortality was daily recorded, and total mortality was used for analysis. Evaluation of lesions by using foot-pad macroscopic examination was performed in all birds at final weighing. It was also performed quantitative examinations of litter enterobacteria. Statistical analyses were performed by using the mixed model theory for repeated measures and logistical regression. Rice husks litter promoted the best performance of birds at all studied ages. Results did not permit to recommend a ventilation system inasmuch as both had similar performances. Soy <b>straw</b> <b>litter</b> causes a high incidence of foot-pad lesions. Enterobacteria occurrence is lower in reused litter...|$|E

For this, 180 animals, 31 days old, were divided in three experimentalgroups of sixty each. Before {{the beginning of the}} assay, aprophylactic treatment was providedto the animals for 7 days. The T 1 group’s rabbits received a phytoterapictreatment composed by vegetableextracts (China and Colocynthis). The T 2 group’s rabbits receiveda pharmacological treatmentcomposed by trimethoprim and sodiumsulphadymetoxin. The T 3 groupwas the control. The used productswere dissolved in the drinking water. All the animals were housed in squarepens (cm 100 x 100 x 70 h) and received,ad libitum, water and a commercialpelleted feed. Faecal materialwas collected weekly from fiverabbit per replicate and then thenumber and the species of oocystsoutput by hard faeces was determined. The results confirmed the that Eimeriamedia, E. perforans and E. magnawere the species more frequently detectedin Italian rabbitry. The processof oocysts output by hard faecesremained unchanged in the twogroups. Independently from treatments,the level of infestation didn’toccur any enteric pathology due tococcidia. The prophylactic treatments didn’taffect the rabbit performances ormortality rate and the observed differencesbetween males and femaleswere an expression of normalityvariation by sex. Neither the housingsystem on <b>straw</b> <b>litter</b> modified themeat palatability. Further studies are necessary to determinethe efficacy of the phytoterapictreatment tested in this researchand, more in general, of thoseused in veterinary medicine. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Mulches {{effect on}} net {{radiation}} (RN), air (Ta) and soil (TS) temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil water content (SW), stomatal conductance (gS) and survival of three native species in a degraded {{tropical deciduous forest}} area was examined. The study year was dry, {{with half of the}} average annual rainfall. Three blocks were chosen, each block contained sixteen plots. Mulches with alfalfa <b>straw,</b> forest <b>litter,</b> white polyethylene and bare soil, were used. Twenty plants of each species one year-old were transplanted in each of 16 plots (5 × 6 m). The experiment was conducted during one year. RN was higher in plots with forest litter than in other treatments; Ta, TS and VPD were higher in bare soil plots than in mulched plots, and SW was higher in mulched plots than in bare soil plots. Ipomoea wolcottiana and Caesalpinia eriostachys registered the highest values of gS and survival, whilst Lonchocarpus eriocarinalis registered the lowest. In polyethylene mulch the three species showed the greatest survival. Mulches mitigate extreme microclimates and increase plant survival during the restoration of dry tropical areas...|$|R

6000|$|The good Squire's remarks {{brought to}} mind a visit that I once paid to the Tabbard Inn, famous for being the place of {{assemblage}} from whence Chaucer's pilgrims set forth for Canterbury. It is in the borough of Southwark, not far from London Bridge, and bears, at present, the name of [...] "the Talbot." [...] It has sadly declined in dignity {{since the days of}} Chaucer, being a mere rendezvous and packing-place of the great wagons that travel into Kent. The court-yard, which was anciently the mustering-place of the pilgrims previous to their departure, was now lumbered with huge wagons. Crates, boxes, hampers, and baskets, containing the good things of town and country, were piled about them; while, among the <b>straw</b> and <b>litter,</b> the motherly hens scratched and clucked, with their hungry broods at their heels. Instead of Chaucer's motley and splendid throng, I only saw a group of wagoners and stable-boys enjoying a circulating pot of ale; while a long-bodied dog sat by, with head on one side, ear cocked up, and wistful gaze, as if waiting for his turn at the tankard.|$|R
