5|$|Bayt Jibrin {{and all of}} Palestine was conquered by the Ottomans {{after their}} victory over the Mamluks during the 1516 Battle of Marj Dabiq.

The Ottomans did not exercise strict control over their territories and tended to keep local leaders in their traditional positions as long as they complied with the higher authorities and paid imperial taxes. During Suleiman the Magnificent's reign, in 1552, the destroyed Crusader castle in Bayt Jibrin was partially rebuilt {{in order to protect the}} main road between Gaza and Jerusalem.

5|$|The {{male who}} {{performs}} the shraddha {{should take a}} purifying bath beforehand {{and is expected to}} wear a dhoti. He wears a ring of kush grass. Then the ancestors are invoked to reside in the ring. The shraddha is usually performed bare-chested, as the position of the sacred thread worn by him needs to be changed multiple times during the ceremony. The shraddha involves pinda-daan, which is an offering to the ancestors of pindas (cooked rice and barley flour balls mixed with ghee and black <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds),</b> accompanying the release of water from the hand. It is followed by the worship of Vishnu in form of the darbha grass, a gold image or Shaligram stone and Yama. The food offering is then made, cooked especially for the ceremony on the roof. The offering is considered to be accepted if a crow arrives and devours the food; the bird is believed to be a messenger from Yama or the spirit of the ancestors. A cow and a dog are also fed, and Brahmin priests are also offered food. Once the ancestors (crow) and Brahmins have eaten, the family members can begin lunch.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effect of <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> on lipid profile and oxidative stress biomarkers in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Methods: Fifty patients with knee OA were allocated into two groups receiving 40 g of <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> daily along with standard medical therapy (n= 25) or standard treatment (n= 25) for two months. Serum total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid profile (total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides) were measured. Results: After the intervention period two months of study, serum TC, LDL-cholesterol and MDA decreased significantly in the sesame group (P 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} pre and post-treatment values of lipid profile and oxidative parameters between the two groups (P> 0. 05).

Much of traditional cuisine survives because of the area’s relative remoteness and traditional women still cook over wood fires, grinding corn and other foods on metates.

Beans are flavored with <b>sesame</b> <b>seed.</b> Small dishes include tlacoyos with beans, chili peppers with <b>sesame</b> <b>seed,</b> tamales with salted fish, turkey and other fillings, enchiladas zampadas. Vegetable dishes include a green called quelite with beans or with herbs and eggs, chayote with squash seeds, enchiladas with mamey and nopal cactus with eggs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A host runs {{less risk}} of {{contracting}} a gastrointestinal infection when enteropathogenic bacteria adhere to dietary fibers {{instead of to}} epithelial cell receptors. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the binding capacity of food and feed components for intestinal bacteria from various hosts using a miniaturized in vitro assay. In total, 18 dietary components were tested with four strains of E. coli, seven strains of Salmonella enterica and two strains of Lactobacillus. RESULTS: A comparison of the results obtained for all Salmonella strains tested revealed that konjac gum and <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> extract represented the most efficient binding matrices. Similarly, for all E. coli strains tested, <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> extract and artichoke performed well as binding matrices. Salmonella isolates from chickens adhered best to <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> extract. E. coli K 88 and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium isolated from pigs effectively bound to Bia-Mos (R), pumpkin, <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> extract, and tomato. <b>Sesame</b> <b>seed</b> extract and tomato also had adhesive capacities for E. coli K 99, S. enterica sv. Dublin, and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium from calves. With human isolates, konjac gum showed a high binding potential for S. enterica and E. coli. CONCLUSION: The adhesion screening of different food and feed components resulted in highly discriminating product rankings. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Sesame</b> <b>seed</b> is an {{allergen}} {{of growing}} importance worldwide. However, {{knowledge of the}} clinically relevant sesame allergen and its cross-reactivity with homologous allergens is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was the immunological characterization of Dutch sesame seed-allergic patients and evaluation of cross-reactivity between <b>sesame</b> <b>seed,</b> tree nut and pollen allergens using different sources of allergen extracts. Methods: Six patients with a medical history of <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> allergy were included, i. e. 5 with an anaphylactic reaction and 1 with an oral allergy syndrome (OAS). The immunological background of the <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> and tree nut IgE sensitization was characterized with Western blotting and a basophil activation test (BAT). The major sesame allergen was identified by nanoLC-MS/MS. Cross-reactivity was measured using an immuno-inhibition assay with the Phadia ImmunoCAP system. Results: Oleosin was identified as the major allergen for the 5 patients with an anaphylactic reaction to <b>sesame</b> <b>seed,</b> but no cross-reactivity between sesame and tree nut proteins was observed. For the patient with OAS, IgE specific to oleosin was not detected but cross-reactivity between <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> and tree nut proteins was observed. The BAT and ImmunoCAP inhibition test added value to the clinical and immunological characterization of sesame seed-sensitized patients, distinguishing relevant and non-relevant sensitizations. Conclusions: Our immunological approach enabled us to fully characterize the sensitization pattern of 6 sesame seed-allergic patients. The different protein composition of commercially available allergen extracts influences the outcomes of the immunological assays and thus also the diagnosis to a large extent. </p...|$|R
