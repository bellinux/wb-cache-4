Based on the classroom observed, the writer {{found out that the}} teacher used several kinds of communication signals called meta-language: feedback, turnover <b>signals,</b> and <b>bracket</b> <b>signals.</b> Therefore this study is an attempt to analyse the frequency of those signals used and the effectiveness. Then, to collect the data, the writer taped a particular subject taught by the same teacher for 3 times, and then chose one of the three tapes which has the most frequent signals. The writer transcribed and put the results in three tables of feedback, turnover <b>signals</b> and <b>bracket</b> <b>signals,</b> in which each of them were classified into verbal and nonverbal signals. After that, the writer analysed the data based on the research question. In addition, the writer also analysed some factors that caused the effectiveness of several signals. After analysing the data, the writer found out that the three signals under study appear quite frequent in the classroom Turnover signals appear a bit more often than backchannel <b>signals.</b> While <b>bracket</b> <b>signals,</b> which were actually needed to appear more, occurred in a low total number. Additionally, the writer also found out that not all the signals appeared were effective, {{in the sense that the}} signals cannot encourage the students to speak or answer the teacher's questions. This happened because of several reasons, for example unsystematically delivered signals, an utterance that contain a negative steals, and the students' condition itself as a result, eventhough most of the teacher's signals are effective, it is obvious that the teacher should have evaluated her way of teaching and approaching the students so that the stude nts will not feel like being pushed in studying and learning...|$|R
5|$|In mid-2013, {{work had}} resumed {{in the tunnel}} segment between 99th Street and 105th Street, {{involving}} the addition of track and signals, mechanical and plumbing equipment, and upgrading the tunnels to meet modern fire code standards. , the station was 65% excavated. Rails for the line had arrived and were being stored in the station cavern; {{about one-third of the}} rails for the line had arrived by then, enough for tracks to be laid from 105th to 87th Streets. By spring 2014, the mezzanine was completed, and roof slabs were being installed; tracks and <b>signal</b> <b>brackets</b> were also installed north of the station. By April 2015, the station was 67% complete, and by April 2016, the station was 91% complete. The station was scheduled to be completed by June 2016, but this was later pushed back to fall 2016.|$|R

50|$|Various {{operating}} staff {{who saw the}} signal {{before and after the}} accident also gave evidence that the arm was not properly horizontal, including some who said that the degree of elevation appeared to increase as they got closer to it. It was later found that the <b>signal</b> post <b>bracket</b> was badly bent. The bracket may have been struck by a chain hanging from a wagon, or perhaps by engineers' machinery working on the lineside.|$|R

For example: Plaintiff asserts his cause is just, stating, [...] "my causes is [...] just." [...] Although in the original quoted sentence the word [...] "my" [...] was capitalized, it has been modified in the quotation and the change <b>signalled</b> with <b>brackets.</b> Similarly, where the quotation contained a grammatical error, the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with [...] "sic" [...] (Latin for 'thus').

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{installation}} of the first full mechanical interlocking system at Lambton Station in Wellington, a smaller system was installed at Kaitoke. [...] A signal box was built {{at the south end of}} the platform, and two arm <b>bracket</b> <b>signals</b> for both [...] "home" [...] and [...] "starting" [...] were provided for trains travelling in both directions. [...] Later, up and down [...] "distant" [...] signals were added. [...] Balanced arm semaphore signals replaced the earlier slotted-post design.|$|R
25|$|The box {{closed in}} October 1967, and the {{foundations}} {{and a significant}} amount of timber still survives, including rear posts and cross beams. The steel tubed Up Home <b>bracket</b> <b>signal</b> has been cut off at its base, and is still lying where it fell - presumably for intended collection later - although the arms and dolls are missing. A line of telegraph poles still runs from Cromford Meadows to the Junction, between the River Derwent and the railway line, though the wires have long gone.|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, Tanygrisiau {{had been}} {{provided}} with a run-round loop whilst {{it had been the}} terminus between June 1978 and May 1982. This loop was removed when the line was reopened to Blaenau Ffestiniog. In the mid-1990s, a project was launched to install a fully signalled passing loop. This proceeded as a volunteer project, including the building of a signal box. However, prior to commissioning, the project was abandoned in 2001. The trackwork (apart for the siding off the Up Loop) remained in situ. In June 2002, the loop was once again used to run trains around as part of the 2002 Gala to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the restoration of services to Blaenau Ffestiniog. The intended platform starter <b>signals</b> (posts, <b>brackets</b> and arms) have been recovered and some are now in use on the Isle of Man Railway, whilst others are destined for the resignalling of Harbour Station. In 2004, with new disc starter signals and spring-loaded points installed, Tanygrisiau became a passing loop for the first time.|$|R
40|$|In situ laser {{ablation}} quadrupole {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry {{was used to measure}} Pb isotopes in galena. Data acquisition was optimized by adjusting spot size, energy density, and ablation time to obtain near steady-state low relative standard deviation (%RSD) <b>signals.</b> Standard-sample <b>bracketing</b> using in-house Broken Hill galena as external reference standard was used and offline data reduction was carried out using VizualAge for Iolite 3. Using this methodology, galena grain in polished thin sections from selected massive sulphide deposits of the Bathurst Mining Camp, Canada, were tested and compared to previously published data. Absolute values and errors on the weighted mean of ~ 20 individual analyses from each sample compared favourably with whole-rock Pb-Pb isotope data. This approach provides a mean to obtain rapid, accurate, and moderately (0. 1 % 2 Ïƒ) precise Pb isotope measurements in galena and is particularly well suited for exploratory or reconnaissance studies. Further refinement of this approach may be useful in exploration for volcanogenic massive sulphides deposits and might be a useful vectoring tool when complemented with other conventional exploration techniques...|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} {{to the rear}} of the locomotive sheds house the carpenters' shop and paint shop where all the in-house painting and signwriting is carried out by the railway's own staff. A smaller stone-built shed houses more storage facilities and atop this building are the two (now unused) water tanks for the shed complex which remain as a reminder of busier times. The side of the water tank base originally carried a large <b>bracket</b> <b>signal</b> governing entry into the station, but this was damaged and then removed c.1981. What once formed a gap between the sheds was covered over in 1999 to provide further secure accommodation for rolling stock and this has been constructed from corrugated metal and is used to house some of the railway's redundant items of rolling stock including one of two Empress Vans and frames off out of use locomotives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{the home}} {{appliances}} are systemized, they have complicatedly assembled structure. It {{is reasonable to}} see the noise problem of home appliance {{in the viewpoint of}} system like vehicle and ship. There are various system analysis methods to resolve the noise problem [1 - 3]. To use system analysis methods, the system information like modal and path properties must be gathered and analyzed. But it takes many times to find out the system properties, so the simpler system analysis methods are needed. The coherence analysis method is useful as the system analysis method, since the method can identify the system property like the relationship between inputs and outputs directly and simply. In the paper, the partial coherence analysis is used for identification of the MISO system of washing machine, in which multi-input signals are vibration <b>signals</b> of motor <b>bracket</b> and an output signal is noise signal of washing machine. The relationship between the noise of washing machine and the vibration of the motor bracket in working status was identified and the parts of bracket closely correlated with noise were also proved by the relationship. And the noise of washing machine was controlled by redesigning the parts of bracket associated with the noise of washing machine based on the coherence function in octave band...|$|R
