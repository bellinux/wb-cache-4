5|$|Among P. labiata {{and some}} other Portias, when adults {{of the same species}} but {{opposite}} sexes recognise each other, they display at 10 to 30centimetres. Males usually wait for 2 to 15minutes before starting a display, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> female starts a display first.|$|E
5|$|A Battalion in the Marine Corps {{is headed}} by the Battalion Commander, usually a Lieutenant Colonel and <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> Colonel, his staff, headquarters, and the Battalion Sergeant Major.

5|$|Almost all the {{necessary}} corrections of misspellings have been made. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>a</b> stroke of the pen indicates an error, perhaps to be corrected later. Some corrections seem to be written by prima manu (e.g. Matthew 4:10; 5:19) others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 6; Luke 3; 10:35). The apostrophe is used even when not required, especially in εξ', and ουκ'.|$|E
5|$|Another {{widespread}} and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> layer of egg custard or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well-known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version {{is a relatively}} recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>a</b> sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> whole group {{of about a dozen}} dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> good amount of claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E

5|$|Gareloi has an {{extensive}} eruptive history, {{dating back to}} at least 1760. At least 12 eruptions have occurred at the summit, accompanied by lava and pyroclastic flows. Typically they have been characterized by a central vent eruption followed by an explosive eruption, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> phreatic explosion. All have been of Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 1 to 3. Such eruptions have occurred in 1790, 1791, 1792, 1873, 1922, April 1929, 1950, January 17, 1952, August 7, 1980, January 15, 1982, September 4, 1987, and August 17, 1989. Uncertain eruptions occurred in 1760, 1828, 1927, and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{was also}} an {{innovator}} {{in the realm of}} craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces ("trencadís") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented a new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of primary colours, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.|$|E
5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, it is <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> minuscule positional concession, {{as it makes}} it harder for this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E

5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E
5|$|Krishna worship or reverence {{has been}} adopted by several new {{religious}} movements since the 19thcentury, and he is <b>sometimes</b> <b>a</b> member of an eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures. For instance, Édouard Schuré, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and occult movements, considered Krishna a Great Initiate, while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual teacher for humanity along with Buddha.|$|E

5|$|Simple {{versions}} are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>a</b> mandoline {{is used to}} slice vegetables for vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin slicing and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.|$|E
5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>a</b> pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the main plot was {{inspired}} by a scene from the novel <b>Sometimes</b> <b>a</b> Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as he thought he was being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E
