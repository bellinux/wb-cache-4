40|$|This paper {{concerns}} policy synthesis {{in large}} queuing networks. The results provide {{answers to the}} following questions: (i) It is well-known that an understanding of variability {{is important in the}} determination of safety stocks to prevent unwanted idleness. Is this the only use of high-order <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> in <b>policy</b> synthesis? (ii) Will a translation of an optimal policy for the deterministic fluid model (in which there is no variability) lead to an allocation which is approximately optimal for the stochastic network? If so, what is the `regret'? (iii) Where are the highest sources of sensitivity in network control? A sensitivity analysis of an associated fluid-model optimal control problem provides an exact dichotomy in (ii). If an optimal policy for the fluid model is `maximally non-idling', then variability plays a small role in control design...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of multi-domain {{access control policy}} integration {{makes it difficult to}} understand and manage the <b>policy</b> conflict <b>information.</b> The <b>policy</b> <b>information</b> visualization technology can express the logical relation of the complex information intuitively which can effectively improve the management ability of the multi-domain policy integration. Based on the role-based access control model, this paper proposed two policy analyzing methods on the separated domain <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> of multi-domain <b>policy</b> integration conflicts and the policy element levels of inter-domain and element mapping of cross-domain respectively. In addition, the corresponding visualization tool is developed. We use the tree-maps algorithm to statistically analyze quantity and type of the policy integration conflicts. On that basis, the semantic substrates algorithm is applied to concretely analyze the policy element levels of inter-domain and role and permission mapping of cross-domain. Experimental result shows tree-maps and semantic substrates can effectively analyze the conflicts of multi-domain policy integration and have a good application value...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the following questions}} regarding policy synthesis in large queueing networks: (i) It {{is well known that}} an understanding of variability is important in the determination of safety stocks to prevent unwanted idleness. Is this the only value of high-order <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> in <b>policy</b> synthesis? (ii) Will a translation of an optimal policy for the deterministic fluid model (in which there is no variability) lead to an allocation which is approximately optimal for the stochastic network? (iii) What are the sources of highest sensitivity in network control? A sensitivity analysis of an associated fluid-model optimal control problem provides an exact dichotomy in (ii). If an optimal policy for the fluid model is `maximally non-idling', then variability plays a small role in control design. If this condition does not hold, then the `gap' between the fluid and stochastic optimal policies is exactly proportional to system variability. Furthermore, under mild assumptions, we find that the optimal policy for the stochastic model is closely approximated by an affine shift of the fluid optimal solution. However, sensitivity of steady-state performance with respect to perturbations in the policy vanishes with increasing variability...|$|R
40|$|Policy {{debates on}} {{immigration}} {{have been important}} {{in recent years and}} will probably continue to be high on the national agenda for some time to come. Relevant demographic, <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> can inform <b>policy</b> decisions, but concerns continue to be expressed about an apparent lack of such information in the area of immigration. We are pleased to send you this report, which responds to your request that we study policy-related needs for demographic, statistical information; report on federal statistics that address those needs, including what is known about the quality of those statistics; identify data gaps; and suggest strategies for improving statistics. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of other committees with jurisdiction over immigration issues; the Commissioner, INS; and Director, Bureau of the Census. We will also make copies available to others upon request. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please call me or Judith A. Droitcour, Assistant Director, who served as project director for this work, at (202) 512 - 7997. Other major contributors are listed in appendix V...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} incorporate <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> into a rule-based parser to resolve syntactic ambiguities. We extract the <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> from the Penn Treebank, and apply {{the information to the}} rule-based parser. For the extraction of the <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> the tag conversion is needed because of the disagreement of the tags and the bracketing style. We will show the effect of the tag conversion with experiments. The final result shows about 7 % error rate reduction in the dependency evaluation. We will also show how much each type of <b>statistical</b> <b>information</b> affects the parsing performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} issues {{underlying the}} development of <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> with the aim to group the issues into six classes: technical and scientific information, library, information and communication technology, social, government information, and economy. Issues underlying {{the development of}} <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> need to be grouped to facilitate {{the analysis of the}} current <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> situation of any country. Classification is also an approach appropriate for a new field which has not gained academic maturity such as <b>information</b> <b>policy.</b> Additionally, classification is also important to determine the focus of <b>information</b> <b>policy.</b> This paper is based on a literature review in <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> which gathered qualitative data in analysing the issues embracing the development of <b>information</b> <b>policy.</b> Analyses revealed that the <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> group has never changed ever since the earliest research.

40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>policy</b> {{formulation}} is {{not only}} a matter of politics and policies. In this article it is argued that national <b>information</b> <b>policies</b> are also about ethics and that the moral complexities and challenges associated with the development of national <b>information</b> <b>policies</b> should be taken into consideration. As such {{it is a matter of}} social justice. A brief overview of the scope and nature of national <b>information</b> <b>policies</b> is provided. It is also argued that ethical reasoning should not be confused with laws or customs and that sound ethical reasoning is needed to address the ethical complexities associated with the design of national <b>information</b> <b>policies.</b> A set of ethical principles is proposed that can be used as guidelines for the development of national <b>information</b> <b>policies.</b> [URL]...|$|R

40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>policy</b> (IP) {{as it is}} {{presented}} in the literature of library and information science (LIS) suffers from some limiting assumptions that obscure central policy issues concerning power over information. A more promising approach to <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> may be found in the actor network theory (ANT). ANT’s rich methodology embraces scientific realism, social constructivism, and discourse analysis in its central concept of hybrids, or “quasi-objects”, that are simultaneously real, social, and discursive. The advantages of conceiving <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> as a network of hybrids are explored, with examples drawn from radio broadcasting and the “information superhighway”.
