5000|$|Drilling {{is another}} means of {{sampling}} the seabed. It {{is used to}} obtain {{a record of the}} seabed stratigraphy or the rock formations below it. The set-up used to sample an offshore structure's foundation is similar to that used by the oil industry to reach and delineate hydrocarbon reservoirs, with some differences in the types of testing. The drill string consists of a series of pipe segments 5 in in diameter <b>screwed</b> <b>end</b> to end, with a drillbit assembly at the bottom. As the dragbit (teeth extending downward from the drillbit) cut into the soil, soil cuttings are produced. Viscous drilling mud flowing down the drillpipe collects these cuttings and carry them up outside the drillpipe. As is the case for onshore geotechnical surveys, different tools can be used for sampling the soil from a drill hole, notably [...] "Shelby tubes", [...] "piston samplers" [...] and [...] "split spoon samplers".|$|E

50|$|Sometimes wood {{splitting}} is undesirable. Methods to prevent splitting in woodworking are the butterfly joint, truss connector plates, or metal straps. Columns may be hollowed {{in the center}} to prevent splitting. Nail points may be blunted or pilot holes drilled to prevent splitting of lumber while nailing or <b>screwing.</b> <b>End</b> grain sealers are liquid products usually containing wax which helps prevent rapid drying of the ends of lumber resulting in splits. Metal end plates or S-shaped pieces of metal may be driven into the butt ends of a timber.

40|$|Steady {{and useful}} culture for chondrocytes is {{essential}} for cartilage regenerative medicine. However, in conventional plate culture, the chondrocytes become dedifferentiated and lose their ability to make cartilage matrices. Three-dimen sional culture mimicking the physiological environment in native chondrocytes is useful to maintain the chondrocyte properties during the proliferation culture. However, the three-dimensional culture is practically a hard task due to dif ficult harvest of the cells. Thus, we attempted to apply porous materials, hollow fibers for the three-dimensional culture, and developed their module to realize the effective harvest of the cells. Polyethersulfone-based hollow fibers, wh ose safety and cell affinity were confirmed by the experiment of the coculture with human chondrocytes, were collected to fabricate a module. The hollow fiber module was installed with <b>screw</b> <b>ends,</b> and enabled the easy removal of chondro cytes from the inner unit. Cultured human chondrocytes embedded within collagen hydrogel were put into the outer lumen of the hollow fiber module, while chondrocyte prolfieration medium was perfused through the inner lumen at 0 to 30 mL/min. After 2 weeks’ culture, the flow rate of 3 to 10 mL/min effectively supported the chondrocyte prolifera tion. Then, long-term culture using the hollow fiber module at flow rate of 5 mL/min was performed, revealing that the cell growth in this module at 3 weeks was approximately twice larger than that in static culture. The numbers of viable cells could be maintained by week 7. The hollow fiber module installed with <b>screw</b> <b>ends</b> can effectively culture and harvest the chondrocytes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background : Embolization might complicate device {{closure of}} large atrial septal defects (ASDs) with {{deficient}} margins. When margins are deficient, a precariously placed device can {{appear to be}} held in good position by the rigid delivery cable. Once the cable is unscrewed, the device adopts the natural lie of the interatrial septum. This can occasionally expose the inadequately captured margins and lead to device embolization. Most embolizations occur immediately after release. Retrieval of the embolized device required prolonged fluoroscopy and sometimes open heart surgery. Objective : To evolve a new strategy of retrieval of a malpositioned device after unscrewing the cable before impending embolization. Materials and Methods : After deploying the device in place, a snare is passed through the delivery sheath around the cable to grip the screw on the right atrial disc of the device. With the snare holding the <b>screw</b> <b>end,</b> the device is released by unscrewing the cable. The device position is reconfirmed on echocardiography. The snare is subsequently removed if the device was stable. In case of device migration, the same snare is used to retrieve the device before it embolizes completely. Results : Snare assistance was used in 24 patients considered as high-risk for device embolization. Its usefulness was demonstrated in two patients with deficient posterior margin and small inferior margin where the device got malpositioned immediately after release. As the snare was still holding on to the <b>screw</b> <b>end,</b> the device could be retrieved into the sheath easily. Conclusion : This novel snare assisted device release strategy safeguards against device embolization in large ASDs with deficient rims and allows simplified retrieval...|$|R

The effect of different processing parameters on the dispersion state was investigated. Complementary techniques {{were used to}} characterize nanocomposites microstructures. Scanning electron microscopy allows to quantify the remaining agglomerates, whereas X-Ray diffraction focusses on the intercalation of the clay platelets by the polymer chains. Rheological measurements in small amplitude oscillatory shear helps to characterize the nanodispersion of the organoclay.

The {{results show that the}} screw speed plays a major role on the exfoliation, but a compromise has to be found between an efficient dispersion and the matrix thermal degradation.

40|$|The {{drilling}} bone may potentially cause excessive frictional heat, {{which can}} lead to local bone necrosis. This heat generation and local necrosis has been suggested to contribute to the resorption of bone around the placed <b>screws,</b> <b>ending</b> in loss of screw purchase in the bone and inadvertent loosening and/or the bone-implant construct. In vivo studies on this subject have inherent obstacles {{not the least of which}} is controlling the variables and real time bone temperature data acquisition. Theoretical models can be generated using computer software and the inclusion of known constants for the mechanical properties of metal and bone. These known Data points for the variables (drill bit and bone) enables finite element analysis of various bone drilling scenarios. An elastic-plastic three-dimensional (3 D) acetabular bone mode was developed and finite element model analysis (FEA) was applied to various simulated drilling procedures. The FEA results clearly indicate that the depth of drilling and the drill speed both have a significant effect on the temperature during drilling procedures. The reduction of the feeding speed leads to a reduction in bone temperature. Our data suggests that reducing the feeding speed regardless of RPMs and pressure applied could be a simple useful and effective way to reduce drilling temperatures. This study is the first step in helping any surgeon who drills bone and places screws to better understand the ideal pressure to apply and drill speed to employ and advance rate to avoid osteonecrosis...|$|R

With the {{increasingly}} wide use of screw components in industry, technologies for efficiently fabricating the complex helical surfaces on these components {{play an important}} role in modern metal-working. In this paper, the helical surface of a screw shaft is mathematically modeled based on the profile of its end section, and the whirlwind milling process and its requirements for machining the screw using standard cutter blades are overviewed. Then a theoretical approach to calculating the tool path and the corresponding movements of the machine axes for producing such a helical surface are presented.
