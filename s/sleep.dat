5|$|As {{attention}} {{to the role of}} <b>sleep</b> hygiene in promoting public health has grown, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of resources available in print and on the internet. Organizations running public health initiatives include the National <b>Sleep</b> Foundation and the Division of <b>Sleep</b> Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with <b>sleep</b> hygiene resources, such as tips for <b>sleep</b> hygiene, instructional videos, <b>sleep</b> hygiene self-assessments, poll statistics on <b>sleep</b> hygiene, and tools to find <b>sleep</b> professionals. A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of <b>Sleep</b> Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy <b>Sleep</b> Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote <b>sleep</b> hygiene awareness.|$|E
5|$|Practice of <b>sleep</b> {{hygiene and}} {{knowledge}} of <b>sleep</b> hygiene practices can be assessed with measures such as the <b>Sleep</b> Hygiene Index, <b>Sleep</b> Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale, or the <b>Sleep</b> Hygiene Self-Test. For younger individuals, <b>sleep</b> hygiene can be assessed by the Adolescent <b>Sleep</b> Hygiene Scale or the Children's <b>Sleep</b> Hygiene Scale.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sleep</b> {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of <b>sleep</b> (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer <b>sleep</b> deprivation. A <b>sleep</b> deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily <b>sleep</b> into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of <b>sleep.</b> A <b>sleep</b> deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional <b>sleep</b> cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the <b>sleep</b> time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen <b>sleep</b> quality by increasing light <b>sleep</b> and decreasing deep <b>sleep.</b> Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave <b>sleep</b> and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor <b>sleep</b> hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of <b>sleep</b> deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and <b>sleep</b> in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} <b>sleep</b> hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{for people}} {{experiencing}} difficulties with <b>sleep,</b> spending less time in bed results in {{deeper and more}} continuous <b>sleep,</b> so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of the bed for any activities except <b>sleep</b> (or sex).|$|E

5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality <b>sleep</b> {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of <b>sleep</b> hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to <b>sleep,</b> reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful <b>sleep.</b> For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair <b>sleep</b> in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. Chronic low back pain is associated with <b>sleep</b> problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during <b>sleep,</b> a shorter duration of <b>sleep,</b> and less satisfaction with <b>sleep.</b> In addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sleep</b> hygiene is {{a central}} {{component}} of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. <b>Sleep</b> hygiene recommendations {{have been shown to}} reduce or eliminate the symptoms of insomnia. Specific <b>sleep</b> disorders may require other or additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with <b>sleep</b> may require additional assistance from healthcare providers.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sleep</b> {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during <b>sleep,</b> but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM <b>sleep</b> (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) <b>sleep,</b> which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a <b>sleep</b> episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM <b>sleep,</b> also called slow wave <b>sleep,</b> activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave <b>sleep,</b> and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sleep</b> {{problems}} are {{a feature of}} the disease and can be worsened by medications. Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness (including sudden <b>sleep</b> attacks resembling narcolepsy), disturbances in REM <b>sleep,</b> or insomnia. REM behavior disorder (RBD), in which patients act out dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or DLB.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by <b>sleep</b> and rest, and <b>sleep</b> deprivation is detrimental to immune function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± produced in response to infection, appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) <b>sleep.</b> Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the <b>sleep</b> cycle, including an increase in slow-wave <b>sleep</b> relative to REM <b>sleep.</b>|$|E

However, they elected to forgo the <b>sleep</b> period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy <b>sleep</b> environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before <b>sleep,</b> engaging in mentally difficult tasks before <b>sleep,</b> and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain <b>sleep</b> hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative <b>sleep</b> an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|There is support showing {{positive}} <b>sleep</b> {{outcomes for}} people who follow more than one <b>sleep</b> hygiene recommendation.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious breathers. All mammals <b>sleep,</b> but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of <b>sleep</b> in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to <b>sleep</b> with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals <b>sleep,</b> but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave <b>sleep,</b> in which they <b>sleep</b> {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E
