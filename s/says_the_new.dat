2500|$|The band's fourth album, Fed Through the Teeth Machine, was {{recorded}} in early to mid-2009 in Milford, New Hampshire, at Backyard Studios, {{which is owned by}} the band's former guitarist Jonny Fay. The album was released on October 27, 2009. Kozowyk <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> songs are more intense and mature than those the previous album.

2500|$|The Allied air {{commander}} in the South West Pacific Area, Major General George Kenney, devised {{a plan for a}} major attack on Wewak. Allied personnel started construction of two dummy airfields, relatively close to Japanese infantry positions on the Huon Peninsula, north of Lae.

Simultaneously, at Tsili Tsili, [...] away, the Allies constructed a real airfield and transferred fighter planes there before the Japanese discovered its existence.

6000|$|The liberal cave of the {{previous}} year was broken up, Lowe and the ablest of its old denizens now voting with Mr. Gladstone, but the great majority going with the government. The place of the empty cave was taken by a new group of dissidents, named from their habitat the party of the Tea-Room. Many, both whigs above the gangway and even radicals below, were averse to bringing Lord Russell and Mr. Gladstone back again; they thought a bill would have a better chance with the tories than with the old leaders. Insubordination and disorganisation were complete. “I have never seen anything like it,” <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Lord Halifax;(154) “but the state of things this year enables me to understand what was very inexplicable in all I heard of last year.” We can hardly wonder that the strain was often difficult to bear. A friend, meeting Mr. Gladstone at dinner about this time (March 25), thought that he saw signs of irritated nerve. “What an invaluable gift,” he reflects, “a present of phlegm from the gods would be! If we could roll up Thompson [master of Trinity] or Bishop Thirlwall with him and then bisect the compound, we should get a pair as invincible as the Dioscuri.” An accomplished observer told his constituents that one saw the humour of the great parliamentary chess tournament, looking at the pieces on the board and the face of Disraeli; its tragic side in a glimpse of the face of Gladstone; in the mephistophelian nonchalance of one, the melancholy earnestness of the other.(155) ...|$|E
