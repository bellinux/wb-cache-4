50|$|Alternative {{stripper}} configurations include matrix, internal exchange, flashing feed, and multipressure with <b>split</b> <b>feed.</b> Many {{of these}} configurations offer more energy efficiency for specific solvents or operating conditions. Vacuum operation favors solvents with low heats of absorption while operation at normal pressure favors solvents with high heats of absorption. Solvents with high heats of absorption require less energy for stripping from temperature swing at fixed capacity. The matrix stripper recovers 40% of CO2 {{at a higher}} pressure and does not have inefficiencies associated with multipressure stripper. Energy and costs are reduced since the reboiler duty cycle is slightly less than normal pressure stripper. An Internal Exchange stripper has a smaller ratio of water vapor to CO2 in the overheads stream, and therefore less steam is required. The multipressure configuration with <b>split</b> <b>feed</b> reduces the flow into the bottom section, which also reduces the equivalent work. Flashing feed requires less heat input because it uses the latent heat of water vapor to help strip some of the CO2 in the rich stream entering the stripper {{at the bottom of}} the column. The multipressure configuration is more attractive for solvents with a higher heats of absorption.|$|E

In {{the present study}} we examined the efficacy of offering foraging patch and substrate choice {{in an attempt to}} reduce motor stereotypy in two captive vicugna (F 1 and F 2). Browse were added to the vicugna’s enclosure as an additional forage substrate and also split the vicugna’s normal feed: half being delivered outside of the sleeping enclosure and half inside to offer a split patch choice. The study employed an ABACA design (A: Baseline, B: Browse, C: <b>Split</b> <b>Feed).</b> There was a significant effect for condition, P = 0. 017. T-tests revealed a significant condition effect in F 1 between the Browse and Baseline one, P < 0. 05 with the frequency of stereotypy during the Browse condition being higher. In addition in F 1, a higher frequency of stereotypy was observed during the Browse condition as compared to Baseline two and this approached significance, P = 0. 06. T-tests revealed several significant inter-condition differences in F 2. The frequency of stereotypy during the Browse condition was significantly higher than during Baseline one, P < 0. 05, Baseline 2, P < 0. 01 and the <b>Split</b> <b>Feed</b> condition, P < 0. 05. The frequency of stereotypy was also significantly higher in the Baseline 3 condition than in the <b>Split</b> <b>Feed</b> condition, P = 0. 05. In the wild, vicugna are the only camelids who sleep and eat in different areas. However, the subjects used for the present study were fed in their sleeping enclosure.

40|$|Laying hens {{are kept}} in {{production}} {{until the age of}} 75 - 80 wk, but the actual egg production period is only 55 - 60 weeks long, as young pullets start producing eggs approximately at 20 wk of age. During a single laying cycle a hen can produce on average 360 eggs. Extending the egg production period and keeping hens longer, possibly until 100 wk of age would not only contribute to increased profitability but also to more sustainable food production. In a longer laying cycle, the costs of egg production (e. g. : pullet purchase price, feed) are balanced by the earnings of a longer productive period and replacement of hens, depopulation and cleaning of stables would be less often required. However, there are several bottlenecks in extending the production period of laying hens such as declining persistency and egg quality, decreased bone quality, health and welfare. To tackle these problems, a multifactorial approach is needed. Improved genetic selection has to be accompanied by optimal nutrition and management to be able to produce 500 eggs until 100 wk of age which should be feasible by 2020, as layer breeding companies predict. This PhD research focused on the role of nutrition and management in extended production cycles in laying hens. First, a field study was conducted to have a better understanding how eggshell quality changes in the last phase of the production cycle in layer flocks. Secondly, small-scale experiments were conducted where an alternative <b>feeding</b> concept, <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> was tested to investigate its potential to improve shell quality in aged laying hens. Finally, it was investigated whether <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> would also be applicable under field conditions in commercial egg production. Apart from nutritional factors, management techniques were also investigated under commercial conditions, such as the effect of an adjusted light stimulation program to achieve a more optimal development of the young pullet during rearing and pre-lay which can contribute to a longer productive laying period. Results of the field study showed that egg quality decreased in the last phase of the production cycle and shell quality became more heterogeneous. However, at end of lay, when flocks were depopulated, shell quality was still acceptable according to table egg standards, as flocks were replaced before decreasing shell quality could cause economic losses. In the concept of a <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> system hens are fed two nutritionally contrasting diets during the day. In contrast, in conventional layer nutrition, hens are fed one single diet during the day. Offering different nutrients at the moment when these are required during the daily egg formation cycle in the <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> system might improve feed efficiency, Ca utilization and possibly shell quality. In the small-scale experiments besides testing different nutrient levels in the first and second half of the day, the effect of the particle size of the Ca source (fine and coarse limestone, FL and CL, respectively) in the diet was also assessed. For brown aged laying hens (72 - 83 wk) significantly lower feed intake and a considerably lower cracked eggs percentage was found when hens were fed a morning diet without added Ca source (0 FL: 0 CL) combined with an afternoon diet with reduced levels of energy, protein and P but increased Ca level with 30 FL: 70 CL compared to a conventional diet offering the same nutrients. Despite the reduced % of cracked eggs with the <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> system, shell thickness could not be improved. For white aged laying hens (75 - 92 wk) the same approach in <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> resulted in increased egg weight but no improvement in shell quality. For white hens providing the same amount of Ca, but only as fine limestone (50 FL) {{in the first half and}} as coarse limestone (50 CL) in the second half of the day, proved to be the most beneficial diet in the <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> system. Following the small-scale trials, it was investigated whether <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> would also be applicable under field conditions in commercial egg production. For this, white laying hens were placed in enriched cages and brown laying hens were placed both in enriched cages and aviaries. The results of the large scale experiments in enriched cages suggest that for optimal performance and egg quality white and brown hybrids might require a different nutritional strategy with regard to the amount of Ca source and its particle size in the diet fed in the first and second half of the day. For brown hens varying Ca levels throughout the day in the <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> system proved to be beneficial in reducing the percentage of cracked eggs, whereas for white hens the best strategy to maintain egg production and quality was the supply of constant Ca levels throughout the day, but in the form of 50 FL in the first half and as 50 CL in the second half of the day. However, differences between the effects of split vs conventional dietary treatments on eggshell quality were limited. The results of the large scale experiments in enriched cages highlighted that <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> could improve feed efficiency in aged flocks. In the aviary system however, the practical application of <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> was more challenging and neither performance nor egg quality could be improved. The benefits of a delayed onset of lay could not be proven with the adjusted lighting program during rearing and the onset of lay compared to a standard program. However, the applied programs were very similar and therefore the intended delay in sexual maturation could not be achieved. Therefore, this study could not confirm that hens raised on a delayed lighting program are more suitable for an extended production cycle. Based on the observations during the field study and the results of the experimental work conducted during this PhD, it can be concluded that there is a potential in commercial layer hybrids for extended production cycles until 100 wk of age and the goal of producing 500 eggs appears to be feasible in 2017. However, results also showed that there are considerable differences between layer hybrids: white hens are more suitable for longer production cycles compared to brown hybrids (in enriched cages as well as in aviary systems). The <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> concept proved to have potential for aged laying hens, but its successful application requires thorough knowledge of the feeding equipment installed on the farm. Although Ca supplementation is the most important nutritional factor influencing eggshell quality, additional factors related to intestinal health also need to be considered. Maintaining gut health and the integrity of the intestinal segments, with special attention to the duodenum – the main site of Ca and P absorption – is a pre-requisite for good shell quality during a productive extended laying cycle. To successfully extend the laying cycle an overall strategy is needed including optimized nutrition with the focus on improving shell quality, and various management practices with the focus on tackling specific health and welfare problems (such as bone integrity, gut health, feather pecking) arising in different hybrids kept in different housing systems. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImplementation of amine-based CO 2 {{capture and}} {{compression}} systems on {{coal-fired power plants}} {{would lead to a}} significant loss on power plant efficiency. This energy penalty can be reduced using new solvents and/or modifications of the process flowsheet. As the complexity of the flowsheet increases, more parameters have to be considered and classic parametric analysis is no longer sufficient. The aim of this work is therefore to develop a systematic and rigorous method able to automatically assess the minimum energy consumption of a given process. Such an approach is based on a thorough phenomenological model, using a rigorous thermodynamic framework (extended UNIQUAC) and considering chemically enhanced heat and mass transfer. Afterwards, a reduced but representative model is obtained in order to save computational effort and ensure robustness during process simulations. Finally, the optimization problem is solved in order to evaluate the process energy minimum. This method has been validated on two flow schemes operating with MEA, the conventional process and a <b>split</b> <b>feed</b> stripper, leading to energy penalties of respectively 383 and 361 kWh/tCO 2.

Treatments consisted of feeding concentrate (16 % CP, 68 % TDN) in the morning (am; n = 19), afternoon (pm; n = 19) or split between the morning and afternoon (am to pm); n = 18) at 4 % of BW/(lambAday). In a second study lactating St. Croix White and Dorper x St., Croix White ewes grazing guinea grass pastures were assigned to treatments (n = 16 /treatment) based on breed, age and number of lambs. Treatments consisted of individually feeding ewes 0. 9 kg concentrate (16 % CP, 68 % TDN) in the morning (am) or afternoon (pm), 0. 45 kg in the morning and afternoon (am to pm) or no feed (Control) beginning on day 7 (lambing = day 0). On day 21, 24 h milk production was measured. A sterile ram with a marking harness was used to detect estrus. The am and pm lambs gained less (p - 1, respectively). The am to pm ewes consumed a higher (p 0. 10). Weight loss by control ewes was greater (p 0. 10). A <b>split</b> <b>feeding</b> regimen increased feed consumption and decreased post-partum weight loss but did not increase litter weaning weight or milk production of hair sheep ewes.

Tibia ash content was higher in the S system compared to the C system (P = 0. 005); tibia breaking strength, however, did not differ between feeding systems.

40|$|A Passive Optical Network (PON) is a single, {{collective}} {{optical fiber}} that used low-cost optical splitters {{to divide the}} single fiber into <b>split</b> strands <b>feed</b> individual subscribers. PON’S are called passive because, other than at the CO (Central Office) and subscriber endpoints, there are no active electronics inside the access network. With the development of services offered by the Internet, the “last mile” restricted access problems keep it up to increase step by step. Many algorithms were developed for making TDM EPON efficient similar to Scheduling (No class Solution) and Priority Swapping, IPACT etr. These all algorithms have problems like delay, QoS and channel under- utilization. We focused the wellorganized bandwidth utilization in TDM EPON by managing time slots within ONUs and reducing latency and increasing quality of service. Our Rahul Fixed Priority Enhance Classes Bandwidth (RFPECB) algorithm is an intra-ONU bandwidth allocation algorithm, {{which is used to}} enhance the network performance by evaluating the parameters like channel underutilization, delay and Quality of Service. The issues which are lacking in the already made algorithms are being resolved with our RFPECB Algorithm. The main problem time slots management issue solved in RFPECB algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Artemisinin, a {{secondary}} metabolite of sweet wormwood, {{is the basis}} for the production of the most effective antimalarial drugs. Since the amount of artemisinin currently produced from plants is not sufficient to treat the worldwide malaria cases, an effective semisynthetic method was developed recently that is capable of producing artemisinin from dihydroartemisinic acid (DHAA). DHAA is a byproduct obtained during the extraction of artemisinin from plant leaves. The photocatalytic reaction to convert DHAA to artemisinin can be performed continuously in a tubular reactor using toluene as a solvent. The reactor effluent contains besides artemisinin the photocatalyst (dicyanoanthracene) and several compounds that are structurally similar to artemisinin, including unreacted DHAA starting material. To isolate artemisinin from the reaction mixture, two separation techniques were applied, crystallization and chromatography. The solid obtained by seeded cooling crystallization was highly enriched in artemisinin but contained also traces of the photocatalyst. In contrast, using a variant of continuously operated multicolumn simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography, which <b>splits</b> the <b>feed</b> into three fractions, we were able to recover efficiently the photocatalyst in the raffinate stream. The extract stream provided already almost pure artemisinin, which could be finally further purified in a simple crystallization step...|$|R
40|$|Continuous countercurrent or {{simulated}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) chromatography is a well-established separation technology. Conventional processes {{are based on}} four zones which fulfil distinct functions in order to <b>split</b> a <b>feed</b> into two fractions. Frequently there is an interest in isolating a target component out of a feed mixture containing more than two components. Modifications of the classical SMB process are required to solve this task. In the last years several concepts exploiting more than four zones have been suggested. To analyse these concepts the equilibrium theory has been frequently applied, neglecting all kinetic effects. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to apply an equilibrium stage model in order to describe the performance of a combination of two or three 4 -zone true moving bed units which are connected in series or integrated into 8 - or 12 -zone true moving bed units. The performance of such units is evaluated with respect to their potential to continuously separate ternary or quaternary mixtures. The analysis is based on the assumption of linear adsorption isotherms. An important aspect is the introduction of additional purge streams required for a successful operation of integrated 8 - and 12 -zone units. 2006 Elsevier Inc.
