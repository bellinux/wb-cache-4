In {{the case of a}} circularly polarized wave, as seen in the accompanying animation, the tip of the electric field vector, at a given point in space, describes a circle as time progresses. [...] At any instant of time, the electric field vector of the wave describes a helix along the direction of propagation. [...] A circularly polarized wave can be in one of two possible <b>states,</b> <b>right</b> circular polarization in which the electric field vector rotates in a right-hand sense with respect to the direction of propagation, and left circular polarization in which the vector rotates in a left-hand sense.|$|E
