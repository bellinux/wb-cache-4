25|$|Jawless {{fish were}} the {{earliest}} fish to evolve. There is current {{debate over whether}} these are really fish at all. They have no jaw, no scales, no paired fins, and no bony skeleton. Their skin is <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> to the touch, {{and they are very}} flexible. Instead of a jaw, they possess an oral sucker. They use this to fasten onto other fish, and then use their rasp-like teeth to grind through their host's skin into the viscera. Jawless fish inhabit both fresh and salt water environments. Some are anadromous, moving between both fresh and salt water habitats.|$|E
500|$|When the Æsir exclaimed {{that they}} were ready, Fenrir shook himself, knocked the fetter to the ground, {{strained}} hard, and kicking with his feet, snapped the fetter – breaking it into pieces that flew far into the distance. High says that, as a result, to [...] "loose from Leyding" [...] or to [...] "strike out of Dromi" [...] have become sayings for when something is achieved with great effort. The Æsir started to fear {{that they would not}} be able to bind Fenrir, and so Odin sent Freyr's messenger Skírnir down into the land of Svartálfaheimr to [...] "some dwarfs" [...] and had them make a fetter called Gleipnir. The dwarves constructed Gleipnir from six mythical ingredients. After an exchange between Gangleri and High, High continues that the fetter was <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> as a silken ribbon, yet strong and firm. The messenger brought the ribbon to the Æsir, and they thanked him heartily for completing the task.|$|E
500|$|The pelvic fins are {{distinct}} from the disc and have rounded outer margins. The short and thick tail bears skin folds along either side and two dorsal fins on top. The first dorsal fin is slightly larger than the second. The well-developed caudal fin is triangular with blunt corners, and is approximately {{as long as the}} space between it and first dorsal fin. The skin is <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft,</b> entirely lacking dermal denticles. The dorsal coloration of the common torpedo is light to dark brown, with distinctive large spots ("ocellae") on the disc; each ocellus is blue and encircled by darker and lighter rings. Typically there are five ocellae arranged symmetrically in a row of three and another of two; rays with 0–4 ocellae are less common, and those with more than five are rarer still. An unusual male with eight ocellae was caught off Tunisia, and another with nine off southern France. When present, the sixth ocellus is similarly sized to the first five and positioned at their center; any additional ocellae tend to be smaller than the first six and placed asymmetrically towards the snout. The underside is cream-colored, with dark disc margins. An adult albino female was captured off Tunisia. Males and females typically measure [...] long respectively; the largest individual on record was [...] long. Rays from off West Africa grow larger than those from the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|According to radioandmusic.com, 'Demon King' is a {{story that}} is told via the tracks, each one being a {{separate}} chapter in the album. Sahil 'Demonstealer' Makhija says the new album is different from the band's previous ones and has a lot to offer to all kinds of metalheads, from <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>softer</b> tracks like 'Facing the Faceless' to extremely aggressive tracks like 'Death, Desolation and Despair'.|$|R
30|$|Another more {{plausible}} possibility is that, regardless of being or not mercerized, the denim fabric has received in tertiary or late stage of processing, a cellulase enzyme treatment, which provided a controlled hydrolysis or {{change of the}} structure of cellulose molecules - the main cotton constituent component (Basra and Malik 1984). Cellulases are able to make cotton fabrics <b>smoother</b> <b>and</b> <b>softer,</b> degrading the surface fibers (loose fibers and microfibrils), conferring also a stone washed appearance (or the aspect of “wear after washings”) in jeans (Ferrante 2011; Wadaa et al. 2010).|$|R

50|$|True is Mika Nakashima's first Japanese album.

50|$|In {{its early}} years of existence, the smooth jazz format was {{considered}} to be a form of AC, although it was mainly instrumental, and related a stronger resemblance to the soft AC-styled music.

60|$|Descending {{from the}} tree I hastily {{collected}} what remained of my provisions and set off as fast as I could go towards it. As I drew near {{it seemed to me}} to be a white ball of immense size and height, and when I could touch it, I found it marvellously <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft.</b> As it was impossible to climb it--for it presented no foot-hold--I walked round about it seeking some opening, but there was none. I counted, however, that it was at least fifty paces round. By this time the sun was near setting, but quite suddenly it fell dark, something like a huge black cloud came swiftly over me, and I saw with amazement that it was a bird of extraordinary size which was hovering near. Then I remembered that I had often heard the sailors speak of a wonderful bird called a roc, and it occurred to me that the white object which had so puzzled me must be its egg.|$|E

60|$|Yet, even {{in their}} low condition, there were good points about those islanders. Cook says that they were {{as large as the}} largest-sized Europeans. The men were tall, strong, well-limbed, and finely shaped. The tallest he saw, on a {{neighbouring}} island, was a man who measured six feet three inches and a half. The women of the superior rank were above our middle stature, but those of the inferior class rather below it. Their complexion was a kind of clear olive or brunette, and the skin of the women was <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft.</b> They had no colour in their cheeks, but their faces were comely; the cheekbones were not high, neither were the eyes hollow. Their eyes were sparkling and full of expression, and their teeth good, but their noses being flat did not correspond with his ideas of beauty. Their hair was black and coarse. The men had beards, which they wore in many fashions, always, however, plucking out great part of them, and keeping the rest perfectly clean and neat.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George {{accepted}} this offer, {{and the young}} soldier accordingly walked with them all about. He pointed out all the different buildings, and mentioned the dates of the erection of them, and referred to the most important historical events that had transpired in them. Finally he led the party through a gate into a small garden, and thence out upon the rampart wall, from which {{there was a very}} extended and extraordinarily beautiful view of the surrounding country.[E] To the north-west were seen the Highlands, with the peaks of Ben Lomond, Ben Venue, and Benan, rising conspicuously among them. On the east were other hills, rising abruptly out of the smooth and smiling plain, and covered with dark plantations of evergreen. All around the foot of the castle, and extending to the distance, in some directions, of many miles, the country was level and fertile, and it presented every where the most enchanting pictures of rural beauty. Some of the fields were of the richest green, others were brown from fresh tillage, with men ploughing or harrowing in them, or plants just springing up in long green rows, which, partly on account of the distance, and partly through the exquisite neatness and nicety of farmers' work, looked so <b>smooth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft,</b> and fine, that the scene appeared more like enchantment than reality.|$|E
60|$|And so spring grew to summer. And {{then one}} evening {{a great thing}} happened. He {{could not make out}} at first what it was about her: some little added {{fragrance}} that made itself oddly felt, while she herself seemed to be conscious of increased dignity. It was not until he took her hand to say good-bye that he discovered it. There was something different about the feel of her, and, looking down at the little hand that lay in his, he found the reason. She had on a pair of new gloves. They were still of the same fawn colour, but so <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> and cool. They fitted closely without a wrinkle, displaying the slightness and the gracefulness of the hands beneath. The twilight had almost faded, and, save for the broad back of a disappearing policeman, they had the Outer Circle to themselves; and, the sudden impulse coming to him, he dropped on one knee, as they do in plays and story books and sometimes elsewhere, and pressed the little fawn gloves to his lips in a long, passionate kiss. The sound of approaching footsteps made him rise hurriedly. She did not move, but her whole body was trembling, and in her eyes was a look that was almost of fear. The approaching footsteps came nearer, but a bend of the road still screened them. Swiftly and in silence she put her arms about his neck and kissed him. It was a strange, cold kiss, but almost fierce, and then without a word she turned and walked away; and he watched her to the corner of Hanover Gate, but she did not look back.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{markedly}} different in style {{from the past}} few hits, with less emphasis on synthesizers, instead on [...] "light slices of guitar, <b>smooth</b> keyboard pads <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> percussion".

60|$|From {{the rest}} of these, however, I must except the {{beauteous}} nymph Fayaway, who was my peculiar favourite. Her free pliant figure was the very perfection of female grace and beauty. Her complexion was a rich and mantling olive, and when watching the glow upon her cheeks I could almost swear that beneath the transparent medium there lurked the blushes of a faint vermilion. The face of this girl was a rounded oval, and each feature as perfectly formed as the heart or imagination of man could desire. Her full lips, when parted with a smile, disclosed teeth of a dazzling whiteness; and when her rosy mouth opened with a burst of merriment, they looked like the milk-white seeds of the “arta,” a fruit of the valley, which, when cleft in twain, shows them reposing in rows on either side, embedded in the red and juicy pulp. Her hair of the deepest brown, parted irregularly in the middle, flowed in natural ringlets over her shoulders, and whenever she chanced to stoop, fell over and hid from view her lovely bosom. Gazing {{into the depths of}} her strange blue eyes, when she was in a contemplative mood, they seemed most placid yet unfathomable; but when illuminated by some lively emotion, they beamed upon the beholder like stars. The hands of Fayaway were as soft and delicate as those of any countess; for an entire exemption from rude labour marks the girlhood and even prime of a Typee woman’s life. Her feet, though wholly exposed, were as diminutive and fairly shaped as those which peep from beneath the skirts of a Lima lady’s dress. The skin of this young creature, from continual ablutions and the use of mollifying ointments, was inconceivably <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As a child those dreadful deeds did not impress me, since I did not witness them myself, {{and after}} looking at that stain {{of blood on the}} grass the subject faded out of my mind. But as time went on and I heard more about this painful subject I began to realize what it meant. The full horror of it came only a few years later, when I was big enough to go about to the native houses and among the gauchos in their gatherings, at cattle-partings and brandings, races, and on other occasions. I listened to the {{conversation}} of groups of men whose lives had been mostly spent in the army, as a rule in guerilla warfare, and the talk turned with surprising frequency to the subject of cutting throats. Not to waste powder on prisoners was an unwritten law of the Argentine army at that period, and the veteran gaucho clever with the knife took delight in obeying it. It always came as a relief, I heard them say, to have as victim {{a young man with a}} good neck after an experience of tough, scraggy old throats: with a person of that sort they were in no hurry to finish the business; it was performed in a leisurely, loving way. Darwin, writing in praise of the gaucho in his Voyage of a Naturalist, says that if a gaucho cuts your throat he does it like a gentleman: even as a small boy I knew better--that he did his business rather like a hellish creature revelling in his cruelty. He would listen to all his captive could say to soften his heart--all his heartrending prayers and pleadings; and would reply: [...] "Ah, friend,"--or little friend, or brother--"your words pierce me to the heart and I would gladly spare you for the sake of that poor mother of yours who fed you with her milk, and for your own sake too, since in this short time I have conceived a great friendship towards you; but your beautiful neck is your undoing, for how could I possibly deny myself the pleasure of cutting such a throat--so shapely, so <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft</b> and so white! Think of the sight of warm red blood gushing from that white column!" [...] And so on, with wavings of the steel blade before the captive's eyes, until the end.|$|E
6000|$|... § 48. On {{a sudden}} it was; for, even yet a youth, and {{retaining}} profound respect for all older artist's ways of work, he followed his own will fearlessly in choice of scene; and already in the earliest of his coast drawings there are as daring and strange decisions touching {{the site of the}} spectator as in his latest works; lookings down and up into coves and clouds, as defiant of all former theories touching possible perspective, or graceful componence of subject, as, a few years later, his system of color was of the theory of the brown tree. Nor was the step remarkable merely for its magnitude,--for the amount of progress made in a few years. It was much more notable by its direction. The discovery of the true structure of hill banks had to be made by Turner, not merely in advance of the men of his day, but in contradiction to them. Examine the works of contemporary and preceding landscapists, and it will be found that the universal practice is to make the tops of all cliffs broken and rugged, their bases <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> <b>soft,</b> or concealed with wood. No one had ever observed the contrary structure, the bank rounded at the top, and broken on the flank. And yet all the hills of any importance which are met with throughout Lowland Europe are, properly speaking, high banks, for the most part following the courses of rivers, and forming a step from the high ground, of which the country generally consists, to the river level. Thus almost the whole of France, though, on the face of it, flat, is raised from 300 to 500 feet above the level of the sea, and is traversed by valleys either formed by, or directing, the course of its great rivers. In these valleys lie all its principal towns, surrounded, almost without exception, by ranges of hills covered with wood or vineyard. Ascending these hills, we find ourselves at once in an elevated plain, covered with corn and lines of apple trees, extending to the next river side, where we come to the brow of another hill, and descend to the city and valley beneath it. Our own valleys in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Devonshire, are cut in the same manner through vast extents of elevated land; the scenery which interests the traveller chiefly, as he passes through even the most broken parts of those counties, being simply that of the high banks which rise from the shores of the Dart or the Derwent, the Wharfe or the Tees. In all cases, when these banks are surmounted, the sensation is one of disappointment, as the adventurer finds himself, the moment he has left the edge of the ravine, in a waste of softly undulating moor or arable land, hardly deserving the title of hill country. As we advance into the upper districts the fact remains still the same, although the banks to be climbed are higher, the ravines grander, and the intermediate land more broken. The majesty of an isolated peak is still comparatively rare, and nearly all the most interesting pieces of scenery are glens or passes, which, if seen from a height great enough to command them in all their relations, would be found in reality little more than trenches excavated through broad masses of elevated land, and expanding at intervals into the wide basins which are occupied by the glittering lake or smiling plain.|$|E
