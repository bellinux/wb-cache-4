Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for Export-Import Bank short-term financing insurance for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated.

40|$|This thesis puts forward two {{principal}} arguments. First, it argues that commercial letters of <b>credit</b> and <b>standby</b> letters of <b>credit</b> {{should not be}} treated on an equal footing. They are, and should be, treated as two separate undertakings {{with respect to the}} application of the fraud exception. Secondly, the thesis argues {{that there should be a}} 'wider' fraud exception for standby letters of credit; however, the need is to explore how wide that fraud exception should be. To support the arguments of this thesis, the study examines the application of the fraud exception in four major jurisdictions: the US, England, Canada and Australia. Out of these four jurisdictions, two - the US and Canada - have been expressly applying the wider fraud test to <b>standby</b> letters of <b>credit</b> and the other two have traditionally applied the more stringent fraud test to <b>standby</b> <b>credits.</b> The research will compare and critically examine these four jurisdictions' approaches to their different tests of the fraud rule to <b>standby</b> letters of <b>credit,</b> and argue that the fraud rule for <b>standby</b> letters of <b>credit</b> should neither be too narrow ('fraud in documents') nor should it be too wide (fraud in the inducement or unconscionable conduct or bad faith). It is argued that <b>standby</b> letters of <b>credit</b> are more abstract than commercial letters of credit; therefore, protecting the principle of the autonomy of these independent undertakings is of paramount importance. The study argues that even the wider fraud exception (the 'fraud in the transaction' defence) should be given a narrow meaning: in order to protect the independence of <b>standby</b> <b>credits,</b> it should be confined to cases in which the beneficiary had 'no bona fide belief in the validity of its claim. The thesis clearly shows that the wider 'fraud as no bona fide claim' is an appropriate fraud defence for <b>standby</b> letters of <b>credit</b> whereas for commercial letters of credit the fraud exception should be narrowly confined to 'fraud in documents', which is arguably an appropriate test for these undertakings.

50|$|Liquidity {{is a prime}} {{concern in}} a banking {{environment}} and a shortage of liquidity has often been a trigger for bank failures. Holding assets in a highly liquid form tends to reduce the income from that asset (cash, for example, is the most liquid asset of all but pays no interest) so banks will try to reduce liquid assets as far as possible. However, a bank without sufficient liquidity {{to meet the demands}} of their depositors risks experiencing a bank run. The result is that most banks now try to forecast their liquidity requirements and maintain emergency <b>standby</b> <b>credit</b> lines at other banks. Banking regulators also view liquidity as a major concern.|$|E
50|$|During 1966-1969, then {{president}} Marcos borrowed {{a great amount}} of money to finance his domestic expansion and reforms. This expansion in the government budget led to increases in the current account deficit and crisis in the balance of payments (BOP). According to the Political Economy of Growth and Impoverishment in the Marcos Era, the Philippines' foreign debt rose from $360 million in 1962 to $26.2 billion by the end of 1985. Hence, just over a third of today's $77 billion external debt was contributed by the 20-year rule of the Marcos government. During the early 1970s, the government aimed at reviving growth and establishing an economic stabilization plan as well as a <b>standby</b> <b>credit</b> arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

This is in line with the institution's goal of achieving and supporting economic stability. These <b>standby</b> <b>credit</b> lines started during a time of significant economic growth (5% year-over-year), but also at a time of heavy dollarization (alignment with/dependency on the U.S. Dollar).

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{canvassing}} {{the principal}} potential problems in advising upon letters of credit, this article considers the following topics: (i) the documents of a typical credit transaction; (ii) the doctrine of autonomy; (iii) the doctrine of strict compliance and incidence of non-complying documents; (iv) the documents used to check letter of credit terms; (v) the types of fraud; and (vi) the level of burden of proof required in establishing fraud. In particular, this article by looking at case law raises three questions. First, is the doctrine of strict compliance effective when in a majority of transactions the documents tendered are discrepant due to actual fraud and mere fraud? Secondly, what is the appropriate degree of burden of proof used by the courts to justify non-payment for <b>standby</b> <b>credits</b> given the case of perpetrating fraud there under? And lastly, what has caused {{the demise of the}} traditional bill of Lading to a more electronic mode of negotiability?...|$|R

40|$|The Letter {{of credit}} {{as a method}} of {{smoothing}} international payment is a conditional security and obligation to pay the customer bank (issuing bank) to seller (applicant). For this purpose, the letters of credit may be considered as the most usual method of payment of goods price in international trade. The classic form of letters of credit is the commercial letters of credit whose financial obligation is rooted in the documents that demonstrates the making of transaction by the beneficiary and it is used as a mechanism of payment and financial security in international transaction of goods. Contrary to commercial letter of credit which is a payment document, <b>standby</b> letter of <b>credit</b> has been taken into account for protection of beneficiary in case of default of payment to perform obligation or payment. <b>Standby</b> letters of <b>credit</b> are equal to bank guarantee and issued as performance and obligation security and in the form of letter of credit.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{expanded}} the commercial bank certification hypothesis to include banks acting in an underwriting capacity. This paper further develops that research {{by focusing on}} the industrial revenue bond market in which banks have the unique opportunity to simultaneously act as both credit guarantor and underwriter. When explicitly allowing for bankissued <b>standby</b> letters of <b>credit</b> (guarantees), we find significantly greater yield spreads for those bonds underwritten by commercial banks compared to bonds underwritten by investment banks. Overall, no net benefit appears to accrue to the bond issuer when attempting to achieve joint (or double) certification benefits by employing commercial banks as both credit guarantor and underwriters except in the special case where the same bank acts as both guarantor and underwriter. This latter result is consistent with an "economy of scope" in monitoring and reusing information. ...|$|R

Systems are limited to from 0.5 kW to 50 kW. Payment is for 10 years. Payments are in the form of monthly credits to the consumers regular monthly bill and are paid monthly or annually at TVA's choice. Payments are for 10 years, and payment at retail can be extended for an additional 10 years. A standard offer program is available for systems from 50 kW to 1 MW, which pays from 4 to 6 cents/kWh above retail for the first 10 years. Net metering is available, but residential customers with from 10 to 20 kW arrays could pay a monthly [...] "standby charge" [...] of up to $60/month. As of December 2, 2011, only one customer in Virginia was a residential customer with an array of that size.
