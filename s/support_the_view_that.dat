5|$|As some archaeological records <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> the Egyptian {{state was}} divided during Peribsen's reign, there is {{continued}} debate {{as to why}} his predecessors decided to divide the realm, and whether Peribsen ruled part or all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Other scholars, however, {{argue that}} {{hereditary}} illegitimacy is not listed among the indiscretions of the Wicked Priest, {{and that this}} interpretation has been foisted upon the text by decades of questionable interpretation.

5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E

5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only found at the {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{test results}} <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{congenital}} amusia is hereditary. It {{is likely to}} be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development. However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched. This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{recent studies}} (above and Rohde 2005a,b) <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> niche space is largely unsaturated, i.e. that {{numerous}} vacant niches exist. As a consequence, competition between species {{is not as}} important as usually assumed. Nonequilibria are caused not only by environmental disturbances, but are widespread because of nonsaturation of niche space. Newly evolved species are absorbed into empty niche space, that is, niches occupied by existing species do not necessarily have to shrink.|$|E

25|$|Settlement {{patterns}} {{as well as}} village {{plans in}} England fall into two great categories: scattered farms and homesteads in upland and woodland Britain, nucleated villages across a swathe of central England. The chronology of nucleated villages is much debated and not yet clear.

25|$|According to Manetho, {{the first}} pharaoh was Menes, but archeological {{findings}} <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> the first ruler to {{claim to have}} united the two lands was Narmer, the final king of the Naqada III period. His name is known primarily from the famous Narmer Palette, whose scenes have been interpreted as the act of uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. Menes is now thought {{to be one of}} the titles of Hor-Aha, the second pharaoh of the First Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Easterly and Levine further {{observe that}} studies {{of how the}} {{environment}} directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, {{but that does not}} mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development. They find that regression results support the findings of Jared Diamond and David Landes that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.|$|E

25|$|Many {{religious}} and philosophical traditions <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{the soul is}} the ethereal substance – a spirit; a non material spark – particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, {{as well as the}} true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{about whether or not}} Ibn al-Nafis participated in {{dissection}} to come to his conclusions about pulmonary circulation. Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to his conclusions. According to one view, his knowledge about the human heart could have been derived from surgical operations rather than dissection. Other comments found in al-Nafis’s writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> he practiced dissection in order to come to his conclusions about the human heart and pulmonary circulation. Ibn al-Nafis’s comments to the contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity {{announced}} that they found no evidence which would indicate Männil had participated in war crimes. However, the investigators discovered that seven Jews Männil interrogated were later executed. In March 2001, Kaitsepolitsei started investigating Männil's wartime activities at Efraim Zuroff's request. After a nearly five-year-long investigation, they {{concluded that there was}} no evidence that Männil had participated in war crimes. The state prosecutor, Margus Kurm, said that there are no documents or witnesses to prove Männil had participated in executions, arrests, or repressions. Regarding those individuals whom Männil had interrogated, Kurm said that there is no evidence that Männil was aware of the detainees being destined for repression or execution. Several aspects <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> Männil was unaware of such possibilities: The interrogations in question took place on September 4 and 5, at which time the Wehrmacht had been in Tallinn for only six days.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} when the game of Liubo originated, {{although}} according to legend it was invented by Wu Cao (烏曹, called Wu Zhou 烏胄 in the early 2nd century CE Shuowen Jiezi dictionary), a minister to King Jie, the last king of the Xia Dynasty, who according to traditional chronology reigned 1728–1675 BCE. While there is no archeological or reliable documentary evidence to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> Liubo {{dates back to the}} Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BCE), early Chinese records do indicate that Liubo was already a popular game by the Warring States period (476–221 BCE). For example, the Records of the Grand Historian records a speech made during the reign of King Xuan of Qi (reigned 319–301 BCE) that claims that the capital city of Linzi was so wealthy that its citizens were all able to indulge in activities such as playing musical instruments, cockfighting, dog racing, playing Liubo and playing kick ball.|$|E
500|$|Chapter VIII {{addresses}} {{the idea that}} species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile {{in order to preserve}} separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: [...] "Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view,</b> <b>that</b> there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties." ...|$|E
500|$|The ramparts {{were the}} strongest {{part of the}} fort, with the entrances the weakest. The complex {{gateways}} <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> the site was militaristic; the long, curving east entrance maximised the time {{it would have taken}} for attackers to enter the fort and would have allowed defenders on the ramparts more time to hurl missiles, while the southwest entrance narrowed forcing attackers together and causing disarray. Iron Age society was, in Cunliffe's view, [...] "effervescent... essentially unstable, and prone to conflict", and he uses the possible military nature of hill forts to support this view. The burning of the gates was probably the result of an attack, and the charnel pits dating {{from the end of the}} intense period of Danebury's occupation contain about 100bodies, many with injuries that appear to have been inflicted by weapons such as spears and swords.|$|E
