5000|$|There was a vogue of half-frame {{cameras in}} the 1960s, mainly from Japan, {{originating}} with the Olympus Pen models. It allowed for a very compact camera, using commonly available film, unlike other <b>subminiatures</b> that used exotic films (16mm, 9.5mm, etc.).This vogue ended when cameras like the Rollei 35 or the Olympus XA showed {{that it was possible}} to make cameras as small as the half-frame ones, but taking 24&times;36 mm exposures.|$|R
25|$|From 1936 to 1975 {{the history}} of the Minox brand is {{essentially}} that of the Minox <b>subminiature</b> camera. From 1975 the Minox name also became associated with other products, most notably the Minox 35mm compact cameras produced from 1975 until 2004.|$|E
25|$|At photokina in 2008 Minox {{announced}} a new <b>subminiature</b> digital camera called the DSC, (Digital Spy Camera) with a 3 megapixel sensor that outputs 5 megapixel interpolated images. It includes some design cues of the Minox LX but otherwise does not resemble the original cameras.|$|E
25|$|The Minox <b>subminiature</b> camera {{attracted}} the attention of intelligence agencies in America, Britain and Germany, and most of the Eastern Bloc (East Germany, Romania) due to its small size and macro focusing ability. There is at least one document in the public record of 25 Minox cameras purchased by the US Office of Strategic Services intelligence organisation in 1942.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. <b>Subminiature</b> tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Shure {{introduced}} the Vagabond 88 wireless microphone system. Operating within a copper wire circle either {{suspended from the}} ceiling or laid on the floor, the system could transmit within an area of approximately 700 square feet. The system consisted of a low-frequency FM radio transmitter and microphone, utilized five <b>subminiature</b> vacuum tubes, and was powered by two hearing aid batteries. The Vagabond system was expensive and somewhat fragile, but was adopted for use by several Las Vegas venues of the time. Not until 1990 did Shure re-enter the wireless microphone market {{with the introduction of}} the L Series.|$|E
25|$|The {{first product}} {{to carry the}} Minox name was a <b>subminiature</b> camera, {{conceived}} in 1922, and finally invented and produced in 1936, by Baltic German Walter Zapp. The Latvian factory VEF (Valsts elektrotehniskā fabrika) manufactured the camera from 1937 to 1943. After World War II, the camera was redesigned and production resumed in Germany in 1948. Walter Zapp originally envisioned the Minox to be a camera for everyone requiring only little photographic knowledge. Yet {{in part due to}} its high manufacturing costs the Minox became more well known as a must-have luxury item. From the start the Minox also gained wide notoriety as a spy camera.|$|E
25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a temperature-controlled kiln or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like <b>subminiature</b> vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and <b>subminiature</b> vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Minox <b>subminiature</b> {{camera was}} invented by Walter Zapp in 1936. Zapp, a Baltic German, was born in 1905 in Riga, then part of the Russian Empire. The family moved to Reval (now called Tallinn, Estonia) where he first {{took a job as}} an engraver before finding a position with a photographer. He became friends with Nikolai 'Nixi' Nylander and Richard Jürgens, and it was through discussions with these friends that the idea of a camera that could always be carried came to him. Nixi Nylander also coined the name [...] "Minox" [...] and drew up the Minox mouse logo. Jürgens funded the original project but was not able to get support in Estonia for production. Jürgens contacted an English representative of the VEF (Valsts Elektrotehniskā Fabrika) electrotechnical manufacturing business in Riga (by then independent Latvia) who then arranged a meeting where Zapp demonstrated the Minox prototype (UrMinox), with a set of enlargements made from Ur-Minox negatives. Production began in Riga at VEF, running from 1937 until 1943. In the same time, VEF had received patent protection on Zapp's inventions in at least 18 countries worldwide.|$|E

50|$|First {{making an}} {{appearance}} in the late 19th century, often as concealed cameras, <b>subminiature</b> cameras became popular soon after WWII when many consumer markets required small, inexpensive cameras. Friedrich Kaftansky's Mini-flex was designed in 1931, {{on the market in}} 1933. Walter Zapp's Riga Minox appeared in 1938. Kodak's introduction of the 110 camera in the 1970s and the Kodak disc camera in the 1980s brought the <b>subminiature</b> camera to the forefront of the photographic market. The many cheap, poorly made cameras that soon appeared drove Kodak out of the market.Various formats of <b>subminiature</b> camera have come and gone over the years as newer formats have replaced older one. In addition, many larger format cameras, especially 35 mm, become smaller in size and weight—partly due to the consumer demand for <b>subminiature</b> cameras—and were able to replace some <b>subminiature</b> formats. For example, full-frame 35 mm cameras, such as the Minox 35 and the Olympus XA, were made as small as earlier half-frame <b>subminiature</b> cameras such as the Olympus Pen, using moderate wide-angle fixed lenses to minimise lens barrel depth. Some <b>subminiature</b> formats, such as the Minox and 110 formats, continue in production. Most other <b>subminiature</b> cameras are still usable if film can be obtained, particularly if the photographer is prepared to do the processing.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>subminiature</b> cameras {{include a}} rangefinder, {{for example the}} Minox 110. These {{increase}} the size.Autofocus or through-the-lens focusing systems are not used on <b>subminiature</b> cameras {{to reduce the size}} requirements.|$|E
