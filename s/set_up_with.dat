There was not another contested election in Taunton for almost twenty years, {{and during that time}} the Taunton Market House Society was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the aim of preventing the bad blood of a contested election, and to spend money that would have otherwise been spent on campaigning on improving the town. Maxwell remained as one of Taunton's members of parliament until 1768.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty {{serving as}} a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> <b>with</b> the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.|$|E

A constitutional monarchy was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> George deferring to the legitimate authority of the elected officials, although {{he was aware of}} the corruption present in elections and the difficulty of ruling a mostly illiterate population. Between 1864 and 1910, there were 21 general elections and 70 different governments.|$|E
5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> <b>with</b> members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E
5|$|The UERL was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{an initial}} {{capitalisation}} of £5million (£ today). The company {{was backed by}} three merchant banks, Speyer Brothers in London, Speyer & Co. in New York and Old Colony Trust Company in Boston, each of which was to receive £250,000 from the capital raised. Almost 60 per cent of the initial share offering was bought in the United States, with a third sold in Britain and the rest mainly in the Netherlands. Further capital was soon needed for the construction works and additional share and bond issues followed. The UERL eventually raised a total of £18million (£ today).|$|E

The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{a center for}} living traditions of art, folk {{performing}} arts, and crafts <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the objective of preserving and promoting South India's heritage and culture.

Potters trained at the center are issued a certificate of their skills by the regional office of the Department of the Development Commissioner (Handicrafts). Classical dances such as Bharatnatyam, Mohiniyattam and Kuchipudi, and music concerts are regular events held in the large amphitheater. Each year, 15,000 school children visit the museum.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matić was {{suspended}} for the final, due to a two-match ban he received for pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015. Another central midfielder for the club, John Obi Mikel, missed the match through a knee injury. Due to Matić's absence, Kurt Zouma – usually a central defender – moved into defensive midfield, with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma's previous position. Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley: Petr Čech started in goal in place of Thibaut Courtois, César Azpilicueta at left-back instead of Filipe Luís, and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield {{at the expense of}} Juan Cuadrado and Oscar. Chelsea <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a three-man attack, with Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at three o’clock in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of {{reasonably}} flat land close to the harbour, separated by the large Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded the floodplain of the Water of Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. As with many of the city's other place names, both these names and that of the Water of Leith reflect the names of places in Edinburgh.|$|E
