40|$|<b>Sense</b> <b>and</b> Sensibility {{is one of}} Jane Austen's novels, {{which tells}} about how the main female characters, named Elinor <b>and</b> Marianne balance <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> {{sensibility}}. The story is about the two main female characters, Elinor uses her <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> Marianne uses her sensibility; and also how they balance <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> sensibility. The writer states how Elinor and Marianne balance their <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> sensibility in facing up their problems. The thesis writer conducts library research {{in order to get}} data about the novel and analyze the novel. The thesis writer uses literary approach, the theories of characterization, conflict and also concept of <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> sensibility to analyze how Elinor and Marianne balance their <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> sensibility. Through her analysis, the writer finds out how they use and also balance their <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> sensibility in facing up her problems. By defending Elinor's feeling toward Edward finally she marries a man that she loves. On the other hands, by forgetting Willoughby's secret marriage, Marianne tries to love Colonel Brandon and marry him. Finally, the thesis writer finds out that do not use only <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> sensibility in facing up the problem but they should balance between <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> sensibility...|$|R

5|$|In this {{conception}} of mind no strict distinction is {{made between the}} conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the five <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> sixth for perception of mental phenomena. The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (manovijñāna) and attention (āvartana), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.|$|E

5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E

40|$|Since {{unmanned}} aircraft {{do not have}} a human on board, they need to have a <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> avoid capability that provides an "equivalent level of safety" (ELOS) to manned aircraft.

40|$|Objective: This thesis {{focuses on}} the number <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> {{language}} skills of four and five year old children. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine whether there is a relation between number <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> language skills in four and five year old children. Method: A group of 58 students (boys N= 29, girls N= 29) in the first and second grade of kindergarten completed several digital number sense tasks. Also data about language skills was collected. Correlation analyses were used to examine the relation between number <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> language skills. ANOVA was used to examine interaction effects of age. Results: No significant correlations were found between number <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> language skills. The aspects counting and number naming display a marginal significant relation with language skills. Conclusion: Further examination of the relation between number <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> language skills is suggested. Further examination has to focus on the different aspects of number <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> the age of the students. It is expected that correlations between number <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> language skills in six and seven year old children will be found...|$|R
5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|Laozi is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} author of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history.

As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> desires.|$|E

5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between November 1993 and January 1994, {{the series}} introduces attorney Beck as a love interest for Brock. When Beck pursues {{a lawsuit against}} Scarmore Industries for employees poisoned by a sentient liquid-mercury virus, Venom is injured trying {{to protect her from}} the Juggernaut's kidnap attempt. The symbiote is submerged and infected with the sentient virus (which heals Brock), bonding with the pair and introducing a third mind into their relationship. The virus drives Brock insane (causing him to murder a cleaning lady), and he is physically transported to the realm of insanity to confront its avatars: Paranoia, Dusk and the Necromancer.

5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his <b>senses,</b> <b>and</b> enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaetí Blödhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E
