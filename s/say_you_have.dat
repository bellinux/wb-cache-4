500|$|One critic theorized, [...] "...ather than {{end this}} Brazil-ian sci-fi dystopia with the {{equivalent}} of that film's shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, {{just to see if}} the audience is paying attention." [...] Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, [...] "It's actually kind of a rush. They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> visions. That your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true."*Vest. pg. 135 While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned.|$|E
500|$|To reinvigorate the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the {{competition}} was expanded and rebranded as the UEFA Champions League in 1992. From the 1997–98 season, it was further expanded to include eight domestic league runners-up selected by a UEFA coefficient and preliminary spots the following season were awarded to the third placed team; in some leagues fourth from 2002–03. The expansion and constant growth of {{the competition}} led to {{the decline of the}} Cup Winners' Cup, abolished in 1999 and by which point instigated proposals for a European Super League. Arsène Wenger has, on numerous occasions predicted the latter, arguing the pressure of television companies will force it to happen: [...] "It's all about money. More games equal more money through TV revenue and I think the next few years will see not just two, but three or four teams from the top countries competing against each other. It's what television wants – big teams in big matches. That is why the Champions' League was introduced." [...] Although Arsenal qualified for a fifteenth successive season of Champions League football in May 2012, this coincided with the club not winning a domestic honour since 2005, which led to open criticism over the competition's present format. Wenger however has gone on to defend the club policy, stating a trophy for Arsenal is winning the Premier League or the Champions League; [...] "Would you like to finish tenth in the league but win the League Cup and <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> won a trophy? Certainly not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornwallis {{was serving}} under Field Marshall Haig {{when he played}} in a charity cricket match, taking a hat-trick. He was later invited by C. H. B. Marsham to play for Kent County Cricket Club against Sussex in the 1919 County Championship. Cornwallis, who had not played cricket since school, {{initially}} laughed off the invitation but was told by Haig to accept – being told it was [...] "one of those things {{you have got to}} <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done once, Cornie". He took a wicket in the match and went on to play several more times for Kent in 1919.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 {{prosecutors}} {{entered a}} motion to join the Samsoe charges {{with those of the}} four newly discovered victims. Alcala's attorneys contested it; as one of them explained, [...] "If you're a juror and you hear one murder case, {{you may be able to}} have reasonable doubt. But it's very hard to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> reasonable doubt on all five, especially when four of the five aren't alleged by eyewitnesses but are proven by DNA matches." [...] In 2006, the California Supreme Court ruled in the prosecution's favor, and in February 2010 Alcala stood trial on the five joined charges.|$|E
2500|$|No direct {{orders to}} commit atrocities by Milošević {{have ever been}} discovered, though little or no effort was made by Milošević to punish people deemed {{responsible}} for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladić who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladić was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> so much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if you have such influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark... I warned Mladić not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'" ...|$|E
