Shape features in a <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part</b> {{model can be}} associated with volume subtraction from base-sheet (e. g., piercing/blanking operation), deformation/modification of base-sheet or forming operation on base-sheet. The shape features in a <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part</b> model are classified as (i) Volumetric features and (ii) Deformation features. These features can also be classified as ‘ 2 -dimensional (2 D) features’ (volumetric features) and ‘ 3 -dimensional (3 D) features’ (deformation features) as a result of modification and forming of base-sheet. The thickness is constant for a <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part.</b> Hence, the shape features in a <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part</b> are also referred as constant thickness features. The representation, classification, and extraction procedures of the sheet-metal features are based on topology and geometry. The novelty is that the proposed classification and representation of sheet-metal features is based purely on shape entities and therefore it is possible to automatically extract the features from any <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part</b> model. This enables the use of the proposed classification and representation to be unambiguous and application independent and to handle equivalences between feature labels and their representations among applications. The definition presented for a feature can also be extended to include application specific information...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of modern industry, sheet-metal parts in mass production have been widely applied in mechanical, communication, electronics, and light industries in recent decades; but the advances in <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part</b> design and manufacturing remain too slow compared with the increasing importance of sheet-metal parts in modern industry. This paper proposes a method for automatically extracting features from an arbitrary solid model of sheet-metal parts; whose characteristics are used for classification and graph-based representation of the sheet-metal features to extract the features embodied in a <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part.</b> The extracting feature process can be divided for valid checking of the model geometry, feature matching, and feature relationship. Since the extracted features include abundant geometry and engineering information, they will be effective for downstream application such as feature rebuilding and stamping process planning...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We propose {{unilateral}} fixtures, a {{new class}} of fixtures for sheet metal parts with holes, where holding elements lie almost completely {{on one side of the}} part, maximizing access for welding, assembly, or inspection. Each primary jaw is cylindrical with a conical groove that provides the equivalent of four point contacts and facilitates part alignment. We present a two-phase algorithm for computing unilateral fixtures. Phase I is a geometric algorithm that assumes the part is rigid and applies 2 D and 3 D kinematic analysis of form-closure to identify all candidate locations for pairs of primary jaws. We prove three new grasp properties for 2 D and 3 D grips at concave vertices and define a scale-invariant quality metric based on the sensitivity of part orientation to infinitesimal relaxation of jaw position. Phase II uses a Finite Element Method (FEM) to compute part deformation and to arrange secondary contacts at part edges and interior surfaces. For a given <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part,</b> given as a 2 D surface embedded in 3 D with e edges, n concavities and m mesh nodes, Phase I takes O (e + n 4 / 3 log 1 / 3 n + g log g) time to compute a list of g pairs of primary jaws ranked by quality.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} four appended papers. The thesis describes {{the challenges and}} advantages {{of the use of}} FE-analysis in the design of a component forming process in the automotive industry. Today, shortened lead-times in the automotive industry have dramatically increased the need for more efficient development methods in each stage of the process development chain. In order to decrease the long lead-time for producing a forming tool, sheet-metal-forming simulation was introduced. To successfully implement sheet-metal-forming simulation it is important to establish an efficient exchange of information. Efficient information handling will also generate a more accurate basis for decisions aimed at reducing the number of changes in the development phase to achieve the specified automotive part or process. Efficient information exchange can be established by using a database where animations from the sheet-metal-forming simulations are stored. The database should be accessible from the Internet in order to enable direct investigation and analysis by authorised persons. Today, sheet-metal-forming simulations are able to predict e. g. thinning, cracks and forces with high accuracy. The investigation showed that sheet-metal-forming simulation is superior in reducing lead-time and costs compared with the use of try-out tools. The Karafillis-Boyce (1993) material model has been implemented in the explicit, dynamic software LS- DYNA A special optimisation program, written in the programming language C, was developed to find proper parameters for the above-mentioned material model. The results showed that the model by Karafilli and Boyce provided superior results compared with the models by Barlat and Uan (1989), and Hill (1948), respectively. There are two important phenomena that sheet-metal-forming simulation cannot yet adequate predict, namely surface defects and springback. The accuracy regarding the prediction of surface defects and springback was evaluated by analysing a double curved <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>part.</b> This part resembled the area around the fuel filler lid. Based on this model, experiments and sheet-metal-forming simulations were performed and the results were compared.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} classification, {{representation and}} extraction of deformation features in <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts.</b> The thickness is constant for these shape features and hence these are {{also referred to}} as constant thickness features. The deformation feature is represented as a set of faces with a characteristic arrangement among the faces. Deformation of the base-sheet or forming of material creates Bends and Walls with respect to a base-sheet or a reference plane. These are referred to as Basic Deformation Features (BDFs). Compound deformation features having two or more BDFs are defined as characteristic combinations of Bends and Walls and represented as a graph called Basic Deformation Features Graph (BDFG). The graph, therefore, represents a compound deformation feature uniquely. The characteristic arrangement of the faces and type of bends belonging to the feature decide the type and nature of the deformation feature. Algorithms have been developed to extract and identify deformation features from a CAD model of <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts.</b> The proposed algorithm does not require folding and unfolding of the part as intermediate steps to recognize deformation features. Representations of typical features are illustrated and results of extracting these deformation features from typical sheet metal parts are presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore the use of magnesium in crash-related areas is more challenging compared to steel and aluminum.

40|$|In sheet-metal bending, defects {{relating}} to the component-forms such as springback are common.

40|$|Stamping {{process is}} widely used to {{fabricate}} sheet-metal components. Due to the intrinsic nature of <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts,</b> it is usually difficult to control {{the quality of the}} final shape, surface defects or geometric errors. Additionally, to meet tight GD&T specifications, a proactive prediction technique is required to estimate global/local geometric defects caused by manufacturing steps. Current best practice relies on manual trial-and-error approaches which are far to be optimal and are costly and time consuming. This paper proposes a model-driven methodology to forecast geometric errors for given set of process parameters (forward process), and consequently optimise (feedback process) the process parameters to achieve given quality standards. The methodology is based on: (i) experimental investigation with varying process parameters and subsequently, deviation field extraction by mapping high density Cloud-of-Points with nominal CAD model; (ii) deviation field decomposition; (iii) surrogate model development by mapping decomposed deviation field to process parameters.

40|$|Automating {{redesign}} is {{an approach}} for engineering designers to prevent design related manufacturability problems in early product development and thus reduce costly design iterations. A {{vast amount of}} work exists, with most research findings seemingly staying within the research community rather than finding its way into use in industrial settings where research issues have often evolved from the concerned applied research. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present an approach with industrial implementation potential regarding automating redesign of sheet-metal components in early product development to avoid manufacturing problems due to design flaws and non-optimal designs. Geometry, generated by a knowledge-based engineering (KBE) system, gives input to the case-based reasoning (CBR) governed manufacturing planning. If geometry is found non-manufacturable or enhancement of already manufacturable geometry is possible, the CBR system will suggest redesign actions to resolve the problem. CBR extends the capabilities of the rule-based KBE-system by enabling plan-based evaluation. The approach has the potential for industrial implementation, since KBE is often closely coupled to an industrial CAD-system, hence enabling technology is at the industry. Also, combining KBE and CBR reduces the coding effort compared to coding the whole design support with CBR, as feature recognition is simplified by means of KBE. A case study of development of <b>sheet-metal</b> manufactured <b>parts</b> at a Swedish automotive industry partner presents the method in use. As it is shown that redesign can be automated for <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts</b> there is a potential for reducing costly design and manufacturing iterations. 10. 1115 /DETC 2006 - 99545 </p...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} demand from manufacturing industries for new tool materials such as more wear resistant zinc-alloys, with optimised characteristics regarding short-run <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts</b> production. Research on zinc-alloys wear resistance has been performed by a lot of research groups. However, {{it is very difficult to}} compare the wear resistance of these materials due to the fact that the investigations have been carried out with conventional methods, such as pin-on-disc or block-on-ring tests. In this paper wear resistance has been evaluated for three different zinc-alloys with different primary phase as die-tool material in forming process equipment. The method used has been the U-bending process, in which the conditions are realistic due to the complex varying load and strain during the forming process. The primary phase in ACuZinc 5 is a F-phase, which is harder and stronger than the primary phases in Norzak 2 and ZA 27. ACuZinc 5 is almost nine times more abrasive resistant and Norzak 2 is 1. 8 times more abrasive resistant than ZA 27.

40|$|Predicting {{the final}} shape {{variation}} of single and multi-station assemblies of compliant parts is a strategic topic especially in automotive and aeronautic industries for the wide-spread presence of sheetmetal assembly processes. The high flexibility of compliant parts causes wide final shape variations during the assembly process. Therefore, it is strategic to analyze different assembly configurations {{at the beginning}} of the design phase. Starting from the recent methodology proposed by the same authors in a previous paper to do tolerance/variation analysis of compliant assemblies in single- and multi-station configurations, the developed MATLAB-based tool, called SVA-FEA (Statistical Variation Analysis & Finite Element Analysis), is here briefly illustrated. SVA-FEA allows to pre-process FE models, imported from MSC. Patran® or HyperMesh®, defining input deviations and output variables, and including contacts between parts. Then, the results obtained with a linearization process by the MSC. Nastran® solver can be post-processed to evaluate the statistical variations - in term of mean and standard deviations - of all the points of interest. The paper presents the comparative study of tolerance/variation analysis, performed on an single-station assembly of two <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts,</b> between SVA-FEA and a commercial CAT system (TAA® module of CATIA® CAD system).

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is using {{more and more}} of Advanced High Strength Steel {{in order to reduce the}} weight of the car. Since this will generate more springback, it is of vital importance to be able to predict the amount of springback in the parts. Otherwise, many late changes have to be made in order to fit the parts in their position. In order to increase the ability to understand and test the behavior of the springback in <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts,</b> a new semi-industrial experimental tool, the flex-rail, has been developed. This is a very flexible tool, which can be used for various kinds of materials, from mild steel and aluminum to advanced high strength steel such as TRIP-steel and CP-steel by using different insert. The tool is designed for experimental analysis of 3 D-springback, which is the case in the more complicated automotive parts, such as b-pillars and side members. The scope of this work is to analyze the springback behavior and prediction for Advanced High Strength Steel both numerically and experimentally. Sheet-metal-forming simulations were made in LS-DYNA. The results proved that the new geometry, flex-rail, gave a complex springback behavior for all tested materials. Furthermore, the prediction of springback showed good correlation in sections with small amounts of twist but that LS-DYNA under-predicts the springback for sections with large amounts of twist for all materials except DP 600...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bending has {{significant}} {{importance in the}} sheet metal product industry. Moreover, the springback of sheet metal {{should be taken into}} consideration in order to produce bent sheet metal parts within acceptable tolerance limits and to solve geometrical variation for the control of manufacturing process. Nowadays, the importance of this problem increases because of the use of <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts</b> with high mechanical characteristics (High Strength Low Alloy steel). This work describes robust methods of predicting springback of parts in 3 D modelling subjected to bending and unbending deformations. Also the effects of tool geometry in the final shape after springback are discussed. The first part of this paper presents the laboratory experiments in wiping die bending, in which the influence of process variables, such as die shoulder radius, punch-die clearance, punch nose radius and materials properties were discussed. The second part summarises the finite element analysis by using ABAQUS software and compares these results with some experimental data. It appeared that the final results of the FEM simulation are in good agreement with the experimental ones.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry represents a highly important {{sector of the}} Swedish economy. The increasing demands placed on the quality and performance of products that are manufactured places increasing demands on the manufacturing processes involved. The aim of the dissertation has been to study how a particular forming process used {{in the production of}} thin <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts</b> of advanced character can best be analyzed, optimized, controlled and monitored, and how the processing results can best be predicted and be expressed in economic terms. The <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts</b> in question are composed of either stainless steel or pure titanium, formed into complex and intensive patterns, high demands being placed upon their precision of manufacture. An overarching goal was to be able to continuously and adaptively optimize the manufacturing process in terms of quality, process stability, production speed and sustainable resource utilization. To facilitate achievement of this ultimate goal, a laboratory platform was developed providing the testing methodology needed for process studies of different aspects of forming of critical importance. Use of this platform made it possible to focus on specific problems encountered industrially in the forming of the geometric patterns called for. Under the laboratory conditions created, knowledge and experience concerning relationships between important processing factors and the processing results obtained could be studied. In many cases, the results of the studies carried out could be combined with those obtained through use of more traditional testing methods, either to simplify or to verify results obtained. The laboratory platform and the studies carried out enabled the formability of the different materials involved to be rank-ordered and each of them to be assigned a formability index. The effects of different factors that affect the friction that occurred were also studied with the aim of being determining what forming conditions were optimal. It was found to be possible, with use of the methodology developed and of the increased knowledge and understanding it provided of the sheet-metal surfaces involved, of the lubrication employed, and of the formability of the sheet-metal material in question, to improve the performance of the process that was studied. Tool wear was assessed in a laboratory platform by means of appropriate measurement techniques. In order to keep the tool cost in an industrial setting as low as possible per part produced, {{it is important that the}} tool material and the coating of it employed be selected with adequate attention to both cost and performance. Various tool solutions for low-, medium- and high-volume production were studied. Taking account of the relationship between the costs associated with a reference tool and the wear index that applies can help to optimize the relationship between price and performance. The use of FE-analysis was seen as an important step in efforts for improvement aimed at creating a high-performance production system. Virtual aids can be useful in this context, contributing to time effectiveness in optimization of both the product in question and the manufacturing process involved. The laboratory platform made it possible to verify the results of the FE-analyses performed, enabling improvements both of the product and of the forming process employed to be implemented. A new control system that was developed based on use of AE (Acoustic Emission), able during the forming process to ensure virtually in real time the quality of the products being manufactured, was studied, as were various methods for describing the production system as a whole from the standpoint of cost. A method for analyzing production performance in terms of downtimes, in particular their character, effects and the costs per unit produced, was presented. A cost model likewise developed enabled both the downtimes and their causes to be expressed in economic terms. The dynamic downtime behavior of a production system was also studied from a cost perspective. There was found to be considerable potential for improvement of the production process as a whole. It was also shown that selection of the appropriate level of automation is important for achieving a production system having both a high level of performance and long-term sustainability. In connection with this, an economic model was presented for determining the optimal automation level under a given set of conditions...|$|R
40|$|Laser Bending {{is a new}} {{non-contact}} {{method of}} forming sheet-metal components which does not require any special tools. This process is highly accurate and can be easily automated. This would save {{a great deal of}} time and cost which is essential for tooling design and fabrication in conventional processes. Laser bending also provides flexibility in process planning with various processes such as welding, cutting, cladding and surface treatment that can be carried out at a single Laser workstation. In Laser Bending, the metal sheet is locally heated along a path by a laser beam. This forms a steep temperature gradient across the thickness i. e. between top and bottom surfaces. The top surface expands because of higher temperature, forcing bottom surface to contract. This bends the sheet away from the laser. As soon as the laser source is switched off, the surface starts to cool rapidly and the temperature gradient is reversed due to heat conduction. This results in bending the sheet towards the laser beam and thus giving it the final shape. Bending angle can be controlled by varying a) Laser Power, b) Scan Velocity, c) Beam Diameter, d) Sheet Thickness and e) Number of scans repetitions. Laser bending has already been applied for micro-bending and adjusting curvatures of bent parts used in Computer hard disk drives. Other applications include bending thick plates for Ship-building, repairing welding distortions, straightening <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts</b> and sculpture making. Also Laser Bending can be a suitable process for bending high strength materials such as Titanium and its alloys, commonly used in Aerospace Industry and Medical Implants Fabrication. Titanium is usually formed by special hot forming processes such as Hot Brake Forming and Superplastic Forming, which require special die designing and are only suitable for larger components. Laser Bending can be a better alternative to these processes because of its good controllability, less set-up time, ability to form complex shapes and repeatability. In this thesis, the feasibility of a 500 W Nd:YAG Laser to bend Commercially Pure Grade- 2 Titanium is examined. A theoretical model has been developed to predict the bending angle as a function of process parameters. The model is then verified with experiments on the Nd:YAG laser. Due to high temperatures involved in Laser bending and oxide film (α-case) formation, material properties change drastically and that reflects on reducing the bending angle per scan in multi-scan system. To reduce oxidation Inert gas shielding has been used. Different nozzle positions and inert gas combinations (Argon and Helium) have been used to enhance the bend quality and bend angle. Effects of these design changes on width of Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), thickness of sheet at HAZ, material hardness and final bending angle are discussed. As Grade- 2 Titanium is a highly reflective material, different coatings such as graphite and thermal paint have been used to improve absorption of the laser beam. The effects of these coatings on bending angle and bend quality are covered...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} processes are strongly affected by part and process variations. Understanding the final {{shape of the}} assembly is a crucial task to be achieved during the design stage to reduce cost and production time. Typically, when parts are put together variations propagate part-to-part. This stack-up effect is strictly related to part deviations, assembly sequence, assembly constraints, part flexibility. All these fac-tors combine into a non-linear way. Technical literature provides valid methodologies to analyze tolerance stack-up problems. In this contest, assemblies are usually classified into two main categories: rigid assemblies and compliant assemblies. In the first case, parts are assumed ideal-rigid and the additional variation due to elastic or plastic defor-mation is not accounted. When the flexibility of parts is not negligible, as into manufac-turing processes involving <b>sheet-metal</b> <b>parts,</b> its effect has to be accounted into numeri-cal simulations. This dissertation provides {{a contribution to the}} modeling and the simu-lation both of rigid and compliant assemblies. With respect to rigid assembly, a general methodology, called SVA-TOL (Sta-tistical Variation Analysis for Tolerancing), is proposed. The methodology is based into two main steps. Tolerance specifications are modeled in the first step following Interna-tional Standard rules. Variational features are so generated. Then, by using these varia-tional features, assembly constraints are modeled as combination of elementary geome-try entities: points, lines and planes. Two assembly solvers are illustrated: the sequential solver and the least squares solver. The sequential solver allows to analyze assembly constraints taking into account the assembly sequence. Specific mathematical tools, such as Screw Theory and Graph Theory, are here adopted to automatically calculate the list of degrees of freedom al-lowed for a specific part being assembled. The least squares solver, instead, permits to analyze all assembly constraint si-multaneously by best fitting all mating conditions. Case studies have pointed out the field of applicability of proposed assembly solvers. With respect to compliant assembly, a general frame-work, called SVA-FEA (Statistical Variation Analysis & Finite Element Analysis), is presented. SVA-FEA al-lows to statistically simulate single- and multi-station assembly processes under linear assumptions. A Global Sensitivity Matrix is introduced to link input part or process de-viations and output assembly deviations. In this way, no Monte Carlo simulation is needed. The whole assembly process is based on the Place, Clamp, Fasten and Release (PCFR) cycle. Parts are positioned on fixturing frames, where are clamped and fastened. Then, they are released reaching their final assembly configuration. To numerically cal-culate the sensitivity matrix two FEA runs, performed on the nominal geometry, are re-quired. The first one calculates the fixturing and fastening forces, by applying the method of influence coefficients. These forces are then applied into the second FEA run to simulate the final elastic spring-back. SVA-FEA methodology has been implemented into a friendly MatLAB®’s GUI, allowing to define the whole assembly process, with its variability, and to visualize the final assembly deviations, in terms on mean and standard deviations. Two significant case studies have highlighted how SVA-FEA al-lows to simulate both single- and multi-station assembly processes. Results have been compared with ones coming from commercial CAT software, showing a good numeri-cal correlation. SVA-FEA assumes that input statistical deviations are independent among them. This means that no covariance effect is accounted. To overcome this weakness, a new non-linear methodology is also proposed. The non-linear methodology, to do variational analysis of compliant assembly, uses a Monte Carlo approach to statistically generate input free shape geometry. The methodology can be described as follows. For each Monte Carlo step, input geometry is generated according to an automatic morphing mesh procedure. Then, the PCFR cycle is simulated. The geometry is so updated for each phase of the PCFR cycle. To reach more realistic results, contact pairs, defined as surface-to-surface type, may be introduced into the numerical simulation. The morphing mesh approach allows to generated free shape parts starting from few control points, defined on the nominal geometry, and setting the tolerance error value. Finally, critical remarks are outlined, highlighting future directions of research in the field of tolerance analysis of rigid and compliant assembly processes...|$|R
