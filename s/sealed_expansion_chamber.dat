40|$|The aim {{of work is}} {{to compare}} two {{possible}} methods of mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic instabilities. This comparison is performed by monitoring the formation and evolution of Taylor vortices in hydrodynamic sealing gap. Sealing gaps {{are a part of}} the hydraulic machines with the impeller, such as turbines and pumps, and they have an effect on the volumetric efficiency of these devices. This work presents two examples of sealing gaps. These examples are closed sealing gap and modified <b>sealing</b> gap with <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber.</b> On these two examples are applied procedures of solution contained in CFD software (ANSYS Fluent 14. 5). In ANSYS Fluent is two possible basic approaches of solution this task: the moving wall method and the sliding mesh method. The result of work is monitoring the impact of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> on the formation of hydrodynamic instabilities in the sealing gap. Another result is comparison of two used methods of mathematical modeling, which shows that both methods can be used for similar tasks...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{development of}} a second order model for predicting sound transmission losses of the single <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> (Muffler). Firstly, Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is used to predict the sound transmission losses of <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber.</b> Then, accuracy of the TMM is validated against the experimental results. Finally, the second order model is developed using response surface method (RSM). Also, fractional factorial design (FFD) is carried out to investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> dimensions on the sound transmission losses at desired pure tone 500 Hz. Analysis of the RSM showed that Muffler diameter, Muffler length and Pipe diameter are significant parameters. In addition their square and interaction terms are enough to obtain the response variable (transmission losses). The study also found that the predictive model development by RSM close to those predict by TMM. The <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is one of the more}} significant tools which are used to attenuate the noise emitted from the exhaust system of the vehicle engine.

40|$|The {{boundary}} element method (BEM) {{is frequently}} employed {{to predict the}} transmission loss (TL) of an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> silencer with a rigid walled boundary, while {{the effect of the}} vibration of the end plates of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> silencer is usually ignored. However, when the airflow or acoustic pressure in a duct is large and the end plate of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> silencer is not thick enough, the effect of the vibration of the end plate should not be ignored. In this paper, based on a coupling of the BEM and the finite element method (FEM), the numerical results illustrate the existence of the effect on the TL of the vibrating end plates. Furthermore, numerical experiments also show that for an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> of constant size, the thicker the end plate, the less influence the vibration of the end plate has on the TL. And this may be helpful for the design of silencer. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "V-TACS" [...] - Variable Torque Amplification Chamber System - works {{differently}} from the [...] "ATAC system" [...] and it will only work when it is {{used in conjunction with}} a tuned muffler. Tuned mufflers/expansion chambers increase power but only at the RPM they are designed for and can actually cause a power loss outside their tuned RPM. [...] "V-TACS system" [...] takes advantage of using an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> without losing power outside the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber's</b> tuned RPM. Within the head and cylinder of the engine, there is a chamber that is sealed by a valve. This sealed chamber is vented onto the exhaust port when the valve is open. At low RPM this valve is open, this has the effect of increasing the exhaust manifold volume and negating the power loss that would normally be apparent at low RPM with an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber.</b> At mid RPM the valve is closed, this enables the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> to work. It is identified by the head and cylinder, being much larger than normal for its displacement, the cylinder wall is also cast with the wording VTACS on it.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the exhaust}} {{pressure}} {{has fallen to}} near-atmospheric level, the piston uncovers the transfer ports. At this point energy from the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{can be used to}} aid the flow of fresh mixture into the cylinder. To do this, the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> is increased in diameter so that the out-going acoustic wave (created by the combustion process) creates a reflected vacuum (negative pressure) wave that returns to the cylinder. This part of the chamber is called the divergent (or diffuser) section and it diverges at 7 to 9 degrees. It may be made up of more than one diverging cone depending on requirements. The vacuum wave arrives in the cylinder during the transfer cycle and helps suck in fresh mixture from the crankcase into the cylinder, and/or prevent the suction of exhaust gases into the crankcase (due to crankcase vacuum). However, the wave may also suck fresh mixture out the exhaust port into the header of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber.</b> This effect is mitigated by the port-blocking wave.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inertial}} supercharging {{effect from}} two-stroke engines {{is the result}} of the design of an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> in the two-stroke exhaust system. Its carefully designed shape and length uses the expanding exhaust gasses to create a vacuum that pulls more exhaust gases (and some of the intake gasses) out of the engine. This is immediately followed by a reflected pressure wave timed to force the extra intake gasses back into the cylinder, thus achieving a greater mass of air/fuel mix in the combustion chamber than possible with conventional induction & exhaust scavenging methods. <b>Expansion</b> <b>chambers</b> only work well at a narrow engine speed range which is why two stroke engines are referred to as having a [...] "powerband". Since the early eighties exhaust powervalves have been developed which have the effect of altering the timing and/or volume of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber,</b> greatly improving the spread of power of high output two stroke engines.|$|R
