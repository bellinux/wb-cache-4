5|$|In early February 1942, Air Commodore George Jones, {{soon to be}} {{appointed}} Chief of the Air Staff, inspected NWA and found the morale and <b>serviceability</b> of its combat units—Nos.2, 12 and 13Squadrons—to be lacking.|$|E
5|$|By August, as the <b>serviceability</b> and the {{quantity}} of the Luftwaffe's inventory steadily diminished due to combat, demand for air support only increased as the VVS recovered. The Luftwaffe found itself struggling to maintain local air superiority. With the onset of bad weather in October, the Luftwaffe was on several occasions forced to halt nearly all aerial operations. The VVS, although faced with the same weather difficulties, had a clear advantage thanks to the prewar experience with cold-weather flying, {{and the fact that}} they were operating from intact airbases and airports. By December, the VVS had matched the Luftwaffe and was even pressing to achieve air superiority over the battlefields.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities. Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and <b>serviceability</b> increased.|$|E
5|$|Owing to his keen {{interest}} in the type he followed, with interest, the exploits of Kommando Nowotny, the all jet fighter unit. Although it had low <b>serviceability</b> rates, its aircraft achieved considerable success. To see how new aircraft performed in action, Galland often visited the front line airfields close {{to the scene of}} the fighting. On 8 November 1944, he was present when ace Walter Nowotny took off with a force of Me 262s in an overcast to engage a USAAF raid. Galland listened to it over the radio waves. Nowotny claimed a bomber but his Me 262 was damaged. He was then jumped by USAAF fighters and crashed close to the airfield. Galland heard the firing but did not see the event. It did not dissuade him from believing in the capabilities of the aircraft as a fighter.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Luftwaffe to {{identify}} the radar chain and distinguish RAF fighter bases from those of other RAF commands undermined its ability to destroy the British fighter defences. The Luftwaffe underestimated British radar, and they had not realised its importance in the British operational system. To the contrary, OKL believed that the radar stations would benefit the German effort by sending RAF forces into large-scale air battles for the Luftwaffe to decimate. The RAF aircraft industry supported the losses and its pilots were replaced sufficiently to limit the RAF’s decline in strength and deny the Germans victory. Conversely, the RAF were able to ensure the <b>serviceability</b> rates and aircrew numbers of the Luftwaffe declined in August–September.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical fuel shortage from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace the relatively small losses and operational <b>serviceability</b> reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable of taking a toll on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The impotence of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that month, was not adequately opposed either.|$|E
5|$|Deliveries of the Vengeances to Australia {{were much}} delayed. Following Australia's entry into Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF order still stood at 297 Vengeances. These {{aircraft}} {{were scheduled to}} be delivered between January and December 1942. No Vengeances had arrived by 8 May 1942, though the RAAF's order had been increased to 367. A small number of the type arrived in Australia in late May 1942, but subsequent deliveries were slow. This was because the USAAF was also rapidly expanding at this time, which limited the number and types of aircraft available to its allies. Attempts by the Australian Government to obtain Vengeances from USAAF allocations in March 1942, when the country faced a possible Japanese invasion, were unsuccessful. The majority of the dive bombers arrived after April 1943; {{by this time the}} threat of invasion had passed. Overall, Australia received 15 Vengeances in 1942, 227 in 1943 and 100 during 1944. Many of the aircraft suffered from defects, which led to delays in introducing them into service and caused the type to have a relatively low <b>serviceability</b> rate.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} {{withdrawal}} of the RAAF's Vengeances from combat. Odgers judged that a key reason behind the decision was the poor performance of the Vengeance compared to other available aircraft in the region. USAAF units equipped with superior types were arriving in New Guinea during early 1944, and Kenney wanted to free up scarce space at forward airfields so that he could launch attacks on the important Japanese bases at Wewak and Hollandia; these targets were beyond the range of the Vengeance. In particular, No. 77 Wing was required to vacate Nadzab so that its airfields could accommodate a group of long-ranged Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighers. Odgers also argued that the Vengeances had proven to be mechanically unreliable, and had difficulty taking off while carrying a full bomb load: in practice it was found that they could carry only the same bomb load as Kittyhawk fighters. The Kittyhawks were also superior at strafing targets and {{did not need to be}} escorted. A 2008 paper written by staff of the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre disputed Odgers' views on the reliability of the aircraft, stating that No. 77 Wing had a good <b>serviceability</b> rate. This paper instead argued that difficulties in supplying the wing may have been a more important factor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, saboteurs caused a fire on Triglav, further eroding crew morale already under {{pressure}} from desertion. Elsewhere in the Bay of Kotor, Milan Spasić and Sergej Mašera died blowing up the destroyer Zagreb to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Following this, Kern decided to sail out with just two boats, Durmitor and Kajmakčalan, which he deemed had the most trustworthy crews, leaving the Bay of Kotor on 17 April. Because both boats were in poor condition and overloaded with personnel, the maximum speed they could achieve was 29 knots. Before passing through the Strait of Otranto, the boats successfully evaded two groups of Italian ships. They arrived at Navarino Bay in southern Greece on 19 April and at Souda Bay in Crete on 22 April, where they were tasked with escorting a convoy to Alexandria, protecting it from possible attacks from Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers. Once in Alexandria, they joined with other JKRM vessels and aircraft that had managed to escape, forming the JKRM in exile. The two boats were first tasked with patrolling {{the outside of the}} harbour in anticipation of an attack by Axis coastal craft. In June they operated against Vichy French forces in Syria. In 1944 they were reported as being tasked with escorting convoys between Alexandria and Port Said. However, with time the <b>serviceability</b> of the boats became a problem {{because of the lack of}} spare parts needed for their German-built engines.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 six F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron were {{deployed}} to the Middle East {{as part of}} Operation Okra, replacing a detachment of Super Hornets. No. 81 Wing's involvement in Operation Okra concluded in May 2017, with No. 1 Squadron resuming responsibility for this task. By this time all of the wing's three squadrons had completed at least one rotation to the Middle East: No. 3 Squadron was deployed once, {{and the other two}} squadrons conducted two deployments. The squadrons used a common 'pool' of aircraft during these deployments, with either six or seven Hornets being stationed in the Middle East at any time. The aircraft were typically deployed for eight months before rotating back to Australia when becoming due for major servicing. Members of the three Hornet-equipped squadrons served five or six month rotations, and ground crew from 2OCU and No. 81 Wing's workshops were also deployed to fill specialist roles. The Hornets attacked ISIL personnel and facilities in both Iraq and Syria, including in support of Iraqi forces engaged in the Battle of Mosul. Overall, No. 81 Wing conducted 1,973 sorties over Iraq and Syria during which 1,961 munitions were released. Despite the age of the aircraft and the harsh environmental conditions in the Middle East, the detachment sustained a very high <b>serviceability</b> rate.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{moved from}} Richmond to RAAF Base Amberley, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At {{this time the}} {{squadron}} continued {{to be responsible for}} all Caribou conversion training, as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent detachment of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and Detachment B of the squadron was established at RAAF Base Townsville in North Queensland during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing Detachment C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international peacekeeping force which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful referendum on independence conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the detachment. The air and ground crew deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips. Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, Detachment C's ground crew managed to maintain a high aircraft <b>serviceability</b> rate. In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole Caribou operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands peacekeeping force. Both Caribous were based at Honiara International Airport, and a detachment remained in the country until July 2004. All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008.|$|E
25|$|There were 60 {{additional}} {{aircraft in}} the Philippine Army Air Corps, including one Keystone ZB-3A bomber. 42 were Stearman 76DC trainers of varying <b>serviceability</b> and utility.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 the CH-124 fleet {{averaged}} 9–14,000 flying hours, while Sea Kings {{of other}} fleets {{go as high}} as 40,000 hours. Although the CH-124 had frequent technical issues, none are serious, and they could maintain a 87 percent <b>serviceability</b> rate.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being one}} of the newest MiG-21 fleets in service, the Romanian MiG-21 LanceR fleet was {{grounded}} due to difficulties maintaining the aircraft, and since 1996 it has had an accident rate of over 30 per 100,000 hours. <b>Serviceability</b> rates below 50% are not uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Choosing {{packaging}} machinery {{includes an}} assessment of technical capabilities, labor requirements, worker safety, maintainability, <b>serviceability,</b> reliability, ability to integrate into the packaging line, capital cost, floorspace, flexibility (change-over, materials, etc.), energy requirements, quality of outgoing packages, qualifications (for food, pharmaceuticals, etc.), throughput, efficiency, productivity, ergonomics, return on investment, etc.|$|E
25|$|From 1981 to 1982, the {{squadron}} strived to achieve higher standards, {{and participated in}} several air-to-air missile and gun-firing exercises, such as Exercise Vajraghat-III, Exercise Chaukanna-III and IV. By 19 May 1982, {{the squadron}} had achieved 100% <b>serviceability,</b> and all the aircraft were flown that day.|$|E
25|$|Constraints {{may include}} {{available}} resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, safety, marketability, productivity, and <b>serviceability.</b> By understanding the constraints, engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or {{system may be}} produced and operated.|$|E
25|$|The {{consumers}} of this data {{have grown more}} numerous and complex {{with the growth of}} programs offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These are designed to offer operators guaranteed availability and make the picture more complex with the operator managing the asset but the OEM taking on the liability to ensure its <b>serviceability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Shuttleworth Collection {{based at}} Old Warden Aerodrome in Bedfordshire, England, has a 1910 {{airworthy}} example (G-AANH) powered by an Anzani Y-Type 30hp 3-cylinder radial engine. The example {{is believed to}} be the 43rd Deperdussin produced and the world's second oldest airworthy type. It is flown at home airshows during the summer months subject to weather and <b>serviceability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Configuration {{management}} {{is used to}} maintain {{an understanding of the}} status of complex assets with a view to maintaining the highest level of <b>serviceability</b> for the lowest cost. Specifically, it aims to ensure that operations are not disrupted due to the asset (or parts of the asset) overrunning limits of planned lifespan or below quality levels.|$|E
25|$|A major {{modification}} between 1986 and 1994, MOD-90, modernized {{the capability}} and <b>serviceability</b> of the Talon I {{to extend its}} service life. All 14 Combat Talon I's were equipped with upgraded navigational radars, an enhanced electronic warfare suite and provided new outer wings. By 1995 all Combat Talon Is were equipped with a helicopter-air refueling pods.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of these aircraft from multiple sources {{along with the}} ones already in the EAF inventory caused increasing <b>serviceability</b> problems. In 1982, the EAF began receiving General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters under the Peace Vector Program. As of 2015, the EAF received a total of 220 F-16s. 18 aircraft were lost in accidents and 7 F-16A/Bs were grounded.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the period}} of gunnery trials {{continued}} between 1927 and 1930, thirteen reports of structural damage were filed, indicating that there remained problems with absorbing the blast and recoil of the guns. The Westbury was also used to test an Oerlikon cannon in the aft position, at angles adjustable between 40 and 60 degrees, but this gun {{was found to have}} inadequate <b>serviceability.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were {{perennial}} {{problems for}} KG 40, {{and the other}} ‘Condor units'. Lack of numbers and <b>serviceability</b> meant there was no guarantee that one or two sorties of three to eight hours would be active when a convoy passed through air space in range of the Luftwaffe. Thus the ability of Fliegerführer Atlantik to find convoys remained sporadic {{until late in the}} command's service.|$|E
25|$|Historically, pinball {{machines}} have employed a central fixed I/O board {{connected to the}} primary CPU controlled by a custom microcontroller platform running an in-house operating system. For {{a variety of reasons}} that include thermal flow, reliability, vibration reduction and <b>serviceability,</b> I/O electronics have been located in the upper backbox of the game, requiring significant custom wiring harnesses to connect the central I/O board to the playfield devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{tribute to}} the Hs 123 usefulness came in January 1943 when Generaloberst Wolfram von Richthofen, then commander-in-chief of Luftflotte 4, asked whether production of the Hs 123 could be restarted because the Hs 123 performed well in a theater where mud, snow, rain and ice took a heavy toll on the <b>serviceability</b> of more advanced aircraft. However, the Henschel factory had already dismantled all tools and jigs in 1940.|$|E
25|$|Fracture {{toughness}} {{is required}} to alter the crack propagation in ceramics. It is helpful to evaluate the <b>serviceability,</b> performance and long term clinical success of biomaterials. It is reported that the high fracture toughness material improved clinical performance and reliability as compare to low fracture toughness. It can be measured by many methods e.g. indentation fracture, indentation strength, single edge notched beam, single edge pre cracked beam and double cantilever beam.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake or seismic {{performance}} {{defines a}} structure's ability to sustain its main functions, {{such as its}} safety and <b>serviceability,</b> at and after a particular earthquake exposure. A structure is normally considered safe {{if it does not}} endanger the lives and well-being of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing. A structure may be considered serviceable if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed.|$|E
25|$|German {{production}} was only just {{keeping pace with}} night-fighter losses. Some 2,375 aircraft were lost and only 2,613 were built in factories or re-entered the frontlines from repair workshops. The overall numbers fell from 76% of establishment to 63% in 1943. <b>Serviceability</b> fell from 72% to 66%. The battles had also taken their toll on the RAF. The Ruhr battle had cost the RAF 923 bombers, another 813 were lost over Hamburg.|$|E
25|$|The CF-104 {{was very}} {{successful}} in operational exercises held by NATO. The Canadians first {{took part in the}} AFCENT Tactical Weapons meet in 1964 and did so every year after that. This meet was a competition between squadrons from Belgium, France, Germany, USA, Britain, and the Netherlands. Scores were based on several factors. Bomb accuracy, time on target, navigation, mission planning and aircraft <b>serviceability.</b> Pilots were chosen at random from the various squadrons to accurately represent operational capabilities.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, as {{a result}} of four A-4S being written off in {{separate}} accidents, coupled with the low <b>serviceability</b> of the original batch of A-4S. Investigations conducted by RSAF reveal that although there was plenty of fuselage life left, the Wright J65 turbojet engines in use by the Skyhawks was too old and the associated spare parts were becoming both difficult and expensive to obtain. Consequently, the RSAF decided to upgrade the A-4S/TA-4S rather than to replace them.|$|E
25|$|Complex assets such as aircraft, ships, {{industrial}} machinery etc. depend on many different components being serviceable. This <b>serviceability</b> is often {{defined in terms}} of the amount of usage the component has had since it was new, since fitted, since repaired, the amount of use it has had over its life and several other limiting factors. Understanding how near the end of their life each of these components is has been a major undertaking involving labor-intensive record keeping until recent developments in software.|$|E
25|$|A {{structure}} {{refers to}} a body or system of connected parts used to support a load. Important examples related to Civil Engineering include buildings, bridges, and towers; and in other branches of engineering, ship and aircraft frames, tanks, pressure vessels, mechanical systems, and electrical supporting structures are important. To design a structure, an engineer must account for its safety, aesthetics, and <b>serviceability,</b> while considering economic and environmental constraints. Other branches of engineering work {{on a wide variety}} of non-building structures.|$|E
25|$|The 330 was {{somewhat}} slower {{than most of}} its pressurised competition, but it built up {{a reputation as a}} comfortable, quiet and rugged airliner. The quiet running of the Pratt & Whitney PT6A-45R was largely due to an efficient reduction gearbox. The cabin {{was the result of a}} collaboration with Boeing engineers who modelled the interior space, fittings and decor after larger airliners. The use of a sturdy structure complete with the traditional Short braced-wing-and-boxy-fuselage configuration also led to an ease of maintenance and <b>serviceability.</b>|$|E
25|$|No. 601 Squadron RAF was {{the only}} British unit to use the Airacobra operationally, {{receiving}} their first two examples on 6 August 1941. On 9 October, four Airacobras attacked enemy barges near Dunkirk, in the type's only operational action with the RAF. The squadron continued to train with the Airacobra during the winter, but a combination of poor <b>serviceability</b> and deep distrust of this unfamiliar fighter resulted in the RAF rejecting the type after one combat mission. In March 1942, the unit re-equipped with Spitfires.|$|E
25|$|Cracking of the {{concrete}} section {{is nearly impossible to}} prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and concrete mix design. Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a <b>serviceability</b> failure in limit state design. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of rebar, or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.|$|E
