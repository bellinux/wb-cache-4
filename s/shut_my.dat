It’s not like I’m always looking for things, either, but I can’t close my ears to any music. Any guitar, any drums, any rhythm section— I’ve always been open to those things, {{trying to understand what}} makes them work in a song". He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've done my whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that other people would be afraid to take. Stone Rollin means I'm going all the way out there this time".|$|E
500|$|All Ballantyne's novels are, {{in his own}} words, [...] "adventure {{stories for}} young folks", and The Coral Island is no exception. It is a Robinsonade, a genre of fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), {{one of the most}} popular of its type, and one of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes. Susan Maher, professor of English, [...] notes that in comparison to Robinson Crusoe such books generally replaced some of the original's romance with a [...] "pedestrian realism", exemplified by works such as The Coral Island and Frederick Marryat's 1841 novel Masterman Ready, or the Wreck of the Pacific. Romance, with its attention to character development, was only restored to the genre of boys' fiction with Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island argues literary critic Lisa Honaker. The Coral Island, for all its adventure, is greatly occupied with the realism of domestic fiction (the domain of the realist novel); Ballantyne devotes about a third of the book to descriptions of the boys' living arrangements. The book exhibits a [...] "light-hearted confidence" [...] in its description of an adventure that was above all fun. As Ralph says in his preface: [...] "If there is any boy or man who loves to be melancholy and morose, and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of fun, let me seriously advise him to <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> book and put it away. It is not meant for him." [...] Professor of English [...] has observed that [...] "the swift movement of the story from coastal England to exotic Pacific island is similar to the swift movement from the real world to the fantastic in children's fantasy".|$|E

2500|$|In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese {{reflects}} that, [...] "As chance {{would have}} it, Jonah {{got the ball}} in the opening stages of the second half and ran straight at me… I think I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes, but I tackled him. Later in the half he pushed me aside to score a try, but I could at least claim to have cut him down once." [...] Following the Test Campese and Lomu met in the changing rooms and exchanged their jerseys. Lomu gave Campese his number 11 jersey while Campese gave Lomu his number 16 jersey. Campese's 92nd Test marked the last Test he would play in the amateur era.|$|E
2500|$|Many African Americans, called Exodusters, {{escaped the}} Klan and racially discriminatory {{laws in the}} South by moving to large {{northern}} cities, {{as well as to}} places like Kansas where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement, which he thought resembled the American Colonization Society he had fought in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to stick it out. He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, [...] "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes to the ugly facts before me." ...|$|E

MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I must have looked gaunt and ghastly standing there in my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could almost hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E

2500|$|Milo Goes to College {{is cited}} {{as one of}} the most {{significant}} albums of the early-1980s southern California hardcore punk movement. Steven Blush, author of , remarked that its [...] "cheeky love songs disguised as hardcore blasts became the most aped formula in rock." [...] Rock critic Robert Christgau gave it an A- rating, saying [...] "These fishermen don't kid around about what powers hardcore hyperdrive—not simply an unjust society, but also a battered psyche. When they're feeling bad, any kind of power—money, age, ass-man cool, the possession of a vagina—can set off their anarchic, patricidal, 'homo'-baiting, gynephobic rage. But their bad feelings add poignant weight to the doomed vulnerability of the last four songs, which happen to be their hookiest". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the album [...] "Perfect for the little guy who was ever called a nerd and never got the girl. The chainsaw pop combined with earthy humor conveys what is often an inarticulate rage." [...] Hilburn's review was especially affirming for Stevenson, whose father criticized and discouraged his songwriting: [...] "Robert Hillburn was saying something different. He was saying that I can write okay, that I'm a decent songwriter. So it served to <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> dad up a little bit, so that I could pursue the band thing a little less encumbered by his stifling attitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Russian state channel RTR was {{the only}} media granted access. They {{broadcast}} a heavily edited version of the meeting that only showed the president speaking, eliminating many emotional and contentious encounters between the President and family members. Their single TV camera fed its signal to a satellite truck on loan to RTR from the German TV Company RTL, and RTL recorded the entire event. Two Russian journalists from Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Kommersant, who posed as family members, witnessed hysterical widows and mothers howling at Putin, demanding to know why they were receiving so much conflicting information and {{who was going to}} be punished for the deaths of their family members. During the meeting, Nadezhda Tylik, the mother of Kursk submariner Lt. Sergei Tylik, was extremely emotional and interrupted the meeting. She harangued Putin and Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov, accusing them of lying to the family members. She told them, [...] "You better shoot yourselves now! We won't let you live, bastards!" [...] When she would not be quiet, a nurse in civilian apparel behind her forcibly injected her through her clothing with a sedative. She shortly thereafter lost the ability to speak and was carried out. Immediately after his wife was given the injection, Tylik's husband said he had asked the woman to give his wife the drug [...] "because she was prone to excessive emotions." [...] Four months later she revealed that her husband had lied about the injection to the public to [...] "save my nerves" [...] and that he, in fact, [...] "did not ask for help." [...] Tylik later stated, [...] "The injection was done to <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> mouth. Immediately after it, I just lost the ability to speak and was carried out." ...|$|E
