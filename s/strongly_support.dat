5|$|The Saudi Arabian {{government}} and other Gulf region governments <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often accuse the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission found no evidence supporting the claim. Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but the claim was dropped after a UN 1970 survey found that most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the different}} groups of bats {{have been the subject}} of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group. In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> the monophyly of bats, debate continues as to the meaning of available genetic and morphological evidence.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} {{so early in the}} primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E

5|$|S. freyi {{remained}} {{as the sole}} member of Sphecomyrma until a fossil closely resembling the species was collected in Canadian amber deposits in 1985. Wilson provided the first description of the fossil, naming it S. canadensis. He notes that the close resemblance of the fossils to S. freyi in key characteristics <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> its inclusion in Sphecomyrminae. He further notes that the specimens are the first ants recorded in Canadian amber, but a vast diversity of insects {{have been found in}} the amber prior to the discovery, stretching {{as far back as the}} 19th century. The discovery of the specimens from Canada indicates that the subfamily was widespread through much of the northern hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. In 2005, new fossils of an undescribed Sphecomyrma ant and S. freyi were collected in the White Oaks outcrop in Sayreville, New Jersey. The specimens were later donated to the American Museum of Natural History and studied by palaeoentomologists Michael Engel and David Grimaldi, who both provided the first description of the undescribed ant in an American Museum Novitates journal article, naming it Sphecomyrma mesaki. The age of these fossils are estimated at 79 to 92 million years.|$|E

Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> prohibition laws—the mayor had been a saloon keeper.|$|E

25|$|Taken together, these morphometric studies <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> {{the notion}} that brain plasticity—changes of brain structure—remains {{possible}} throughout life and may well be an adaptation to changes in brain function which {{has also been shown}} to change with experience. The title of this section was meant to emphasize this, namely that plasticity and learning provide two perspectives—functional and structural—at the same phenomenon, a brain that changes over time.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Electoral Survey that is {{conducted}} following all elections by the Australian National University {{has found that}} support for a republic has remained reasonably static since 1987 at around 60%, if the type of republic {{is not part of}} the question.

All three samples of B. kaempferi formed a <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> clade sister to the <b>strongly</b> <b>supported</b> clade of B. monoica, with the clade of B. papyrifera further sister to the clade composed of B. kaempferi and B. monoica.|$|R

Many Democrats support affirmative action programs to further this goal. Democrats also <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability. As such, the Democrats pushed as well the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, a legal expansion that became law.|$|E

In 1948, Soviet leaders ordered American communists to support the third party candidacy of Wallace against incumbent President Harry S. Truman, and Gold actively supported Wallace despite the CIO's refusal to do so.|$|E

25|$|European social-democrats <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> Europeanism and {{supranational}} integration, {{although there}} is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this left-wing nationalism to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by free-trade agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.|$|E
25|$|Yeomans was {{promoted}} to chair of the MUC's public transit committee in November 1986. Shortly thereafter, he called for the province to finish delayed renovations on the Dorion–Rigaud commuter line and expressed disappointment when the government instead allocated the money for a road link to Mirabel Airport. Yeomans later opposed the provincial government's plan to extend Highway 440 to the Trans-Canada Highway, arguing that it would create more urban sprawl and reduce investment in Montreal. He did, however, <b>strongly</b> <b>support</b> the province's plans to renovate Montreal's Deux-Montagnes Line.|$|E
