The complexity of electrospray mass spectrometric data acquired {{from a range of}} samples (serum, urine, yeast intracellular extracts, yeast metabolic footprints, placental tissue metabolic footprints) has been investigated and has defined the frequency of different ion types routinely detected. Although some ion types were expected (protonated and deprotonated peaks, isotope peaks, multiply charged peaks) others were not expected (sodium formate adduct ions). In parallel, the Manchester Metabolomics Database (MMD) has been constructed with data from genome scale metabolic reconstructions, HMDB, KEGG, Lipid Maps, BioCyc and DrugBank to provide knowledge on 42, 687 endogenous and exogenous metabolite species. The combination of accurate mass data for a large collection of metabolites, theoretical isotope abundance data and knowledge of the different ion types detected provided a greater number of electrospray mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals</b> which were putatively identified and with greater confidence in the samples studied.

In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer {{and at the same time}} provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards.

Suppression with samples collected into phosphate buffers is avoided when citrate, trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid is used for collection, while phosphate still provides excellent resolution in the capillary. Low concentrations of hydrochloric acid added to the sample/matrix mixture generate essentially adduct-free mass spectra with better signal-to-noise ratios and detection limits (fmol range) than those obtained with citrate or trifluoroacetic acid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Differences in {{ionization}} efficiency among neutral and sialylated glycans prevent direct quantitative comparison by their respective mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals.</b> To overcome this challenge, we developed an integrated chemical strategy, Dual Reactions for Analytical Glycomics (DRAG), to quantitatively compare neutral and sialylated glycans simultaneously by MALDI-MS. Initially, two glycan samples {{to be compared}} undergo reductive amination with 2 -aminobenzoic acid and 2 - 13 [C 6]-aminobenzoic acid, respec-tively. The different isotope-incorporated glycans are then combined and subjected to the methylamidation of the sialic acid residues in one mixture, homogenizing the ionization responses for all neutral and sialylated glycans. By this approach, the expression change of relevant glycans between two samples {{is proportional to the}} ratios of doublet signals with a static 6 Da mass difference in MALDI-MS and the change in relative abundance of any glycan within samples can also be determined. The strategy was chemically validated using well-characterized N-glycans from bovine fetuin and IgG from human serum. By comparing the N-glycomes from a first morning (AM) versus a...|$|R

Because quantitative proteomic data are noisy, {{it is necessary to}} develop statistical methods to eliminate false-positives and identify true partners. We present here a novel approach for filtering false interactors, named "SAFER" for mass Spectrometry data Analysis by Filtering of Experimental Replicates, which is based on the reproducibility of the replicates and the fold-change of the protein intensities between bait and control. To identify regulators or targets of autophagy, we characterized the interactors of LGG 1, a ubiquitin-like protein involved in autophagosome formation in C. elegans. LGG- 1 partners were purified by affinity, analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS mass spectrometry, and quantified by a label-free proteomic approach based on the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> intensity of peptide precursor ions. Because the selection of confident interactions depends on the method used for statistical analysis, we compared SAFER with several statistical tests and different scoring algorithms on this set of data. We show that SAFER recovers high-confidence interactors that have been ignored by the other methods and identified new candidates involved in the autophagy process. We further validated our method on a public data set and conclude that SAFER notably improves the identification of protein interactors...|$|E
40|$|The ubiquitin-proteasome {{system is}} a central {{mechanism}} for controlled proteolysis that regulates numerous cellular processes in eukaryotes. As such, defects in this system can contribute to disease pathogenesis. In this pathway, E 3 ubiquitin ligases provide platforms for binding specific substrates, thereby coordinating their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Despite the identification of many E 3 ubiquitin ligases, the identities of their specific substrates are still largely unresolved. The ankyrin repeat-containing protein with a suppressor of cytokine signaling box 2 (ASB 2) gene that we initially identified as a retinoic acid-response gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells encodes the specificity subunit of an E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation. We have recently identified filamin A and filamin B as the first ASB 2 targets and shown that ASB 2 triggers ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of these proteins. Here a global quantitative proteomics strategy is provided to identify substrates of E 3 ubiquitin ligases targeted to proteasomal degradation. Indeed we used label-free methods for quantifying proteins identified by shotgun proteomics in extracts of cells expressing wild-type ASB 2 or an E 3 ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant of ASB 2 {{under the control of}} an inducible promoter. Measurements of spectral count and mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> intensity demonstrated a drastic decrease of filamin A and filamin B in myeloid leukemia cells expressing wild-type ASB 2 compared with cells expressing an E 3 ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant of ASB 2.

In this thesis a further insight of the atmospheric pressure ionisation processes electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) has been endeavoured, to provide a deeper understanding of and ways to minimize this bias. A response model for ESI has been modified and used to study the influence of solvent composition on the observed mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal.</b> The response model divides the response into an analyte partitioning coefficient and an instrumental response factor. A number of experimental parameters influencing the response were investigated including spray position relative to the orifice, spray potential, nebulizer and curtain gas flow rates, ionic strength and organic content of the sprayed solution. The history of the generated droplets turned out to be of significant importance to both the partitioning coefficients and the instrumental response factor. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} total ionic strength and not only the electrolyte concentration will influence the instrumental response factor. In addition, based on the importance of hydrophobicity and electrophoretic mobility, a model was proposed for the ion distribution within the electrosprayed droplets. The coupling of an electrochemical (EC) cell to a mass spectrometric (MS) system has been evaluated. The coupling of the EC cell to the MS was made to decouple the cell from the high voltage circuit of the ESI.

The pesticide particles with {{the diameter of}} hundreds of nanometers are generated by the homogeneous nucleation method using azelaic acid as nucleus. The reactions are carried out in an aerosol reaction chamber under ambient pressure (1 atm) and room temperature (298 K), respectively. The time-of-flight mass spectra of the solid-state ozonation products of malathion and chlorpyrifos are obtained. The assignments of the mass spectra reveal that the major ozonation products of malathion particles are s-(1, 2 -diethoxycarbonynl) ethyl-O,O-dimethylphosphorothioate (malaoxon), 2 -mercapto-succinic acid diethylester, 1, 2 -dicarbethoxyethyl-dimethoxyphosphinyldisulfide and bis(1, 2 -bis-ethoxycarbonylethyl) disulfide. The experimental results reveal that water vapor can enhance the formation of malaoxon, 2 -mercapto-succinic acid diethylester and bis(1, 2 -bis-ethoxycarbonyl-ethyl) disulfide. In the case of chlorpyrifos, the sole ozonation product observed is 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyl-diethylphosphate (chlorpyrifos oxon).

40|$|Two simple {{interfaces}} {{were designed}} and realized, enabling on-line coupling of microfluidics reactor chips to a nanoflow electrospray ionization (NESI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (MS). The interfaces {{are based on}} two different approaches: a monolithically integrated design, in which ionization is assisted by on-chip gas nebulization, and a modular approach implying the use of commercially available Picospray 2 tips. Using reserpine as a reference compound in a 1 : 1 mixture of acetonitrile and water revealed that both interfaces provide a remarkably stable mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> (standard deviations lower than 8 % and 1 % for the monolithic and modular approaches, respectively). Glass microreactors, containing mixing zones, were fabricated and coupled to the modular interface with perfluoroelastomer Nanoport 2 fluidics connectors, providing a tool to study chemical reactions on-line. Investigation of the mixing dynamics showed that complete on-chip reagents mixing is achieved within a few tens of milliseconds. Metal–ligand interactions of Zn-porphyrin 1 with pyridine (2), 4 -ethylpyridine (3), 4 -phenylpyridine (4), N-methylimidazole (5), and N-butylimidazole (6) in acetonitrile as well as host–guest complexations of b-cyclodextrin (7) with N-(1 -adamantyl) acetamide (8) or 4 -tert- butylacetanilide (9) in water were studied by mass spectrometry using the modular NESI-chip interface. From on-chip dilution-based mass spectrometric titrations of Zn-porphyrin 1 with pyridine (2) or 4 -phenylpyridine (4) in acetonitrile Ka-values of 4. 6 +/- 0. 4 6 103 M 21 and 6. 5 +/- 1. 2 6 103 M 21, respectively, were calculated. The Ka-values are about four times larger than those obtained with UV/vis spectroscopy in solution, probably due to a higher ionization efficiency of complexed compared to uncomplexed Zn-porphyrin. For the complexation of N-(1 -adamantyl) acetamide (8) with b-cyclodextrin (7), a Ka-value of 3. 6 +/- 0. 3 6 104 M 21 was obtained, which is in good agreement with that determined by microcalorimetry...|$|E

Neutral and ion-induced nucleation experiments, i. e. without and {{with the presence of}} ions, respectively, were carried out under precisely controlled conditions. The sulfuric acid concentration was measured with a chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (CIMS) during the new particle formation experiments. The added ternary trace gases were ammonia (NH 3), dimethylamine (DMA, $C_ 2 H_ 7 N$) or oxidised products of pinanediol (PD, $C_{ 10 }H_{ 18 }O_ 2 $). When pinanediol was introduced into the chamber, an increase in the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> used to determine the sulfuric acid concentration (m/z 97, i. e. $HSO_ 4 $−) was observed due to ions from the CLOUD chamber. The enhancement was only observed during ion-induced nucleation measurements by using either galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) or the proton synchrotron (PS) pion beam for the ion generation, respectively. The ion effect typically involved an increase in the apparent sulfuric acid concentration by a factor of ~ 2 to 3 and was qualitatively verified by the ion measurements with an atmospheric-pressure interface-time of flight (APi-TOF) mass spectrometer. By applying a high-voltage (HV) clearing field inside the CLOUD chamber, the ion effect on the CIMS measurement was completely eliminated since, under these conditions, small ions are swept from the chamber in about 1 s. In order to exclude the ion effect and to provide corrected sulfuric acid concentrations during the GCR and PS beam nucleation experiments, a parameterisation was derived that utilises the trace gas concentrations and the UV light intensity as input parameters.

KEML {{studies were carried out}} in a large temperature range (398 - 567) K by using effusion orifices with 0. 3, 1, and 3 mm diameters. The vapor pressures so measured revealed no kinetically hindered vaporization effects and provided second-law vaporization enthalpies at the mean experimental temperatures in close agreement with literature. By exploiting the large temperature range covered, the heat capacity change associated with vaporization was estimated, resulting in a value of - 66. 8 J K- 1 mol(- 1), much lower than that predicted from calorimetric measurements on the liquid phase and theoretical calculations on the gas phase. The conversion of the high temperature vaporization enthalpy to 298 K was discussed and the value Delta H-g(l) m(298 K) = (128. 6 +/- 1. 3) kJ mol(- 1) assessed on the basis of data from literature and present work. Vapor pressure data were also processed by the third-law procedure using different estimations for the auxiliary thermal functions, and a Delta H-g(l) m(298 K) consistent with the assessed value was obtained, although the overall agreement is sensitive to the accuracy of heat capacity data. KEMS measurements were carried out in the lower temperature range (393 - 467) K and showed that the largely prevailing ion species is BMIm(+), supporting the common view of BMImNTf(2) vaporizing as individual, neutral ion pairs also under equilibrium conditions. By monitoring the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> of this ion as a function of temperature, a second-law Delta H-g(l) m(298 K) of 129. 4 +/- 7. 3 kJ mol(- 1) was obtained, well consistent with KEML and literature results.

We hypothesized that organic compounds exuded by sugar beet roots solubilize soil P and that this exudation is stimulated by P starvation. Results Root exudates were collected from plants grown in hydroponics under low- and high-P availability. Exudate components were separated by HPLC, ionized by electrospray, and detected by mass spectrometry {{in the range of}} mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) from 100 to 1000. Eight mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals</b> were enhanced at least 5 -fold by low P availability at all harvest times. Among these signals, negative ions with an m/z of 137 and 147 were shown to originate from salicylic acid and citramalic acid. The ability of both compounds to mobilize soil P was demonstrated by incubation of pure substances with Oxisol soil fertilized with calcium phosphate. Conclusions Root exudates of sugar beet contain salicylic acid and citramalic acid, the latter of which has rarely been detected in plants so far. Both metabolites solubilize soil P and their exudation by roots is stimulated by P deficiency. These results provide the first assignment of a biological function to citramalic acid of plant origin. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-throughput}} {{method is}} described, where the enantioselectivity of approximately 10 000 catalysts or biocatalysts {{can be determined}} per day. The method is based on electrospray mass spectrometric techniques using an eight- channel multiplexed (MUX) sprayer system connected to a time- of-flight mass spectrometer. The inlet of the ion source is controlled by a stepping rotor that is continuously moving from one sprayer to the next with a recording time of 100 ms for each channel and a delay time of 50 ms, thus allowing a spectrum to be obtained from each channel every 1. 2 s. One cycle, where eight samples are being sprayed in parallel, requires around 70 s, which allows a 96 -well microtiter plate to be screened in 14 min. Integration of two pseudo-enantiomers (S) -glycidyl phenyl ether and (R) -D- 5 -glycidyl phenyl ether is necessary to quantify the enantiomeric excess (ee-value), where one enantiomer is isotopically labeled to allow easy identification of the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals.</b> Errors of similar to 2 % for the ee-values indicate {{that in addition to}} the significant improvement in sample throughput this is also a precise method for high-throughput screening.

40|$|A {{dynamic method}} {{is applied to}} measure the {{mobility}} of gas-phase ions in the dual ion funnel interface of the electrospray source of a quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer. In a new operational mode, a potential barrier was formed in the second ion funnel of the mass spectrometer and then progressively increased. In this region, a flow of gas drags the ions into the mass spectrometer while the electric force applied by the potential barrier decelerates them. Ions with lower mobility can be carried by the gas flow more easily than those with high mobility. Thus, electrical forces can block the more mobile ions more easily. Hence, the electric barrier formed in the ion funnel permits only ions below a certain mobility threshold to enter the mass spectrometer. When the barrier voltage is increased, this threshold moves from high to low mobilities. Ions with mobilities above the threshold cannot enter the mass spectrometer, and their signal decreases to zero. Thus, in a barrier voltage scan, mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals</b> of ions sequentially disappear. Differentiation of these decreasing ion signal curves produces peaks from which an ion mobility spectrum can be reconstructed. Blocking voltages, i. e., {{the positions of the}} peaks on the barrier voltage scale are directly related to the mobility of these ions. An internal calibration using ions with known mobility values helps determine the unknown ion mobilities and allows calculation of ionic cross sections...|$|R

Environmental stressors such as ocean acidification (OA) potentially affect DOM production and degradation processes, e. g., phytoplankton exudation or microbial uptake and biotransformation of molecules. Resulting changes in carbon storage {{capacity of the}} ocean, thus, may cause feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. Previous experiments studying OA effects on the DOM pool under natural conditions, however, were mostly conducted in temperate and coastal eutrophic areas. Here, we report on OA effects on the existing and newly produced DOM pool during an experiment in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean at the Canary Islands during an (1) oligotrophic phase and (2) after simulated deep water upwelling. The last is a frequently occurring event in this region controlling nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics. We manipulated nine large-scale mesocosms with a gradient of pCO 2 ranging from ~ 350 up to ~ 1, 030 μatm and monitored the DOM molecular composition using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry via Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). An increase of 37 μmol L− 1 DOC was observed in all mesocosms during a phytoplankton bloom induced by simulated upwelling. Indications for enhanced DOC accumulation under elevated CO 2 became apparent during a phase of nutrient recycling {{toward the end of}} the experiment. The production of DOM was reflected in changes of the molecular DOM composition. Out of the 7, 212 molecular formulae, which were detected throughout the experiment, ~ 50 % correlated significantly in mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> intensity with cumulative bacterial protein production (BPP) and are likely a product of microbial transformation. However, no differences in the produced compounds were found with respect to CO 2 levels. Comparing the results of this experiment with a comparable OA experiment in the Swedish Gullmar Fjord, reveals similar succession patterns for individual compound pools during a phytoplankton bloom and subsequent accumulation of these compounds were observed.

Discrete frequency noise in the emission at the mass spectrometer sampling orifice {{was found to be}} nearly identical to that in the mass spectrometer signal. However, discrete frequency noise in emission from the plasma alone differed substantially in frequency from that in the mass spectrometer signal. The dependence of noise frequencies on plasma operating conditions was generally the same for the mass spectrometric measurements and both emission measurements. These results indicate that the plasma was the source of discrete frequency noise in the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal.</b> The major source of signal instability in this particular ICP-mass spectrometer was found to be 1 /f noise;A new, home-made ICP-mass spectrometer was used to study the influence of Na, K, and U on ion signals from Y, Co, and As. In general, analyte signals were suppressed in the presence of excess matrix element. The extent of suppression was greatest for the element with high ionization energy (As) and least for the element with the smallest ionization energy (Y). These trends in the interference effect could be altered by applying a positive voltage to the first element of the ion optics. When the skimmer orifice diameter was made smaller than the sampling orifice diameter, analyte signal suppression was uniform and more extensive. Under these conditions, the heavy matrix element (U) induced more suppression than did the light matrix element (Na);Degrees of ionization for As and Sb in an inductively coupled plasma were measured using mass spectrometry, and electron density (n[subscript] e) in the plasma just upstream of the mass spectrometer sampling orifice was measured from Stark broadening of the H I 486. 13 nm emission line. These data were used to calculate ionization temperature (T[subscript] ion) for Sb and As over the range of plasma conditions studied. Variations of Sb T[subscript] ion with plasma conditions were consistent with those expected of the ICP itself, however, such was not always the case for As T[subscript] ion.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for investigating chiral recognition in the gas phase in the absence of perturbing environmental phenomena and discriminating and even quantifying chiral species by interaction with chiral reference molecules. A small library of synthetic receptors was prepared by macrocyclization of complementary A and B fragments to yield A 2 B 2 macrocycles, where A are activated forms of isophthalic acid derivatives and B are chiral, C 2 symmetric 1, 2 -diamines derived from 1, 2 -diphenylethylendiamine. Their enantioselectivity was investigated by ESI-MS and revealed large enantioselectivities towards the enantiomers of aminoacids and peptide guests. The stability of the complexes increases with the size of guests and with large aromatic portions on the guest. Part C This part of my academic program was developed at the University of California, Davis, under the supervision of prof. Carlito Lebrilla, during the last period of my Ph. D. activity. An important goal in proteomic is to quantify the profile changes of protein abundances in biological systems. Quantifying these changes is a key to understand changes in cell state at a molecular level. In the last years label-free quantitation using MRM (multiple reaction monitoring), which correlates the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> of intact proteolytic peptides with the relative or absolute protein quantity, is become a powerful tool for accurate quantitation. Here we report a label-free method to quantify proteins and their glycoforms in biologic fluids (milk, feces and urine) by MRM, including the selection of proteotryptic peptides and the optimization and validation of transitions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{so-called}} “chemical noise background” {{imposes a}} major {{limit on the}} practical sensitivity of MALDI mass spectrometry. Typically, {{as the amount of}} material of interest subjected to MALDI analysis is reduced, the signal decreases {{to the point where it}} can no longer be differentiated from the chemical noise. Using a newly designed MALDI-ion trap mass spectrometer, we describe experiments intended to throw light on the nature of the chemical noise background and to reduce its effects. Single-stage mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals</b> from peptides were observed to disappear into the noise when the amount of sample applied to the MALDI sample stage was decreased to less than a femtomole. At these low levels, analysis of the collision-induced fragmentation spectra revealed the presence of ions originating from the peptide as well as cluster ions that originate from the chemical noise. The fragmentation pattern arising from dissociation of the cluster species suggests that they are composed largely of matrix molecules. A significant fraction of these cluster ions can be dissociated at activation energies lower than the threshold for peptide fragmentation. We used this finding to collisionally pre-activate MALDI ions to remove a significant portion of the chemical noise from the spectrum, allowing us to obtain readily discernible single stage MS signals from 100 attomols of peptide. The strategy also yielded high quality MS/MS spectra from 100 attomols of peptide. Different possibilities of collisional pre-activation for improving sensitivity are considered...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the most {{relevant}} advances in chiral analysis and focuses on highly efficient enantioseparations by liquid chromatography and its hyphenation with mass spectrometry (MS). The use of MS for chiral discrimination has been successfully done by enantiomer interaction with chiral reference reagents or environment. This has been achieved by host–guest association, ion–molecule reactions in gas phase or complex dissociation. All modes can provide different mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals</b> for the two enantiomers and relative intensities depending on the enantiomeric ratio that can be experimentally estimated. A more interesting type of analysis in terms of performance and sensitivity is enantio-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) -MS. This chapter examines the recent trends and advances in chiral HPLC columns, highlighting the types of chiral selector, mobile-phase compatibility with MS detection, as well as efficient and innovative column packing particles. Future directions for enantioseparations are development of very efficient chiral columns and ultrafast HPLC runs. The latter topic is indeed {{a consequence of the}} former, due to the high working pressure arising from new-generation chiral stationary phases. The two routes concern, on the one hand, the use of very small fully porous particles (< 2 μm) and, on the other hand, chiral selectors bonded to superficially porous particles (core-shell technology). Some fundamental studies have already been conducted by these authors, particularly to understand deeply the mass transfer kinetics and its influence on band broadening effects in chiral separations. Further studies need to be done on chiral stationary phases obtained with superficially porous particles since some critical aspects are not obvious and could remarkably affect their development...|$|R
40|$|A protein of a {{biological}} sample is usually quantified by immunological techniques based on antibodies. Mass spectrometry offers alternative approaches {{that are not}} dependent on antibody affinity and avidity, protein isoforms, quaternary structures, or steric hindrance of antibody-antigen recognition in case of multiprotein complexes. One approach {{is the use of}} stable isotope-labeled internal standards; another is the direct exploitation of mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals</b> recorded by LC-MS/MS analysis of protein digests. Here we assessed the peptide match score summation index based on probabilistic peptide scores calculated by the PHENYX protein identification engine for absolute protein quantification in accordance with the protein abundance index as proposed by Mann and co-workers (Rappsilber, J., Ryder, U., Lamond, A. I., and Mann, M. (2002) Large-scale proteomic analysis of the human spliceosome. Genome Res. 12, 1231 - 1245). Using synthetic protein mixtures, we demonstrated that this approach works well, although proteins can have different response factors. Applied to high density lipoproteins (HDLs), this new approach compared favorably to alternative protein quantitation methods like UV detection of protein peaks separated by capillary electrophoresis or quantitation of protein spots on SDS-PAGE. We compared the protein composition of a well defined HDL density class isolated from plasma of seven hypercholesterolemia subjects having low or high HDL cholesterol with HDL from nine normolipidemia subjects. The quantitative protein patterns distinguished individuals according to the corresponding concentration and distribution of cholesterol from serum lipid measurements of the same samples and revealed that hypercholesterolemia in unrelated individuals is the result of different deficiencies. The presented approach is complementary to HDL lipid analysis; does not rely on complicated sample treatment, e. g. chemical reactions, or antibodies; and can be used for projective clinical studies of larger patient groups...|$|R
40|$|Chiral {{analysis}} of amino acids {{was achieved by}} investigating the collision-induced dissociation spectra of protonated trimers that were formed from the electrospray ionisation of amino acids {{in the presence of}} one of the following chiral selectors: L-or D- N-t-butoxycarbonylphenylalanine (BPhe), L- or D- N-t-butoxycarbonylproline (BPro) and L- or D- N-t-butoxycarbonyl-O-benzylserine (BBSer). The protonated trimers were dissociated to protonated dimers, and the intensity ratio of the protonated dimer (product ion) to the protonated trimer (precursor ion), i. e., the observed dissociation efficiency r, was found to be strongly dependent on the chirality of the amino acids with respect to that of the chiral selectors. The results showed that the chirality of all 19 common amino acids can be definitely differentiated. The method was demonstrated as rapid, sensitive, precise, robust, and requiring no reference standards and only minimal sample preparation. The chirality of all three amino acids in a mixture was determined without prior separation of the amino acids, consuming only 70 pmole of sample and requiring only about 14 minutes of mass spectrometric measurements. A cyclodipeptide with unknown chirality was determined to be cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Leu) by acid hydrolysis followed by the present method, and the results were consistent with the physiochemical properties and NMR data of the compound. The relationship between an observed mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signal</b> and enantiomeric excess (ee) has been reported to be linear in other previous studies. In the present study, however, both our derivations and experimental results confirmed that the relationship between the r value for an enantiomeric mixture and its ee is hyperbolic, and r = a + b/(c + ee), where a, b and c are constants. A linear calibration plot was obtained by plotting r versus l/(c + ee), where c was calculated with the MATLAB software, or by plotting l/(r - r 0) versus 1 /ee, where r 0 is the r value for the racemic mixture. The latter "Two-Reciprocal" method was more convenient for application. Another practical method for ee determination was the "Three-Point" method, whereby the ee of an unknown sample with a measured r value could be derived from the equation ee = 100 x {l/(rL-r 0) - l/(rD-r 0) } / { 2 /(r-r 0) - l/(rL-r 0) - l/(rD-r 0) }, with rL and rD being the r values for the enantiomerically pure L- and D- forms of the sample respectively. A calibration plot was not required. The ee determination was achieved with acceptable precision even for the worst case of acceptable chiral recognition with a particular chiral selector, suggesting that the ee determination of all 19 common amino acids could be achieved by the present method. The ee of a histidine sample was determined both by the "Two-Reciprocal" method, giving an error of 0. 2 % ee (1. 1 % relative error) and consuming only about 5. 3 nmole of sample, and by the "Three-Point" method, giving an error of 0. 4 % ee and consuming only about 2. 3 nmole of sample. In the latter case, it took 27 minutes for the mass spectrometric measurements of the three calibration standards and an additional 9 minutes for that of the unknown sample. The direct ee determination of more than one amino acids in a mixture was also demonstrated in the study. This study suggested that ESI-MS/MS can be a promising approach for the chiral {{analysis of}} other compounds...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the apical membrane permeability for CO 2 of intact epithelia of proximal and distal colon of the guinea pig. The method used was the mass spectrometric 18 O-exchange technique previously described. In a first step, we determined the intraepithelial carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity by studying vital isolated colonocytes before and after lysis with Triton X- 100. Intraepithelial CA activity {{was found to be}} 41 000 and 900 for proximal and distal colon, respectively. Then 18 O-exchange measurements were done with stripped intact epithelial layers, which on their apical side were exposed to the reaction solution containing 18 O-labelled CO 2 and HCO 3 −. The mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>signals</b> in these measurements are determined by the intracellular epithelial CA activity, and by the apical membrane permeabilities for CO 2 and HCO 3 −, PCO 2 and PHCO 3. From the signals, we calculated the two permeabilities while inserting the CA activities obtained from isolated colonocytes. From layers of intact colon epithelium, the apical PCO 2 was determined to be 1. 5 × 10 − 3 cm s− 1 for proximal and 0. 77 × 10 − 3 cm s− 1 for distal colon. These values are ≥ 200 times lower than the PCO 2 of the human red cell membrane as studied with the same technique (0. 3 cm s− 1). We conclude that the apical membrane offers a significant resistance towards CO 2 diffusion, which implies that a major drop in CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2) will occur across the apical membrane when luminal pCO 2 is higher than basolateral or capillary pCO 2. In view of the very high pCO 2 that can occur in the colonic lumen, this property of the apical membrane constitutes a significant protection of the cell against the high acid load associated with high pCO 2...|$|R

Even where data exist, the efficacy of data-driven approaches is not only dependent on the quantity but also on the quality of system operational data. These data sources may include temperature, pressure, oil debris, currents, voltages, power, vibration and acoustic <b>signal,</b> <b>spectrometric</b> data as well as calibration and calorimetric data.

40|$|The Schiff base {{compound}} 2, 2 '-{[(2 -aminoethyl) imino]bis[2, 1 -ethanediyl-nitriloethylidyne]}bis- 2 -hydroxy-benzoic acid (H(4) L) as a proligand {{was prepared}} in situ. This proligand has three potential coordination pockets which {{make it possible}} to accommodate from one to three metal ions allowing for the possible formation of mono-, di-, and trinuclear complexes. Reaction of in situ prepared H(4) L with Dy(NO(3)) (3) · 5 H(2) O resulted in the formation of a mononuclear complex [Dy(H(3) L) (2) ](NO(3)) ·(EtOH) · 8 (H(2) O) (1), which shows SMM behavior. In contrast, reaction of in situ prepared H(4) L with Mn(ClO(4)) (2) · 6 H(2) O and Dy(NO(3)) (3) · 5 H(2) O {{in the presence of a}} base resulted in a trinuclear mixed 3 d- 4 f complex (NHEt(3)) (2) [Dy{Mn(L) }(2) ](ClO(4)) · 2 (H(2) O) (2). At low temperatures, compound 2 is a weak ferromagnet. Thus, the SMM behavior of compound 1 can be switched off by incorporating two Mn(II) ions in close proximity either side of the Dy(III). This quenching behavior is ascribed to the presence of the weak ferromagnetic interactions between the Mn(II) and Dy(III) ions, which at T > 2 K act as a fluctuating field causing the reversal of magnetization on the dysprosium ion. Mass <b>spectrometric</b> ion <b>signals</b> related to compounds 1 and 2 were both detected in positive and negative ion modes via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

40|$|Porous layer open tubular (PLOT) {{columns and}} immobilized trypsin open tubular (TOT) columns of 10 μm inner {{diameter}} (i. d.) {{were made and}} characterized for fast intact protein analysis and protein digestion, respectively. A 0. 1 mg/mL standard protein solution of cytochrome C, myoglobin, and carbonic anhydrase was used to investigate the PLOT column performance and on-column trypsination was investigated using 5 and 0. 3 mg/mL cytochrome C solutions. Mobile phase combination of A (H 2 O/FA/TFA, 100 / 0. 1 / 0. 05, v/v/v) and B (ACN/H 2 O/FA/TFA, 90 / 10 / 0. 1 / 0. 05, v/v/v/v) were used for protein separation on PLOT columns and mobile phase combination of A (50 mM NH 4 OAc pH 8. 75) and B (ACN) were used for protein digestion on the TOT columns. The optimal combination of flow rate and gradient time for separation of intact proteins on the poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) PLOT column was explored {{in the range of}} 20 to 80 nL/min, and 60 nL/min was found as the efficient flow rate regarding peak shape and peak width at a gradient time of 40 min. The mass <b>spectrometric</b> (MS) <b>signal</b> intensity was found to depend on flow rate and the temperature in the investigated range from 25 to 80 ℃. Gradient steepness on different column lengths, and column i. d. s, was also examined. Long columns provided better performance at longer gradient times. At elevated flow rates the pressure increases, thus 60 ℃ was found as the optimal temperature at 60 nL/min. The optimal gradient time on a 3 m long column at a flow rate of 60 nL/min was 15 min. Due to difficulties with mass spectrometric detection of many intact proteins the possibility of an on-line digestion using a TOT column was explored. Unfortunately, no digestion was observed with continuous flow at 150 nL/min. Different stop flow times from 20 to 120 s, and 15 min at different flow rates from 20 to 340 nL/min at temperatures 25 and 37 ℃, different amount of ACN within a range of 5 to 90 % at 25 ℃, and 37 ℃ and column length in the range of 27 to 50 cm was examined to obtain digestion, and a 2 min stop flow time at 37 ℃ were found as optimal digestion time and temperature, respectively. Shorter columns gave better digestion and a column length of 30 cm column was found to be optimal. Proteins mostly elute from a reversed phase column within a range of 40 to 90 % of ACN. No difference in protein digestion on the TOT column was found in the range 40 to 90 % of ACN, at both 25 and 37 ℃...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{shortage}} of fossil fuels the use of lignin as a renewable resource is of great global importance. In this work two representative spent liquors from the two dominant processes in the paper and pulp industry were examined. First sum parameters (e. g. content of lignin and carbohydrates) and inorganic components of the liquors were analyzed. Because of large amounts of inorganic compounds in sulfate spent liquor and high sugar content in sulfite spent liquor lignin degradation products were isolated by well-known methods. The development of analytical methods was performed by lignin model compounds. In addition to commercially available monomeric substances several dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric compounds with lignin typical linkages were synthesized. Due to {{the large number of}} lignin degradation products in spent liquors a GCxGC-(TOF) MS method was developed. With this method monomeric and dimeric lignin model compounds can be analyzed. Even after derivatization trimeric and tetrameric substance cannot be recognized. The optimized method was applied to the examination of the isolated lignin degradation products. It was confirmed that spent liquors are complex mixtures of many compounds which even cannot be separated by comprehensive gas chromatography. So a fractionation of the degradation products via a successive soxhlet-extraction method using different solvents became necessary. After the fractionation some monomers were identified by GCxGC-(TOF) -MS. Afterwards a liquid chromatography method for the identification of high molecular compounds was developed. The developed and optimized HPLC-method shows signals in the DAD-chromatogram. With a mass <b>spectrometric</b> detection no <b>signals</b> were available. Therefore a mass spectrometric analysis method with direct injection using model substances was developed and transferred to the real samples. The mass spectrometric method enables a qualification of many substances. Using a high-resolution mass spectrometer it is possible to determine the molecular formula by detecting masses with a precision of ± 0. 02 Da. According to the molecular formula double-bound-equivalents were calculated. In particular MS/MS experiments could obtain information about the number of methoxygroups and the presence of ß-O- 4 ´-linkages and sulfonic acid groups. According to this method several proposals for the structures of 35 monomers in isolated lignosulphonates were evaluated. Eleven monomeric structures include sulfonic acid groups. Additionally eight C-C-linked dimers were identified. Furthermore masses of trimers, tetramers and pentamers were detected. In kraft lignin, isolated from the sulphate liquor, 27 monomers and 21 dimers were identified. In addition, high molecular weight substances with masses up to 680 Da were determined in this liquor. MS/MS experiments have shown that there are no ß-O- 4 '- linkages in the identified compounds. Up to now the masses of detected trimers, tetramers and pentamers were only postulated in literature. So these exact masses were discovered for the first time. Various determined substances, for example long-chain aromatic structures or condensation products, do not originate from wood and can only be formed during the pulping process. All identified substances have a uniform basic structure. Therefore the use of the uniform lignin degradation products seems reasonable. For example unification could be performed by hydrogenation. The received substances could serve as renewable raw materials for other chemical products...|$|R
