40|$|BACKGROUND: Integrated {{healthcare}} {{delivery systems}} present unique opportunities for cancer survivorship research. The National Cancer Institute funds the Cancer Research Network (CRN) to leverage these capabilities {{for all types}} of cancer research, including survivorship. METHODS: The authors gathered information from a recent CRN funding application, Survivorship Interest Group materials, the CRN website, and published articles. CRN studies were selected to illustrate diverse topics and a variety of data-collection approaches. RESULTS: The 14 systems that participate in the CRN provide care for approximately 10. 8 million individuals of all ages and racial/ethnic backgrounds, for whom approximately 38, 000 new cancer diagnoses were made in 2005. CRN systems have the ability to use existing data and collect new data on patients, providers, and organizations through well established research centers staffed by independent scientists. Of the 45 funded and 2 pending CRN grant applications as of November 30, 2007, 21 include aspects related to cancer <b>survivorship.</b> These <b>studies</b> have examined clinical trial participation, patterns of care, age and racial/ethnic disparities, diffusion of clinical trial findings, treatment outcomes, surveillance, and end-of-life and palliative care.

40|$|The Children's Cancer <b>Survivorship</b> <b>Study</b> reports more chronic {{illnesses}} in sarcoma survivors than other pediatric cancers. Chemotherapy and radiation put survivors {{at risk for}} developing {{chronic illnesses}}, including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney failure. Sarcoma survivors may have a reduced life expectancy and signs of heart disease in their 30 s and 40 s. Since these medical problems occur much later in the general population, they often go undetected or misdiagnosed in sarcoma survivors, creating delays in intervention and treatment. The {{good news is that}} these chronic illnesses can often be prevented or minimized. The most common adverse effect of chemotherapy and radiation is coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD has a number of risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. These risk factors are modifiable with lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, and/or pharmacological intervention. By identifying and managing risk factors like hypertension early, we in turn reduce the risk for CAD and prolong survival. This is well established in the general population; there is no reason a priori not to apply it to sarcoma survivors.

40|$|Background: This article {{presents}} {{a subset of}} findings {{on the experience of}} bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMAB) from an Australian hematology <b>survivorship</b> <b>study.</b> Objective: The aim of the larger research was to document and explore issues associated with the experience of survivorship for hematology patients supported by Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland. The experience with BMABs was one of the issues explored. Interventions/Methods: The qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 50 individuals with a diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy from a range of locations throughout Queensland, Australia. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and then analyzed thematically. Results: The findings demonstrate that, for many of the hematology patients in the study, BMABs were a painful experience. The findings indicate that a major contributing factor to the pain and discomfort is the lack of effective procedural care. Conclusions: The findings emphasized the importance of the provision of choice with regard to anesthesia or sedation as part of the procedural care for BMABs. Implications for Practice: The insights provide urgency to the call for further research to improve clinical practice and procedural care in relation to BMABs. The strong recommendation from the study is that procedural pain in relation to BMABs for hematology patients be managed from the initial procedure as the consequences of a traumatic experience can be far reaching, particularly in light of the need for repeated BMABs over the treatment trajectory. As specialist nurses are now increasingly taking responsibility for carrying out such procedures, the findings have implications for the nursing profession.

Research Paper I is an exploratory, qualitative study to investigate breast cancer survivors' experiences with breastfeeding (N= 11). Research Paper II is a nested case-control study to evaluate {{physical and mental health}} differences among women who had a child after breast cancer compared to those who did not (N= 81). Research Paper III is a cohort study evaluating the association between long-term depressive symptoms and post -diagnosis reproductive concerns (N= 131). All three studies include participants diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at age 40 or younger who participated in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) study (N= 3088), a multiyear randomized trial of a dietary intervention. Research Paper I includes a purposeful sample of 11 survivors who had a child after treatment ended. We conducted open-ended semi-structured interviews and used cross-case inductive analysis to identify themes. Ten of 11 participants initiated breastfeeding. The main themes were: 1) Cautiously hopeful, 2) Exhausting to rely on one breast, 3) Motivated despite challenges, 4) Support and lack of support, and 5) Encouraging to others. Participants were motivated to breastfeed but faced significant challenges, largely due to a reliance on one lactating breast. Research Paper II is a nested case- control study involving 81 WHEL participants, 27 cases who had a child after cancer and 54 controls who did not (matched on age and stage at diagnosis). This study explores a selection bias indicating that cancer survivors who become pregnant are a self-selected healthier group. After controlling for covariates in a multilevel model, physical health was not different between groups but mental health was marginally higher among cases, meeting a level of clinical significance. Research Paper III is a cohort study involving 131 WHEL participants who participated in a continuation <b>survivorship</b> <b>study.</b> This study investigates whether recalled concerns about reproduction after breast cancer treatment are associated with long-term depressive symptoms, monitored at up to 6 time-points.

40|$|As the acreage of glyphosate-resistant (GR) {{cropping}} systems increases, {{so does the}} occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds in the landscape. Biotypes of GR Conyza canadensis were first observed in Delaware, USA, in 2000. Since the first documentation of GR C. canadensis, {{there have been many}} instances of independent evolution of GR C. canadensis biotypes. The ecology of GR C. canadensis and any potential fitness consequences of GR trait are still unknown. If there is no fitness cost or a fitness increase associated with the GR trait, GR C. canadensis may increase in prevalence in the landscape {{even in the absence of}} glyphosate application. With the consideration that fitness is a difficult parameter to measure, other variables may be used as surrogate measures of fitness, such as reproduction, growth rate, phenology, survivorship, etc. This research seeks to determine if differences exist in surrogate measures of fitness - patterns of growth, reproductive allocation, and competitive ability - and if so, how differences may apply to future population changes, for glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible C. canadensis. The first two experiments presented test two populations of GR plants and two populations of GS plants, first in a greenhouse study of shading effects and intraspecific competition (Chapter 2), and second in a field <b>survivorship</b> <b>study</b> within two habitat types (Chapter 3). The third study tests for the prevalence of GR C. canadensis in field margins of GR {{cropping systems}} and seeks correlations in the occurrence of resistance and factors related to geography and field management (Chapter 4). The greenhouse study (Experiment 1, Chapter 2) of surrogate measures of fitness (growth, reproduction) in response to intraspecific competitive ability and shading showed that, while all populations had the same response to shading, there were differences between populations in growth and reproduction. While all measures were greater for individual plants with no competition, plants competing with individuals from one of the GR populations (R 2) often had measures that were not different from the no competition treatment or were greater than the other competition treatments (R 1, S 1, and S 2). The field <b>survivorship</b> <b>study</b> compared growth, survival, and reproduction of the previously studied four populations of C. canadensis is two habitats, a old-field in the second year of succession (ruderal) and a soybean field planted with a GR cultivar (agrestal) (Experiment 2, Chapter 3). One of the GR populations (R 1) had the highest survivorship of the four populations in the ruderal habitat, while there was no difference in survivorship of the four populations in the agrestal habitat. While there was little difference in growth between ruderal populations, in the agrestal habitat, one GS population (S 1) consistently had the smallest diameter, height, and leaf number. One of the agrestal GR populations (R 2) was larger than the others, though not always different from R 1. R 1 was the first population to senesce regardless of habitat. Both agrestal GR populations produced more capitulae (seed heads) than the GS populations, and R 1 also showed high reproductive success in the ruderal habitat. A test for the occurrence of GR C. canadensis in field margins of GR cropping systems (Experiment 3, Chapter 4) utilized a discriminating spray test on seed collected from the margins of 17 agricultural fields in 2008 from Illinois, Indiana, and Nebraska. The relationships between the occurrence of GR C. canadensis in 2008 field margins and 1) geography, 2) field management practices, 3) herbicide diversity, 4) weed community diversity, 5) field-interior changes in C. canadensis populations (λ), and 6) knowledge or suspicion of difficult-to-control C. canadensis populations, were tested. Geography was the clearest relationship in these data and was related to geography, with greater, more variable occurrence of GR C. canadensis in 2008 field margins in the southern and eastern sites than the northern and western sites. Management practices in field-interiors from year 2006 to 2008 had little relationship to occurrence of GR C. canadensis in 2008 field margins, except for the increased use of tillage and the increased use of non-glyphosate herbicide modes of action in 2007 field-interiors of fields with the highest occurrence of GR C. canadensis in the field margins in 2008. Additionally, the greatest occurrence of GR C. canadensis was associated with high diversity in the weed community in 2007 field-interiors. These results suggest that GR C. canadensis persisted in 2008 field margins even though there was a perceivable increase in management intensity the previous year. In conclusion, although there were no differences in fitness clearly associated with the GR trait in C. canadensis, GR populations may possess equal or greater vigor in growth, reproduction, and competition as GS populations. Based on these results, GR C. canadensis may persist in agricultural field-margins or other ruderal, unmanaged habitats and act as a seed source for future field-interior infestations. Depending on the characteristics of the GR biotype, GR C. canadensis may increase in frequency in the landscape...|$|E

It is important to identify prognostic factors for late breast cancer events. The authors investigated time-varying effects of tumor characteristics on breast-cancer-free survival using data on 3, 088 breast cancer survivors from 4 US states who participated in a randomized dietary intervention trial in 1995 – 2006, with maximum follow-up through 15 years (median, 9 years). A piecewise constant penalized spline approach incorporating time-varying coefficients was adopted, allowing for deviations from the proportional hazards assumption. This method is more flexible than standard approaches, provides direct estimates of hazard ratios across time intervals, and is computationally tractable. Having a stage II or III tumor {{was associated with a}} 3 -fold higher hazard of breast cancer than having a stage I tumor during the first 2. 5 years after diagnosis; this hazard ratio decreased to 2. 1 after 7. 7 years, but higher tumor stage remained a significant risk factor. Similar diminishing effects were found for poorly differentiated tumors. Interestingly, having a positive estrogen receptor status was protective up to 4 years after diagnosis but detrimental after 7. 7 years (hazard ratio = 1. 5).

For small endotherms that are native to high-altitude environments, {{this is not}} always a viable strategy, as the capacity for sustained aerobic thermogenesis is critical for survival during periods of prolonged cold stress. For example, <b>survivorship</b> <b>studies</b> of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) have demonstrated that thermogenic capacity is under strong directional selection at high altitude. Here, we integrate measures of whole-organism thermogenic performance with measures of metabolic enzyme activities and genomic transcriptional profiles to examine the mechanistic underpinnings of adaptive variation in this complex trait in deer mice that are native to different elevations. We demonstrate that highland deer mice have an enhanced thermogenic capacity under hypoxia compared with lowland conspecifics and a closely related lowland species, Peromyscus leucopus. Our findings suggest that the enhanced thermogenic performance of highland deer mice is largely attributable to an increased capacity to oxidize lipids as a primary metabolic fuel source. This enhanced capacity for aerobic thermogenesis is associated with elevated activities of muscle metabolic enzymes that influence flux through fatty-acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in high-altitude deer mice and by concomitant changes in the expression of genes in these same pathways. Contrary to predictions derived from studies of humans at high altitude, our results suggest that selection to sustain prolonged thermogenesis under hypoxia promotes a shift in metabolic fuel use in favor of lipids over carbohydrates...|$|R

It has been hypothesized that color {{is due to}} absorption of pigment from the host 2 ̆ 7 s diet and that color increases the probability of transmission to the next host. Yet, published data are not convincing, alternative hypotheses have not been explored, and {{the function of the}} pigment remains unknown. My research investigates alternative explanations for integumental pigmentation in C. constrictum larvae. One alternative is that the pigment acts as a biological sunscreen, shielding larvae from harmful ultraviolet radiation. High performance liquid chromatography indicated the pigment is the carotenoid astaxanthin, a potent anti-oxidant, and is present in both amphipods and parasites. Exposure of experimentally infected amphipods to natural levels of UV light did not alter larval development or host survival. A second alternative is that the carotenoid is metabolically and nutritionally essential for developing larvae. When amphipods were fed an artificial diet lacking carotenoids, larval development was delayed and ability to infect the next host (Anas discors) was significantly reduced. Further, <b>survivorship</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that high intensity infections deplete amphipods of nutrients, often castrating females, and increasing host mortality. Protein biochemistry indicated that a carotenoid-protein complex is the most likely nutrient being taken from the amphipod by developing larvae. Results from experimental and biochemical studies are consistent with the hypothesis that an amphipod carotenoprotein is a vital nutrient for C. constrictum and {{is the source of the}} orange carotenoid. This is an important finding because very little is known about the nutrition and metabolism of larval acanthocephalans. ...|$|R
40|$|Lymphedema (LE) is {{a life-long}} {{potential}} consequence {{of breast cancer}} treatment that may affect {{quality of life of}} breast cancer survivors in long-term <b>survivorship.</b> Previous <b>studies</b> reported that about 2 million women living with breast cancer are at a lifetime risk for LE development. Information from self-reported lymphedema symptoms and its management will provide potential early detection and intervention to manage LE.

Thirty-one patients (34 hips, 21 percent of study group) smoked {{at the time of}} surgery. Of 13 components (seven cups, five cemented and one cementless stem) revised for aseptic loosening, eight (8 / 68, 11. 8 percent) were revised in six smokers, and five (5 / 262, 1. 9 percent) were revised in four nonsmokers (p= 0. 0012). Multivariate covariate analysis revealed a 4. 5 times greater risk of implant loosening in smokers (p= 0. 0662). Based on this preliminary study, further larger studies should be performed to determine the extent that smoking may contribute to THA survivorship...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of failure for unicompartmental arthroplasty are poorly understood. There is some suggestion that long term ligament degeneration, particularly of the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL), may affect long term <b>survivorship.</b> This <b>study</b> evaluated whether the cruciate mechanism remained functional {{in the long term}} (10 years) following UKA. Two separate cohorts of patients who had undergone St Georg Sled medial compartmental arthroplasty had knee kinematics assessed using an established fluoroscopic technique. One group (early) was assessed at a mean of 46 months (3. 8 years) since surgery, whilst the other (late) was assessed at a mean of 125 months (10. 4) following surgery. No significant difference was found in the sagittal plane kinematics between the two groups or in comparison to the control normal knee. The results suggest that after fixed bearing UKA the cruciate mechanism remains intact over time and the ligaments continue to function similarly to those of the normal knee...|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in medical}} technology, in genetics, and in {{clinical}} research {{have led to}} early detection of cancer, precise diagnosis, and effective treatment modalities. Decline in cancer incidence and mortality due to cancer has led to increased number of long-term survivors. However, the ethnic minority population has not experienced this decline and still continues to carry a disparate proportion of the cancer burden. Majority of the clinical research including <b>survivorship</b> <b>studies</b> have recruited and continue to recruit a convenient sample of middle- to upper-class Caucasian survivors. Thus, minorities are underrepresented in cancer research {{in terms of both}} clinical studies and in health related quality of life (HRQOL) studies. ^ Life style and diet have been associated with increased risk of breast cancer. High vegetable low fat diet has been shown to reduce recurrence of breast cancer and early death. The Women 2 ̆ 7 s Healthy Eating and Living Study is an ongoing multi-site randomized controlled trial that is evaluating the high-vegetable low fat diet in reducing the recurrence of breast cancer and early death. The purpose of this dissertation was to (1) compare the impact of the modified diet on the HRQOL during the first 12 -month period on specific Minorities and matched Caucasians; (2) identify predictors that significantly impact the HRQOL of the study participants; and (3) using the structural equation modeling assess the impact of nutrition on the HRQOL of the intervention group participants. Findings suggest that there are no significant differences in change in HRQOL between Minorities and Caucasians; between Minorities in the intervention group and those in the comparison group; and between women in the intervention group and those in the comparison group. Minority indicator variable and Intervention/Comparison group indicator variable were not found to be good predictors of HRQOL. Although the structural equation models suggested viable representation {{of the relationship between the}} antecedent variables, the mediating variables and the two outcome variables, the impact of nutrition was not statistically significant to be included in the model. This dissertation, by analyzing the HRQOL of minorities in the WHEL Study, attempted to add to the knowledge base specific to minority cancer survivors. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aims of {{this study}} were to define the design {{criteria}} of an artificial ACL which could reproduce the non-linear load-elongation characteristics of the native ACL, and to investigate the mechanical behaviour of a novel ACL reconstruction design consisting of a metallic elastic system and a polymeric cord. Introduction: Kinematic and <b>survivorship</b> <b>studies</b> on the ACL intact and ACL deficient knees have emphasised the importance of preserving and/or reconstructing the ACL [1], [2]. The unique mechanical properties of the ACL and the non-linear relationship between the ACL forces and the quadriceps muscle forces at different flexion angles are the key elements in providing normal kinematics. Current synthetic ACL reconstruction grafts have shown poor long-term results, mainly due to wear, creep, fatigue and mechanical failure. None of the synthetic and biological grafts used for the ACL reconstruction have been able to replicate the normal mechanical behaviour of the ACL and prevent degenerative disease progression such as osteoarthritis. Method: Desired mechanical properties of the artificial ACL were defined based the results of in vitro and in vivo biomechanical studies. Suitable materials were found for the prosthetic ACL which met the required design criteria. Implicit finite element analyses were performed on a spring-cord construct design and the output force-elongation data compared to the estimated in-vivo natural ACL properties found in the literature. Results: It was shown that an artificial ACL should have a non-linear stiffness with low resistance to the initial load (~ 30 Nmm- 1 stiffness in the toe region) and increased stiffness under higher load (~ 110 Nmm- 1 stiffness in the linear region). Suitable materials for the ACL reconstruction design (i. e. CoCrMo alloy and UHMWPE fibres) were identified based on their biocompatibility, strength, strain, creep and fatigue properties The FEA results showed that the mechanical properties of the novel artificial ACL deisgn closely resembled that of the natural ACL at 30 ° of flexion. A validation test was performed on prototype samples, which supported the finite element data. Conclusions The non-linear force-elongation properties of the native ACL can be reproduced by an artificial ACL reconstruction system in the ACLD knees...|$|R
40|$|Cancer survivors, {{the medical}} community, public health professionals, researchers, and policymakers all need {{information}} about newly diagnosed cancer cases and deaths {{to better understand}} and address the disease burden. CDC collects cancer data on 96 % of the U. S. population through the National Program of Cancer Registries. The National Program of Cancer Registries routinely collects data on all cancer occurrences, deaths, {{and the types of}} initial treatment received by the patients, and recently CDC has made advances in its cancer surveillance activities that have direct applicability to cancer survivorship research and care. This article examines CDC’s innovative uses of the National Program of Cancer Registries infrastructure and data as a recruitment source for <b>survivorship</b> research <b>studies</b> and behavioral interventions; comparative effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes research; and the collection, consolidation, and dissemination of treatment summaries for cancer survivors and their providers. This paper also discusses long-term, idealistic plans for additional data linkages and sharing among public health, providers, and the cancer survivor through innovative concepts such as patient portals and rapid-learning health care...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{measures}} of termite food preference assess consequences of foraging behavior such as wood consumption, aggregation and/or termite <b>survivorship.</b> Although <b>studies</b> {{have been done}} to investigate the specifics of foraging behavior this is not generally integrated into choice assay experiments. Here choice assays were conducted with small isolated (orphaned) groups of workers and compared with choice assays involving foragers from whole nests (non-orphaned) in the laboratory. Aggregation to two different wood types {{was used as a}} measure of preference. Specific worker caste and instars participating in initial exploration were compared between assay methods, with samples of termites taken from nest carton material and sites where termites were feeding. Aggregation results differ between choice assay techniques. Castes and instars responsible for initial exploration, as determined in whole nest trials, were not commonly found exploring in isolated group trials, nor were they numerous in termites taken from active feeding sites. Consequently the use of small groups of M. turneri worker termites extracted from active feeding sites may not be appropriate for use in choice assays...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{predator}} effects is typically {{focused on the}} finalistic aspect of such interactions. Although direct predation is undoubtedly important, there is a far less studied realm that is equally, if not, {{more important than the}} direct effects of predation. Here we examine the indirect growth effects of predator and prey interactions by using predator stimuli experimentation. Juvenile rockfishes of the genus Sebastes were introduced to predation stimuli and within generation effects on growth were measured. Multiple experiments were run while manipulating visual chemical stimuli. It was discovered that the existence of predation stimuli resulted in a consistent negative growth effect on both body length and height in juvenile rockfish. Although sub-lethal predator effects significantly stunted growth in both mean body length and height, weight was not affected. It has been seen that juvenile survivorship can differentiate based on size relationships, and therefore stunted growth of juvenile fish by predation presence may lead to changes in <b>survivorship.</b> This <b>study</b> also reinforces the theory that energy allocation and metabolism may {{play a key role in}} the way that fish are affected by predatio...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hip {{replacements}} {{are considered}} routine operations which {{improve the quality}} of life in patients by reducing pain and restoring function. There are many variations in prostheses with varying benefits and disadvantages. Methods: Literature from the United States and Europe was collected on total hip replacements between 2001 and the present and analyzed based on outcome measures and <b>survivorship.</b> Results: <b>Studies</b> generally use revision as end point with few studies measuring patient satisfaction. The Charnley style metal-on-polyethylene implants still show the most consistent results long term. Metal on metal and ceramic on ceramic show reduced wear and osteolysis, the main indication for revision, so may prove better when more long term studies become available. There are so many implants that long term studies are not actually feasible due to options entering and leaving the market on a rapid basis. Conclusions: Large-scale, long term, independent studies are needed to compare available choices. Immediate feedback is also necessary to keep up with new products. The creation of a national registry in the US and standardized outcome measurements would allow large scale conclusions to be made on the benefits and risks of each implant design and approach, giving doctors, engineers, and patients an invaluable source of information for use in decision making...|$|R
