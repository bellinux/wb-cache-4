5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at Kīlauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its <b>summit</b> <b>caldera,</b> its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of Kīlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea's <b>summit</b> <b>caldera.</b> Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea {{is one of}} five hotspot volcanoes {{that form}} the island of Hawaii, the largest and {{youngest}} island of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Of these five volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000years ago, and is currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible <b>summit</b> <b>caldera,</b> but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.|$|E
5|$|At most 600,000 years old, Kīlauea {{is still}} quite young for a Hawaiian volcano; the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern Kohala, {{experienced}} almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct. The volcano's foreseeable future activity {{will likely be}} much like {{it has been for}} the past 50,000 to 100,000 years; Hawaiian and explosive activity will continue to heighten Kīlauea's summit, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its <b>summit</b> <b>caldera.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{orientations and}} ages of {{elongate}} <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> on major polygenetic volcanoes were compiled to document Miocene to Pleistocene Sh (minimum horizontal stress) directions {{on the western}} and northern flanks of the West Antarctic rift system. Miocene to Pleistocene <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> along the western Ross Sea show relatively consistent ENE long axis trends, which are at a high angle to the Transantarctic Mountain Front and parallel to the N 77 ºE Sh direction at Cape Roberts. The elongation directions of many Miocene to Pleistocene <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> in Marie Byrd Land parallel the alignment of polygenetic volcanoes in which they occur, except several Pleistocene calderas with consistent NNE to NE trends. The overall pattern of elongate calderas in Marie Byrd Land is probably due {{to a combination of}} structurally controlled orientations and regional stress fields in which Sh is oriented NNE to NE at a moderate to high angle to the trace of the West Antarctic rift system...|$|R
5|$|The {{length and}} origin these eruptions has also varied. Events last {{anywhere}} between days and years, and occur {{at a number}} of different sites. Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kīlauea's <b>summit</b> <b>caldera.</b> Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its upper section.|$|E
5|$|Shield volcanoes undergo {{at least}} two stages of {{volcanic}} activity. The initial shield stage is the most productive volcanically and features repeated eruptions of large volumes of predominately fluid peralkaline felsic magmas that become progressively more evolved. During this stage, a small <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> may form, {{as is the case}} for the Ilgachuz Range. After the shield stage has been completed, the post-shield stage succeeds. This stage of activity is characterized by small volumes of more mafic lavas expressed as small cinder cones and capping flows. Dissection of the shield by stream erosion is also apparent, resulting in the creation of deeply incised radial valleys.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Hawaiian {{religious}} practice {{holds that the}} five volcanic peaks of the island are sacred, and regards Mauna Loa, the largest of them all, with great admiration; but what mythology survives today consists mainly of oral accounts from the 18th century first compiled in the 19th. Most of these stories agree that the Hawaiian volcano deity, Pele, resides in Halemaʻumaʻu Crater on Kilauea; however a few place her home at Mauna Loa's <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> Mokuʻāweoweo, and the mythos in general associates her with all volcanic activity on the island. Regardless, Kīlauea's lack of a geographic outline and strong volcanic link to Mauna Loa led to it being considered an offshoot of Mauna Loa by the Ancient Hawaiians, meaning much of the mythos now associated with Kīlauea was originally directed at Mauna Loa proper as well.|$|E
50|$|The mafic {{ring dike}} {{structures}} may be deeper level expressions of <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> {{related to a}} shield volcano phase while the pyroclastic fragments could either be associated with satellite cones or the result of Misema caldera collapse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{terrestrial}} volcano Emi Koussi (in Chad) {{has been}} studied as an analog of Elysium Mons. The two shield volcanoes have <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> of similar size, but Elysium Mons is 3.5 times larger in diameter and 6 times higher than its counterpart on Earth.|$|R
50|$|The island {{comprises}} two volcanic mountains, with {{a valley}} between. The western mountain {{is composed of}} four overlapping and eroded stratovolcanoes, with a cinder cone field at the western end. It has not been historically active. The eastern mountain is a large shield volcano with two overlapping <b>summit</b> <b>calderas,</b> which last erupted in 1937.|$|R
5|$|The next {{successful}} ascent {{was made}} on January 29, 1834, 40years later, by the Scottish botanist David Douglas, who also reached the <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> using the ʻAinapō Trail. By the time Douglas reached the summit the environment had put him under extreme duress, but he nonetheless stayed overnight to make measurements of the summit caldera's proportions and record barometric data on its height, both now known to be widely inaccurate. Douglas collected biological samples on the way both up and down, and after a difficult and distressing descent began collating his samples; he planned to return to England, but instead several months later his body was mysteriously discovered crushed in a pit besides a dead wild boar.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa {{has been}} {{designated}} a Decade Volcano, one of the sixteen volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) as being worthy of particular study {{in light of their}} history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas. The United States Geological Survey maintains a hazard zone mapping of the island done on a one to nine scale, with the most dangerous areas corresponding the smallest numbers. Based on this classification Mauna Loa's continuously active <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> and rift zones have been given a level one designation. Much of the area immediately surrounding the rift zones is considered level two, and about 20 percent of the area has been covered in lava in historical times. Much of the remainder of the volcano is hazard level three, about 15 to 20 percent of which has been covered by flows within the last 750 years. However, two sections of the volcano, the first in the Naalehu area and the second on the southeastern flank of Mauna Loa's rift zone, are protected from eruptive activity by local topography, and have thus been designated hazard level 6, comparable with a similarly isolated segment on Kīlauea.|$|E
500|$|The caldera started forming {{during an}} {{eruption}} around 17,000 (or 18,300) {{years ago and}} was enlarged by later paroxysmal eruptions, ending in the one of AD 79. This structure has given {{its name to the}} term [...] "somma volcano", which describes any volcano with a <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> surrounding a newer cone.|$|E
50|$|Because {{there is}} no plate {{tectonics}} on Venus, heat is mainly lost by conduction through the lithosphere. This causes enormous lava flows, accounting for 80% of Venus' surface area. Many of the mountains are large shield volcanoes that {{range in size from}} 150-400 km in diameter and 2-4 km high. More than 80 of these large shield volcanoes have <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> averaging 60 km across.|$|R
50|$|Icelandic shields {{are mostly}} small (~), {{symmetrical}} (although this can affected by surface topography), and characterized by eruptions from <b>summit</b> <b>calderas.</b> They {{are composed of}} either tholeiitic olivine or picritic basalt. The tholeiitic shields tend to be wider and shallower than the picritic shields. They do not follow the pattern of caldera growth and destruction that other shield volcanoes do; caldera may form, but they generally do not disappear.|$|R
50|$|Its {{main feature}} is a NE-SW-oriented rift-like {{fracture}} set connecting two <b>summit</b> <b>calderas.</b> There {{is also a}} structure which links the northern caldera and ridge system to Idem Kuva corona located NW of Gula Mons. Radially spreading lava flows which have digitate and broad sheet-like forms extend from the summit, including radar-dark flows which overlay several older lava deposits. Radial and circumferential fractures are present on the flanks.|$|R
500|$|Vesuvius is a {{distinctive}} [...] "humpbacked" [...] peak, {{consisting of a}} large cone (Gran Cono) partially encircled by the steep rim of a <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> caused {{by the collapse of}} an earlier and originally much higher structure called Mount Somma. The Gran Cono was produced during the A.D. 79 eruption. For this reason, the volcano is also called Somma-Vesuvius or Somma-Vesuvio.|$|E
500|$|There {{is a small}} {{string of}} faults on and near the main <b>summit</b> <b>caldera,</b> {{arranged}} parallel to the northern coast. The faults were originally regarded to be {{a direct result of}} the collapse; however scientists note the fault lines do not go all the way to the coast but are arranged tightly clustered around the caldera. [...] This indicates that the fault lines may have been caused indirectly, possibly due to the sudden release of stress during the event.|$|E
500|$|Mount Vesuvius ( [...] ; [...] also [...] or [...] in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano {{located on}} the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about [...] east of Naples and a short {{distance}} from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.|$|E
50|$|Alba Mons {{is notable}} for the {{remarkable}} length, diversity, and crisp appearance of its lava flows. Many of the flows radiate from the summit, but others appear to originate from vents and fissures {{on the lower}} flanks of the volcano. Individual flows may exceed 500 km in length. Lava flows near the <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> appear to be significantly shorter and narrower than those on more distal parts of the volcano. The two most common types of volcanic flows on Alba Mons are sheet flows and tube-and-channel fed flows.|$|R
5000|$|Rift {{zones are}} a {{prevalent}} feature on shield volcanoes that is rare on other volcanic types. The large, decentralized shape of Hawaiian volcanoes {{as compared to}} their smaller, symmetrical Icelandic cousins {{can be attributed to}} rift eruptions. Fissure venting is common in Hawaii; most Hawaiian eruptions begin with a so-called [...] "wall of fire" [...] along a major fissure line before centralizing to a small number of points. This accounts for their asymmetrical shape, whereas Icelandic volcanoes follow a pattern of central eruptions dominated by <b>summit</b> <b>calderas,</b> causing the lava to be more evenly distributed or symmetrical.|$|R
5|$|The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz {{occurred}} about 1.8 {{million years}} ago {{at the beginning of the}} Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two {{million years ago}}, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.|$|R
500|$|During its {{observed}} history, {{the volume}} of lava erupted by Kīlauea has varied widely. In 1823 Kīlauea's <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> was far deeper than it is today, but {{was in the process}} of filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption, with [...] of lava erupted there alone by 1840. The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in eruptive volume, and in the thirty years between then and about 1950, the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited very little activity; Kīlauea's eruptive volume has increased steadily since then, with present activity comparable to that of the early 1800s.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, a Canadian–American {{collaborative}} expedition, {{named the}} Canadian American Seamount Expedition (CASM), visited the northwestern edge of Axial Seamount's <b>summit</b> <b>caldera</b> {{to investigate a}} persistent temperature anomaly in the region. In a series of eight dives conducted by Pisces IV, the scientists discovered a vibrant hydrothermal vent community {{on the leading edge}} of a [...] fissure within the caldera. Vent temperatures were [...] measured around , approximately [...] hotter than the surrounding environment. Camera tows and submersible dives through the 1980s and 1990s revealed Axial Seamount's active state, including the only known black smoker in the northwest Pacific. Three venting centers have been recognized: the original site, named CHASM; a southwestern caldera field discovered in the late 1980s, named ASHES; and a site located on its southeastern rift zone, named CASTLE. All are primarily sulfur/sulfide emitting.|$|E
500|$|Kīlauea {{has a large}} <b>summit</b> <b>caldera,</b> {{measuring}} [...] with walls up to [...] high, breached by {{lava flows}} on the southwestern side. It is unknown if the caldera was always there {{or if it is}} a relatively recent feature, and it is possible that it has come and gone throughout Kīlauea's eruptive history; what is known is that it likely formed over several centuries, with its construction estimated to have begun about 500 years ago, and that its present form was finalized by a particularly powerful eruption in 1790. A major feature within the caldera is Halemaumau Crater, a large pit crater and one of Kīlauea's most historically active eruption centers. The crater is approximately [...] in diameter and [...] deep, but its form has varied widely through its eruptive history; the floor of the Halemaumau Crater is now mostly covered by flows from its most recent eruption, in 1974.|$|E
5000|$|The New Senator Caldera {{is a large}} {{striking}} Archean {{caldera complex}} within {{the heart of the}} Blake River Megacaldera Complex, Quebec, Canada. It has a diameter of 15-30 kilometers and is made of thick massive mafic sequences. The caldera complex has inferred to be a subaqueous lava lake during {{the early stages of the}} caldera's development. Gabbro sills represent lava lakes, which are common in mafic <b>summit</b> <b>calderas.</b> These subaqueous lava lakes are large units with a change in grain size from coarse to fine grained and a hyaloclastite top. The Kiwanis (Norands) intrusion, a high-level synvolcanic magma chamber, intrudes felsic rocks, and is in turn cross-cut by basaltic dikes and sills.|$|R
40|$|Geomorphic and stratigraphic {{analysis}} of Alba Patera suggests a volcanic construct built by lavas with rheologic properties similar to basalts. A series of evolving eruptive styles {{is suggested by}} changes in morphology and inferred progressive reductions in flow volume with higher stratigraphic position. Alba Patera's volcanic history has been summarized into four main phases. The first is characterized by extensive flood like flows presumably erupted from fissures associated with the initial intrusion of magma into the region. The second phase {{is associated with the}} emplacement of pyroclastic rock, a more speculative interpretation. The third phase produced the voluminous tabular, crested, and undifferentiated flows, probably from a more centralized vent source. The fourth and last phase is marked the effusion of levee like flows and the collapse of the <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> and final graben formation...|$|R
40|$|The Misema and New Senator calderas are {{instrumental}} {{in understanding the}} evolution of the Blake River Group in the Abitibi greenstone belt and the formation of volcanic massive sulfide deposits. The 40 - 80 km in diameter, E-W trending Misema caldera is a coalescence of at least two large mafic shield volcanoes that formed prior to 2702. 9 ± 4. 1 Ma (ca. 2703 Ma) based on the Cléricy gabbro complex. The margin of the Misema caldera displays a 10 - 15 km wide inner and outer ring zone, in which numerous mafic ring dyke structures (e. g. Montsabrais) and subaqueous pyroclastic deposits are observed. The mafic ring dyke complexes are considered deeper level expressions of <b>summit</b> <b>calderas</b> related to a shield volcano phase and the pyroclastic debris may eithe...|$|R
500|$|The first post-eruption {{expedition}} {{was organized}} and conducted by [...] on 12 February 1998, which conducted conductivity, temperature, depth, and optical casts to unusual results. In May, a dedicated bathymetric {{survey of the}} seamount showed topographical changes along the volcano's southern flank, which estimated the thickest flows to [...] In July DSV Alvin made several dives on the seamount's <b>summit</b> <b>caldera,</b> followed in August through September by an extensive observation and collection program using ROV ROPOS, confirming the bathymetric estimates. A sheet flow more than [...] long and [...] wide was produced from Axial Seamount's upper southern flank, {{on the site of}} what was formerly an active geothermal field. The southern flows were in an area marked by a difference between older sediments and newer, glassier rock, and the maximum ridge generated by the eruption, at the crest of the southern flow, was [...] high. The total eruptive volume was roughly [...]|$|E
500|$|The modern {{monitoring}} system on Mauna Loa is constituted {{not only by}} its locally seismic network but also {{of a large number}} of GPS stations, tiltmeters, and strainmeters that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in Mauna Loa's subterranean magma chamber, which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity. The GPS network is the most durable and wide-ranging of the three systems, while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data, but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation; nonetheless a survey line across the caldera measured a [...] increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption, and a similar increase in 1984 eruption. Strainmeters, by contrast, are relatively rare. The Observatory also maintains two gas detectors at Mokuʻāweoweo, Mauna Loa's <b>summit</b> <b>caldera,</b> as well as a publicly accessible [...] and occasional screenings by interferometric synthetic aperture radar imaging.|$|E
500|$|A [...] wide caldera {{lies in the}} area, {{which is}} partly filled by {{pyroclastic}} flows. Some of these flows extend outside the caldera. On the western rim of the caldera, the [...] high Monte Burney volcano developed. It has its own <b>summit</b> <b>caldera,</b> and a steep wall on the northern side with uncertain origin. This volcano is glaciated, with a glacier extending between [...] of altitude. The total glacier volume is about [...] It also shows traces of a sector collapse towards the south-southwest. Flank vents are also found and generated lava and pyroclastic flows. The rim of the larger caldera is taken up by a ring of lava domes. Glacial erosion has left a rugged landscape, which close to the volcano is smoothed by deposits coming from the volcano. The landscape east of the caldera is buried by pyroclastic flows, and some outcrops in them may be remnants of a pre-Burney volcano.|$|E
40|$|The volcano of Somma-Vesuvius, {{located near}} Naples (southern Italy), buried Pompeii and Herculaneum during the 79 CE eruption. It {{consists}} of an old stratovolcano, Monte Somma, collapsed several times because of huge explosive eruptions, and a recent cone, Vesuvius, grown inside the <b>summit</b> depression (<b>caldera)</b> after the 79 CE eruption...|$|R
40|$|We {{have carried}} out 2 -D {{numerical}} simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) to investigate density-driven deformation in Martian volcanic edifices {{and how it}} affects the development of caldera complexes. These simulations demonstrate {{that the presence of}} a dense and weak cumulate body within a volcanic edifice strongly influences the volcano morphology and enhances volcanic spreading. The settling of a cumulate body generates distinctive structural and morphological features characteristic of Olympus Mons and Arsia Mons, including low flank slopes and pronounced <b>summit</b> <b>calderas.</b> We show that gravitational spreading of a cumulate body can play a primary role in the long-term development of calderas. We conclude that a cumulate body that is both shallow and wide could generate a single large depression similar to the Arsia-type caldera, while our simulations of a narrow cumulate body are capable of generating summit subsidence that is similar in dimension to the Olympus Mons caldera...|$|R
50|$|The {{largest and}} most {{conspicuous}} volcanoes on Mars occur in Tharsis and Elysium regions. These volcanoes are strikingly similar to shield volcanoes on Earth. Both have shallow-sloping flanks and <b>summit</b> <b>calderas.</b> The main difference between Martian shield volcanoes and those on Earth is in size: Martian shield volcanoes are truly colossal. For example, the tallest volcano on Mars, Olympus Mons, is 550 km across and 21 km high. It is nearly 100 times greater in volume than Mauna Loa in Hawaii, the largest shield volcano on Earth. Geologists {{think one of the}} reasons that volcanoes on Mars are able to grow so large is because Mars lacks plate tectonics. The Martian lithosphere does not slide over the upper mantle (asthenosphere) as on Earth, so lava from a stationary hot spot is able to accumulate at one location on the surface for a billion years or longer.|$|R
