Furthermore, the aim was to look into whether there is any difference in experience between men and women and depending on their level of care. Using a qualitative method, semi-structured interviews were carried out with eight elderly people; six women and two men. The main questions of the study were: How do the elderly people experience the practical use of personal safety alarms? In what ways, if any, do the elderly people experience that the personal <b>safety</b> <b>alarm</b> has changed their daily life? In what ways do the elderly people experience that the personal <b>safety</b> <b>alarm</b> effects their ability to stay in their own home? A cognitive perspective was mainly used to analyze the results.

40|$|The {{demographic}} development {{indicates an}} increased elderly population in Sweden in the future. One {{of the greatest}} challenges for a society with an ageing population is to provide high-quality health and social care. New information and communication technology and services can be used to further improve health care. To enable elderly persons to stay at home as long as possible, various kinds of technology, such as safety alarms, are used at home. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the experiences of elderly persons through testing a mobile <b>safety</b> <b>alarm</b> and their reasoning about safety, privacy and mobility. The mobile <b>safety</b> <b>alarm</b> tested was a prototype in development. Five elderly persons with functional limitations and four healthy elderly persons from a pensioner's organisation tested the alarm. The mobile alarm with a drop sensor and a positioning device was tested for 6 weeks. This intervention was evaluated with qualitative interviews, and analysed with latent content analysis. The result showed four main categories: feeling safe, being positioned and supervised, being mobile, and reflecting on new technology. From these categories, the overarching category 'Safety and mobility are more important than privacy' emerged. The mobile <b>safety</b> <b>alarm</b> was perceived to offer an increased opportunity for mobility in terms of being more active and as an aid for self-determination. The fact that the informants were located by means of the positioning device was not experienced as violating privacy as long as they could decide how to use the alarm. It was concluded that this mobile <b>safety</b> <b>alarm</b> was experienced as a tool to be active and mobile. As a way to keep self-determination and empowerment, the individual has to make a 'cost-benefit' analysis where privacy is sacrificed to the benefit of mobility and safety.

40|$|Every {{industrial}} production, particularly chemical processing, demands {{special attention}} in conducting the technological process {{with regard to}} the security requirements. For this reason, production processes should be continuously monitored by means of control and <b>alarm</b> <b>safety</b> instrumented systems. In the production of nitric acid at Petrokemija d. d., the original <b>alarm</b> <b>safety</b> system was designed as a combination of an electrical relay safety system and transistorized alarm module system. In order to increase safety requirements and modernize the technological process of nitric acid production, revamping and upgrading of the existing <b>alarm</b> <b>safety</b> system was initiated with a new microprocessor system. The newly derived <b>alarm</b> <b>safety</b> system, Simatic PCS 7, links the function of "classically" distributed control (DCS) and logical systems in a common hardware and software platform with integrated engineering tools and operator interface to meet the minimum safety standards with safety integrity level 2 (SIL 2) up to level 3 (SIL 3), according to IEC 61508 and IEC 61511. This professional paper demonstrates the methodology of upgrading the logic of the <b>alarm</b> <b>safety</b> system in the production of nitric acid {{in the form of a}} logical diagram, which was the basis for a further step in its design and construction. Based on the mentioned logical diagram and defined security requirements, the project was implemented in three phases: analysis and testing, installation of the safety equipment and system, and commissioning. Developed also was a verification system of all safety conditions, which could be applied to other facilities for production of nitric acid. With the revamped and upgraded interlock <b>alarm</b> <b>safety</b> system, a new and improved safety boundary in the production of nitric acid was set, which created the foundation for further improvement of the production process in terms of improved analysis...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{experience}} among care professionals that persons with dementia often say ‘no’ to conventional caring measures such as taking medication, eating or having a shower. This tendency to say ‘no’ may also concern the use of assistive technologies such as fall detectors, mobile <b>safety</b> <b>alarms,</b> Internet for social contact and robots. This paper provides practical recommendations for care professionals in home health care and social care about {{how to respond to}} such resistiveness towards assistive technologies. Apart from the option of accepting the ‘no’, it discusses a number of methods for influencing persons with dementia in order to overcome the ‘no’. These methods range from various non-coercive measures—including nudging—to coercion. It is argued that while conventional caring measures like those mentioned are essential for survival, health or hygiene, assistive technologies are commonly merely potentially beneficial supplements. With this in mind, it is concluded that care professionals should be more restrictive in using methods of influence involving some degree of pressure regarding assistive technologies than regarding conventional caring measures...|$|R

5000|$|A carbon {{monoxide}} detector or CO detector is {{a device that}} detects {{the presence of the}} {{carbon monoxide}} (CO) gas in order to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. In the late 1990s Underwriters Laboratories (UL) changed their definition of a single station CO detector with a sound device in it to a carbon monoxide (CO) alarm. This applies to all CO <b>safety</b> <b>alarms</b> that meet UL 2034; however for passive indicators and system devices that meet UL 2075, UL refers to these as carbon monoxide detectors. CO is a colorless, tasteless and odorless compound produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. It {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "silent killer" [...] because it is virtually undetectable without using detection technology and, in a study by Underwriters Laboratories, [...] "Sixty percent of Americans could not identify any potential signs of a CO leak in the home". Elevated levels of CO can be dangerous to humans depending on the amount present and length of exposure. Smaller concentrations can be harmful over longer periods of time while increasing concentrations require diminishing exposure times to be harmful.|$|R
