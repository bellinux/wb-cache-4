5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{developments}} in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful. Modern weapons systems and their supporting logistics facilities such as munitions stores could not fit within the 16th-century designs. A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences concluded that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and newer sites along the coast, and the castle was disarmed. A review in 1913 concluded that keeping naval artillery at Calshot was also unnecessary, and the site was turned into an experimental seaplane station instead.|$|E

5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a black hole.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself is too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of value, and is only infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E

As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E
5|$|Fears over a {{possible}} French invasion resurfaced {{several times in}} the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts still thought to be military valuable, and encouraged the decommissioning of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service simply too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of real use, and she remained in service for only two years. Puglia was the only ship of the class {{to take an active}} role in the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|The dark shyshark poses {{no danger}} to humans and is too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of {{commercial}} importance. Many are hooked by sport fishers casting from the shore, who regard the shark as a pest and often kill it. It {{may also be}} caught by subsistence fishers and in lobster traps and bottom trawls, though not in substantial quantities. This shark occasionally finds {{its way into the}} aquarium trade, though there is no direct fishing for this purpose. As the dark shyshark remains common and does not seem heavily threatened by human activity, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its small range does raise concerns that an increase in regional fishing pressure or habitat degradation could impact the entire population.|$|E
5|$|The raid on Christmas {{night was}} the last major Japanese attack on the Marianas. On January2, a single Japanese {{aircraft}} destroyed one B-29 and damaged another three. A further two small raids were attempted in January and one on February2, but none of five aircraft dispatched reached the islands and four were shot down. In early February the 6thAir Army's parent headquarters, the General Defense Command (GDC), reached {{the conclusion that the}} raiding forces being dispatched against the American bomber bases were too <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective. As {{it was not possible to}} allocate additional aircraft to bolster these missions, the GDC directed that the offensive cease and that the 6thAir Army be held in reserve to be used against any Allied forces which landed in the Japanese home islands.|$|E
