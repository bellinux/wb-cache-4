40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of {{dorzolamide}} and timolol add-on therapy in open-angle glaucoma (OAG) patients previously treated with prostaglandin analogue (Pg), by evaluating fluctuations in the intraocular (IOP), blood (BP), ocular perfusion pressures (OPP) and retrobulbar blood flow (RBF) parameters. Methods: 35 OAG patients (35 eyes), 31 women (88. 6 %) age 63. 3 (8. 9) years were evaluated in a 3 month randomized, cross-over, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study.</b> During the experiments BP, heart rate, IOP and OPP were assessed 4 times per day (8 – 12 – 16 – 20 h). RBF was measured twice per day (8 – 20 h) using Color Doppler imaging in the ophthalmic (OA), central retinal (CRA), nasal (nSPCA) and temporal (tSPCA) posterior ciliary arteries. In each vessel, peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were assessed and vascular resistance (RI) calculated. Results: Both add-on therapies lowered IOP in a statistically significant manner from 15. 7 ± 2. 4 mmHg at latanoprost baseline to 14. 9 ± 2. 2 mmHg using dorzolamide (p < 0. 001) and 14. 2 ± 1. 9 mmHg using timolol (p < 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of antibiotic drops placed in the conjunctival cul-de-sac to antibiotic ointment applied to the lid margin in reduction of bacterial colonization on the lid margin. METHODS: A randomized, prospective, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study</b> was conducted on 19 patients with culture-proven colonization of bacteria on the lid margins. Ophthalmic eligibility criteria included the presence of > or = 50 colony-forming units/mL (CFU/mL) of bacteria on both right and left lids. Each patient received one drop of ofloxacin in one eye every night for one week, followed by one drop {{once a week for}} one month. In the same manner, each patient received bacitracin ointment (erythromycin or gentamicin ointment if lid margin bacteria were resistant to bacitracin) to the lid margin of the fellow eye. Quantitative lid cultures were taken at initial visit, one week, one month, and two months. Fifteen volunteers (30 lids) served as controls. Lid cultures were taken at initial visit, one week, and one month. RESULTS: Both antibiotic drop and ointment reduced average bacterial CFU/mL at one week and one month. Average bacterial CFU/mL reestablished to baseline values at two months. There was no statistically significant difference between antibiotic drop and ointment in reducing bacterial colonization on the lid margin. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic drops placed in the conjunctival cul-de-sac appear to be as effective as ointment applied to the lid margins in reducing bacterial colonization in patients with > or = 50 CFU/mL of bacteria on the lid margins...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) on ocular {{rigidity}} and compare its effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) readings with Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), Schiøtz indentation tonometry (ST), and dynamic contour tonometry (DCT). Patients and Methods: Prospective, observational, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study.</b> Eighty-one patients who underwent myopic LASIK and 108 unoperated myopic control patients {{were included in the}} study. The IOP was measured using GAT, DCT, and ST. The coefficient of ocular rigidity (Ko) was obtained from the regression analysis of the 3 readings obtained with each weight of the ST. Linear multiple regression analysis was performed with dummy variables to assess the effects of age, central corneal thickness (CCT), and refractive surgery on measured IOP values. Results: Age, CCT, and previous LASIK explained 39. 41 % of the IOP readings with GAT, 25. 31 % with DCT, and 3. 28 % with ST. LASIK caused a mean decrease of 2. 51 mm Hg in IOP readings (P= 0. 000) with GAT, 1. 29 mm Hg (P= 0. 036) with DCT, and no significant change in IOP readings with ST (P= 0. 299). Significant differences in the Ko were observed between the LASIK and control groups. The Ko values were unrelated to age and CCT in the LASIK and control groups. Conclusions: ST seems to be less affected by previous LASIK procedures. There is a difference in the ocular rigidity between the unoperated and LASIK eyes that is not correlated with the CCT. Therefore, ST seems to measure changes in the biomechanical behavior of corneas that underwent LASIK surgery...|$|E

Methods: This post-hoc, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study</b> was conducted with 310 patients who were scheduled to undergo unilateral clear corneal cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. Incisions were closed with stromal hydration (270 patients) or without stromal hydration (40 patients) based on physician standard of care. All patients received the hydrogel bandage at the conclusion of the procedure. Ocular assessments of stromal edema, flare, corneal staining, anterior chamber cells, best-corrected visual acuity, and intraocular pressure were made 24 hours after surgery. Results: Significantly more patients experienced stromal edema in the group with stromal hydration (26. 3 % versus 10. 0 %, respectively; P = 0. 028). A higher percentage of patients experienced corneal staining when stromal hydration was performed (20. 4 % versus 2. 5 %; P = 0. 004). The mean BCVA (best-corrected visual acuity) also was significantly different between the groups (logMAR of 0. 164 with stromal hydration versus 0. 095 without hydration; P = 0. 007). No significant differences were observed between the study groups in terms of flare, anterior chamber cells, or intraocular pressure. Conclusion: Cataract surgery without stromal hydration provided better surgical outcomes than the traditional hydration procedure when used in conjunction with a new hydrogel bandage.

40|$|Study Design: A multicenter, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study</b> of {{patients}} with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) using a repeated-measures design. Objective: To compare 3 different methods of patellar taping for individuals with PFPS. Background: Patellar taping is commonly used {{as a treatment for}} PFPS. It is commonly thought that taping works by medially realigning the patella. However, comparisons have been rarely made with other methods of taping which attempt to realign the patella in different directions. Methods and Measures: Seventy-one patients with PFPS (39 men, 32 women; average age ± SD, 34 ± 10 years) from 3 different treatment centers were tested. Each patient performed 4 single step-downs from a standard 8 -inch (20. 3 -cm) platform, initially with the patella untaped and then with the patella taped in a medial, neutral, and lateral direction. Pain was recorded on a standard 11 -point numerical pain rating scale. The sequence of taping was randomly allocated and patients were masked to the method used. The methods of taping were compared using repeated-measures generalized linear model analysis. Results: All methods of taping significantly decreased pain when compared to the untaped condition (P<. 0001). Neutral- and lateral-glide techniques produced a significantly greater degree of pain relief (P<. 0001) than the medial-glide technique. Conclusion: In this study, patellar taping produced an immediate decrease in pain in patients with PFPS, irrespective of how taping was applied. These data raise questions as to the mechanism of action of patellar taping. Furthermore, these results suggest that it is unlikely that taping works by altering patellar position...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0. 7 mg (DEX) as adjunctive therapy to ranibizumab in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD). Procedures: This was a 6 -month, <b>single-masked,</b> multicenter <b>study.</b> Patients were randomized to DEX implant (n = 123) or sham procedure (n = 120) and received 2 protocol-mandated intravitreal ranibizumab injections. The main outcome measure was injection-free interval to first as-needed ranibizumab injection. Results: DEX increased the injection-free interval versus sham (50 th percentile, 34 vs. 29 days; 75 th percentile, 85 vs. 56 days; p = 0. 016). 8. 3 % of DEX versus 2. 5 % of sham-treated patients did not require rescue ranibizumab (p = 0. 048). Visual acuity and retinal thickness outcomes were similar in DEX and sham-treated patients. Only reports of conjunctival hemorrhage (18. 2 vs. 8. 5 %) and intraocular pressure elevation (13. 2 vs. 4. 2 %) were significantly different in the DEX versus the sham treatment groups.

40|$|AbstractThe human choroid {{is capable}} of rapidly {{changing}} its thickness {{in response to a}} variety of stimuli. However {{little is known about the}} role of the autonomic nervous system in the regulation of the thickness of the choroid. Therefore, we investigated the effect of topical parasympatholytic and sympathomimetic agents upon the choroidal thickness and ocular biometrics of young healthy adult subjects. Fourteen subjects (mean age 27. 9  ±  4 years) participated in this randomized, <b>single-masked,</b> placebo-controlled <b>study.</b> Each subject had measurements of choroidal thickness (ChT) and ocular biometrics of their right eye taken before, and then 30 and 60  min following the administration of topical pharmacological agents. Three different drugs: 2 % homatropine hydrobromide, 2. 5 % phenylephrine hydrochloride and a placebo (0. 3 % hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) were tested in all subjects; each on different days (at the same time of the day) in randomized order. Participants were masked to the pharmacological agent being used at each testing session. The instillation of 2 % homatropine resulted in a small but significant increase in subfoveal ChT at 30 and 60  min after drug instillation (mean change 7  ±  3  μm and 14  ±  2  μm respectively; both p    0. 05). In human subjects, significant increases in subfoveal and parafoveal choroidal thickness occurred after administration of 2 % homatropine and this implies an involvement of the parasympathetic system in the control of choroidal thickness in humans...|$|R

Methods: Twenty five POAG patients, previously treated with any prostaglandin analogs, were evaluated in an prospective, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study.</b> After {{a week of}} run-in period with bimatoprost all patients were treated with bimatoprost dosed once {{in the morning for}} 1 month, after which dorzolamide was added twice daily for 2 months. Goldmann applanation IOP, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate were measured every 2 hours for 24 hours and diurnal ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated. Color Doppler Imaging (CDI) of the ophthalmic (OA) and central retinal arteries (CRA) was recorded five times daily. All measurements were taken after two phases of treatment and compared. Results. The mean baseline IOP was 14. 8 ± 3. 5 mmHg. Mean IOP, following bimatoprost monotherapy (12. 8 ± 2. 9 mmHg) and after two months of dorzolamide adjunctive therapy (12. 2 ± 2. 6 mmHg) were not statistically significant (p= 0. 544). Only at the 4 AM timepoint IOP was significantly reduced using the bimatoprost/dorzolamide combined therapy (p= 0. 013). The 24 -hour IOP fluctuations were lower when dorzolamide was added (6. 0 ± 2. 3 mmHg vs. 4. 6 ± 1. 5 mmHg, p= 0. 0016). Repeated ANOVA analysis detected a significant decrease of vascular resistance in the OA(p= 0. 0167) with adjunctive dorzolamide treatment. Conclusions. The addition of dorzolamide to morning-dosed bimatoprost had an additive hypotensive effect only on the nighttime IOP curve at 4 AM and resulted in a lower IOP fluctuation.

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} effect of intravitreal {{corticosteroids}} as first-line adjunctive treatment in acute post cataract surgery endophthalmitis. Methods We conducted a multicenter prospective, randomized, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study</b> including patients with acute post cataract surgery endophthalmitis. All patients received the initial intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycine 1 mg, ceftazidime 2 mg) with intravitreal betamethasone (400 μg) in the group 1 {{but not in the}} group 2. At day 2, all patients had the same invitreal antibiotics with betamethasone (400 μg). A prompt or deferred vitrectomy could be associated with this treatment if baseline visual acuity was limited to light perception. The primary endpoint was the BCVA (logMAR) and the secondary endpoint was the impact on intraocular pressure Results We report the preliminary results on the first 54 patients;. 24 patients were included in the group 1 and 30 in the group 2. The BCVA was better in the group 1 at 8 days (1. 44 ± 0. 90 vs 1. 90 ± 1. 0 logMAR), at one month (0. 50 ± 0. 69 vs 1. 24 ± 1. 11 logMAR) and at 3 months (0. 52 ± 0. 87 vs 0. 99 ± 1. 13 logMAR). The confidence intervals were overlapping, except at one month, suggesting a statistical significance at this point. There was no difference in both groups considering the intraocular pressure at day 8 : 14. 13 mmHg (IC 95 %: 10. 29 - 17. 97) in the group 1 and 12. 52 mmHg (IC 95 %: 10. 49 - 14. 55) in the group 2. Conclusion Intravitreal corticosteroids as a first line adjunctive treatment in acute post cataract surgery endophthalmitis seem to accelerate the recovery of visual acuity but do not seem {{to have an impact on}} the final functional outcome.

Methods: This prospective, randomized, parallel-group, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study</b> included 28 subjects who received either a single-dose VTP or 3  months of doxycycline treatment. At baseline and 3  months post treatment, all subjects were evaluated for the following: dry eye symptoms with a standard dry eye questionnaire (the Standard Patient Evaluation for Eye Dryness [SPEED]), meibomian gland (MG) function by counting the number of glands yielding liquid secretion with the MG evaluator (MGE), tear breakup time (TBUT) and corneal and conjunctival staining. Results: In the VTP group, at 3  months, there was a significant improvement in MG function (4. 00 ± 1. 47 to 7. 73 ± 5. 53), SPEED score (11. 00 ± 3. 30 to 5. 42 ± 2. 15), TBUT (6. 26 ± 2. 01 to 8. 44 ± 1. 81), corneal staining (0. 38 ± 0. 50 to 0. 12 ± 0. 33) and conjunctival staining (1. 69 ± 1. 93 to 0. 62 ± 0. 85). In the doxycycline group, there was a significant improvement in MG function (4. 63 ± 1. 41 to 10. 63 ± 5. 91), SPEED score (13. 42 ± 4. 17 to 9. 42 ± 5. 47) and conjunctival staining (2. 38 ± 1. 88 to 1. 13 ± 1. 51), but the improvement in TBUT (6. 90 ± 2. 56 to 7. 59 ± 2. 03) and corneal staining (0. 21 ± 0. 41 to 0. 13 ± 0. 34) was not statistically significant (p= 0. 262 and p= 0. 414, respectively). At 3  months, SPEED score was significantly better in the VTP group (p< 0. 05); other parameters were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion: A single 12 -minute bilateral VTP procedure was significantly more effective than the 3 -month daily course of oral doxycycline at improving the dry eye symptoms secondary to MGD. A single 12 -minute VTP treatment was at least as effective as a dose of doxycycline for 3  months, in improving MG function and all measured signs of MGD. Given the minimal risk profile of the single VTP procedure over long-term doxycycline use, a single VTP presents a favorable alternative to long-term antibiotic use.

In this multicenter, <b>single-masked,</b> randomized <b>study,</b> 240 patients with signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis were randomized to receive 1 of the following 8 treatments twice daily: cromolyn sodium/chlorpheniramine maleate, diclofenac, epinastine, fluorometholone, ketotifen, levocabastine, naphazoline/antazoline, and olopatadine. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated by a masked operator using a 10 -point scale at the moment of enrollment (day 0) and at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The percentage of patients achieving at least a small (at least 50 % reduction of the total scale score) or a good (at least 75 %) improvement of signs and symptoms was calculated at each visit. Tolerability was also evaluated as the duration of discomfort after instillation. RESULTS. All drugs gave some improvement in symptoms in more than 85 % of cases. Epinastine and olopatadine obtained at least a good relief of symptoms in 37 % and 33 % of cases at week 1. At the end of the study, good improvement of symptoms was obtained in at least 70 % of patients by epinastine, ketotifen, fluorometholone, and olopatadine, whereas a 75 % improvement for signs was obtained only by fluorometholone and ketotifen. Naphazoline/antazoline induced higher discomfort compared to the other study treatments (p< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS. The efficacy of epinastine, ketotifen, and olopatadine in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis was comparable to fluorometholone.

Methods: In this prospective, <b>single-masked</b> crossover <b>study,</b> patients were randomized 1 : 1 to BTFC-DTFC or DTFC-BTFC treatment sequences. Patients self-administered each medication for 7 days, with a 48 -hour washout period between treatments, and rated ocular discomfort after each treatment period. Medication preferences based on ocular comfort (primary endpoint) and anticipated adherence were assessed. Safety outcomes included adverse events and intraocular pressure. Between-group differences in treatment preference and ocular discomfort scores were analyzed using chi-square and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests, respectively. Adherence, intraocular pressure, and adverse events were summarized descriptively. Results: In total, 112 patients were enrolled (mean ± SD age, 66 ± 11 years), and 109 patients completed the study. Numerically, more patients in the intent-to-treat dataset preferred BTFC versus DTFC (59. 3 % versus 40. 7 %); however, this result was not statistically significant (treatment difference, 18. 6 %; P= 0. 0670). Mean ocular discomfort scores (range, 0 – 9) were statistically significantly lower with BTFC versus DTFC (2. 6 versus 3. 7; P= 0. 0002, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test). More patients who preferred BTFC over DTFC were confident that they would adhere to their preferred medication. Treatment-related adverse events included blurred vision with BTFC and eye irritation or eye pain with DTFC. Conclusion: BTFC and DTFC were preferred by approximately 60 % and 40 % of patients, respectively, and BTFC was associated with less patient-reported ocular discomfort.

40|$|A {{total of}} 22 {{patients}} with acute ischemic stroke participated in two randomized, <b>single-masked,</b> placebo-controlled <b>studies</b> that evaluated {{the safety and}} pharmacokinetics of single escalating intravenous doses of lubeluzole. The first dose of study medication in all patients was given within 6 hours of {{the first sign of}} stroke onset. In the first study, 6 patients received a single 1 -hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg of lubeluzole; 4 of these patients received an additional 10 -mg dose 3 to 4 days later. Two additional patients received placebo. In the secund study, 4 patients received a single 1 -hour infusion of 10 mg of lubeluzole, and 2 patients received placebo. After a safety evaluation of the second study, 6 additional patients received 15 mg of lubeluzole, and 2 other patients received placebo. Lubeluzole had no clinically relevant effects on any cardiovascular variable compared with placebo. The majority of adverse experiences were mild to moderate and resolved during treatment. No unexpected electroencephalogram abnormalities were observed, and no evidence of epileptiform discharges was found in any of the patients. At the end of the infusion, plasma lubeluzole concentrations decayed biphasically, with mean distribution half-lives of 46. 3 to 101. 0 minutes and mean terminal half-lives of 20. 8 to 27. 7 hours. Comparisons of the dose-normalized values of the individual plasma concentrations {{at the end of the}} infusion and the total area under the curve from time 0 to infinity suggested that lubeluzole exhibited linear kinetics over the dose range evaluated in patients with ischemic stroke.

Methods: 35 OAG patients (35 eyes), 31 women (88. 6 %) age 63. 3 (8. 9) years were evaluated in a 3 month randomized, cross-over, <b>single-masked</b> <b>study.</b> During the experiments BP, heart rate, IOP and OPP were assessed 4 times per day (8 – 12 – 16 – 20 h). RBF was measured twice per day (8 – 20 h) using Color Doppler imaging in the ophthalmic (OA), central retinal (CRA), nasal (nSPCA) and temporal (tSPCA) posterior ciliary arteries. In each vessel, peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were assessed and vascular resistance (RI) calculated. Results: Both add-on therapies lowered IOP in a statistically significant manner from 15. 7 ± 2. 4 mmHg at latanoprost baseline to 14. 9 ± 2. 2 mmHg using dorzolamide (p < 0. 001) and 14. 2 ± 1. 9 mmHg using timolol (p < 0. 001). The IOP lowering effect was statistically significant at 20 h, favoring timolol as compared to dorzolamide (1. 4 ± 2. 4 vs. 0. 2 ± 2. 1 mmHg), (p < 0. 05). Dorzolamide add-on therapy showed smaller IOP (2. 0 ± 1. 4), SPP (13. 3 ± 7. 9), systolic BP (13. 5 ± 8. 7) and diastolic BP (8. 4 ± 5. 4) fluctuations as compared to both latanoprost baseline or timolol add-on therapies. Higher difference between morning and evening BP was correlated to decreased evening CRA EDV in the timolol group (c = − 0. 41; p = 0. 01). With increased MAP {{in the morning or}} evening hours, we found increased evening OA RI in timolol add-on group (c = 0. 400, p = 0. 02; c = 0. 513, p = 0. 002 accordingly). Higher MAP fluctuations were related to impaired RBF parameters during evening hours-decreased CRA EDV (c = − 0. 408; p = 0. 01), increased CRA RI (c = 0. 576; p < 0. 001) and tSPCA RI (c = 0. 356; p = 0. 04) in the dorzolamide group and increased nSPCA RI (c = 0. 351; p = 0. 04) in the timolol add-on group. OPP fluctuations correlated with increased nSPCA RI (c = 0. 453; p = 0. 006) in the timolol group. OPP fluctuations were not related to IOP fluctuations in both add-on therapies (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Both dorzolamide and timolol add-on therapies lowered IOP in a statistically significant fashion dorzolamide add-on therapy showed lower fluctuations in IOP, SPP and BP.

These agents have not been previously compared in a prospective manner to determine their efficacy in these settings. Methods: This prospective, <b>single-masked,</b> randomized <b>study</b> comprised 256  eyes from 128  consecutive patients being treated with LASIK or PRK who were randomized to receive tetracaine in one eye and proparacaine in the other. The patients were blinded as to which anesthetic agent was used in each eye. Pain levels were graded on a 0 – 10  scale, and were assessed upon instillation, during surgery, immediately postoperatively, 30  minutes postoperatively, overnight, and on postoperative day 1. Patients were asked 30  minutes after surgery which anesthetic agent they would choose. Results: Both anesthetic agents resulted in diminished amounts of subjective pain in patients undergoing LASIK and PRK. Tetracaine caused significantly more pain upon instillation than proparacaine for both LASIK and PRK patients. LASIK patients noted significantly less pain 30  minutes after surgery when treated with tetracaine. Significantly more LASIK patients preferred the eye treated with tetracaine. These differences were not present in the PRK group. Conclusion: Both tetracaine and proparacaine are effective methods of topical anesthesia in LASIK and PRK. Tetracaine caused significantly more pain upon instillation in all patients, but resulted in greater analgesia 30  minutes after surgery in the LASIK group. Patients in the LASIK group expressed a preference for tetracaine over proparacaine. There was no significant drop preference among PRK patients.

40|$|An objective, digital-imaging {{method of}} {{measuring}} corneal staining was evaluated in 24 subjects wearing soft contact lenses. The method {{was used to}} compare the clinical performance of common multipurpose care systems (MPS) for soft contact lens care. Subjects used three different MPS, one containing polyquaternium- 1 (PQ) and two containing polyhexanide (PX 1 and PX 2), for 2 weeks in a randomised, <b>single-masked</b> (investigator) crossover <b>study.</b> Corneal staining induced with the three MPS was analysed using an image-processing program (ImageTool, UTHSCSA Version 2, University of Texas, USA). Conjunctival hyperaemia and papillae were also evaluated. The intraclass correlation coefficient was similar with image analysis to that of investigator grading (0. 876, 0. 879, respectively). Significant differences in staining response were detected using the objective method. There was significantly less staining area with polyquaternium- 1 (PQ) than polyhexanide (PQ: 0. 12 mm 2, PX 2 : 0. 91 mm 2). Inferior palpebral papillae were significantly greater with PX 2 than with PQ (1. 0, 0. 7 (0 – 4), respectively). The technique was shown to be an effective method of evaluating different corneal staining responses. Bilateral corneal staining in three or more quadrants is useful in the diagnosis of MPS-related staining...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} effectiveness of the Trulign toric intraocular lens (IOL) in adults with cataract. SETTING: Eight private practices in the United States and 1 in Canada. DESIGN: Prospective randomized <b>single-masked</b> multicenter <b>study.</b> METHODS: A toric IOL (1. 25 D, 2. 00 D, or 2. 75 D, determined by a toric calculator) was implanted in eligible patients with age-related cataract requiring a 16. 00 to 27. 00 diopter (D) spherical IOL power and with a predicted postoperative astigmatism of 0. 83 to 2. 50 D. Eyes within the lowest cylinder range (predicted postoperative astigmatism 0. 83 to 1. 32 D) were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio between the 1. 25 D toric IOL group and the nontoric accommodating IOL (Crystalens) control group. RESULTS: The toric 1. 25 D group had a statistically significantly greater percentage reduction in absolute cylinder (P < . 001) and uncorrected distance visual acuity (P = . 002) {{than the control group}} at the 120 - to 180 -day visit. The mean monocular uncorrected vision at distance, intermediate, and near was 20 / 25, 20 / 22, and 20 / 39, respectively, with the 1. 25 D, 2. 00 D, and 2. 75 D toric IOLs in aggregate (toric group). In addition, 96. 1 % of patients (123 / 128) had 5. 0 degrees or less absolute IOL rotation postoperatively. Regarding safety, the endpoints for preservation of corrected visual acuity and the incidence of complications and adverse events were met. CONCLUSION: The toric IOL was safe and effective in reducing the effects of preoperative corneal astigmatism and provided excellent uncorrected distance and intermediate vision and functional near vision.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} if {{the combination}} of partial reduction (PR) orthokeratology (ortho-k) and spectacles for residual refractive errors in the daytime was effective to slow myopic progression in high myopic children. METHODS: High myopic children (aged 8 to 11 years) with spherical equivalent refraction at least - 5. 75 diopters (D) and myopia - 5. 00 D or more myopic were recruited and randomly assigned into PR ortho-k and control groups. Subjects in the PR ortho-k group were fitted with custom made four-zone ortho-k lenses with target reduction of 4. 00 D for both eyes, and the residual refractive errors were corrected with single-vision spectacles for clear vision in the daytime. Control subjects were fully corrected with single-vision spectacles. Axial length of each eye of all subjects was measured with the IOLMaster at 6 -month intervals by a masked examiner. This study was registered at www. clinicaltrial. gov with the identifier NCT 00977236. RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects were recruited and randomized to the PR ortho-k and control groups. Twelve PR ortho-k and 16 control subjects completed the study. Compared with the residual refractive errors at the 1 -month visit (after stabilization of ortho-k treatment), the median increase in noncycloplegic residual myopia at the 24 -month visit was 0. 13 D. In the control group, the median increase in myopia was 1. 00 D {{at the end of}} the study. The mean ± SD increases in axial length were 0. 19 ± 0. 21 mm in the PR ortho-k group and 0. 51 ± 0. 32 mm in the control group (95 % confidence interval, - 0. 55 to - 0. 12; unpaired t test, p = 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS: This <b>single-masked</b> randomized <b>study</b> showed that PR ortho-k effectively slowed myopic progression in high myopes. Axial length elongation was 63 % slower in PR ortho-k-treated children compared with children wearing spectacles. School of Optometr...|$|R

Methods: In this prospective, <b>single-masked</b> crossover <b>study,</b> patients were randomized 1 : 1 to BTFC-DTFC or DTFC-BTFC treatment sequences. Patients self-administered each medication for 7 days, with a 48 -hour washout period between treatments, and rated ocular discomfort after each treatment period. Medication preferences based on ocular comfort (primary endpoint) and anticipated adherence were assessed. Safety outcomes included adverse events and intraocular pressure. Between-group differences in treatment preference and ocular discomfort scores were analyzed using chi-square and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests, respectively. Adherence, intraocular pressure, and adverse events were summarized descriptively. Results: In total, 112 patients were enrolled (mean ± SD age, 66 ± 11 years), and 109 patients completed the study. Numerically, more patients in the intent-to-treat dataset preferred BTFC versus DTFC (59. 3 % versus 40. 7 %); however, this result was not statistically significant (treatment difference, 18. 6 %; P= 0. 0670). Mean ocular discomfort scores (range, 0 – 9) were statistically significantly lower with BTFC versus DTFC (2. 6 versus 3. 7; P= 0. 0002, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test). More patients who preferred BTFC over DTFC were confident that they would adhere to their preferred medication. Treatment-related adverse events included blurred vision with BTFC and eye irritation or eye pain with DTFC. Conclusion: BTFC and DTFC were preferred by approximately 60 % and 40 % of patients, respectively, and BTFC was associated with less patient-reported ocular discomfort. Greater ocular comfort of glaucoma medications may improve treatment adherence. Keywords: brinzolamide, dorzolamide, fixed combination, ocular discomfort, patient preferenc...|$|R

Methods: In this randomized, prospective, <b>single-masked,</b> fellow-eye <b>study,</b> photorefractive keratectomy was performed on 46 eyes from 23 patients, with one eye randomized to WaveLight Allegretto, and the fellow eye receiving VISX CustomVue. Three-month postoperative outcome measures included uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, refractive error, root mean square of total and grouped higher-order aberrations, contrast sensitivity, and Schirmer&rsquo;s testing. Results: Mean values for uncorrected distance visual acuity (logMAR) were &mdash; 0. 03 &plusmn; 0. 07 and &mdash; 0. 06 &plusmn; 0. 09 in the wavefront-optimized and wavefront-guided groups, respectively (P = 0. 121). Uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20 / 20 or better was achieved in 91 % of eyes receiving wavefront-guided photorefractive keratectomy, and 87 % of eyes receiving wavefront-optimized photorefractive keratectomy, whereas uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20 / 15 was achieved in 35 % of the wavefront-optimized group and 64 % of the wavefront-guided group (P &ge; 0. 296). While root mean square of total higher-order aberration, coma, and trefoil tended to increase in the wavefront-optimized group (P = 0. 091, P = 0. 115, P = 0. 459, respectively), only spherical aberration increased significantly (P = 0. 014). Similar increases were found in wavefront-guided root mean square of total higher-order aberration (P = 0. 113), coma (P = 0. 403), trefoil (P = 0. 603), and spherical aberration (P = 0. 014). There was no significant difference in spherical aberration change when comparing the two platforms. The wavefront-guided group showed an increase in contrast sensitivity at 12 cycles per degree (P = 0. 013). Conclusion: Both VISX CustomVue and WaveLight Allegretto platforms performed equally in terms of visual acuity, safety, and predictability in photorefractive keratectomy. The wavefront-guided group showed slightly improved contrast sensitivity. Both lasers induced a comparable degree of statistically significant spherical aberration, and tended to increase other higher-order aberration measures as well.

40|$|Purpose: To compare chilled {{and room}} {{temperature}} {{balanced salt solution}} (BSS) and bandage contact lens (BCL) on post photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) pain. Methods: In a prospective, <b>single-masked,</b> controlled eye <b>study,</b> one hundred eyes of fifty patients {{were divided into two}} groups which received room temperature or chilled BSS and BCL in each eye, and compared for post-PRK pain. Three different pain evaluation systems were used to evaluate pain between the groups at 1 and 6 Â h and days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, postoperatively. Results: 15 patients were male (30 %), and 35 were female (70 %). The mean age was 29 Â Â±Â  5 (20 â 40) y/o. The mean spherical equivalent (SE) of preoperative refractive error in both groups was not statistically significantly different (â 4. 18 Â Â±Â  1. 5 in chilled and â 4. 19 Â Â±Â  1. 7 in room-temperature groups, respectively; PÂ =Â  0. 94). The mean time of epithelial healing was 6. 16 Â Â±Â  1. 7 (3 â 13) days in the chilled and 6. 10 Â Â±Â  1. 59 (3 â 12) in the room temperature group (PÂ =Â  0. 32). Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 1 month was 0. 013 Â Â±Â  0. 03 (0 â 0. 22) logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in the chilled group and 0. 014 Â Â±Â  0. 04 (0 â 0. 22) logMAR in the room temperature group, postoperatively (PÂ =Â  0. 84). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups by any of the three pain scoring systems. No clinically important corneal haziness was found in the groups during follow-up.

Methods: In this randomized, prospective, <b>single-masked,</b> fellow eye <b>study,</b> LASIK {{was performed on}} 44 eyes (22 patients), with one eye randomized to WaveLight Allegretto, and the fellow eye receiving VISX CustomVue. Postoperative outcome measures at 3 months included uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), refractive error, root-mean-square (RMS) value of total and grouped HOAs, contrast sensitivity, and Schirmers testing. Results: Mean values for UDVA (logMAR) were - 0. 067 &plusmn; 0. 087 and - 0. 073 &plusmn; 0. 092 in the WF optimized and WF guided groups, respectively (P = 0. 909). UDVA of 20 / 20 or better was achieved in 91 % of eyes undergoing LASIK with both lasers while UDVA of 20 / 15 or better was achieved in 64 % of eyes using the Allegretto platform, and 59 % of eyes using VISX CustomVue (P = 1. 000). In the WF optimized group, total HOA increased 4 % (P = 0. 012), coma increased 11 % (P = 0. 065), and spherical aberration increased 19 % (P = 0. 214), while trefoil decreased 5 % (P = 0. 490). In the WF guided group, total HOA RMS decreased 9 % (P = 0. 126), coma decreased 18 % (P = 0. 144), spherical aberration decreased 27 % (P = 0. 713) and trefoil decreased 19 % (P = 0. 660). One patient lost one line of CDVA secondary to residual irregular astigmatism. Conclusion: Both the WaveLight Allegretto and the VISX CustomVue platforms had equal visual and safety outcomes.
