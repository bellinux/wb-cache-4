25|$|Screamers {{was stuck}} in {{development}} hell {{for over a decade}} before finally being produced. Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon had completed his adaptation of Dick's short story Second Variety in the early 1980s (along with his adaptation of another of Dick's short <b>stories,</b> <b>We</b> Can Remember It For You Wholesale, which became the 1990 film Total Recall). By 1983, O'Bannon's screenplay for Screamers had been optioned by Tom Naud (SFX designer on the 1981 film Outland). However, the production never went ahead as planned and {{it was not until the}} 1990s that Screamers went into production, by which time the screenplay had been rewritten by Miguel Tejada-Flores. The film, directed by Christian Duguay, was made in Canada. Locations included a quarry in Quebec, in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, as well as Joliette.|$|E
500|$|When {{the series}} began, Chris Carter {{did not think}} of {{creating}} a [...] "mythology" [...] for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, because he felt that [...] "they were just <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> wanted to tell". Eventually, however, the writers saw that the most [...] "personal" [...] episodes were those based on the government conspiracy. Another reason for the development of an ongoing mythology was that the producers were afraid of not creating a thread between the episodes centering on the conspiracy, feeling that it would be pretentious not to do so.|$|E
500|$|The {{collection}} contains the first episodes in the series' mythology, or fictional story arcs. When the series began, Chris Carter {{did not think}} of creating a [...] "mythology" [...] for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, because he felt that [...] "they were just <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> wanted to tell". Eventually, however, the writers saw that the most [...] "personal" [...] episodes were those based on the government conspiracy, and, as such, developed more stories based around the conceit. Jerry Hardin, William B. Davis, Mitch Pileggi, Tom Braidwood, Dean Haglund and Bruce Harwood all play supporting roles in the collection. Released on June 7, 2005, the collection received generally positive reviews from critics.|$|E

500|$|In January 2013, Joss Whedon {{deflected}} {{any direct}} influences from other series, {{such as the}} efforts of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in The X-Files, and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on [...] "the peripheral people...the people {{on the edges of}} the grand adventures." [...] As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences [...] "seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the <b>stories,</b> <b>we</b> really enjoy that." [...] Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, [...] "The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Jason Bovberg praised the episode for its [...] "spooky wonderfulness", {{stating that the}} episode scared his daughter. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "A fun, 'scary' (for little kids) SpongeBob that adults will appreciate, 'Graveyard Shift' uses the old standby of the headless/handless/legless (take your pick) killer-seeking-revenge <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> all told as kids, and cleverly grafts it onto a 'SpongeBob at work' storyline." [...] Mavis added, [...] "I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass, the voice actor for Squidward, gets quiet and {{manipulative}} when he's shining SpongeBob on, and here's {{one of the best}} examples of that." [...] He praised Count Orlok's cameo, [...] "especially when they animate the vampire's face into a goofy, giddy smile." [...] Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his [...] "personal faves." [...] He also said [...] " [...] has everything that makes the show great: funny dialogue (the whole story of the Hash-Slinging Slasher is hilarious), clever sight gags (especially SpongeBob's regenerating limbs), and that aforementioned outta-nowhere ending that made me bust a gut." ...|$|E
500|$|She then starred {{alongside}} Mark Ruffalo in the 2004 {{independent film}} We Don't Live Here Anymore. The {{film is a}} drama {{which was based on}} the short <b>stories</b> <b>We</b> Don't Live Here Anymore and Adultery by Andre Dubus, and depicts the crisis of two married couples. She reunited with Sean Penn in The Assassination of Richard Nixon, which was set in 1974. She played Marie Andersen Bicke, the wife of the would-be presidential assassin Samuel Byck (Penn). Finally in 2004, she teamed up with Jude Law and Dustin Hoffman in David O. Russell's ensemble comedy I Heart Huckabees. Watts next starred and co-produced with director/screenwriter Scott Coffey her film, the semi-autobiographical drama Ellie Parker (2005), which depicted the struggle of an Australian actress in Hollywood. The film began as a short film that was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001 and was expanded into a feature-length production over the next four years. Film critic Roger Ebert praised Watts' performance: [...] "The character is played by Watts with courage, fearless observation and a gift for timing that is so uncanny it can make points all by itself." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2014, Disney Animation {{commenced}} a 16-month upgrade of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building, {{in order}} to fix what Catmull had called its [...] "dungeon-like" [...] interior. For example, the interior was so cramped {{that it could not}} easily accommodate [...] "town hall" [...] meetings with all employees in attendance. [...] Disney did not disclose the renovation's cost, but Lasseter revealed that [...] "he whole center of the second floor will have an atrium that will go up two <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> want to make this building so beautiful that it's worthy of the artistic talent that's there." [...] In addition, it was revealed that the large sorcerer's hat would become the building's main entrance. Lasseter stated, [...] "There will be a gorgeous stairway that goes up into the hat, it's a really great symbol like you're entering the building through the magic of Mickey Mouse's hat." [...] Due to the renovation, the studio's employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio spaceâ€“ the DisneyToon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building). Director Don Hall analogized the studio's relocation to the end of The Empire Strikes Back, where [...] "you know they're going to get back together." [...] The renovation was completed in October 2016.|$|E
500|$|The stories {{themselves}} were designed as glimpses into the Halo universe, including {{information on the}} inner workings of the alien Covenant, as well as details regarding elements of the back-story that were hitherto undisclosed. Jarrard explained that [...] "The stories that happen off camera, the parallel events to the arcs that our fans know from the existing mediums, are the <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> really wanted to tell." [...] Jarrard further described this as an attempt to move away from the story of the Master Chief, the central character of the franchise, and focus instead on what they believed to be the core themes that lay behind the game universe, such as maintaining hope in the face of overwhelming odds and humanity's struggle for survival; themes that extended beyond [...] "...a genetically enhanced super soldier picking up two guns and kicking some alien butt." [...] The four stories that ended up in the final publication were [...] "the most interesting to , and the writers of [...] ". Although Bungie created the story arcs present in the Halo Graphic Novel, the studio described the importance of providing a framework for each story that the various artists and writers could tell without jeopardizing their own voice. Artist Simon Bisley said that [...] "the stress was to make the characters look very much as they do in the game. Beyond that point I was given free rein to interpret the script and the action" [...] based on what was given to the artists and writers.|$|E
500|$|Palmer was {{contacted}} by a Chicago businessman interested in starting an sf magazine, {{and took the}} opportunity to resolve his financial problems by forming a new company, Bell Publications, in partnership with the businessman (whose name was never revealed), and starting two magazines: Universe Science Fiction and Science Stories. [...] Universes first issue appeared in June 1953, while Other Worlds was still being published. [...] It was financed by Palmer's partner, and intended as a bimonthly, though in fact the first four issues were on a quarterly schedule. [...] It was edited by Palmer and Mahaffey, who used the collective pseudonym [...] "George Bell" [...] for the first two issues. [...] Science Stories followed in October, also edited by Palmer and Mahaffey as [...] "George Bell", and published by Bell Publications; this was effectively the same magazine as Other Worlds Science Stories, with [...] "Other Worlds" [...] dropped from the title. [...] In the second issue of Science Stories Palmer explained the reason for the new magazine: [...] "For a variety of reasonsâ€”and let's be honest, most of them were financialâ€”we had to make a spur-of-the-moment decision to discontinue Other Worlds and replace it with the magazine you are now reading. [...] We phoned the typesetter, halted work on the August OW, and lifted the editorial and <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> needed for Science Stories No. 1 from OW material on hand". Subscribers to Other Worlds were given the option to continue their subscription with whichever of the two magazines they preferred.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the <b>stories,</b> <b>we</b> really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something I think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not just any powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isnâ€™t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966â€“69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E

[...] He added he preferred this video to the official one. The official music video was directed by Mark Pellington and released on February 17, 2012. Mraz explained [...] "The story of the video is that we all have our <b>stories.</b> <b>We</b> all have our own version of sufferingâ€¦.and everybody has many things to not give up on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Manson is {{an atheist}} but {{has long been}} {{interested}} in spirituality. She recalled, [...] "When I was very small, I was very besotted with the church, absolutely I loved the theatre of it and I got very involved in all the <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> were taught." [...] When she was about 12, she had an argument with her father at the dinner table, screaming at him that [...] "religion's a sham and I'm not going to church anymore, it's just bullshit". She stopped going to church but continued to have theological debates with him every Sunday. Manson became disenchanted with organized religion and although she maintained an interest in spirituality, she complained that she [...] "brushed up against too many examples of hypocritical spiritualists".|$|E
2500|$|Trouble {{was much}} more themed on Christianity than their debut, {{although}} its nature was philosophical rather than spiritual. Characterized by James Carter, [...] "The last album, we wrote about our everyday lives... {{the majority of the}} songs were about skateboarding and <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> made up. This album, pretty much every song is about Christianity." [...] The band leveled criticism at the church and Christians generally, sometimes using sarcasm, reminding one reviewer of Steve Taylor. [...] "Tip from Me" [...] is about breaking broad perceptions of Christianity and the Church. The purpose of the song was to acknowledge problems with the church, say to the non-Christian that [...] "Yeah, we see the problems too," [...] and a call to the Christian to act to fix them. In the song [...] "Stupid" [...] the band used the example of abortion clinic bombings (see, for example Eric Robert Rudolph) to make a pronounced statement about hypocrisy.|$|E
