Low elastic modulus and low surface energy of variously engineered fluorinated/siloxane copolymers were regarded as two important parameters to design effective coatings which prevent the adhesion of foulants and eventually release the attached organisms. The classes of amphiphilic polymers under consideration were represented by random copolymers derived from <b>styrene</b> <b>monomers</b> containing siloxane, fluoroalkyl and ethoxylated side chains, diblock copolymers derived from <b>styrene</b> and <b>styrene</b> <b>monomers</b> containing siloxane, fluoroalkyl and ethoxylated side chains, and triblock copolymers derived from <b>styrene</b> and <b>styrene</b> <b>monomers</b> containing siloxane, fluoroalkyl and ethoxylated side chains.
