5000|$|Penalization {{has several}} effects on inference, {{relative}} to a regular GLM. For one thing the estimates are subject to some smoothing bias, which is the price that must be paid for limiting estimator variance by penalization. However if smoothing parameters are selected appropriately the (squared) smoothing bias introduced by penalization should be less than the reduction in variance that it produces, so that the net effect is a reduction in mean <b>square</b> <b>estimation</b> error, relative to not penalizing. A related effect of penalization is {{that the notion of}} degrees of freedom of a model has to be modified to account for the penalties' action in reducing the coefficients' freedom to vary.

40|$|Power {{estimation}} is {{an important}} issue in digital VLSI circuit design. The estimation of average power dissipation of a circuit through exhaustive simulation is impractical due to the large number of primary inputs and their combinations. In this paper, two algorithms based on least <b>square</b> <b>estimation</b> are proposed for determining the average power dissipation in CMOS circuits. Least <b>square</b> <b>estimation</b> converges faster by attempting to minimize the mean square error value during each iteration. Two approaches namely, the sequential least <b>square</b> <b>estimation</b> and the recursive least <b>square</b> <b>estimation,</b> are investigated. The proposed methods are distribution independent in terms of the input samples, unbiased and point estimation based. Experimental results for the MCNC ' 91 and the ISCAS ' 89 benchmark circuits are presented.

Multisensor Bearings-Only passive target tracking can solve the problem using exchange data. So the constrained Least Square Estimation(CLSE) algorithm is proposed for Multisensor Bearings-Only passive target tracking. The constrained condition is introduced to the Least <b>Square</b> <b>Estimation</b> algorithm firstly. Then the eigenvector corresponding to the least eigenvalue of the matrix is used to overcome the shortcoming of Extend Kalman Filter algorithm which needs the initial value. Also the bias problem of Least <b>Square</b> <b>Estimation</b> is conquered.

40|$|Experimental {{design and}} Taguchi's {{parameter}} design are widely employed by industry {{to optimize the}} process/product. However, censored data are often observed in product lifetime testing during the experiments. After implementing a repetitious experiment with type II censored data, the censored data are usually estimated by establishing a complex statistical model. However, using the incomplete data to fit a model may not accurately estimates the censored data. Moreover, the model fitting process is complicated for a practitioner who has only limited statistical training. This study proposes a less complex approach to analyze censored data, using the least <b>square</b> <b>estimation</b> method and Torres's analysis of unreplicated factorials with possible abnormalities.
