5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the first season, as he {{believed}} Egan to be creative, passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the Christmas season in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing <b>stage</b> <b>as</b> little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E

50|$|Currently {{there is}} no one staging system for all neuroendocrine neoplasms. Well {{differentiated}} lesions generally have their own staging system based on anatomical location, whereas poorly differentiated and mixed lesions are <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> carcinomas of that location. For example, gastric NEC and mixed adenoneuroendocrine cancers are <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> a primary carcinoma of the stomach.|$|R
2500|$|The TNM {{system is}} used to record the {{anatomical}} extent of disease. It is useful to condense these categories into groups. carcinoma in situ is categorized stage 0; often tumours localized to the organ of origin are <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> I or II depending on the extent, locally extensive spread, to regional [...] nodes [...] are <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> III, and those with distant metastasis <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> <b>stage</b> IV. [...] However, in some tumour types stage groups {{do not conform to}} this simplified schema. The stage group is adopted with the intention that categories within each group are more or less homogeneous in respect of survival, and that the survival rates are distinctive between groups.|$|R

Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the <b>stage</b> <b>as</b> part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{performed}} with aim to analyze differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pathological T 4 (pT 4), {{related to the}} DTC patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 1 -pT 3. Methods: 267 patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 1 -pT 4 were treated in a period from 1977 to 2000, and followed {{until the end of}} 2001. Out of the total number, 117 patients were <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 4, 49 patients as pT 3, 78 patients as pT 2, and 23 patients as pT 1. All patients were treated surgically, by radioiodine and by hormonal therapy; some of them underwent external radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Results: We staged 36 male and 81 female patients. pT 4 : 98 patients with papillary carcinoma (PAP), and 19 patients with follicular (FOL) DTC. In pT 4 stage regional metastases (N 1) were found in 68 patients, distant metastases (M 1) in 21 patients, and disease related lethal outcome occurred in 10 patients. In pT 1 stage N 1 were present in 21 patients, M 1 in 2 patients, and lethal outcome in 2 patients; in pT 2 stage N 1 was present in 37 patients, M 1 in 8 patients and lethal outcome in 5 patients; in pT 3 stage N 1 were present in 14 patients, M 1 in 11 patients, and lethal outcome in 5 patients. Regional metastases of DTC patients were significantly more frequent in pT 4 stage than in DTC patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 2 and pT 3, but they were significantly more frequent in pT 1 stage (p< 0. 001). Distant metastases were significantly more frequent in DTC patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 4, related to the patients in pT 1 and pT 2 stage, but statistical difference was not significant to the patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 3. We did not find any statistical difference in lethal outcome between patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 4 and patients in pT 1, pT 2 or pT 3 stages. Complete remission after treatment was achieved in 41. 5 % of pT 4 patients partial remission in 20. 8 %, unchanged status in 14. 2 %, exacerbation in 7. 6 % disease related lethal outcome was observed in 8. 5 %, while 5. 7 % of patients died from concomitant diseases. The survival probability of all pT 4 patients at 5 years was 0. 904 + 0. 0401, at 10 years 0. 84 + 0. 058, at 15 years 0. 764 + 0. 09. In pT 4 patients with M 1 the survival probability was significantly shorter. Conclusion: DTC patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 4 had significantly more frequent N 1 and M 1 than patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 2 -pT 3, and more frequent M 1 compared to patients in pT 1 stage, but patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 1 had N 1 very frequently because most of them were detected after discovery of N 1. Stage pT 4 had no significant influence to the lethal outcome, related to patients <b>staged</b> <b>as</b> pT 1 -pT 3. The expected survival in pT 4 patients was long, probably as a result of multimodal treatment, including I- 131...|$|R

5|$|In 1913 he {{debuted in}} film, {{but he only}} had modest success in the medium.

During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement.

The next two stages both resulted in a bunch sprint, with Guido Bontempi winning stage 7 and Franco Chioccioli, stage 8. The ninth stage contained the climbs of Monte Terminillo and La Forca and was considered one of the tougher stages in the race. Malvor-Bottecchia-Vaporella rider Acácio da Silva won the <b>stage</b> <b>as</b> the top of the general classification rankings remained unchanged from the previous days.|$|E
5|$|Many riders used normal {{road race}} bikes for this <b>stage,</b> <b>as</b> {{the course is}} highly {{atypical}} for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not.
