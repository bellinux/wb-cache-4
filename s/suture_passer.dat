40|$|The {{following}} {{report has}} been prepared based upon an assignment {{given by the}} company, Ortopedic Care Scandinavia AB. The paper is an exam on basic level, 15 credit points at higher level education within product development. Ortopedic Care Scandinavia AB is working with product development of medical technology products. What makes the corporate unique {{is the fact that}} the development is based upon problems encountered by surgeons in their daily work. Suggestions for improvement in technology are given directly by the end users. This paper is based upon such problems. Product development was made on the medical instrument called, <b>suture</b> <b>passer.</b> The instrument is used in endoscopic surgery of the rotator cuff. The cuff is a group of four muscles (and their respective tendons) that stabilize the shoulder. In case of an accident, mostly sport related, these muscles can loosen from the bone. In surgery a <b>suture</b> <b>passer</b> is then used to penetrate the injured tendon with a needle with an attached suture. The passer creates a loop of suture that can be used to attach the damaged tendon. The report is based upon the following problem formulations: The needle has an inconvenient edge that can damage the muscle. The strength of the suture thread is deteriorated by the design of the needle. The suture thread has been known to snap when the surgeon apply to much pressure when tying. If the patient is suffering from subacromial impingement the jaw of the instrument can appear to be clumsy and hard to open. The jaw has sharp teeth which have been known to get stuck in the tendon. The surgeon must then perform an uncontrolled movement which might damage the tendon. The jaw limits the surgeons’ choice of thickness of the suture thread. The thickness of the needle used in the <b>suture</b> <b>passer</b> is limited to one size.   The purpose of the project is to develop a new concept that minimizes the risk for the patient and at the same time the concept should facilitate the work of the surgeon. The concept should meet the set requirements and be presented in the form of renderings of CAD-models and drawings. To achieve this process the instrument uses four different components. The needle, the jaw, the handle and an attachment between the needle and the handle.   Under heading 5, the generating process, each component presents to together with arguments of its design. The instrument consist of 25 components that are all developed from the ground up. The result should be viewed as a thorough concept that can be used for further development. It is recommended that the next step should be an investigation about material choice. When the material is specified a prototype should be manufacture and then used for testing. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{evaluates the}} {{feasibility}} of lapa-roscopic transfascial suture repair of umbilical hernias when combined with another laparoscopic procedure that potentially contaminates the peritoneal cavity. Method: From August 1997 to November 2001, 32 pa-tients underwent laparoscopic umbilical suture repair in association with another laparoscopic procedure. The re-pair was performed with the Carter-Thomason suture pas-ser. Results: Of the 32, 26 patients with more than 1 -year follow-up {{were included in the}} study. The mean diameter of the umbilical hernia defect was 1. 67 cm (range, 0. 5 to 3).

40|$|Massive {{irreparable}} {{rotator cuff}} tears are {{often associated with}} severe functional impairment and disabling pain. One viable treatment option is a latissimus dorsi tendon transfer. We propose an all-arthroscopic technique that we believe avoids insult to the deltoid musculature while reducing morbidity from open harvest of the tendon. The operation is performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position, by use {{of a combination of}} viewing and working portals in the axilla. The initial viewing portal is placed along the anterior belly of the latissimus muscle in the axilla. The latissimus and teres major are identified, as is the thoracodorsal neurovascular pedicle. The tendons are carefully separated, and the inferior and superior borders of the latissimus are whipstitched using a <b>suture</b> <b>passer,</b> which helps facilitate subsequent mobilization of the muscle. The interval deep to the deltoid and superficial to the teres minor is developed into a subdeltoid tunnel for arthroscopic tendon transfer. The latissimus tendon is then transferred and stabilized arthroscopically to the supraspinatus footprint with suture anchors. Our preliminary data suggest that this surgical technique results in improvement in pain, range of motion, and function...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{literature}} suggests that laparoscopic repair of ventral hernias may have very low recurrence rates. However, laparoscopy may not be feasible in certain situations. We describe an open technique that uses the tension-free retrofascial principles of laparoscopic repair {{without the need for}} subcutaneous flaps. Through an incision in the hernia, the peritoneum is entered and adhesions are taken down. A piece of DualMesh (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Newark, Del) is trimmed to fit with a 5 -cm circumferential overlap. A vertical incision is made in the mid portion of the mesh. The mesh is fixed in an intraperitoneal retrofascial position using GORE-TEX sutures (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc). The sutures are brought through the abdominal wall using a laparoscopic <b>suture</b> <b>passer</b> and tied into place {{on one side of the}} mesh. That side is then tacked to the posterior fascia with a spiral tacking device. The other side is sutured into place in a similar fashion and then tacked to the fascia by passing the spiral tacking device through the incision in the mesh. The mesh incision is closed with a running GORE-TEX suture. The overlying tissues are closed in layers...|$|E

40|$|Triangular {{fibrocartilage}} complex (TFCC) insertion {{into the}} fovea of the distal ulna plays {{a crucial role}} in stabilizing the distal radioulnar joint. Consequently, surgical reattachment against avulsion of the foveal TFCC insertion is required to stabilize the distal radioulnar joint. However, because of technical difficulties, no arthroscopic procedure for such a lesion has currently been established. We present a new technique for arthroscopic reattachment of the avulsed TFCC into the fovea. An osseous tunnel 2. 9 mm in diameter is created from the ulnar neck to the foveal surface. Under arthroscopic guidance, a nonabsorbable <b>suture</b> <b>passed</b> into a 21 gauge needle is placed into the TFCC through the osseous tunnel.

40|$|Purpose: Too {{develop a}} {{flexible}} drill device {{that can be}} inserted into the shoulder joint so that arthro-scopic transosseous suture repair for Bankart lesion is possible. Materials and Methods: We created a device composed of a flexible drill unit and a guide pipe unit. The flexible drill unit was made of flexible multifilament wires (1. 2 mm in diameter) that was twisted into one cord {{so that it can}} flex in any direction and a drill bit (1. 2 mm in diameter) that is attached onto one end of the flexible wire. The guide pipe unit was a 150 mm long metal pipe (2. 0 mm in inner diameter and 3. 0 mm in outer diameter), with one end bent to 30 degrees. The flexible drill set was inserted into the shoul-der joint through the posterior portal of the joint. The guide pipe component was placed onto the medial wall of the glenoid so that the pipe was placed 5 mm posterior to the margin of the anterior glenoid rim. The flexible drill was driven through the glenoid by the power drill so that holes were made in the gle-noid. A non- absorbable suture was passed through the hole.

40|$|Background: Repair of incisional hernia (IH) in {{the elderly}} is a {{challenge}} for the surgeon. Primary closure is preferable but is not always possible because of high recurrence rates of IH repaired without a prosthesis and/or possible respiratory and cardiovascular complications due to extreme tension of the margins. We report our experience with underlay mesh placement in elderly patients with large IH. Methods: A total of 72 patients from January 2003 to December 2009 underwent IH repair involving placement of an intraperitoneal Gore® DualMesh® prosthesis. The prosthesis was first anchored at eight points in a compass rose pattern using a Gore® <b>suture</b> <b>passer</b> and then firmly secured to the abdominal wall with a 360 ° internal crown running suture. Results: Two intraoperative intestinal tears occurred during debridement and were immediately sutured. Postoperative complications included seven seromas, four hematomas, and two infections, {{one of which was}} resolved with conservative treatment while one required prosthesis removal. Conclusion: This surgical procedure, like laparoscopic treatment, allows the surgeon to avoid dissection of the abdominal layer and improves prosthesis adhesion with reinforcement of the incisional area near the abdominal defect. The reduction in operation time is remarkable. Despite good results in terms of safety and minimal recurrence for laparoscopy in the management of IH, the use of minimally invasive techniques for large incisional wall defects, especially in elderly patients, is still controversial and practiced by few surgeons. This open technique avoids cardiopulmonary complications arising from pneumoperitoneum {{in the elderly}}...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDisplaced tibial {{intercondylar}} eminence fractures require early {{reduction and}} stable fixation to prevent nonunion, knee instability, {{and a lack}} of extension. Many types of surgical procedure are recommended including arthrotomy or an arthroscopic technique to stabilize the fracture segment using Kirschner wire, screws, staples, and suture fixation. However, contemporary arthroscopic techniques and devices can facilitate intra-articular surgery and have been applied to the treatment of this fracture. In our current report, we describe a simple suture fixation method under arthroscopy for the treatment of tibial intercondylar eminence fractures. We treated eight knees of eight patients. One patient had a Type II fracture and seven patients had a Type III fracture according to Meyer's classification. Following the arthroscopic inspection of concomitant injuries, debridement of hematoma, and reduction of the fragment, two nonabsorbable sutures (Ethibond No. 2, Johnson & Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA) were advanced through the <b>suture</b> <b>passer</b> device, which is used to penetrate the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) near to the insertion site of the displaced fragment. Two surgical sutures were pulled out by the suture retriever from the anterior proximal tibia hole and were fixed to the tibia cortex bone with a double-spike plate. At follow-up, radiographic examinations showed that bone union was achieved in all cases. All but one patient could resume normal activities with no restrictions and no ligamentous instability. All knees had a negative Lachman's test and showed a gain of stable ligament function by KT 2000 arthrometer evaluation. One patient had an insignificant extension limitation and experienced slight pain after walking but these symptoms were minimal. In conclusion current arthroscopic surgery techniques for tibial intercondylar fractures can be easily performed and reproducibly achieve secure fixation and early mobilization of the knee...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Rotator cuff {{tears are}} {{frequently}} associated with pathologies {{of the long}} head of the biceps tendon (LHBT). Tenotomy and tenodesis of the LHBT are commonly used to manage disorders of the LHBT. Methods We present an arthroscopic soft tissue LHBT tenodesis associated with a Roman Bridge (double pulley – suture bridges) repair Results Two medial row 5. 5 -mm Bio-Corkscrew suture anchors (Arthrex, Naples, FL), double-loaded with No. 2 FiberWire sutures (Arthrex, Naples, FL), are placed in the medial aspect of the footprint. A shuttle is passed through an anterior point of the rotator cuff and through the LHBT {{by means of a}} Penetrator or a BirdBeak <b>suture</b> <b>passer</b> (Arthrex, Naples, FL). A tenotomy of the LHBT is performed. All the sutures from the anteromedial anchor are passed through a single anterior point in the rotator cuff using a shuttle technique. All the sutures from the posteromedial anchor are passed through a single posterior point in the rotator cuff. The sutures in the medial row are tied using the double pulley technique. A suture limb is retrieved from each of the medial anchors and manually tied as a six-throw surgeon's knot over a metal rod. The two free suture limbs are pulled to transport the knot {{over the top of the}} tendon bridge. The two free suture limbs are then used to produce suture bridges over the tendon, using a Pushlock (Arthrex, Naples, FL), placed 1 cm distal to the lateral edge of the footprint. The same double pulley – suture bridges technique is repeated for the other two suture limbs from the two medial anchors. Conclusion This technique allows to perform a double pulley – suture bridges repair for a rotator cuff tear, associated with a soft tissue tenodesis for the management of LHBT pathology. The tenodesis of the LHBT is performed just with the passage of a shuttle inside the LHBT, after passing it through the anterior portion of the rotator cuff, with successive detachment of the LHBT from the glenoid. It is a technically easy procedure which can be performed relatively quickly, and does not require additional fixation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Most arthroscopic {{rotator cuff}} repairs utilize <b>suture</b> <b>passing</b> devices placed through arthro- scopic cannulas. These devices {{are limited by}} the size of the passing device where the <b>suture</b> is <b>passed</b> through the tendon. An {{alternative}} technique has been used in the senior author’s practice for the past ten years, where sutures are placed through the rotator cuff tendon using percutaneous passing devices. This technique, dubbed the global percutaneous shuttling technique of rotator cuff repair, affords the placement of sutures from nearly any angle and location in the shoulder, and has the potential advantage of larger suture bites through the tendon edge. These advantages may increase the area of tendon available to compress to the rotator cuff footprint and improve tendon healing and outcomes. The aim of this study is to describe the global percutaneous shuttling (GPS) technique and report our results using this method. The GPS technique can be used for any full thickness rotator cuff tear and is particularly useful for massive cuff tears with poor tissue quality. We recently followed up 22 patients with an average follow up of 32 months to validate its usefulness. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved significantly from 37 preoperatively to 90 postoperatively (P< 0. 0001).

The IHM repair technique is performed by running an interlocking horizontal mattress suture, starting at the far end. The <b>suture</b> needle <b>passes</b> underneath the prior crossing suture to lock each throw. When the suture is finished, it is tied at the near end as shown in Fig.  2. In this technique, suture is performed at 0.5  cm from the tendon edge. For IHM, there are six loops for each suture.|$|R
30|$|Two {{transverse}} incisions are {{made and}} via subperiosteal dissection a <b>suture</b> is <b>passed</b> from the posteromedial to anterolateral using a right-angled and curved clamp. The Gigli saw {{is tied to}} the suture and is pulled from posterior to anterior. Elevators are inserted, and the posterior and lateral cortices divided. The medial periosteum is then elevated, and the cortex divided. The saw is cut with a wire cutter and removed.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{elements}} of midfacial aging include elongation {{of the lower}} eyelid, flattening of the malar eminence, hollowing in the submalar area, laxity of the jowls, and deepening of the nasolabial crease. Attention to rejuvenation of these areas has included various techniques involving movement of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) and elevation of the malar fat pad. A trend toward simplification in midface lifting has introduced the use of suspension sutures. Methods: This paper describes an approach to midfacial rejuvenation that combines the {{elements of}} SMAS plication and lateral SMASectomy with a suture suspension of themalar fat pad to achieve long-lasting improvement of the aging midface. The ptotic malar fat pad is suspended by suture to the deep temporal fascia. The <b>suture</b> <b>passes</b> from the subcutaneous position where it is fixed to the malar fat pad, through the SMAS, and over the periosteum of the zygoma, and is fixed to the deep temporal fascia. Plication of the SMAS over the suture, combined with lateral SMASectomy, provides three vectors of elevation beneat...|$|R
