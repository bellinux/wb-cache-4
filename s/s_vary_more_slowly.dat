We measure the variation by Lipschitz Bound (LB) – functions which admit smaller LB are considered to <b>vary</b> <b>more</b> <b>slowly.</b> Since most functions in practice are wiggly and do not admit a small LB, we extend this framework by approx-imating a wiggly function, f, by ones which admit a smaller LB and do not deviate from f {{by more than a}} specified Bound Deviation (BD). In fact for any positive LB, one can find such a BD, thus defining a trade-off function (LB-BD function) between the variation measure (LB) and the deviation measure (BD). We show that the LB-BD function satisfies nice properties: it is non-increasing and convex. We also present a method to obtain it using convex optimization. For a function with given LB and BD, we find the optimal fit and present deter-ministic bounds for the prediction error of various methods. Given the LB-BD function, we discuss picking an appropriate LB-BD pair for fitting and calculat-ing the prediction errors.

Here tipping refers to the dramatic change in dynamical behavior characterized by a rapid transition away from a previously attracting state. In {{the absence of the}} periodic forcing, it is well-known that a slowly varying bifurcation parameter produces a delay in this transition, beyond the bifurcation point for the static case. Using a multiple scales analysis, we {{consider the}} effect of amplitude and frequency of the periodic forcing relative to the drifting rate of the slowly varying bifurcation parameter. We show that a high frequency oscillation drives an earlier tipping when the bifurcation parameter <b>varies</b> <b>more</b> <b>slowly,</b> with the advance of the tipping point proportional to the square of the ratio of amplitude to frequency. In the low frequency case the position of the tipping point is affected by the frequency, amplitude and phase of the oscillation.

Using this information we are able to show that the collocation method using splines of order k (degree k - 1) converges with optimal order O(h"k). (The collocation points are the midpoints of subintervals when k is odd and the break-points when k is even, and stability is shown under the assumption that the method may be modified slightly.)

The relaxation data do not agree qualitatively with theories of superconducting pair breaking due to paramagnetic impurities. At low temperatures (T < 0. 2 K) 1 T 1 T is approximately constant in UBe 13, with a value which decreases with decreasing applied field. This behavior is probably not due to direct relaxation by paramagnetic impurities, for which the temperature dependence would be in the opposite sense. For x= 0. 033 1 /T 1 varies less rapidly than T 3. The additional relaxation may be due to filling in the gap by Th-induced pair breaking.

Here, we study {{the question of how}} this "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach can be implemented within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. We first show that slow feature analysis, an algorithm that is based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons by means of a modified Hebbian learning rule. This approach provides a link to the trace rule, which is another implementation of slowness learning. Then, we show analytically that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window. By studying the learning dynamics of STDP, we show that for functional interpretations of STDP, it is not the learning window alone that is relevant but rather the convolution of the learning window with the postsynaptic potential. We then derive STDP learning windows that implement slow feature analysis and the "trace rule. " The resulting learning windows are compatible with physiological data both in shape and timescale. Moreover, our analysis shows that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics, respectively. The theory indicates that irreversible input statistics are not in favor of stable weight distributions but may generate oscillatory weight dynamics.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} Dual-detector density logs {{which have}} been used in the petroleum industry for years. The tool was designed with a second detector to allow compensation for the effect of a layer of mudcake between the tool and the formation being measured. The compensation algorithm commonly used calculates the correction to apply to the density measured by the long-spaced detector as proportional to the difference in the densities measured by the two detectors. The coefficient of proportionality is determined from experimental data taken with the tool in a fluid-filled hole of 15 to 40 cm diameter, with uniform thickness sheets of various materials simulating the mudcake. In applying this technology for the Containment program at the Department of Energy Nevada Test Site (NTS) we have discovered two problems. First, we frequently log in air-filled holes much larger than 40 cm. Second, the gap, or layer, is rarely uniform with depth or vertical position {{on the face of the}} tool. We have developed a method to determine the proper amount of correction dynamically. No experimental data on the gap effect are needed as long as the two detectors are calibrated to read the proper density when the gap is zero. The method assumes that the form of the equation used in the standard algorithm is correct, but uses the variation of the two density signals with depth to determine the appropriate value of the coefficient, assuming true density <b>varies</b> <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than the gap effects. This new, maximum likelihood, method appears to work better than the standard method in both fluid and air-filled holes where the borehole wall is rough and no mudcake is present.

The solution is fully characterised by only one dimensionless number, the persistence angle, which is the typical angle of rotation during the correlation time of the angular velocity. We first show that the two-dimensional case is exactly solvable. When the persistence angle is large, a series for the correlation function has the surprising property that its sum <b>varies</b> much <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than any of its individual terms. In three dimensions we obtain asymptotic forms for the correlation function, in the limits where the persistence angle is very small and very large. The latter case exhibits a complicated transient, followed by a much slower exponential decay. The decay rate is determined by the solution of a radial Schrödinger equation in which the angular momentum quantum number takes an irrational value, namely j =½ (√ 17 - 1). Possible applications of the model to objects tumbling in a turbulent environment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are {{currently}} the best probes {{of the dark}} energy in the universe. To constrain the nature of dark energy in a model-independent manner, we allow the density of dark energy, ρX(z), to be an arbitrary function of redshift. Using simulated data from a space-based supernova pencil beam survey, we find that by optimizing the number of parameters used to parametrize the dimensionless dark energy density, f (z) = ρX(z) /ρX(z = 0), we can obtain an unbiased estimate of both f (z) and the fractional matter density of the universe Ωm (assuming a flat universe and that the weak energy condition is satisfied). A plausible supernova pencil beam survey (with a square degree field of view and for an observational duration of one year) can yield about 2000 SNe Ia with 0 ≤ z ≤ 2 (Wang 2000). Such a survey in space would yield SN peak luminosities with a combined intrinsic and observational dispersion of σ(mint) = 0. 16 mag. We find that for such an idealized survey, Ωm can be measured to 10 % accuracy, and the dark energy density can be estimated to ∼ 20 % to z ∼ 1. 5, and ∼ 20 - 40 % to z ∼ 2, depending on the time dependence of the true dark energy density. Dark energy densities which <b>vary</b> <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> can be <b>more</b> accurately measured. For the anticipated SNAP mission, Ωm can be measured to 14 % accuracy, and the dark energy density can be estimated to ∼ 20 % to z ∼ 1. 2. Our results suggest that SNAP may gain much sensitivity to the time-dependence of the dark energy density and Ωm by devoting more observational time to the central pencil beam fields to obtain more SNe Ia at z> 1. 2. We use both maximum likelihood analysis and Monte Carlo (when appropriate) to determine the errors of estimated parameters. We find that Monte Carlo analysis gives a more accurate estimate of the dark energy density than the maximum likelihood analysis...|$|R
