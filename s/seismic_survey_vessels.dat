50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s and {{continuing}} into the 1980s surplus SHORAN systems had become widely used to provide precision navigation in {{oil and gas exploration}} industry. Companies like pioneer Offshore Navigation, Inc., Navigation Management, Coastal Surveys (based in Singapore) and Western Geophysical deployed SHORAN receivers to navigate <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> <b>vessels</b> and position drilling rigs around the world. The technology was key to the successful development of the offshore oil & gas industry in the postwar era. Truck-portable SHORAN transponders and up to 90 ft antennas were set up within a few feet of geodesic survey markers near the coast. SHORAN chains consisting of three or four shore stations were used to provide highly accurate navigation across large exploration tracts and as much as 200 mi offshore. Frequently, the massive vacuum tube transmitters were fitted with solid-state control boxes for more reliable operation and to improve reception of weaker signals over the horizon.|$|E
40|$|Between 1999 and 2009, {{autonomous}} hydrophones {{were deployed}} to monitor seismic activity from 16 ° N to 50 ° N along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These data were examined for airgun sounds produced during offshore surveys {{for oil and}} gas deposits, as well as the 20 [*]Hz pulse sounds from fin whales, which may be masked by airgun noise. An automatic detection algorithm was used to identify airgun sound patterns, and fin whale calling levels were summarized via long-term spectral analysis. Both airgun and fin whale sounds were recorded at all sites. Fin whale calling rates were higher at sites north of 32 ° N, increased during the late summer and fall months at all sites, and peaked during the winter months, a time when airgun noise was often prevalent. <b>Seismic</b> <b>survey</b> <b>vessels</b> were acoustically located off the coasts of three major areas: Newfoundland, northeast Brazil, and Senegal and Mauritania in West Africa.

40|$|In a {{world of}} {{constant}} technological development and expansion into the marine environment, the marine soundscape is constantly changing. With the addition of anthropogenic sources from naval sonar to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> <b>vessels</b> over the past century, the deficiency of knowledge {{on the impact of}} such acoustic disturbance leaves little guidance for effective regulation of anthropogenic marine noise pollution. To help address this, the U. S. Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) has teamed with multiple academic and scientific institutions to research and catalog the baseline behavioral ecology across a range of odontocete species, which can then serve as a baseline for additional research. This report examines a portion of that project, conducted to assess the response of Risso’s dolphin, Grampus griseus, to natural stimuli. During an August 2013 playback study off Southern California, acoustic data were collected via digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) to identify the vocal response of three Risso’s dolphins, Grampus griseus. The playbacks consisted of calls from three cetacean species: Megaptera novaeangliae, Orcinus orca, and Grampus griseus. To determine whether the vocal rate measurements could be reliably quantified, a repeatability experiment was conducted. Two playback studies (O. orca and G. griseus) were conducted on one animal, while three playbacks (O. orca, G. griseus, and M. novaeangliae) were presented to two animals. Only one of the tagged animals demonstrated a noteworthy response to the O. orca exposure, with more than a 500 % increase in vocalizations after the playback. Vocal rate did not vary considerably in the tag with O. orca and G. griseus playbacks and the other tag resulted in roughly zero vocalizations during pre- and post-playbacks. Based on the small sample size, it appears that G. griseus response varies {{in the presence of a}} predator – with one tag demonstrating a dramatic increase of vocal rate when exposed to O. orca calls. These results are a necessary early step in gathering baseline information on the behavioral ecology of cetaceans susceptible to anthropogenic acoustic impact. A continuation of this project and further research is necessary to fully understand how marine mammals perceive and are impacted by human expansion into the marine soundscape...|$|E

40|$|A <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> was {{conducted}} off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia in 2010. The survey area was {{adjacent to the}} only known near-shore feeding ground of the Critically Endangered population of western gray whales Eschrichtius robustus in the western Pacific south of the Aleutian Islands. This study examined the effectiveness of efforts to minimize the behavioural responses of the whales to vessel proximity and sound during the survey. Two shore-based behavioural observation teams monitored whale movements and respirations pre-, during and post-seismic survey. Theodolite tracking and focal-animal follow methods were used to collect behavioural data. Mixed linear models were used to examine deviations from 'normal' patterns in 10 movement and 7 respiration response variables in relation to vessel proximity, vessel/ whale relative orientations and 8 received sound metrics to examine if <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> sound and/or <b>vessel</b> activity influenced the whales' behaviour. Behavioural state and water depth were the best 'natural' predictors of whale movements and respiration. After considering natural variation, none of the response variables {{were significantly associated with}} <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> or <b>vessel</b> sounds. A whale's distance from shore and its orientation relative to the closest vessel were found to be significantly influenced by vessel proximity, which suggested some non-sound related disturbance. The lack of evidence that the whales responded to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> sound and <b>vessel</b> traffic by changing either their movement or respiration patterns could indicate that the current mitigation strategy is effective. However, power analyses suggest that our sample sizes were too small to detect subtle to moderate changes in gray whale behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{efficiency}} of diesel-electric marine vessels has been subject for discussion with focus on improving fuel efficiency, reducing the environmental footprint from emissions, as well as reducing running hours and maintenance costs. This paper presents an analysis of load profiles extracted from three different vessels during operation: 1) a ferry; 2) a platform supply vessel; and 3) a <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> <b>vessel.</b> The analysis of the extracted data shows that the loadings of the diesel engines are typically quite low, and do not fall within the optimal loading range of diesel engines' specific fuel oil consumption curves. Furthermore, three different power plant configurations are proposed and compared, which include fixed-speed (diesel engine generators) and variable-speed gensets and the implementation of an energy storage system. Moreover, energy management system (EMS) algorithms based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are proposed as a suitable strategy for optimal unit commitment in the power generation. The results yielded from the MILP algorithms are compared with those from the EMS algorithms based on logic such as if/else statements. The results indicate that optimal EMS algorithms in combination with a revised vessel configuration can increase the operational efficiency, in terms of fuel savings and reduction in genset running hours...|$|R

DalMorNefteGeofizika (DMNG), {{on behalf of the}} Sakhalin- 1 consortium, conducted a 3 -D <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> of the Odoptu license area during 17 August-September 2001. A portion of the primary known feeding area of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is located adjacent to the seismic block. The data presented here were collected as part of daily monitoring to determine if there was any measurable effect of the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> on the distribution and abundance of western gray whales. Mitigation and monitoring program included aerial surveys conducted between 19 July and 19 November using the methodology outlined by the Southern California High Energy <b>Seismic</b> <b>Survey</b> team (HESS). These surveys provided documentation of the distribution, abundance and bottom feeding activity of western gray whales in relation to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> sounds. From an operations perspective, the aerial surveys provided near real-time data on the location of whales in and outside the feeding area, and documented whether whales were displaced out of an area normally used as feeding habitat. The objectives of this study were to assess (a) temporal changes in the distribution and abundance of gray whales in relation to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey,</b> and (b) the influence of <b>seismic</b> <b>survey,</b> environmental factors, and other variables on the distribution and abundance of gray whales within their preferred feeding area adjacent to Piltun Bay.

40|$|AbstractThere {{is great}} {{interest}} in exploring and exploiting hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic, {{and one of the}} main methods of locating and assessing such resources is <b>seismic</b> <b>survey.</b> Marine <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> involve the use of airguns that introduce high-energy noise to the Arctic’s largely pristine underwater acoustic environment. Narwhals may be particularly sensitive to this noise but so far no studies have addressed the question of direct effects of high-energy airgun pulses on these animals. We are concerned about the possibility that three large recent ice entrapments were causally linked to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> activities. On these occasions narwhals remained in coastal summering areas until well into the fall and early winter season, delaying their annual offshore migration and becoming lethally entrapped by rapidly forming fast ice. About 1000 narwhals died in an ice entrapment in Canada in 2008 and about 100 in two entrapments in Northwest Greenland in 2009 – 10. We conclude that studies of the direct effects of <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> on narwhals are urgently needed and should ideally precede further <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> in narwhal habitats...|$|R
