40|$|The {{sense that}} {{you are about to}} be shown {{something}} wrong lingers throughout this bizarre semi-narrative. Appropriated imagery of natural disasters, paper crafts, mutated animals, abject beauty and genocide form an exquisite corpse of uncanny connectivity with chirrupy 1950 s advertising music or romantic classical. Is this a test? A sensual <b>strip</b> <b>curtain</b> of shiny black pvc suddenly slides in front of the frame - further teasing the relationship with the material act of viewing and constructing meaning, and you are faced with a lo-fi gameshow puzzle that provides no opportunity to engage and a live, rubber-headed nurse continues your aptitude test. “You have a split emotional register,” you are told, “would you like me to reseal it?...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} systems, {{machines}} and methods that assist in creating energy savings including: gas, electricity, HVAC, lighting, daylighting, motion detection, insulated glazing, refrigerator <b>strip</b> <b>curtains,</b> revolving doors, anterooms, thermostat controls, demand-control ventilation and voltage optimisation ...|$|R
25|$|Hangars {{with open}} {{superstructures}} often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation {{especially in the}} evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. <b>Strip</b> <b>curtains</b> and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips {{to the side of}} the door) by the personnel in the hangar concern (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010).|$|R
5000|$|The three leading players, Igor Ilinsky, Maria Babanova and Vasily Zaichikov were so {{in harmony}} they became known collectively as 'Il-Ba-Zai'. Babanova {{was viewed as}} the first great actress to emerge after the October Revolution. A typical review of her acting read as follows: Today no one knows her name but {{tomorrow}} she will be hailed as {{the first of a}} new galaxy of young actresses. Actresses magically born and reared amidst an arid expanse of wooden constructions, under the piercing gaze of a spotlight on a bare stage - <b>stripped</b> of <b>curtains,</b> wings, of all the mysteries of the old theatre. Actresses who owe that theatre nothing.|$|R
60|$|This, however, did {{not satisfy}} the captain, and orders were {{forthwith}} {{given that the}} fire should be taken away, the <b>curtains</b> <b>stripped</b> off, the feather beds removed, and everything reduced to {{pretty much the same}} state in which it had usually been left for Harry Norman's accommodation. So much for all the feminine care which had been thrown away upon the consideration of Uncle Bat's infirmities.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} {{exceptionally}} slender with only 1400 m2 of {{gross floor area}} per floor, because of a zoning regulation limiting the total building floor area to twelve times the property area. Its façade is more ornamental {{than that of the}} average International style tower, with horizontal <b>strips</b> of glass <b>curtain</b> wall alternating with spandrels of various types of stone, including green slate that was quarried in Wales. The building was fully renovated in 1991, and the highly visible CIBC logo at the top was redesigned in 2004 and again in 2013.|$|R
40|$|In {{high-rise}} building fire, {{a large amount}} of fresh air will be pressurized into the fire floor when smoke ventilation and prevention system is used. The fresh air dilutes the smoke, but it also reduces the efficiency of mechanical exhaust. The assumption that vertical composition smoke control model (air curtain combined with pressurization and exhaust fan) is put forward. The mathematic model of smoke flow in {{high-rise building}} and κ-ε three-dimension turbulence model with two equations are used, and the influences of smoke exhaust effect with different smoke control modes are analyzed. The simulation and experiments results show that: in <b>strip</b> corridor, air <b>curtain</b> can effectively prevents the smoke moving into the atria, but the smoke control time is short relatively. While using air curtain combined with positive pressure, the smoke control time at least has an increase of 60 s, and the vertical composition smoke control model has the same effect as atria pressurization model, but the volume of fresh air has decreased by 1 / 3...|$|R
