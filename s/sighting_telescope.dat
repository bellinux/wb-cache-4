25|$|Norden's {{first attempt}} at an {{improved}} bombsight was actually an advance in PDI design. His idea was to remove the manual electrical switches used to move the pointer and use the entire bombsight itself as the indicator. He proposed attaching a low-power <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> to a gyro platform that would keep the telescope pointed at the same azimuth, correcting for the aircraft's movements. The bombardier would simply rotate the telescope left or right to follow the target. This motion would cause the gyros to precess, and this signal would drive the PDI automatically.|$|E
25|$|Initially the 60 pounder {{was fitted}} with tangent sights on a rocking bar with the range scale {{graduated}} to 10,400 yards and 22 degrees, the rear sight had a deflection scale. Before the First World War it was fitted with oscillating (reciprocating) sights, using the older No 5 <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> (x12 magnification) on either Sight Oscillating BL 60 pr Mk I or II, {{which included a}} sight clinometer and range scale {{as well as a}} deflection drum for the telescope. This was replaced by the No 3 carrier for the No 7 dial sight.|$|E
25|$|Carl L. Norden Company {{incorporated}} in 1931, supplying the sights under a dedicated source contract. In effect, {{the company was}} owned by the Navy. In 1934 the newly-forming GHQ Air Force, the purchasing arm of the US Army Air Corps, selected the Norden for their bombers as well, as the M-1. However, due to the dedicated source contract, the Army had to buy the sights from the Navy. This was not only annoying for inter-service rivalry reasons, but the Air Corps' higher-speed bombers demanded several changes to the design, notably the ability to aim the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> further forward to give the bombardier more time to set up. The Navy {{was not interested in}} these changes, and would not promise to work them in. Worse, Norden's factories were having serious problems keeping up with demand for the Navy alone, and in January 1936, the Navy suspended all shipments to the Army.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{rangefinder}} {{had significant}} mass and inertia, the crosslevel servo normally was only lightly loaded, because the rangefinder's own inertia kept it essentially horizontal; the servo's task was usually simply {{to ensure that}} the rangefinder and <b>sight</b> <b>telescopes</b> remained horizontal.|$|R
50|$|During the Siege of Leningrad, LIFMO {{continued}} {{to operate a}} military repair facility for the Leningrad front. It {{was established in the}} first days of war and it fabricated test and measurement instruments for army and navy units. During the Siege, the facility developed improved optical sights, fixed artillery binoculars, gun panoramas, anti-aircraft <b>sighting</b> <b>telescopes,</b> periscopes, machined “cups” for anti-aircraft shells and parts for land and sea mines.|$|R
50|$|Cinetheodolites {{consist of}} a stable base and bearing, a {{vertical}} gimbal or trunnion carrier which rotates about a vertical axis normal to {{the plane of the}} base; a central drum or housing which contains the system telescopic lenses, plus a camera and film assembly; a horizontal trunnion shaft on which the central drum is mounted so that it can rise or dip about the horizontalaxis; and the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescopes,</b> which are also mounted on the horizontal trunnion shaft.|$|R
25|$|In practice, {{the target}} failed to stay {{centered}} in the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> {{when it was first}} set up. Instead, due to inaccuracies in the estimated wind speed and direction, the target would drift in the sight. To correct for this, the bombardier would use fine-tuning controls to slowly cancel out any motion through trial and error. These adjustments had the effect of updating the measured ground speed used to calculate the motion of the prisms, slowing the visible drift. Over {{a short period of time}} of continual adjustments, the drift would stop, and the bombsight would now hold an extremely accurate measurement of the exact ground speed and heading. Better yet, these measurements were being carried out on the bomb run, not before it, and helped eliminate inaccuracies due to changes in the conditions as the aircraft moved. And by eliminating the manual calculations, the bombardier was left with much more time to adjust his measurements, and thus settle at a much more accurate result.|$|E
2500|$|The Norden {{worked in}} an entirely {{different}} fashion, based on the [...] "synchronous" [...] or [...] "tachometric" [...] method. Internally, the calculator continually computed the impact point, as was the case for previous systems. However, the resulting range angle was not displayed directly to the bombardier or dialed into the sights. Instead, the bombardier used the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> to locate the target long in advance of the drop point. A separate section of the calculator used the inputs for altitude and airspeed to determine the angular velocity of the target, the speed at which it would be seen drifting backward due to the forward motion of the aircraft. The output of this calculator drove a rotating prism at that angular speed {{in order to keep the}} target centered in the telescope. In a properly adjusted Norden, the target remains motionless in the sights.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Sisson (1690 - 1747) was a {{prominent}} English instrument maker, {{the inventor of the}} modern theodolite with a <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> for surveying, and a leading maker of astronomical instruments.|$|E
5000|$|A related problem, {{particularly}} for large and longer range guns, {{was that the}} wheels could be at different heights due to {{the slope of the}} ground, which caused inaccuracy. Before the First World War, the British BL 60-pounder gun was fitted with oscillating (reciprocating) <b>sights,</b> using <b>sighting</b> <b>telescopes,</b> a <b>sight</b> clinometer and range scale as well as a deflection drum for the telescope. These mounts could be cross-leveled, which removed the need for the gun commander to calculate a deflection correction for uneven wheels. [...] Cross-leveling introduced the third axis into laying.|$|R

5000|$|Stabilizing {{signals from}} the Stable Element kept the optical <b>sight</b> <b>telescopes,</b> rangefinder, and radar antenna free {{from the effects of}} deck tilt. The signal that kept the rangefinder's axis {{horizontal}} was called [...] "crosslevel"; elevation stabilization was called simply [...] "level". Although the stable element was below decks in Plot, next to the Mk.1/1A computer, its internal gimbals followed director motion in bearing and elevation so that it provided level and crosslevel data directly. To do so, accurately, when the fire control system was initially installed, a surveyor, working in several stages, transferred the position of the gun director into Plot so the stable element's own internal mechanism was properly aligned to the director.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Octant. This instrument, {{labelled}} Crichton - London, Sold by J Berry, Aberdeen, {{appears to}} have an ebony frame with ivory scale, vernier and signature plate. The index arm and mirror supports are brass. Rather than use a <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope,</b> this instrument has a sighting pinnula.|$|E
5000|$|... {{replacing}} the Russian sight with a Pak 38 style anti-tank sighting block that could mount the standard ZF3x8 <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> or an emergency fold out iron sight. Like the Pak 40 and Pak 97/38, the sight mount had provision for attaching an indirect sighting device - the Aushilfsrichtmittel 38 (ARM38).|$|E
50|$|The Type 95 sight was {{originally}} designed {{with a maximum}} target speed of 600 kilometers per hour; however, experience showed that aircraft often exceeded this speed. To compensate for the problem a ring {{was added to the}} <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> to provide an additional offset for the speeds up to 900 kilometers per hour.|$|E
50|$|The gunner sits in {{the lower}} front of the commander. He uses a {{telescopic}} day sight as his main sight. In the T-55A this was the TSh2B-32P (in its final version), an advancement of the <b>sight</b> <b>telescope</b> of T-34. When not engaging targets, the gunner can use his telescope to scan the horizon, or use his own prism vision block for a much wider frontal view. For shooting at night the gunner used his TPN-1 telescope, which replaced the prism vision block from the T-54B onward. Under the day sight is the gunner's control pad with which he controls the turret and fires his weapons- right button for the main gun, left button for the machine gun. The turret is operated electrically, but can also be traversed, aimed and fired mechanically, though overall combat efficiency severely suffers.|$|R
50|$|The SSG 2000 has no iron sights {{by default}} {{and is usually}} fitted with Schmidt & Bender X1.5-6×42 variable-power or Zeiss Diatal ZA 8×56T fixed-power <b>telescope</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Remington MSR is a {{manually}} operated bolt-action weapon with a rotary locking bolt. To facilitate caliber change, the bolt {{is equipped with}} removable bolt heads, with bolt faces matched for appropriate calibers. Bolt heads have three radial locking lugs. The MSR rifle is built upon an aluminum alloy [...] "chassis", which hosts a compact receiver, adjustable trigger unit, pistol grip, and fully adjustable side-folding buttstock. The quick-change barrels are free-floated inside the tubular handguard which is provided {{with a number of}} user-installable Picatinny type accessory rails. The top of receiver also is fitted with monolithic Picatinny rail used to install <b>sighting</b> equipment (<b>telescope</b> <b>sights</b> or night vision sights). Additional equipment includes detachable folding bipod, and a quick-detachable suppressor which installs over the specially designed muzzle brake.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 the {{observatory}} was closed because of corrosion {{of the dome}} and defects in the dome traverse gear. Trees were allowed to grow up around the building and {{the observatory}} was neglected. At some point the observatory was broken into by thieves who stole the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope,</b> a modern replacement has since been installed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the drawing}} to the right, the horizon element (B) {{could be a}} mirror or a prism. On the index arm, the index mirror (A) rotated with the arm. A <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> was {{mounted on the frame}} (C). The index did not use a vernier or other device at the scale (D). Smith called the instrument's index arm a label, in the manner of Elton for his mariner's quadrant.|$|E
50|$|Churchills {{made use}} of the Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV. In the Mark VII, the driver had two {{periscopes}} {{as well as a}} vision port in the hull front that could be opened. The hull gunner had a single periscope as well as the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> on the BESA machine gun mounting. In the turret the gunner and loader each had single periscope and the commander had two fitted in his hatch cupola.|$|E
50|$|AUG LMG The Steyr AUG LMG (Light machine gun) {{is based}} on the AUG HBAR and fires from an open bolt to allow {{sustained}} fire, its <b>telescoping</b> <b>sight</b> has a 4× magnification rather than 1.5× magnification of the base AUG.|$|R
50|$|Saegmuller invented or {{contributed to}} the {{development}} of a multitude of devices. He held more than 35 patents. His inventions include the solar attachment for engineering transits, a new type of naval bore <b>sight,</b> and numerous <b>telescopes</b> and telescope mounts.|$|R
50|$|The Enfield Enforcer was a police-specific sniper variant used {{by various}} British police {{forces from the}} early 1970s. It {{was similar to the}} L39A1, with a sporter style butt. It was {{provided}} with a high-quality East German-made Pecar Berlin telescopic <b>sight.</b> The <b>telescope</b> mounts were of commercial pattern; they did not resemble the No.4 Mk1(T) type screw-on mounts used on the L42A1. Target sights similar to those used on the L39A1 were also fitted to the Enforcer. The 7.62×51mm NATO magazine was fitted, and 767 were made.|$|R
50|$|The 45° {{arc of the}} {{instrument}} (P-Q), was graduated with 90 divisions of a half-degree each. Each such division was subdivided into 60 parts and each part further divided into sixths. This results in the arc being marked in degrees, minutes and sixths of a minute (10 seconds). Thus {{the instrument}} could have readings interpolated to 5 seconds of arc. This fineness of graduation is only possible due to the large size of the instrument - the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> alone was three to four feet long.|$|E

5000|$|The Lloyd rifle was {{initially}} marketed as the [...] "David Lloyd <b>Telescope</b> <b>Sighted</b> Deer Stalking Rifle". David Lloyd had a private 400-yard rifle {{range in the}} grounds of his ancestral home, Pipewell Hall, Northamptonshire, {{and used it to}} set the zero of all his rifles before delivery to their owners.|$|R
50|$|The Gravity Probe B {{experiment}} comprised four London moment gyroscopes and {{a reference}} <b>telescope</b> <b>sighted</b> on HR8703 (also known as IM Pegasi), a binary {{star in the}} constellation Pegasus. In polar orbit, with the gyro spin directions also pointing toward HR8703, the frame-dragging and geodetic effects came out at right angles, each gyroscope measuring both.|$|R
50|$|A {{telescopic}} sight is an optical telescope equipped with {{some form of}} graphic image pattern reticle mounted in an optically appropriate position in the optical system to give an accurate aiming point. Telescopic sights are used {{on a wide range}} of devices including guns, surveying equipment, and even as <b>sights</b> on larger <b>telescopes</b> (called a finderscope).|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope</b> seems remarkable, given {{the small size of}} the telescopes on modern instruments. This was likely Newton's choice of a way to reduce {{chromatic}} aberrations. Short-focal length telescopes, prior to the development of achromatic lenses, produced an objectionable degree of aberration, so much so that it could affect the perception of a star's position. Long focal lengths were the solution, and this telescope would likely have had both a long-focal length objective lens and a long-focal length eyepiece. This would decrease aberrations without excessive magnification.|$|E
5000|$|Both the A13 Mk III Covenanter and the A15 Crusader designs {{used the}} same main turret. The turret was polygonal—with sides that sloped out then in again—to give maximum space on the limited turret ring diameter. Early {{production}} vehicles had a [...] "semi-internal" [...] cast gun mantlet, which was quickly replaced in production by a better protected larger cast mantlet with three vertical slits for the main gun, a coaxial Besa machine gun and for the <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope.</b> There was no cupola for the commander who instead had a flat hatch with the periscope mounted through it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} altazimuth instruments {{consisted of}} a base graduated with a full circle at the [...] and a vertical angle measuring device, most often a semicircle. An alidade on the base was used to sight an object for horizontal angle measurement, and a second alidade was mounted on the vertical semicircle. Later instruments had a single alidade on the vertical semicircle and the entire semicircle was mounted {{so as to be}} used to indicate horizontal angles directly. Eventually, the simple, open-sight alidade was replaced with a <b>sighting</b> <b>telescope.</b> This was first done by Jonathan Sisson in 1725.|$|E
50|$|The M3 Super 90 is {{available}} with various barrel lengths and stock options, with fixed butt and semi-pistol or pistol grips, or with top-folding butts and pistol grips. Sight options include shotgun-type open sights, rifle type open sights, ghost ring (diopter) sights and various mounts for reflex or low magnification <b>telescope</b> <b>sights</b> and tactical flashlights and laser pointers.|$|R
50|$|The WKW Wilk/Tor anti-materiel and/or {{sniper rifle}} {{makes use of}} a {{manually}} operated rotary bolt action weapon of bull-pup layout.
