40|$|Several common root {{diseases}} routinely damage {{sugar beet}} in Nebraska and other production {{areas of the}} Central High Plains, and it is becoming more common to find fields infested simultaneously with multiple pathogens. Owing to the shortage of available fungicides for economic management of soilborne diseases, alternative techniques such as biological control are increasingly being sought for disease management. Over the last several years, unidentified, sterile fungi have been isolated in conjunction with pathogens from infected sugar beet roots and seedlings. At least two promising isolates have been identified from in vitro assays that inhibit the radial growth of multiple <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>root</b> pathogens, including Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. betae, Phoma betae and Pythium aphanidermatum. Based on morphological and molecular characterisation, two isolates, ‘Hall’ and ‘R 47 ’, were putatively identified as Rhizoctonia zeae. In vitro pathogenicity testing indicated that these isolates were not pathogens of sugar beet. Both isolates were compared with the well-established biological control fungus Laetisaria arvalis and tested as potential treatments in a field naturally infested with multiple <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>root</b> diseases. Data indicated that these fungi provided some level of protection against a complex of soilborne diseases and suggest that these isolates could have a potential fit in an integrative management strategy for several <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>root</b> diseases...|$|E

In order to evaluate the effect of plant density and nitrogen and bio fertilizers on qualitative traits of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), two field experiments were carried out in Agriculture and Natural Resources Research Center in Khorasan-E- Razavi province in Mashhad, and agricultural research farm in Torbat-jam sugar factory during 2012.

To investigate if sugar beet is suitable as an alternative biomass crop to silage maize; three-year field trials with both biomass crops in rotations with winter wheat (food crop) and continuous cultivation were conducted at three highly productive sites. Dry matter (DM) yield per hectare was measured via field trials whereas methane yield per hectare was estimated via a calculation. Higher annual DM yield was achieved by silage maize (19. 5 – 27. 4 t∙ha− 1 ∙a− 1) compared to <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>root</b> (10. 7 – 23. 0 t∙ha− 1 ∙a− 1).

Therefore the harvest of the sugar beet tops (including leaves) can be considered as current task for the sugar beet growing system. Modern technologies involve harvest of the tops of sugar beet in two stages: flat basic cut and collecting of the entire green mass at higher altitude and the subsequent cutting of the heads of root crops from the residues. Therefore, topical issues of the sensing of the heads of sugar beet roots arranged in rows, are related to the majority of the sugar beet toppers, cleaners of the sugar beet heads, leaves cutters and, digging up working bodies of some designs. The aim of this study is theoretical determination the optimum design and kinematic parameters of a new sensing mechanism of the sugar beet heads located in the soil {{on the basis of the}} theory of interaction of flat passive swath board sensing organ with the sugar beet heads during their topping when located in the soil. In the study there are used methods of creation of mathematical models of functioning of the agricultural machines and their working bodies with the using of main provisions of mathematics, theoretical mechanics, programming and numerical calculations on the PC. In this paper, there is presented a theoretical study of the interaction of passive sensing organ with the head of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>root</b> when there are located residues of the leaves on a root head spherical surface in the form of short elastic rods.
