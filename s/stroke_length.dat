500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston <b>stroke</b> <b>length</b> of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E

50|$|Diesel engines {{usually have}} longer <b>stroke</b> <b>lengths</b> chiefly to {{facilitate}} achieving the necessary compression ratios.

50|$|Pumpjacks {{can also}} be used to drive what would now be {{considered}} old-fashioned hand-pumped water wells. The scale of the technology is frequently smaller than for an oil well, and can typically fit on top of an existing hand-pumped well head. The technology is simple, typically using a parallel-bar double-cam lift driven from a low-power electric motor, although the number of pumpjacks with <b>stroke</b> <b>lengths</b> 54 inches (137 cm) and longer being used as water pumps is increasing. An example can be found here.|$|R
50|$|The gas may be {{introduced}} by a Schrader-type valve, using a lip seal around the rod and forcing it to allow gas in by external overpressure or a shuttling O-ring system.

One is managing to be able to manufacture a pump with the fine tolerances necessary for efficient operation.

The pistons are usually less than half an inch (13 mm) in diameter with similar <b>stroke</b> <b>lengths.</b> Keeping the wall to piston seal tight means that very small clearances are involved and that materials have to be closely matched for similar coefficient of expansion.|$|R

It is done by applying different polishing <b>stroke</b> <b>lengths</b> with different sized and shaped tools. Manual figuring is a very laborious process, since the heat produced by polishing has to be allowed to dissipate before the shape of the mirror can be measured again, and the places for later polishing selected. Testing of the figure is usually done by a Foucault knife-edge test or Ronchi test in amateur telescope making and with very sophisticated null testers on research telescope optics.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} reduce unit {{production}} costs, the engines that actually went into production, called Speed Six, were TVR modified versions of the initial AJP-6 prototypes with 3.6 and 4.0 litre capacities. Prominent modifications were alterations to valve train geometry, a switch from a billet steel crank to cast iron (with a crank damper), different con-rods, oil filter relocation to the inlet side of the engine, and removal of the exhaust cam oil feed. The two different capacities were achieved through stroke alterations from a con-rod design able to accommodate two different <b>stroke</b> <b>lengths,</b> and different piston crown designs altering the compression ratios. The bores diameters were shared.Pistons were made in Italy by Asso Werke from pre-existing casts, initially designed for the Rotax-Aprilia RSV 1000 engine. Those casts, refused by Rotax, were modified and used to produce the smaller Speed Six pistons.|$|R
