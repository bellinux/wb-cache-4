From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and police and military reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got out of hand. Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated for work and against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police grew more frequent and bloody. The violent <b>social</b> <b>conflict</b> almost rose {{to the point of}} insurrection. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.|$|E
5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from {{as far back as the}} time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and <b>social</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{tensions}} {{between these two}} competing historical and cultural traditions erupted into political and <b>social</b> <b>conflict</b> during the Ukrainian crisis, which began when then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union on 21 November 2013. Support for closer ties with Europe was strong in western and central Ukraine, whilst many in eastern and southern Ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with Russia. President Yanukovych, who drew most of his support from eastern regions, was forced out of office in February 2014. His ouster was followed by protests in eastern and southern Ukraine that placed {{a strong emphasis on}} the importance of historical ties to Russia, the Russian language, and antipathy towards the Euromaidan movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{examines}} {{the nature of}} the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> and sustainable development. It focuses on the significance of the <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> that are associated with municipal solid waste on the sustainable development of the cities of Nairobi, Kenya and Johannesburg, South Africa. The principal assumption of the thesis is that, depending on the way <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> are conducted, conflicts can have constructive or destructive outcomes for society. Consequently, <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> can have negative or positive implications for the specific sector in dispute, primarily, and ultimately, for social, economic or environmental dimensions of development that under-gird the sustainable development of cities. The nature and direction of the association between <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> and sustainable cities in the context of municipal solid waste is, nevertheless, largely obscure. The thesis contends that an appreciation of the <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> in municipal solid waste is critical to unearthing the inherent but often invisible dimensions of society and development that impact municipal solid waste management. It is also critical to illuminating the manner in which municipal solid waste and its management, in turn, impact society and the sustainable development of cities. Such an understanding entails an identification of the <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> that are associated with municipal solid waste, establishment of their causes, conduct and impact on the sustainable management of municipal solid waste primarily and, overall, on the sustainable development of cities. By labelling specific outcomes of <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> such as the amicable resolution of issues in contention as resulting in constructive outcomes for municipal solid waste management or specific socio-economic and environmental dimensions of development and, alternatively, designating outcomes such as the violent and harmful conduct of conflict as destructive, it is possible to establish an association between <b>social</b> <b>conflicts,</b> municipal solid waste and sustainable cities. <b>Social</b> <b>conflicts</b> are thus indicators of problems and contradictions within the municipal sustainable development agenda and an indicator of the gaps that need remedy. The study utilises mixed methods research and comparative data from the cities of Nairobi and Johannesburg with survey data from the low-income neighbourhoods of Dandora and Alexandra, the high-income neighbourhoods of Muthaiga and Sandton, and various stakeholders in municipal solid waste management. It {{examines the}} municipal solid waste stream from the household and residential neighbourhood, through the process of collection, [...] D. Litt. et Phil. (Sociology...|$|R

5|$|Upon the {{rejection}} of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent <b>social</b> <b>conflict,</b> almost rising {{to the point of}} insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene, and Prime Minister Francesco Crispi {{declared a state of emergency}} in January 1894, dissolving the organizations, arresting its leaders and restoring order through the use of extreme force. Some reforms followed, including workmen's compensation and pension schemes. The suppression of the strikes also led to an increase in emigration.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for <b>social</b> <b>conflict</b> and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of economic opportunities {{has led to}} numerous conflicts between society and business in various geographies of the world.

One hundred and seven students of Early and Preschool Education in Rijeka (M= 23 years, 98 % female students) completed a questionnaire that integrated the Scale of Attitudes Towards Behavioural Styles in <b>Social</b> <b>Conflicts</b> (Vlah, 2013), Trauma Symptoms Checklist (Šimić, Sesar, & Barišić, 2012), Social Support Appraisals Scale (Kurtović, 2013), Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (Takšić, 2002), and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (1979). Descriptive, correlation and regression analyses were used to analyse the data. All three styles used in <b>social</b> <b>conflicts</b> were correlated to other research variables. Older students and those more competent in perceiving and understanding emotions and those with higher self-esteem with regard to oneself are significantly more oriented towards the cooperation style.
