The marriage with Agnes was celebrated on 4February 1583, and afterward Gebhard remained in possession of the see. This affair created a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder {{the distribution of the}} letter.|$|E

5|$|North of the Alps, Army Group G {{followed}} suit on 6 May. Kesselring now decided to surrender his own headquarters. He ordered Hausser {{to supervise the}} SS troops {{to ensure that the}} surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at Saalfelden, near Salzburg, in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, the commander of the 101st Airborne Division, who treated him courteously, allowing him to keep his weapons and field marshal's baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at Zeltweg and Graz unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and his staff to move into a hotel at Berchtesgaden. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring drinking tea together created a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the United States. Kesselring met with Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, and gave interviews to Allied newspaper reporters.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|Revolt {{began to}} <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke {{of the events}} in London. There had been long-running {{disagreements}} in St Albans between {{the town and the}} local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey. A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey. Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the abbey gaol, destroyed the fences marking out the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in the town square. They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the abbey spread out over the next few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s {{manufacturers}} such as Hummel and Adidas {{began to}} design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology {{led to the}} introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.|$|E

25|$|A local daily, The Star {{reported}} that a proposal by Kepong MP Dr Tan Seng Giaw to regulate the Azan {{so that it will}} not be too loud or disturb non-Muslims caused a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the Dewan Rakyat.

25|$|In 1826 he {{performed}} in Portici before Francesco I and the Bourbon court.

Toward the end of 1827 {{the health of the}} musician began to fail; he died in Naples on 8 May 1829. The news of his death created a great <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the Neapolitan musical environment.|$|E

25|$|Turner's {{leadership}} was frequently questioned, {{and in the}} lead up to the 1986 Liberal convention, {{a vote of confidence}} loomed large. The popular Chrétien resigned his seat, creating a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> caucus. The ongoing and often open unpopularity of Turner within his own party led to many editorial cartoonists drawing him with a back stabbed full of knives. Keith Davey and other Liberals began a public campaign against Turner, coinciding with backroom struggles involving Chrétien's supporters. The public conflict is said to have influenced many Liberals to support Turner, and he ended up getting 75% of the delegate vote.|$|E
25|$|In December 1997 Tele Danmark {{announced}} {{that from the}} beginning of 1998 they would start collecting a yearly fee (of 340 DKK excluding VAT) for every registered domain name via DK Hostmaster. This caused a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> FIL's members, as they had not been informed. While there had been talks about some sort of fee to DK Hostmaster to cover its expenses, no review of DK Hostmaster’s actual budget was available since it was financially all but a part of Tele Danmark. This was therefore seen by FIL as abuse of power and profit making via the supposedly non-profit DK Hostmaster organization.|$|E
25|$|Other {{minstrel}} troupes {{tried to}} satisfy outlying tastes. Female acts {{had made a}} <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> variety shows, and Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels ran with the idea, first performing in 1870 in skimpy costumes and tights. Their success gave rise to at least 11 all-female troupes by 1871, one of which did away with blackface altogether. Ultimately, the girlie show emerged as a form in its own right. Mainstream minstrelsy continued to emphasize its propriety, but traditional troupes adopted some of these elements {{in the guise of}} the female impersonator. A well-played wench character became critical to success in the postwar period.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Rosetta Stone, a tablet written in ancient Greek, Egyptian Demotic script, and Egyptian hieroglyphs, has partially been credited for the recent <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the study of Ancient Egypt. Greek, a well-known language, gave linguists the ability to decipher the mysterious Egyptian hieroglyphic language. The ability to decipher hieroglyphics facilitated the translation of hundreds of the texts and inscriptions that were previously indecipherable, giving insight into Egyptian culture that would have otherwise been lost to the ages. The stone was discovered on July 15, 1799 in the port town of Rosetta Rosetta, Egypt, and has been held in the British Museum since 1802.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{while still}} in Sacramento, the {{gigantic}} engine {{was used as an}} advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot dragging a long line of empty freight cars behind it and causing quite a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers could {{get a good look at}} the monster up close.|$|E
25|$|The {{communist}} regime established with Soviet assistance, arrested him on 14 July 1947, together {{with all the}} leadership of the National Peasants' Party, after some of the party leadership had allegedly tried to flee the country in a plane landed at Tămădău (see Tămădău Affair). He was imprisoned without trial for nine years, as all charges brought against him were dismissed due to lack of evidence. Coposu later attested that his imprisonment, imposed by Soviet officials overseeing the Securitate, was among those causing a <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the higher echelons of the Communist Party — Belu Zilber, a Communist who was purged together with Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu, later told him that prominent party politician Ana Pauker had unsuccessfully opposed the move in front of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.|$|E
