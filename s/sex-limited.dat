50|$|Epigenetics is the {{inheritance}} of additional marks to the genome without {{changes in its}} sequence. These factors epigenetic factors may also be <b>sex-limited.</b> Genomic imprinting for example, silencing of one parental allele by DNA methylation, for which <b>sex-limited</b> imprinting has been proposed to resolve intralocus conflict. Genomic imprinting {{has been shown to}} be indistinguishable from non-imprinted systems at the population level in some cases, having equivalent evolutionary models. However, this does not hold for <b>sex-limited</b> models of <b>sex-limited</b> imprinting which behave differently depending on which sex imprinting occurs and the parental sex of imprinted allele. Specifically, this affects whether alleles are imprinted in consecutive generations with different evolutionary trajectories (under the same selection fitnesses) arising purely due to <b>sex-limited</b> epigenetics. Thus <b>sex-limited</b> epigenetic traits may have played a pivotal role in the evolution of mammals and other species, particularly as a mechanism to ameliorate intralocus conflict between the sexes.|$|E
5000|$|Unsurprisingly, {{the idea}} of <b>sex-limited</b> genes was {{initially}} developed by Charles Darwin himself in 1871 in his book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. He does not distinguish between <b>sex-limited,</b> sex-linked, and sex-influenced genes, but refers to any gene that expresses differently between sexes as <b>sex-limited.</b> While this concept was still in its infancy, Darwin catalyzed the further development of sex-related selection. Thomas Hunt Morgan, fully aware of this confusing terminology, published an article in The American Naturalist in 1914 titled [...] "Sex-Linked and <b>Sex-Limited</b> Inheritance." [...] This article directly acknowledges that Darwin applied the term <b>sex-limited</b> whenever a characteristic seemed specific to one sex. Morgan proposes the definitions for sex-linked genes and <b>sex-limited</b> genes that we still use today (and that were defined in the introduction above). This paper helped to distinguish between these two similar concepts and clarify much confusion {{in the scientific community}} at the time. Morgan's paper was followed by several others involving <b>sex-limited</b> genes and their expression as traits. One of the more notable examples is John H. Gerould's [...] "Inheritance of White Wing Color, a <b>Sex-Limited</b> (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies," [...] published in Genetics in 1923 (and edited slightly in 1924). [...] Gerould observed that in this species of butterfly, females naturally occur as yellow or white, while males only occur with yellow coloration. He extensively explores this apparently <b>sex-limited</b> trait from a genetic perspective in this ground-breaking 50 page paper. To conclude the notable advancements {{in the early stages of}} the development of <b>sex-limited</b> genes, a brief discussion of R. A. Fisher is necessary. Commonly hailed as one of the best evolutionary biologists of his time, Fisher was also a talented geneticist. His book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, published in 1930, over 20 years before the double-helix shape of DNA was discovered, was the first attempt to explain Darwin's theories within the foundation of genetics. [...] Chapter 6 of this book is titled [...] "Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection" [...] and includes a genetic interpretation of Darwin's initial idea of <b>sex-limited</b> genes. After these groundbreaking works, papers continue to be published further exploring the causes, mechanisms, evolutionary advantages, and more of <b>sex-limited</b> genes.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>sex-limited</b> {{genes are}} present in both sexes but only {{expressed}} in one, this allows the unexpressed genes to be hidden from selection. On a short-term scale, this means that during one generation, only the sex that expresses the <b>sex-limited</b> trait(s) of interest {{will be affected by}} selection. The remaining half of the gene pool for these traits will be unaffected by selection because they are hidden (unexpressed) in the genes of the other sex. Since a portion of the alleles for these <b>sex-limited</b> traits are hidden from selection, this occurrence has been termed 'storage-effect'. On a long-term scale, this storage effect can have significant effects on selection, especially if selection is fluctuating {{over a long period of}} time. It is inarguable that selection will fluctuate over time with varying levels of environmental stability. For example, fluctuations in population density can drive selection on <b>sex-limited</b> traits. In less dense populations, females will have less opportunity to choose between males for reproduction. In this case, attractive males may experience both reduced reproductive success and increased predation pressure. Thus, selection on males for <b>sex-limited</b> traits such as increased size (elephant seals) and weaponry (claws on fiddler crabs, horns on rhinoceros beetles) will change direction with fluctuation in population density.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Hosken et al. {{completed}} an important study exploring {{the effects of}} sexually antagonistic selection on <b>sex-limited</b> trait expression. [...] They asked if sex-specific trait selection always resolved intralocus conflict, as it was believed to do. By using a species of flour beetle, Gnatocerus cornutus, exhibiting <b>sex-limited</b> traits {{in the form of}} exaggerated mandible size, they were able to test this hypothesis. Exaggerated mandibles are only developed in males; females never develop exaggerated mandibles. The point of this experiment was to determine how mandibles affect fitness. If these <b>sex-limited</b> genes are truly quelling intralocus sexual conflict, male mandible size should have no effect on female fitness. After selecting for males with exaggerated mandibles (full materials and methods can be found within the paper), it was experimentally determined that males with exaggerated mandibles had a higher fitness - they experienced increased fighting and mating success. It was also found, however, that females found in the populations of males with exaggerated mandibles had lower fitness (as determined by lifetime reproductive success, LRS) relative to the fitness of females in populations with males with smaller mandibles. Since this male <b>sex-limited</b> trait affects female fitness, intralocus sexual conflict has not been resolved. This highlights the importance of sexual conflict to evolution, because it cannot simply be defused by <b>sex-limited</b> trait expression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sex-limited</b> {{genes are}} genes that {{are present in}} both sexes of sexually {{reproducing}} species but are expressed in only one sex and remain 'turned off' in the other. In other words, <b>sex-limited</b> genes cause the two sexes to show different traits or phenotypes, despite having the same genotype. This term is restricted to autosomal traits, {{and should not be}} confused with sex-linked characteristics, which have to do with genetic differences on the sex chromosomes (see sex-determination system). <b>Sex-limited</b> genes are also distinguished from sex-influenced genes, where the same gene will show differential expression in each sex. Sex-influenced genes commonly show a dominant/recessive relationship, where the same gene will have a dominant effect in one sex and a recessive effect in the other (for example, male pattern baldness).|$|E
50|$|Overall, <b>sex-limited</b> genes {{carry with}} them several complex cost to benefit ratios which call for further analysis. For example, while they allow for greater {{opportunities}} of sexual dimorphism so both sexes can reach much closer to their optimal phenotypes, they also incur fitness costs on sexually reproducing species. Since Charles Darwin's revolutionary book was published in 1871, {{there have been many}} studies done on the nature of these genes. The scientific literature dealing with the concepts of sexual dimorphism and <b>sex-limited</b> genes extends far past what has been listed here. The genetic and mechanistic details of these genes are still being discovered through ongoing research today. It is becoming apparent that a deeper understanding <b>sex-limited</b> genes will be increasingly important as the fields of evolutionary biology and genetics advance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sex-limited</b> {{genes are}} {{responsible}} for sexual dimorphism, which is a phenotypic (directly observable) difference {{between males and females}} of the same species. These differences can be reflected in size, color, behavior (ex: levels of aggression), and morphology. An example of <b>sex-limited</b> genes are genes which instruct the male elephant seals to grow big and fight, at the same time instructing female seals to grow small and avoid fights. [...] These genes are also responsible for some female beetles' inability to grow exaggerated mandibles, research that is discussed in detail later in this article.|$|E
50|$|Breeding time in red-billed gulls is {{expressed}} only in females, because only females lay eggs. Male care, however, affects female breeding performance substantially. This qualifies breeding {{time as a}} <b>sex-limited</b> trait because it {{is expressed}} only in one sex but can be affected by both (similarly to Hosken's beetle experiment above). By following a natural population of red-billed gulls for 46 years, Teplitsky et al. came to an unexpected conclusion - while laying date (aka breeding time) is only expressed in females, the trait is only heritable in males. This is atypical because <b>sex-limited</b> traits are almost always heritable within the sex {{in which they are}} expressed.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{purposes}} {{apart from}} the commercial are researched in advanced countries to breed development for specific purposes like sericin production, <b>sex-limited</b> breeds, and thin/thick filament production. Disease-resistance breeding is important, as the major reason for crop losses is pathogen infection. Efforts are being made to select breeds which are tolerant or resistant to various pathogens.|$|E
50|$|The Appalachian tiger {{swallowtail}} has {{similarities to}} both parent species; it resembles P. canadensis {{as it is}} adapted to a cooler temperature and has only one brood per year (univoltine), but also resembles P. glaucus as it displays <b>sex-limited</b> polymorphism with the dark female morph displaying mimicry. However, {{research has shown that}} P. appalachiensis may be more closely related genetically to P. canadensis than to P. glaucus.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} within insects is also {{displayed by}} dichromatism. In butterfly genera Bicyclus and Junonia, dimorphic wing patterns evolved due to <b>sex-limited</b> expression, which mediates the intralocus sexual conflict {{and leads to}} increased fitness in males. The sexual dichromatic nature of Bicyclus anyana is reflected by female selection {{on the basis of}} dorsal UV-reflective eyespot pupils (Robertson & Monteiro, 2005). Naturally selected deviation in protective female coloration is displayed in mimetic butterflies.|$|E
5000|$|John Parsch and Hans Ellegren defined [...] "genes {{that differ}} in {{expression}} between females and males" [...] as sex-biased genes. While this definition is more broad, <b>sex-limited</b> genes are certainly {{included in this}} category. One of the key principles of sex-biased gene expression that Parsch and Ellegren stressed in their paper in February 2013 is that of rapid evolution. They assert that a gene's sex bias can vary among different types of tissues throughout the body or throughout development, making the level of sex bias a fluid, rather than static, property. This makes it possible, then, that the rapid evolution seen in sex-biased genes is not an inherent property of their sex bias, but a property of some other feature. The paper offers expression breadth, the number of tissue types in which the genes are expressed, {{as an example of}} a feature correlated to sex-biased genes. It is known that genes with limited expression (in only one type of tissue) generally evolve faster than those with a higher expression breadth, and sex-biased genes are often restricted in their expression, such as to only the testes or ovaries. Thus, it is likely that sex-biased (including <b>sex-limited)</b> genes will evolve faster than the average genetic information. Parsch and Ellegren also assert that [...] "sex-biased genes expressed only in <b>sex-limited</b> reproductive tissues evolve faster than unbiased genes that are expressed only in a single, non-reproductive tissue." [...] That is, genes that have a bias toward any kind of reproductive tissue (testes or ovaries) seem to show faster evolution than genes expressed in non-gonadal tissues, despite the number of tissues in which they are expressed. This makes sense in the context of genes with reproductive function evolving more quickly, a generally observed pattern in evolutionary biology.|$|E
50|$|Later {{the same}} year, {{a paper in}} Evolution also came to the same {{conclusions}} about sexual antagonism in relation to <b>sex-limited</b> genes. They developed a mathematical model {{to show that the}} fitness costs of sexual antagonism, even when rare, will usually overwhelm the benefits of sexually concordant selection. (Sexually concordant selection occurs when selection favors the same alleles in both sexes but differs in relative strength between them.) Through several advanced calculations, they concluded that even a small relative amount of sexual antagonism will overwhelm any benefit harvested from sexually concordant selection. Coming to the same conclusion as Hosken et al., they demonstrated mathematically that when <b>sex-limited</b> gene expression attempts to resolve sexual antagonism, it is likely to produce negative long-term fitness consequences. This result is seen in the experiment with beetles above, where the females demonstrate reduced fitness in response to males selected for larger mandibles. So, with mathematical support and a lack of support for strong fitness benefits as a result of sexually concordant selection, the paper concludes that sex-specific selection is more likely to incur costs than benefits to sexually reproducing species.|$|E
5000|$|The overall {{point of}} <b>sex-limited</b> genes is to resolve intralocus sexual conflict. In other words, these genes {{try to resolve}} the [...] "push-pull" [...] {{between males and females}} over trait values for optimal phenotype. Without these genes, organisms would be forced to settle on an average trait value, {{incurring}} costs on both sexes. With these genes, it is possible to 'turn off' the genes in one sex, allowing both sexes to attain (or at least, approach very closely) their optimal phenotypes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{published}} exploring the genetic basis of <b>sex-limited</b> genes. One paper, published in Evolution, evaluates the hypothesis that <b>sex-limited</b> traits can arise in two ways. The alleles responsible for sexual dimorphism can be limited to expression in only one sex when they first appear, or the alleles could begin by being expressed in both sexes then become modified (repressed or promoted) in one sex by modifier genes or regulatory elements. The concept {{of this study was}} to examine female hybrids from species where males displayed different types of ornamental traits (elongated feathers, wattles, color patches). The assumption is that different hypotheses about male-specific expression will yield different results in female hybrids. The methods and materials of the experiment are discussed in detail in the paper, but the important result that emerged was that NO female hybrids expressed any of the ornamental traits found in the parent males. Two interpretations of these results are possible: the dimorphic alleles were initially only expressed in males, or the alleles were initially expressed in both and then were suppressed in females or became limited to males by regulatory regions that are completely dominant in hybrids. The most likely genomic explanation for initial expression in both species then modification is involvement of cis-dominance, where the factors that modify the gene are located next to the gene on the chromosome. (This is in contrast to trans-dominance, where mobile products that can affect distant genes are produced.) These factors can be in the form of promoter regions, which can be either be suppressed or activated by hormones. This experiment also demonstrates that these alleles come under regulatory control very quickly. This is because none of the ornamentation seen in males is seen in the very next generation. These conclusions make it likely that at least some male-specific (thus, <b>sex-limited)</b> genes cue their expression by hormone levels - the absence of estrogen or the presence of testosterone.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{behavior}} (see ethology) encompasses so many disciplines that it {{is impossible}} not to see it in some capacity in almost all primary literature involving live animals. While the examples above certainly contain aspects of animal behavior, a more overt example of it in relation to <b>sex-limited</b> traits is detailed in a Teplitsky et al. paper (2010) centering on breeding time in red-billed gulls. This experiment deals with breeding time, an aspect of reproductive biology. Reproduction and sexual behavior are two key aspects of animal behavior, as they are universally expressed in some way throughout the animal kingdom.|$|E
50|$|On {{the island}} of Maui, the happy types seem to follow simple Mendelian {{inheritance}} rules, while on other Hawaiian islands the body inheritance patterns seem to be <b>sex-limited.</b> The variation is possibly a kind of camouflage against birds, their only natural enemies of significance, to counteract pattern recognition by predators. As the background color may change according to what food the spider has eaten and as T. grallator is small, hides during the day, {{and is not a}} significant prey item for any species of predator, {{it is possible that the}} large variety of patterns serves no significant adaptive purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Ruffs {{can also}} show sexual mimicry through a {{combination}} of genetics and hormones. In a population of ruffs, Philomachus pugnax, there are three types of male morphs: independent males and satellite males, both of which are reproductive competitors, and faeder ruffs that resemble females in their plumage. The first two morphs are controlled by a dominant allele at a single autosomal locus, while the third morph is likely to have come from a combination of a third allele and a lack of testosterone. [...] When testosterone is administered to reeves (female ruffs), male courtship behaviour and male feather colouration are expressed in the reeves. Testosterone, in this case, expresses <b>sex-limited</b> characteristics by acting on the single autosomal gene. Similarly, while it has not yet been tested, {{it is likely that the}} lack of testosterone is the cause for the faeder ruffs’ similarity to females.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} the {{breeding}} of both plants and animals, but is most commercially important in animal breeding to determine the true breeding value of an animal esp. males which are used extensively for propagation of best germplasm. The extensive use of artificial insemination in domestic animals has helped in increasing the selection intensity on the male animals. This selection tool is usually used for characters that are <b>sex-limited,</b> expressed after death(meat characteristics) and usually with low heritability, for example milk or egg production in females. A bull for example cannot be assessed for milk production, however the performance of its female offsprings can be used to determine the use of the animal for future crosses. A progeny test is performed by mating the male with a number of females to produce many progenies in different environment and over a long time period involving different seasons to nullify the impact of season, management, environment in breeding value estimation. The average performance of the offspring is then found, giving a measure of the male's respective value to the breeder.|$|E
5000|$|Chromosomes were {{likened to}} books (above), also like books {{they have been}} studied at more {{detailed}} levels. They contain [...] "sentences" [...] called genes. In fact, many of these sentences are common to multiple species. Sometimes they are organized in the same order, other times they have been [...] "edited"—deleted, copied, changed, moved, even relocated to another [...] "book", as species evolve. Genes are a particularly important part of understanding biological processes because they are directly associated with observable objects, outside chromosomes, called proteins, whose influence on cell chemistry can be measured. In some cases genes can also be directly associated with differences clear to the naked eye, like eye-color itself. Some of these differences are sex specific, like hairy ears.

50|$|On March, 1933, an {{operation}} {{was performed on}} a day-old male Ayrshire calf.

The frontal periosteum it was expected that the two horns would fuse together into one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located above and between the eyes. The experiment was successful, at the age of two years the two buds have formed together into one large horn molded into the forehead for support. What makes this unicorn different from the other ones is all in the horn, unlike the other unicorns the horn spike grew from the skull instead of upon. A single united sheath covers the horn spike, the horn curves slightly upward toward the tip and gracefully extends the curve of the back and neck when the animal stands at attention. Like that of a mythical unicorn described by Ctesias and Fresnel, the horn sheath is white or grayish-white at the base and is tipped with black. (Had the unicorn been a female, the horn would be tipped with red, since the color appears as a <b>sex-limited</b> factor in this particular breed. This Ayrshire bull, whose Scottish ancestors flourished under King James VI, who, as James I of England put the unicorn on England's coat of arms, is a true unicorn. Although it is an animal with the hereditary potentiality for two horns, he recognizes the power of a single horn which he uses as a prow to pass under fences and barriers in his path.|$|E

40|$|Genes {{that are}} {{differentially}} expressed {{between the sexes}} (sex-biased genes) are among the fastest evolving genes in animal genomes. The majority of sex-biased expression is attributable to genes that are primarily expressed in <b>sex-limited</b> reproductive tissues, and these reproductive genes are often rapidly evolving because of intra- and intersexual selection pressures. Additionally, studies of multiple taxa have revealed that genes with sex-biased expression are also expressed in {{a limited number of}} tissues. This is worth noting because narrowly expressed genes are known to evolve faster than broadly expressed genes. Therefore, {{it is not clear whether}} sex-biased genes are rapidly evolving because they have sexually dimorphic expression, because they are expressed in <b>sex-limited</b> reproductive tissues, or because they are narrowly expressed. To determine the extend to which other confounding variables can explain the rapid evolution of sex-biased genes, I analyzed the rates of evolution of sex-biased genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus in light of tissue-specific measures of expression. I find that genes with sex-biased expression in somatic tissues shared by both sexes are often evolving faster than non–sex-biased genes, but this is best explained by the narrow expression profiles of sex-biased genes. Sex-biased genes in <b>sex-limited</b> tissues in D. melanogaster, however, evolve faster than other narrowly expressed genes. Therefore, the rapid evolution of sex-biased genes is limited only to those genes primarily expressed in <b>sex-limited</b> reproductive tissues...|$|E
40|$|Inbreeding is {{reputed to}} distort sex-ratios by {{reducing}} {{the proportion of the}} homogametic sex. However, many data sets do not show such an effect, and there is a known selective publication bias. To resolve the issue, we (a) developed detailed theoretical expectations for the effects of inbreeding on sex-ratios for autosomal and sex-linked loci with <b>sex-limited</b> effects or with equal effects in the two sexes, (b) evaluated the effects of inbreeding on sex-ratios in a new sample of 25 vertebrate taxa, and (c) evaluated the effects of inbreeding on sex-ratios for 69 replicate populations of "Drosophila melanogaster". Theoretical analyses indicated that directional distortions of sex-ratios under inbreeding due to sex-linked loci with <b>sex-limited</b> expression are expected to be small and uncommon and {{that there will be no}} distortions in marsupials. Further, sex linked alleles expressed equally in both sexes may also distort sex-ratios following inbreeding. Autosomal <b>sex-limited</b> alleles should not result in directional sex-ratio distortions in large populations or across many replicates, but may lead to distortions of random direction in some small populations. There were no significant directional distortions of sex-ratio due to inbreeding in either the vertebrates or the "Drosophila" populations. However, there were significant random distortions of sex-ratios in both data sets, presumably from autosomal <b>sex-limited</b> alleles that had drifted in individual populations. Thus, directional distortions in sex-ratio are not a consistent signal of inbreeding depression. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Phosphoglucomutase was {{studied by}} {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis in the Thailand and Hawaii isolates of Parastrongylus cantonensis (also known as Angiostrongylus cantonensis). Two loci were present. The faster-moving locus (PGM- 1) was polymorphic in the Hawaii isolate, represented by two alleles – the faster-moving, less common Pgm- 1 A and the slower-moving, more common Pgm- 1 B. It was monomorphic for the faster-moving allele Pgm- 1 A in the Thailand isolate. The slower-moving locus (PGM- 2) was invariant, with a single band of enzyme activity, in the female worms of both the Thailand and Hawaii isolates. There was no detectable enzyme activity at this PGM- 2 locus in the male worms of both isolates. The non-expression or ‘null ’ PGM- 2 phenotype in the male worms was presumed to be <b>sex-limited.</b> The present findings differ significantly in several aspects (polymorphic locus, proportion of polymorphic loci, heterozygosity, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations, <b>sex-limited</b> expression) from the Japan isolate of P. cantonensis reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Many colour polymorphisms {{are present}} only in one sex, usually males, but {{proximate}} mechanisms controlling {{the expression of}} <b>sex-limited</b> colour polymorphisms have received little attention. Here, we test the hypothesis that artificial elevation of testosterone in females of the colour polymorphic tawny dragon lizard, Ctenophorus decresii, can induce them to express the same colour morphs, in similar frequencies, {{to those found in}} males. Male C. decresii, express four discrete throat colour morphs (orange, yellow, grey and an orange central patch surrounded by yellow). We used silastic implants to experimentally elevate testosterone levels in mature females to induce colour expression. Testosterone elevation resulted in a substantial increase in the proportion and intensity of orange but not yellow colouration, which was present in a subset of females prior to treatment. Consequently, females exhibited the same set of colour morphs as males, and we confirmed that these morphs are objectively classifiable, by using digital image analyses and spectral reflectance measurements, and occur in similar frequencies as in males. These results indicate that the influence of testosterone differs for different colours, suggesting that their expression may be governed by different proximate hormonal mechanisms. Thus, caution must be exercised when using artificial testosterone manipulation to induce female expression of <b>sex-limited</b> colour polymorphisms. Nevertheless, the ability to express <b>sex-limited</b> colours (in this case orange) to reveal the same, objectively classifiable morphs in similar frequencies to males suggests autosomal rather than sex-linked inheritance, and can facilitate further research on the genetic basis of colour polymorphism, including estimating heritability and selection on colour morphs from pedigree data...|$|E

40|$|Background: Intralocus sexual conflict, {{arising from}} {{selection}} for different alleles {{at the same}} locus in males and females, imposes a constraint on sex-specific adaptation. Intralocus sexual conflict can be alleviated by the evolution of <b>sex-limited</b> genetic architectures and phenotypic expression, but pleiotropic constraints may hinder this process. Here, we explored putative intralocus sexual conflict and genetic (co) variance in a poorly understood behavior with near male-limited expression. Same-sex sexual behaviors (SSBs) generally {{do not conform to}} classic evolutionary models of adaptation but are common in male animals and have been hypothesized to result from perception errors and selection for high male mating rates. However, perspectives incorporating sex-specific selection on genes shared by males and females to explain the expression and evolution of SSBs have largely been neglected. Results: We performed two parallel <b>sex-limited</b> artificial selection experiments on SSB in male and female seed beetles, followed by sex-specific assays of locomotor activity and male sex recognition (two traits hypothesized to be functionally related to SSB) and adult reproductive success (allowing us to assess fitness consequences of genetic variance in SSB and its correlated components). Our experiments reveal both shared and <b>sex-limited</b> genetic variance for SSB. Strikingly, genetically correlated responses in locomotor activity and male sex-recognition were associated with sexually antagonistic fitness effects, but these effects differed qualitatively between male and female selection lines, implicating intralocus sexual conflict at both male-and female-specific genetic components underlying SSB. Conclusions: Our study provides experimental support for the hypothesis that widespread pleiotropy generates pervasive intralocus sexual conflict governing the expression of SSBs, suggesting that SSB in one sex can occur due to the expression of genes that carry benefits in the other sex...|$|E
40|$|Genes {{involved}} in pathways regulating body weight may operate differently {{in men and}} women. To determine whether <b>sex-limited</b> genes influence the obesity-related phenotype body mass index (BMI), we have conducted a general non-scalar <b>sex-limited</b> genome-wide linkage scan using variance components analysis in Mx (Neale, 2002). BMI measurements and genotypic data were available for 2053 Australian female and male adult twins and their siblings from 933 families. Clinical measures of BMI were available for 64. 4 % of these individuals, while only self-reported measures were available for the remaining participants. The mean age of participants was 39. 0 years of age (SD 12. 1 years). The use of a <b>sex-limited</b> linkage model identified areas on the genome where quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects differ between the sexes, particularly on chromosome 8 and 20, providing us with evidence {{that some of the}} genes responsible for BMI may have different effects in men and women. Our highest linkage peak was observed at 12 q 24 (-logp = 3. 02), which was near the recommended threshold for suggestive linkage (-logp = 3. 13). Previous studies have found evidence for a quantitative trait locus on 12 q 24 affecting BMI {{in a wide range of}} populations, and candidate genes for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a consequence of obesity, have also been mapped to this region. We also identified many peaks near a -log p of 2 (threshold for replicating an existing finding) in many areas across the genome that are within regions previously identified by other studies, as well as in locations that harbor genes known to influence weight regulation...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a mutation, gag- 1, that affects in a temperature-dependent manner {{a specific type}} of O-glycosylation in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In the mutant, all the major glycoproteins, in particular cell wall proteins, show a decreased apparent molecular weight in polyacrylamide gels, and their antigenicity is affected. The mutant forms multicellular aggregates (palmelloid colonies) at the restrictive temperature due to the delayed release of the daughter cells from the mother cell wall after mitosis. In addition, the mutation causes sterility by preventing sexual agglutination. In contrast to the other phenotypes, the sterility phenotype is temperature independent, and it is expressed only by cells of the plus mating type. We show that imp- 8, a previously described nonagglutinating <b>sex-limited</b> mutation, causes the same glycosylation defect and is allelic to gag- 1. Thus, expression of mt+ agglutinability appears to require the specific type of O-glycosylation that is defective in these mutants. More generally, these observations show that a <b>sex-limited</b> phenotype can be caused by a mutation in a gene that is not itself sex limited in its expression...|$|E
40|$|In silkworms, <b>sex-limited</b> strains {{are either}} {{obtained}} spontaneously or induced by X-rays or gamma rays. When {{a fragment of}} an autosome carrying a dominant allele of those genes responsible for certain characters is translocated onto a W chromosome, the female of the successive generations will express these phenotypic characters and sex discrimination can be facilitated. Gensei-kouken strains are <b>sex-limited</b> strains of silkworms developed by irradiating the pupae with gamma rays, by which {{a portion of the}} second chromosome is translocated onto the W chromosome. In these improved strains, the females are yellow-blooded and spin yellow cocoons. By using the EST-cDNA clones mapped on the Z chromosome, we identified the sex according to the polymorphic banding pattern or intensity of the signals. Furthermore, by using the clones on the second chromosome, the region of the second chromosome translocated onto the W chromosome was also defined. In both the A 95 and A 96 strains selected for the present study, only the mid-portion of the second chromosome was translocated. The differences in length of the fragments translocated in these strains are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{family is}} {{reported}} in which infertility affected three men related through their mothers. The propositus, from testicular tissue was obtained, exhibited desynapsis, lack of chiasmata, and degeneration of spermatocytes {{during the first}} meiotic division. These observations lead us to postulate that a gene for meiotic disturbance, spermatogenic arrest, and azoospermia is segregating in this family; its mode of inheritance conforms to either an X-linked recessive or a <b>sex-limited</b> autosomal dominant transmission...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{benefit to}} sexual selection {{is that it}} promotes purging of deleterious mutations from populations. For this benefit to be realized, sexual selection, which is usually stronger on males, must purge mutations deleterious to both sexes. Here, we experimentally test the hypothesis that sexual selection on males purges deleterious mutations that affect {{both male and female}} fitness. We measured male and female fitness in two panels of spontaneous mutation-accumulation lines of the fly, Drosophila serrata, each established from a common ancestor. One panel of mutation accumulation lines limited both natural and sexual selection (LS lines), whereas the other panel limited natural selection, but allowed sexual selection to operate (SS lines). Although mutation accumulation caused a significant reduction in male and female fitness in both the LS and SS lines, sexual selection had no detectable effect on the extent of the fitness reduction. Similarly, despite evidence of mutational variance for fitness in males and females of both treatments, sexual selection had no significant impact on the amount of mutational genetic variance for fitness. However, sexual selection did reshape the between-sex correlation for fitness: significantly strengthening it in the SS lines. After 25 generations, the between-sex correlation for fitness was positive but considerably less than one in the LS lines, suggesting that, although most mutations had sexually concordant fitness effects, <b>sex-limited,</b> and/or sex-biased mutations contributed substantially to the mutational variance. In the SS lines this correlation was strong and could not be distinguished from unity. Individual-based simulations that mimick the experimental setup reveal two conditions that may drive our results: (1) a modest-to-large fraction of mutations have <b>sex-limited</b> (or highly sex-biased) fitness effects, and (2) the average fitness effect of <b>sex-limited</b> mutations is larger than the average fitness effect of mutations that affect both sexes similarly...|$|E
