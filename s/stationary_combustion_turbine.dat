40|$|SUMMARY: This action proposes {{national}} {{emission standards}} for {{hazardous air pollutants}} (NESHAP) for <b>stationary</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines.</b> We have identified <b>stationary</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> as major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions such as formaldehyde, toluene, benzene, and acetaldehyde. The proposed NESHAP would implement section 112 (d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) by requiring all major sources to meet HAP emission standards reflecting {{the application of the}} maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines.</b> We estimate that 20 percent of the <b>stationary</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> affected by the proposed rule will be located at major sources. As a result, the environmental, energy, and economic impacts presented in this preamble reflect these estimates. The proposed standards would protect public health by reducing exposure to air pollution, by reducing total national HAP emissions by an estimated 81 tons/year in the 5 th year after the standards are promulgated. This action also proposes to add Method 323 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A for the measurement of formaldehyde emissions from natural gas-fired stationary sources. DATES: Comments. Submit comments on or before February 13, 2003. Public Hearing. If anyone contacts us requesting to speak at a public hearing by January 24, 2003, we will hold a public hearing on January 29, 2003.

40|$|Low {{capital cost}} and ample {{low-cost}} natural gas supplies will make natural gas-fired <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> systems the power generation technology of choice {{over the next}} decade. Against the background of earlier use by electric utilities, this paper examines the status, economic outlook, and future directions of <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> technology for industrial and utility power generation. The discussion {{takes into account the}} ongoing deregulation and increasing competition that are shaping the electric power generation business. Included is a comparison between heavy-duty industrial <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> and their rapidly evolving competition, aeroderivative machines, with emphasis on the appropriate application of each. The prospects for future improvements in the cost and performance of <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> are reviewed, and the likely impact of advanced <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> power generation concepts is considered. Also summarized is the outlook for power generation fuels, including the longer term reemergence of coal and the potential for widespread use of coal gasification-based <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> systems. The paper draws heavily from a technical, economic, and business analysis, <b>Combustion</b> <b>Turbine</b> Power Systems, recently completed by SFA Pacific. The analysis was sponsored by an international group of energy companies that includes utilities, independent power producers (IPPs), and power industry equipment vendors...|$|R

40|$|Power {{generation}} from <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> projects {{continues to}} grow throughout the world. With natural gas as the most common primary fuel, and low-sulfur # 2 oil as the backup fuel, <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> are among the cleanest forms of fossil power generation. The combination of clean fuels and high thermal efficiency results in low emissions per megawatt of electrical power generated by these units. Yet, low emissions and high efficiency does not allow these units to escape the scrutiny of environmental regulators. The Legislative and Regulatory Affairs committee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), International Gas Turbine Institute (IGTI), has followed the developments in the <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> industry and the regulatory community. The advent of the Industrial Combustion Coordinated Rulemaking (ICCR) program and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) guidelines for combustion sources can {{have a significant impact}} on <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> projects. Health risk assessments from air toxic emissions are one of the major issues requiring evaluation. This paper discusses the results of a preliminary inhalation health risk assessment of air toxic emissions from four power plant configurations (nominal ratings) : (1) a 184 MW simple cycle <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine,</b> (2) a 184 MW <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> operating in a combined-cycle mode, (3) a 40 MW simple cycle <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine,</b> and (4) a 40 MW <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> operating in a combined-cycle mode. Evaluations were performed for both natural gas and # 2 oil fuels. Emissions were modeled for five (5) years to evaluate increased cancer risk, and both acute and chronic non-cancer health risks associated with these projects. The results of this study demonstrate that health risks from <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines</b> firing either natural gas or # 2 oil are within acceptable limits...|$|R

40|$|The {{motivation}} for the work comes from the requirement to assess the feasibility of using alternative fuels in lean-premixed land-based <b>stationary</b> gas <b>turbine</b> <b>combustion</b> systems. Lean-premixed systems are prone to combustion instability issues and the need is {{to determine how the}} use of alternative fuels would affect such instabilities. The paper presents the results of an acoustically-forced laminar flat flame study that was conducted to measure the influence of flow velocity oscillations on the response of syngas flames under various operating conditions and in comparison to natural gas flames. The results indicate that syngas concentration in a methane-syngas-air mixture significantly affects the flame response. On the other hand, the ratio of hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide in the syngas was found to have a negligible effect on the flame response for a fuel blend made up of 50 % methane and 50 % syngas. Flame liftoff distance and flame speed were found to be important parameters that govern the flame transfer function magnitude and resonant frequency for a thermally stabilized flat flame. The paper also presents insights into flame transfer function scaling based on a refined Strouhal definition. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

50|$|A coal-fueled MHD {{generator}} {{is a type}} of Brayton power cycle, {{similar to}} the power cycle of a <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine.</b> However, unlike the <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine,</b> there are no moving mechanical parts; the electrically conducting plasma provides the moving electrical conductor. The side walls and electrodes merely withstand the pressure within, while the anode and cathode conductors collect the electricity that is generated. All Brayton cycles are heat engines. Ideal Brayton cycles also have an ideal efficiency equal to ideal Carnot cycle efficiency. Thus, the potential for high energy efficiency from an MHD generator. All Brayton cycles have higher potential for efficiency the higher the firing temperature. While a <b>combustion</b> <b>turbine</b> is limited in maximum temperature by the strength of its air/water or steam-cooled rotating airfoils; there are no rotating parts in an open-cycle MHD generator. This upper bound in temperature limits the energy efficiency in <b>combustion</b> <b>turbines.</b> The upper bound on Brayton cycle temperature for an MHD generator is not limited, so inherently an MHD generator has a higher potential capability for energy efficiency.|$|R
