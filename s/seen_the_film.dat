The film involves one character impersonating another and Clarke suggested attempting the same trick in real life. He proposed an operation to mislead German commanders as to Montgomery's location in the days immediately before the Normandy landings (codenamed Operation Neptune).|$|E
5|$|Opening in late April 2009 was a film Downey {{finished}} in mid-2008, The Soloist. The film was pushed {{out from a}} November 2008 release by Paramount Pictures due to the studio's tight end-of-year release schedule. Critics who had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate.

Director Martin Koolhoven said, when Schnitzel Paradise (2005) received the award, {{that he did not}} expect his film to be such a success. Schnitzel Paradise was his first commercially successful film.

25|$|Most adventures {{were based}} on {{specific}} James Bond movies, with a few vital plot details changed, so players who had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> would still be surprised by the adventure. A few were written as sequels to earlier adventures based on specific movies.|$|E
25|$|According to {{producer}} Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against The Deer Hunter {{was led by}} Warren Beatty, {{whose own}} picture Heaven Can Wait had multiple nominations. Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: Julie Christie, serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where Deer Hunter was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized The Deer Hunter in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The Deer Hunter for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted {{a friend of his}} in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The Deer Hunter. Fonda replied she had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> and to this day she still has not.|$|E
25|$|Pacino {{was injured}} during rehearsals for a gunfight after {{he grabbed the}} barrel of a prop gun which had just been used to fire several dummy bullets. His hand stuck to the hot barrel and he was unable to remove it immediately; the injury sidelined him for two weeks. The gunfight scene also {{includes}} a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that he loved the film.|$|E

The screening was attended by McCartney, actors Victor Spinetti, John Junkin, David Janson and many crew members. In media interviews at the event, McCartney disclosed that while he had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> many times on video, he had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> on the [...] "big screen" [...] since its 1964 premiere.|$|E

500|$|Artist Brian Bolland's {{version of}} the Joker stemmed in part from his having {{recently}} <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> The Man Who Laughs. Giordano's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker. He recounted, [...] "I thought about {{it in terms of}} who's my favorite writer at the moment, what hero I would really love to do, and which villain? I basically came up with Alan, Batman and the Joker." ...|$|E

500|$|The exaggerated {{nature of}} the plot and space station {{sequence}} has <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> parodied on numerous occasions. Of note is the Austin Powers spoof film [...] (1999) which whilst a parody of other James Bond films, pays reference to Moonraker by Dr. Evil's lair in space. The scene in which Drax is shot by the cyanide dart and ousted into space is parodied by Powers' ejection of Dr. Evil's clone Mini-Me into outer space in the same way.|$|E
500|$|Many World War II {{veterans}} {{stated that}} the film was the most realistic depiction of combat they had ever <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>film</b> was so realistic that combat veterans of D-Day and Vietnam left theaters rather than finish watching the opening scene depicting the Normandy invasion. Their visits to posttraumatic stress disorder counselors rose in number after the film's release, and many counselors advised [...] "'more psychologically vulnerable'" [...] veterans to avoid watching it. The Department of Veterans Affairs set up a nationwide hotline for veterans who were affected by the film, and {{less than two weeks}} after the film was released it had already received over 170 calls.|$|E
500|$|Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk spoke less enthusiastically {{about the}} film, but {{felt that it}} was a good Spaghetti Western nonetheless. Although praising the locations, as well as the {{performances}} of Kinski and Trintignant, Morricone's score, the realistic approach to the story and Silvano Ippoliti's cinematography, he felt that the characterizations were lacking, adding that Corbucci's direction often [...] "drifts and falters" [...] and lacks the [...] "operatic grandeur" [...] of Leone's films. Erickson also expressed that the film's ending was unsurprising given the nihilistic nature of the rest of the film, but noted that he would have been more shocked by it had he <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> upon its 1968 theatrical release.|$|E

500|$|Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon {{is often}} {{compared}} to the film due to both having complicated plot structures told by multiple characters in the film. Welles said his initial idea for the film was [...] "Basically, the idea Rashomon used later on," [...] however Kurosawa had not yet <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> before making Rashomon in 1950. Nigel Andrews has compared the film's complex plot structure to Rashomon, Last Year at Marienbad, Memento and Magnolia. Andrews also compares Charles Foster Kane to Michael Corleone in The Godfather, Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull and Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood for their portrayals of [...] "haunted megalomaniac, presiding over the shards of [...] own [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Both Terry Rossio and Bill Marsilii have {{acknowledged}} that the film was not shot {{the way they had}} wanted it to be, shifting the blame to director Tony Scott and his goal to focus more on the action aspect of the film than on the more meaningful plot the screenplay had called for. Marsilii, although [...] "quite critical of the mistakes made," [...] said he was proud of the finished product. Rossio, however, was so put off during filming that he, as of May 2008, had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> Rossio complained that Scott had ignored the inclusion of important plot details from the screenplay whenever [...] "there was something he wanted to do" [...] instead. In the DVD commentary, Scott admits that he thought he did a mediocre job shooting [...]|$|E

[...] In late November 2014, Sajid Nadiadwala confirmed that he would direct the film's Hindi remake with Kapoor as the lead. When asked by Subhash K.

500|$|The {{film has}} itself been an {{influence}} {{in a range}} of other productions. There is an unconfirmed rumor that film director Steven Spielberg saw a screening of The Castle of Cagliostro in the early 80's. From that rumor, one would assume that Spielberg was so impressed with the film that it later influenced the action sequences in his Indiana Jones films and [...] There is no evidence of Spielberg quoting the film, but Manga Entertainment's DVD releases do quote him saying [...] "one of the greatest adventure movies of all time." [...] Another unverified statement has Spielberg calling the film's car chase [...] "one of the greatest chase sequences ever filmed". Some sources claim that Spielberg had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, but, according to official Cannes sources, Castle of Cagliostro was not shown that year.|$|E
500|$|In a Washington Post article {{covering}} Babb's career, {{the film}} critic Kenneth Turan wrote that Mom and Dad did not [...] "flourish {{because of its}} birth footageor because of its puerile plot, which Babb himself disparages ... success flowed, rather, from Babb's extraordinary promotional abilities." [...] The film was exhibited across the United States, and over 300 prints were produced. In the weeks preceding the screening, local presenters sought {{to attract the attention}} of the town's inhabitants by distributing letters to local newspapers and church leaflets protesting against the film's moral basis. This strategy often utilized fabricated letters supposedly written by the mayor of a nearby city, who wished to register concern about local young women in his area who had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> and were awakened enough to discuss problems similar to ones of their own.|$|E
