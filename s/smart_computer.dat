However, several challenges like dynamic backgrounds, camera stabilization, complex actions, occlusions etc. make action recognition in a real time and robust fashion difficult. Several complex approaches exist but are computationally intensive.

The use of multiple features for motion descriptors enhances the quality of tracking. Resilient backpropagation algorithm is used for training the feedforward neural network reducing the learning time. The overall system accuracy is improved by optimizing the various parameters of the multilayer perceptron network.

40|$|Introduction : We {{assessed}} proficiency (accuracy and intra‐ and intertest reproducibility) {{of smart}} quantitative sensation tests (smart QSTs) in subjects without and with diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN). Methods : Technologists from 3 medical centers using different but identical QSTs independently assessed 6 modalities of sensation {{of the foot}} (or leg) twice in patients without (n [*]=[*] 6) and with (n [*]=[*] 6) DSPN using <b>smart</b> <b>computer</b> assisted QSTs. Results : Low rates of test abnormalities were observed in health and high rates in DSPN. Very high intraclass correlations were obtained between continuous measures of QSTs and neuropathy signs, symptoms, or nerve conductions (NCs). No significant intra‐ or intertest differences were observed. Conclusions : These results provide proof of concept that smart QSTs provide accurate assessment of sensation loss without intra‐ or intertest differences useful for multicenter trials. Smart technology makes possible efficient testing of body surface area sensation loss in symmetric length‐dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathies. Muscle Nerve 49 : 645 – 653, 201...|$|E

40|$|Human pose {{recognition}} {{has become}} an active research topic lately {{in the field of}} human computer interface (HCI). However it presents technical challenges due to the complexity of human motion. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for human upper body pose recognition using labeled (i. e., recognized) human body parts in depth silhouettes. Our proposed method performs human upper body parts labeling using trained random forests (RFs) and utilizes support vector machines (SVMs) to recognize various upper body poses. To train RFs, we create a database of synthetic depth silhouettes of the upper body and their corresponding upper body parts labeled maps using a commercial computer graphics package. Once the body parts get labeled with the trained RFs, a skeletal upper body model is generated from the labeled body parts. Then, SVMs are trained with a set of joint angle features to recognize seven upper body poses. The experimental results show the mean recognition rate of 97. 62 %. Our proposed method should be useful as a near field HCI technique to be used in applications such as <b>smart</b> <b>computer</b> interfaces...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of mobile communications has been rapidly popular in recent years. In Taiwan, mobile phones predominantly possess multiple functions. In other words, mobile phones {{are not only}} conventional phones but also <b>smart</b> <b>computer</b> systems embedding with intelligent agent mechanisms to integrate heterogeneous applications. In addition, the billing system (Customer DB, Tariff and Sharing Schemes, Rating and Bill Data) is the {{crucial part of the}} communication system. It is an independent system to calculate the fee of communication. There are a lot of applications embedded into the mobile device in the market; however, how to integrate the billing system with the applications is insufficient. This study uses the RFID characteristics and intelligent agent attributes to establish a communication channel in order to automatically transmit data packets from the source site to the destination site. It exploits the intelligent agents to combine the intelligent parking system and the billing system. In addition, it proposes four kinds of intelligent behavior models including the intelligent agent cooperation behavior model, communication behavior model, coordination behavior model and competition behavior model to improve the process more smoothly and automatically. Using the intelligent agent characteristics and integrating the RFID features with the billing system are the most significant key factors.

40|$|Background: Young {{drivers with}} Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are {{at higher risk}} of road traffic {{injuries}} than their peers. Increased risk correlates with poor hazard perception skill. Few studies have investigated hazard perception training using computer technology with this group of drivers. Objectives: *Determine the presence and magnitude of the between-group and within- subject change in hazard perception skills in young drivers with ADHD who receive Drive Smart training. Determine whether training facilitated change in hazard perception is maintained over time. Methods: This was a feasibility study, randomised control trial conducted in Australia. The design included a delayed treatment for the control group. Twenty-five drivers with a diagnosis of ADHD were randomised to the Immediate Intervention or Delayed Intervention group. The Immediate Intervention group received a training session using a computer application entitled Drive Smart. The Delayed Intervention group watched a documentary video initially (control condition), followed by the Drive <b>Smart</b> <b>computer</b> training session. The participant&# 039;s hazard perception skill was measured using the Hazard Perception Test (HPT). Findings: After adjusting for baseline scores, {{there was a significant}} betweengroup difference in post-intervention HPT change scores in favour of the Immediate Intervention group. The magnitude of the effect was large. There was no significant within-group delayed intervention effect. A significant maintenance effect was found at 6 -week follow-up for the Immediate Intervention group. Conclusions: The hazard perception skills of participants improved following training with large effect size and some maintenance of gain. A multimodal approach to training is indicated to facilitate maintenance. A full-scale trial is feasible...|$|E

They are: (1) the multiple linear regression based in-process tool wear prediction (MLR-ITWP) system; (2) the artificial neural networks based in-process tool wear prediction (ANN-ITWP) system; and (3) the statistics assisted fuzzy-nets based in-process tool wear prediction (S-FN-ITWP) system.;Before these above-mentioned systems were developed and evaluated, statistical approaches had been implemented to analyze and identify the most significant force signal for tool wearing monitoring system. This study demonstrates that the average peak cutting forces in the Y direction (the direction that is perpendicular to the table feed) {{is the most effective}} cutting force representation for tool wear monitoring.;Following with this discovery, the first system (MLR-ITWP system) was developed using a multiple linear regression model through 100 experimental data sets. Another nine data sets were used to test the system. The average tool wear prediction error of the MLR-ITWP system was +/- 0. 039 mm through the testing data. The second system (ANN-ITWM system) was developed using back-propagation artificial neural network through the same experimental data and tested with another nine data sets. The average tool wear prediction error of this ANN-ITWM system was +/- 0. 037 mm. The third system (S-FN-ITWM system) was developed using fuzzy-nets assisted statistically through the same experimental data and tested with another nine data sets.
