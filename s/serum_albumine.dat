MATERIAL and METHODS: Between 2005 and 2009, 156 patients (F/M: 49 / 107) who underwent a renal transplantation from a living donor and who were given sirolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy were enrolled in our study. The patients were examined in two groups: Group 1 : TAC+SRL: 57 (36, 5 %), Group 2 : CSA+SRL: 99 (63, 5 %). After Month 3, the therapy was continued with SRL+Mycophenolic acid+Prednisolone. Analyses were performed using the 3 year data of the patients. RESULTS: Demographic data of the groups were similar. The incidences of acute rejection (respectively, 15, 8 %- 21, 2 % in group 1 and 2; p: 0, 480), patient survival (100 %- 98 %; p: 0, 280), graft survival (98, 2 %- 98 %; p: 0, 698) were not found significantly different.

40|$|A guanilina e a uroguanilina foram recentemente descobertas, respectivamente, no intestino e na urina, (Currie et al., 1992; Hamra et al., 1993). Fazem parte da famÃlia de peptÃdeos que ativam a guanilato ciclase de membrana (GC-C), aumentando os nÃveis intracelulares de cGMP (Schulz et al., 1990). EstÃo presentes em diversos tecidos, como respiratÃrio, linfonodos, testÃculos, cÃrebro e medula adrenal (Field et a. l., 1978; Forte et al., 1988, 1989; Hamra et al., 1993; Schulz et al., 1992). Foi comprovado que adicionando uma lisina na porÃÃo N-terminal, obtÃm-se um anÃlogo mais estÃvel e potente que a guanilina. O objetivo desse estudo Ã pesquisar os efeitos renais de um novo anÃlogo, ser-thr-lys-guanilina em sistema de perfusÃo. Os rins foram perfundidos com a soluÃÃo de Krebs-Henseleit modificada com 6 g% de albumina bovina. Os dados foram comparados atravÃs de teste t de Student e ANOVA, com significÃncia p< 0, 05. Na dose de 0, 1 Âg/mL, esse peptÃdeo apresentou efeitos similares aos da uroguanilina, na dose de 0, 5 Âg/mL, em todos os parÃmetros testados. Ambas causaram aumento na pressÃo de perfusÃo (PP: de 101, 5 Â 3, 7 para 111 Â 2, 9 mmHg; de 101, 2 Â 2, 6 para 113, 4 Â 2, 5 mmHg), no fluxo urinÃrio (FU: de 0, 158 Â 0, 016 para 0, 223 Â 0, 01 mL. g- 1. min- 1; de 0, 16 Â 0, 016 para 0, 226 Â 0, 2 mL. g- 1. min- 1) e diminuiÃÃo no transporte tubular total e {{proximal}} de sÃdio (%TNa+: de 0, 774 Â 0, 06 para 0, 724 Â 0, 035; de 0, 735 Â 0, 065 para 0, 773 Â 0, 084), potÃssio (%TK+: de 66, 89 Â 2, 77 para 47, 29 Â 3, 34; de 63, 54 Â 3, 82 para 42, 54 Â 8, 14) e cloreto (%TCl-: de 85, 69 Â 1, 19 para 73, 59 Â 2, 63). Esses resultados foram similares aos previamente descritos apÃs a administraÃÃo da toxina termo-estÃvel da Escherichia coli (STa), guanilina, uroguanilina e lys-guanilina no mesmo sistema (Lima et al., 1992; Fonteles et al., 1996 e 1998). A dose maior (1 Âg/mL) causou aÃÃo antidiurÃtica (FU: de 0, 165 Â 0, 004 para 0, 111 Â 0, 009 mL. g- 1. min- 1) e nenhum efeito sobre o transporte de sÃdio, embora a diminuiÃÃo na reabsorÃÃo tubular de potÃssio (%TK+: de 72, 29 Â 1, 2 para 49, 73 Â 6, 75) e cloreto (%TCl-: de 85, 96 Â 0, 79 para 81, 9 Â 1, 47) continuassem presentes. Nesta dose, nÃo apenas bloqueou o efeito diurÃtico da uroguanilina, como continuou causando um efeito antidiurÃtico significativo (FU: de 0, 168 Â 0, 004 para 0, 116 Â 0, 006). No entanto, nÃo foi capaz de bloquear os efeitos natriurÃticos da uroguanilina (%TNa+: de 85, 35 Â 2, 55 para 79, 92 Â 1, 05). O mecanismo de aÃÃo renal preciso dos peptÃdeos da famÃlia das guanilinas ainda nÃo foi completamente esclarecido. Sabe-se que esses peptÃdeos se ligam aos receptores GC-C (Schulz et al., 1990), porÃm hÃ indÃcios de que existam outras vias de aÃÃo renal, independentes desse receptor. HÃ ainda a possibilidade de que haja duas entidades agindo de modo antagÃnico no sistema. Talvez haja a necessidade de isolÃ-los. A descoberta dos peptÃdeos da famÃlia das guanilinas promoveu avanÃos significativos na compreensÃo da regulaÃÃo endÃgena dos transportes de Ãgua e eletrÃlitos. O completo esclarecimento do seu mecanismo de aÃÃo renal oferece perspectivas reais para o tratamento de doenÃas como a hipertensÃo arterial. Guanylin and uroguanylin {{are members}} of a family of peptides that stimulates cGMP production in several organic tissues, as intestine, kidney, airway, linfonodes, testis, brain and adrenal medulla (Field et a. l., 1978; Forte et al., 1988, 1989; Hamra et al., 1993; Schulz et al., 1992). Their 15 amino acid structures have been identified from rat intestine and opossum urine, respectively (Currie et al., 1992; Hamra et al., 1993), and they seem to be the link between intestine and kidney functions in controling blood pressure, as the âintestinal natriuretic hormoneâ suggested by some authors (Carey, 1978; Lennane et al., 1975). It was demonstrated that a Lysine- 1 analog of guanylin is a more potent natriuretic and kaliuretic peptide. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the renal effects of a novel analog of guanylin: ser-thr-lys-guanylin. Its effects were examined using isolated perfused kidneys from Wistar rats. All experiments were preceded by a 30 minutes internal control period and an external control group (C), in which the kidneys were perfused only with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 6 g% of a previously dialysed bovine <b>albumine</b> <b>serum.</b> The data was analyzed by Student t-test and ANOVA. The level of significance was set at p< 0, 05. Ser-thr-lys-guanylin, at the lowest dose (0. 1 Âg/mL) and uroguanylin (0. 5 Âg/mL) caused similar effects. Both groups were able to increase perfusion presure (PP: 101. 5 Â 3. 7 to 111 Â 2. 9 mmHg; 101. 2 Â 2. 6 to 113. 4 Â 2. 5 mmHg), urinary flow (UF: 0. 158 Â 0. 016 to 0. 223 Â 0. 019 mL. g- 1. min- 1; 0. 16 Â 0. 016 to 0. 226 Â 0. 2 mL. g- 1. min- 1) and to decrease sodium (%TNa+: 0. 774 Â 0. 06 to 0. 724 Â 0. 035; 0. 735 Â 0. 065 to 0. 773 Â 0. 084), potassium (%TK+: 66. 89 Â 2. 77 to 47. 29 Â 3. 34; 63. 54 Â 3. 82 to 42. 54 Â 8. 14) and cloride (%TCl-: 85. 69 Â 1. 19 to 73. 59 Â 2. 63) tubular reabsorption. Similar effects were also found in response to the Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), guanylin, uroguanylin and lys-guanylin in the same system (Lima et al., 1992; Fonteles et al., 1996 e 1998). However, a greater dose (1 Âg/mL), not only caused signifcantly decrease in the urinary flow (UF: 0. 165 Â 0. 004 to 0. 111 Â 0. 009 mL. g- 1. min- 1), but was also able to block the diuretic effects of uroguanylin (UF: 0. 168 Â 0. 004 to 0. 116 Â 0. 006 mL. g- 1. min- 1), although it still decreased potassium (%TK+: 72. 29 Â 1. 2 to 49. 73 Â 6. 75) and cloride(%TCl-: 85. 96 Â 0. 79 to 81. 9 Â 1. 47) tubular reabsorption. The precise renal mecanism of action of this family of peptides has not yet been fully elucidated. Deletion of GC-C genes in transgenic mice reveals that intestinal fluid secretion responses to STa are completely lost (Schulz et al., 1997 & Mann et al., 1997), but the natriuretic responses to STa and uroguanylin are retained (Carrithers et al., 1999), suggesting that other receptors are envolved. There is a possibility that there are to peptides causing antagonic effects. Further isolation may be necessary. Further studies are required to elucidate the specific renal mechanism of action of this new peptide. The discovery of guanylin and its family has promoted significant advances in the understanding of endogenous control of salt, water and eletrolites. The study of its analogs in perfused rat kidneys could help in elucidating their specific renal mecanism of action and bring great perspectives in the control of blood pressure...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} the {{prebiotic}} acting substance lactoferrin on blood parameters and the specific immune reaction were investigated in the model of orphan-reared neonatal beagle-puppies. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein that can be detected in milk and other external secretions of various mammals. In addition to many other functions it has shown stimulating effects on metabolism and immune system in previous trials. For this 14 -week trial 32 beagle-puppies were split in four groups (n = 8) with different lactoferrin inclusion levels (0, 30, 60, 120 mg Lactoferrin/kg milk replacer or dog food). The dogs were fed self-made, balanced milk replacer until weaning during week 8, followed by a commercial dry dog food. Application of Lactoferrin to the puppies had no influence on the increase of body weight. Looking at blood parameters some tendencies of the lactoferrin-supplemented groups within the white blood cell parameters could be detected. Treatment groups showed a decrease of relative lymphocyte numbers compared to those of the control group, what could be due to an anti-proliferating activity of lactoferrin on lymphocytes. Proliferation of neutrophil granulocytes was stimulated by lactoferrin, shown by the slightly increased levels of neutrophils in the treatment groups. No statistical significance could be detected. The typical physiological pattern of the development of red blood cell parameters during the first weeks of newborn puppies could be seen, while oral lactoferrin admission did not change any of these results. The production of anti human <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> antibodies was chosen as a parameter for the investigation of the effect of lactoferrin on the immune status. Lactoferrin did not show any influence on the proliferation of specific antibodies, induced by the subcutaneous application of human <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> for two times during week 8 and 12. Therefore, no direct association between lactoferrin-supplementation and immune response could be observed.

40|$|Key {{issue for}} metal {{nanoparticles}} (MNP) applications is their functionalization, that mainly depends on MNP surface accessibility and on solvents compatibility with functional molecules. Often reduction methods require long and expensive processes {{to overcome these}} two limits and to obtain a satisfactory MNP functionalization. An alternative is represented by laser ablation synthesis of metal nanoparticles in liquid solution (LASiS). LASiS provides stable colloidal solutions in water or in organic solvents, without any ligands or chemicals. Therefore MNP surface is usually free and functionalization occurs directly. However, LASiS does not allow a good control of MNP average size and size distribution. We show how this problem can be faced with good results by chemical free laser manipulation techniques for MNP size reduction and increase, inspired by top down and bottom up approaches.

Deze behandeling resulteerde in me er dan 1 miljoen babys wereldwijd. Verdere optimalisatie van IVF behandeling o p het gebied van embryo cultuursystemen is noodzakelijk om de lage implantatie kans te verhogen (lager dan 20 %). Vele patiënten ondergaan een IVF behandeling m et gameten van suboptimale kwaliteit. Hiervoor zijn verschillende nieuwe technieken ontwikkeld, zoals ooplasma en nucleus transfer, om deze patië nten te behandelen. Deze nieuwe ontwikkelingen vragen een preklinische evaluatie in diermodellen vooraleer toepasbaar in een humane IVF behandeling. Verschi llende studies werden uitgevoerd bij knaagdieren en runderen. Het extrapoleren van deze resultaten naar een humaan {{model is}} een discussiepunt aangezien de fylogenetica van deze diermodellen verschillen van het humane model. Daarenboven zijn er verschillen in de embryonale genoomactivatie en het metabolisme. Niet-humane primaten, zoals bavianen, zijn nauw verwant aan de mens en daarom noodzakelijk voor preklinische onderzoek in geassisteerde voortplanting. Het doel van onze studie is het karakteriseren van de baviaan (niet bedreigde diersoort) als een mod el voor IVF studies bij de mens. Hierbij ligt de focus op ovariële stimulatie (O S) en sperma verwerkingsprocedures. Aan de hand van gerandomiseerde studies me t verschillende OS {{protocols}}, selecteerden we twee succesvolle protocols v oor OS (lang en depot protocol) die resulteerden in 7 tot 10 metafase II eicell en per cyclus. We toonden ook aan dat de menstuele cyclus van een baviaan gesynchroniseerd kon worden door het gebruik van een lage dosis orale contraceptie, wat een belangrijke stap is voor de planning van IVF cycli bij bavianen. Voor het eerst toonden we het belang aan van het gebruik van <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> voor de capacitatie van bavianensperma. Dankzij het toevoegen van <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> nam de spermabeweeglijkheid en de bindingscapaciteit van zaadcellen aan de zona pellucida toe. In vergelijking met het humaan <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> (HSA) en he t bovine <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> (BSA) verhoogt het gebruik van baviaan serum (BS) verder de beweeglijkheid van de zaadcellen en hun bindingscapaciteit aan de zon a pellucida. Gelijkaardige resultaten werden gevonden wanneer chemische activators (dbcAMP en cafeïne) werden gebruikt. We postuleren dat het ge bruik van BS en deze chemische activators de baviaan IVF behandeling zal verbe teren aangezien de beweeglijkheid van de zaadcellen en bindingscapaciteit aan de zona pellucida positief gecorreleerd zijn met de IVF resultaten. Daarnaast was intra-cytoplasmatische sperma injectie (ICSI) mogelijk bij bavianen en resulteerde in een verhoogde fertilisatie. Algemeen schommelde het fertilisatiepercentage in beide groepen tussen 23 %- 71 %. De embryos werd en succesvol in cultuur gehouden tot dag 3 met 80 - 100 % overleving en de aanwezigheid van 12 - 57 % 4 tot 8 cel embryos. Spermastudies bij bavianen tonen aan dat het collecteren van zaadcellen via electroejaculatie (EE), met een interval van drie maanden, geen invloed had op de spermakwaliteit (beweeglijkheid, concentratie, morfologie, pH en volume). Deze resultate n tonen aan dat repetitief gebruik van spermastalen van dezelfde mannelijke bavianen mogelijk is, ook binnen een IVF setting. Een gedetailleerd onderzoek maa kte mogelijk om het baboonmodel te gebruiken om het effect na te gaan van ee n hoge dosis khat (naar aanleiding van de mogelijke associatie tussen subfertil iteit en het gebruik van khat) op de spermaparameters en mannelijke hormonen. We toonden aan dat de toediening van khat een significante daling in de spermakwaliteit veroorzaakt (sperma DNA integriteit, motiliteit en aanta l zaadcellen) en een daling in testosterone spiegels. Tenslotte werd in een piloot studie nagegaan wat de rol is van het baviaanmodel voor het invriezen va n ovarieel weefsel via vitrificatie in de preventie van infertiliteit bij kankerpatiënten. Onze resultaten tonen dat het ovarieel weefsel follikel s in verschillende ontwikkelingstadia bevat die verschillend reageren op het invriesproces, gelijkaardig aan observaties bij de mens. Dit toont aan d at het baviaanmodel nuttig kan zijn in verdere studies rond vitrificatie van ov arieel weefsel. Op basis van onze resultaten kunnen we stellen dat het baviaanmodel een veelbelovend model is voor ve rdere studies voor geassisteerde fertilisatietechnieken hoewel verdere validat ie van het model noodzakelijk is. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{traditional}} production systems, such as bacteria, yeasts and mammal cells, {{plants can}} now be used to produce eukaryotic recombinant proteins. Their advantages as hosts for protein production include correct post-translational modifications, low cost of maintenance and no risk of contamination by human pathogens. Targeting heterologous proteins to the extracellular space {{is required for the}} correct folding of complex proteins and makes harvesting and purification easier. However, the quantity and the quality of recombinant proteins have been proved to be reduced by the action of endogenous co-secreted proteases. In this study, we aimed at identifying active root-secreted (rhizosecreted) proteases in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Their activity was assayed by in vitro degradation of a target protein (Bovine <b>Serum</b> <b>Albumine,</b> BSA) in a range of pH. The protease classes involved in BSA degradation were evaluated by inhibitor-based assays that revealed serine proteases as the major class involved in this degradation in any tested conditions. As a first step towards identification, and subsequent silencing, of the most active members of this class, rhizosecreted proteases are being analyzed by the “Activity-Based Protein Profiling” approach...|$|E

The diploma thesis {{was aimed}} at potencial antiglycation effect of {{antioxidants}} of natural origin (hydroxycinnamic acids) on the modification of bovine <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> and asparate aminotransferase by methylglyoxal as a glycating agent. I monitored the effect of hydroxycinnamic acids on generation of glycation products using fluorescent, absorption, and electrophoretic methods. The influence of hydroxycinnamic acids on the glycation of model proteins was ambiguous. The only derivative with proven antiglycation effect on production of non-specific glycation products and pentosidin measured by fluorescence and spectrophotometry was p-coumaric acid in 100 μM concentration. On the other hand, chlorogenic acid 100 μM displayed strong proglycation effects in all methods used for detection of glycation products. The effect of all tested substances was concentration dependent. Results show that the more substituents given acid contained in its molecule, the stronger proglycation effect this compound exerted...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{sensitive}} label-free impedimetric hCG-immunosensor was constructed {{by using a}} commercial screen-printing carbon ink electrode (namely Disposable Electrochemical Printed chip) as the basis. The carbon ink electrode of DEP chip is modified first by deposition of polypyrrole–pyrole- 2 -carborxylic acid copolymer and thence hCG antibody immobilization via the COOH groups of pyrrole- 2 -carboxylic acid, which can serve as linker for covalent biomolecular immobilization. The experimental results exposed that the designed immunosensor is more sensitive than other previously reported immunosensors, {{in the case of}} detection limit and linear range for antigen detection. With optimal fabrication parameters, the detection limit for α-hCG was 2. 3 pg/mL in 10 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution containing 1 % Bovine <b>Serum</b> <b>Albumine</b> (BSA). Moreover, the use of inexpensive DEP chip as a basis for these immunosensors will allow for simple instrumentation, disposable and portable at low cost.

40|$|A {{method for}} impedimetric {{detection}} of biomolecules with field-effect transistor (FET) arrays is presented. For biomolecular detection, the corresponding molecules such as single-stranded DNA or bovine <b>serum</b> <b>albumine</b> (BSA) were covalently immobilized {{to the gate}} structure of 16 -channel open-gate FET devices. A micro spotter system was used to site-selectively attach biomolecules to selected channels out of the array. The differential transistor transfer function (TTF) of the FETs with attached biomolecules compared to free FETs was recorded. With this impedimetric technique {{it was possible to}} reliably detect biomolecules, because the recordings were not disturbed by the typical long-term drift of the sensors like in potentiometric readout mode. For transistor gates, where DNA sequences of different length were attached, small differences in the TTF spectra were detected. When BSA was covalently immobilized to the FETs clear differences in the TTF spectra were detected, which were independent on buffer pH variations around the isoelectric point of the protein. Based on the results presented in this article it can be concluded, that the TTF method detects passive components of the biomolecules like resistance and capacitance rather than surface charge effects.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{innovative}} photoelectrochemical process (PEC) based on graphite electrode modified with electroactive polyvinylpyridine bearing osmium complex (Os-PVP). The system {{relies on the}} in situ enzymatic generation of CdS quantum dots (QDs).

40|$|Plant-based {{biopharmaceuticals}} {{have gained}} {{a lot of}} interest in the past decade due to their reduced cost and relative safety compared to mammalian cell cultures. While the first plant-made recombinant proteins are now reaching the market, the production systems still need improvements to maximize their competitiveness, proteolysis being one of the main factors limiting the yields. Identifying and inhibiting in vivo endogenous proteases involved in the degradation of recombinant proteins could then lead to a significant increase in production yields. In this study, we focused on two different production systems in Arabidopsis thaliana: rhizosecretion and cell suspensions. Extracellular proteases of both systems were used in vitro to study the conditions of target protein degradation (Bovine <b>Serum</b> <b>Albumine,</b> BSA). First, proteases from both systems degrade BSA at both acidic and neutral-to-basic pH conditions. Then, serine and metallopeptidases were shown to be the main protease classes responsible for BSA degradation by rhizosecreted proteomes or extracellular cell culture media, respectively. Finally, the biochemical tests were coupled to a bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, in order to reduce the number of the proteases most likely involved in BSA degradation. Using this method, only five serine proteases and two metallopeptidases remain candidates for an amiRNA-mediated in vivo inhibition...|$|E
