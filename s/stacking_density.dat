The well-stacked CuPc layer increased the stability and efficiency of the devices. Thermal annealing after CuPc deposition and magnetic field treatment during CuPc deposition were performed to obtain a stacked-CuPc layer; the former increased the <b>stacking</b> <b>density</b> of the CuPc molecules and the alignment of the CuPc film. Thermal annealing at about 100 oC increased the current flow through the CuPc layer by over 25 %. Surface roughness decreased from 4. 12 to 3. 65 nm and spikes were lowered at the film surface as well. However, magnetic field treatment during deposition was less effective than thermal treatment.

40|$|Numerical {{models and}} recent outcrop {{case studies of}} alluvial-to-coastal-plain strata suggest that autogenic {{avulsion}} can control the <b>stacking</b> <b>density</b> and architecture of channelized fluvial sandbodies. The application of these models to subsurface well data was tested by the analysis of upper coastal plain deposits of the late Bajocian Ness Formation in the Brent Field reservoir, UK North Sea. These coastal plain deposits accumulated during the progradation and retrogradation of the wave-dominated ‘Brent Delta’. Sedimentological facies analysis and palaeosol characterization in cores were used to interpret the styles of palaeochannel avulsion. These results were then compared with the dimensions and distributions of channelized fluvial sandbodies that had been quantified by spatial statistical tools (lacunarity, Besag’s L function) applied to interpretative correlation panels between closely spaced wells. The {{results indicate that the}} distributions of channelized sandbodies may plausibly have been generated by avulsions and that they influence sandbody connectivity and pressure depletion patterns.

In this work, asymmetric supercapacitors with excellent performance have been fabricated using ternary (Ni, Co) 0. 85 Se on carbon fabric as bind-free positive electrode and porous free-standing graphene films as negative electrode.

The values obtained were compared with those previously reported for the diaphragm and sternomastoid muscles. The extraocular muscles were studied because they differ from the other two muscles {{in that they are}} among the fastest of the mammalian muscles, yet their endplates have sparse junctional folds. They could thus provide information {{on the extent to which}} ACHe concentration is an invariant feature of endplate morphology and what, if any aspects may be related to their fast speed of response. We found, using light microscope autoradiography, that in the twitch fibers of the extraocular muscle, there is n average of 6. 4 +/- 2. 1 X 10 (7) DFP- binding sites per endplate, of which 29 % (1. 8 X 10 (7)) are reactivated by 2 -PAM and are thus AChe. The morphology of the extraocular endplates allowed us to conclude, on statistical grounds, that the AChe site are probably localized not only along the surface area of the postjunctional membrane (PJM) but also along the surface of the presynaptic axonal membrane.

During the test, the conductive line makes a periodic bending movement from I to V, and every period needs 2 s. The details also {{can be seen from}} the set in Figure  3 b. It is very interesting to find that the resistivity of the conductive silver lines also increases with the increase of the bending angle. From I to III, the resistivity increases from 5.2 to 5.76 Ω. It can be explained that when bending, the silver thin film was stretched and became thin, especially on the top point of the conductive line, so the <b>stack</b> <b>density</b> and conductivity decreased. From III to V, the resistivity was back to 5.2 Ω, and after a periodic movement like this for 1, 000 times, the resistivity did not significantly increase due to the good ductility of the metal silver.

The optimal load resistance maximizes the gross <b>stack</b> power <b>density</b> and results from a trade-off between stack voltage and stack current. The primary trade-off governing the optimal feed velocity is between stack pumping power losses, which reduce the net power density and concentration polarization losses, which reduce the gross <b>stack</b> power <b>density.</b> Lastly, the primary trade-off governing the optimal residence time is between the capital costs of the stack and pretreatment system.

By using SiC substrates with well-formed step-and-terrace structures, stable layer-by-layer growth of 4 H-AlN (1 [overline 1] 00) can be realized. The layer-by-layer growth {{is confirmed by}} observations of anisotropic two-dimensional AlN islands on the grown surface as well as persistent reflection high-energy electron diffraction intensity oscillations. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that stacking fault generation during growth is suppressed and the <b>stacking</b> fault <b>density</b> is reduced to 1 × 106 cm− 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—CoCrPtTa/Ti bilayer {{thin films}} have been sputter {{deposited}} onto both glass and Al substrates under high sputtering rate in a manufacturing environment. From microstructure and magnetic property studies, {{it is found}} that Cr segregation and <b>stacking</b> fault <b>density</b> are the two major issues in obtaining high quality perpendicular media. (0002) texture orientation spread and lattice parameter remain almost constant within the variation range of the deposition parameters, though there is a small distinction between the media on glass and those on Al substrates.

40|$|The {{nucleation}} of GaN {{thin films}} on GaAs is investigated for growth at 620 "C. An rf plasma cell {{is used to}} generate chemically active nitrogen from N 2. An arsenic flux {{is used in the}} first eight monolayer of nitride growth to enhance nucleation of the cubic phase. Subsequent growth does not require an As flux to preserve the cubic phase. The nucleation of smooth interfaces and GaN films with low <b>stacking</b> fault <b>densities</b> is dependent upon relative concentrations of active nitrogen species in the plasma and on the nitrogen to gallium flux ratio...|$|R
