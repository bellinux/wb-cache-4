40|$|The oxygen {{evolution}} and recombination kinetics in Ni-based battery {{systems have been}} investigated under temperature-controlled, steady-state, overcharging conditions within a temperature range of 0 - 60 Â°C. Theoretical relationships for both reactions have been derived. The mathematical relationships have been confirmed by experiments on <b>sealed</b> <b>rechargeable</b> NiCd <b>batteries.</b> Under steady-state overcharging conditions, the Cd electrode potential was proven to be constant, thereby significantly reducing {{the complexity of the}} interpretation of the results. The oxygen evolution reaction was found to be a two-step process at the Ni electrode: two linear Tafel dependencies were found at low and high currents, separated by a transition region at intermediate currents. The oxygen recombination kinetics was found to be first-order in partial oxygen pressure, strongly suggesting that the recombination reaction is purely diffusion-controlled by oxygen, redissolved into the electrolyte, to the Cd electrode surface. For all reactions, activation energies have been determined. The results can directly be applied to aqueous battery models and give more insight into both the overcharging and self-discharge processes occurring in these Ni-based systems...|$|R
50|$|The <b>sealed</b> <b>rechargeable</b> {{nickel-metal hydride}} <b>battery</b> offers {{significant}} performance and environmental friendliness above alkaline <b>rechargeable</b> <b>batteries.</b> Ni/MH, like the lithium-ion battery, provides high energy and power density with long cycle lives. This technology's greatest problem is its inherent high corrosion rate in aqueous solutions. The {{most commonly used}} separators are porous insulator films of polyolefin, nylon or cellophane. Acrylic compounds can be radiation-grafted onto these separators to make their properties more wettable and permeable. Zhijiang Cai and co-workers developed a solid polymer membrane gel separator. This was a polymerization product {{of one or more}} monomers selected from the group of water-soluble ethylenically unsaturated amides and acid. The polymer-based gel also includes a water swellable polymer, which acts as a reinforcing element. Ionic species are added to the solution and remain embedded in the gel after polymerization. Ni/MH batteries of bipolar design are being developed because they offer some advantages for applications as storage systems for electric vehicles. This solid polymer membrane gel separator could be useful for such applications in bipolar design. In other words, this design can help to avoid short-circuits occurring in liquid-electrolyte systems.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the concept}} of a defined <b>sealed</b> <b>rechargeable</b> NiCd <b>battery,</b> the {{mathematics}} of the various electrochemical and physical processes occurring inside the battery are described. Subsequently, these sets of mathematical equations are clustered and converted into an electronic network model. Introducing the relevant electrochemical and physical parameters, the one-dimensional model is shown to be capable of simulating not only the development of the cell voltage during (over) charging and (over) discharging, but also of simultaneously calculating the development of the internal gas pressure. Considering the thermal dependencies of the various electrochemical reactions and those of the battery environment, the temperature development and the mutual interaction with the voltage and gas pressure can also be calculated. Since the electronic network approach gives access to all partial currents flowing through the different reaction paths inside the battery, it is easy to visualize what processes are occurring during battery operation. This is, for example, illustrated for the two-step overdischarge process, indicating that, respectively, the Cd and O 2 charge-transfer reactions play a dominant role under these conditions. Electronic network simulations are shown to be not only restricted to direct current applications but are also applicable to processes, like open-circuit voltage relaxation and self-discharge behavior...|$|R
40|$|A 7. 2 V, 1. 25 Ah <b>sealed</b> {{lithium-ion}} <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> {{has been}} studied for estimating its state-of-charge (SOC) by AC impedance. The dispersion of impedance data over the frequency range between 100 kHz and 25 mHz comprises an inductive part and two capacitive parts. As the inductive behaviour of the battery is attributed to the porous nature of the electrodes, only the capacitive components have been examined. The data obtained at several SOC values of the battery have been analyzed by a non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. The presence of two depressed semicircles in the capacitive region of the Nyquist plots necessitated {{the use of an}} electrical equivalent circuit containing constant phase elements instead of capacitances. The impedance parameters corresponding to the low-frequency semicircle have been found useful for predicting the SOC of the battery, mainly because the magnitude of these parameters and their variations are more significant than those of the high-frequency semicircle. The frequency maximum (f(max)) of the semicircle, the resistive component (Z') corresponding to f(max), the phase angle (phi) in the 5. 0 Hz- 0. 1 Hz frequency range, the equivalent series resistance (R-s) and the equivalent series capacitance (C-s) have been identified as suitable parameters for predicting the SOC values of the lithium-ion battery...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) {{batteries}} are well proven for LEO satellite's application. NiCd {{batteries are}} not very energy-dense, but they are inexpensive, lightweight, and extensively proven [1]. This paper describes {{the development of a}} simulation electrical and thermal model for a <b>sealed</b> <b>rechargeable</b> NiCd <b>battery.</b> Based on the concept of this battery type, a mathematical description of the various electrochemical and thermal processes occurring inside the battery can be given. A family of curves was introduced {{as a result of the}} modelling and simulation work in this paper. Some of these curves are verified with an experimental work results. The validation phases and the dynamics of the battery parameters convergence are extremely high and acceptable. The electrical and thermal properties are shown. One aim of the present research is to study the thermal behavior of a NiCd battery for space applications. After a description of the effect of temperature on NiCd cell electrical properties, a thermal model has been developed to calculate the temperature profile in a NiCd cell stack during charging and discharging processes during ground testing. The equations describing the temperature distribution of the cell stack are derived and then the temperature results are presented. Finally, the calculated temperatures are compared to those measured during ground testing. When selecting batteries for space flight applications, the following requirements should be considered: ampere-hour capacity, recharge-ability, depth of discharge (DOD), lifetime, temperature environments, ruggedness, and weight. Many batteries have been qualified and used for space flight, enhancing the ease of selecting the right battery...|$|R

25|$|Many {{types of}} {{batteries}} employ toxic {{materials such as}} lead, mercury, and cadmium as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Batteries are one form of electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste recycling services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries. Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country. In the United States, the Mercury-Containing and <b>Rechargeable</b> <b>Battery</b> Management Act of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries, enacted uniform labeling requirements for <b>rechargeable</b> <b>batteries</b> and required that <b>rechargeable</b> <b>batteries</b> be easily removable.
