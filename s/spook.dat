5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again. His son <b>Spook</b> was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. <b>Spook</b> was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. <b>Spook</b> played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to <b>Spook,</b> worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E
5|$|Several {{descendants}} of Pal played the fictional Lassie character following their progenitor's death. On the original television series (1954–73), Pal's son, Lassie Junior, and his grandsons, <b>Spook</b> and Baby, worked {{the first several}} seasons. Mire appeared in {{a few of the}} Ranger seasons, and Hey Hey worked the final two syndicated seasons.|$|E

5|$|Although {{all of the}} B-29s {{were named}} as shown, the only nose art applied to the {{aircraft}} before the atomic bomb missions was that of Enola Gay. With the exceptions of Victors 71 and 94, the others were applied some time in August 1945.

5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following {{the turn of the}} century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), <b>Spook</b> Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, The Peripheral (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had largely}} {{abandoned}} short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy {{at the close}} of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series The X-Files around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, No Maps for These Territories, in 2000. Gibson has been invited to address the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the Directors Guild of America (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as Wired, Rolling Stone and The New York Times. His third trilogy of novels, Pattern Recognition (2003), <b>Spook</b> Country (2007) and Zero History (2010) have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to <b>spook</b> or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} for the bomb code-named the Fat Man arrived by air the same day. The bomb's plutonium core (encased in its insertion capsule) and the beryllium-polonium initiator were transported from Kirtland to Tinian by C-54 {{in the custody}} of Project Alberta couriers. Three Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies designated F31, F32, and F33 were picked up at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s, two from the 509th and one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving 2 August. The B-29s were Luke the <b>Spook</b> and Laggin' Dragon of the 509th, and 42-65386, a phase 3 Silverplate of the 216th AAF Base Unit. F33 was expended during the final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to <b>spook</b> at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

5|$|The first {{plutonium}} core, {{along with}} its polonium-beryllium Urchin initiator, was transported {{in the custody of}} Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium-field carrying-case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper. The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 26 July, and arrived at North Field on Tinian on 28 July. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s; two, Luke the <b>Spook</b> and Laggin' Dragon, from the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on 2 August. Upon arrival, F31 was partly disassembled in order to check all its components. F33 was expended near Tinian during a final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.|$|E

2500|$|The power {{exercised}} by a deity is legitimate, and this legitimacy justifies offerings and sacrifice. Unlike {{the gods of}} disease and death, <b>spooks</b> (apparitions) and demons have no such legitimacy. Whereas <b>spooks</b> – like the spectres of the dead – only frighten (and in that way, can also cause disease), demons are devourers; in practice, however, the borderline can be thin. One of the best-known <b>spooks</b> is an attractive woman maddening the men who give in to her lures (known in Yucatec as the xtabay 'Female Ensnarer'). <b>Spooks</b> of the Tzotziles include such figures as the 'charcoal-cruncher', the 'one who drops his own flesh', and 'white-bundle'. The boundary between <b>spooks</b> like these and the wayob of the Classic period is not always entirely clear. The principal demon of the Tzotzil area is the 'Black-man' (h?ik'al), a kidnapper and rapist. [...] An ancient Mesoamerican bird demon, which the Popol Vuh calls Vucub Caquix, severed the limbs of his victims, and was already known in Preclassic Izapa. In order to terrorize their enemies, kings would at times assume the shapes of <b>spooks</b> and demons. Bush spirits (such as the 'Wild Man' or Salvaje) belong to the frightening denizens of uninhabited areas, without, however, being apparitions.|$|R

25|$|In Greenport, {{maintenance}} of NY23B reverts to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The route remains in Greenport for only , passing residential and industrial neighborhoods {{on the fringe}} of the city as it intersects the north end of County Route29 (<b>Spook</b> Rock Road). Just east of the junction, NY23B traverses Claverack Creek and crosses into the town of Claverack, where the route initially serves a sparsely developed area between the town line and the hamlet of Claverack. The open fields are gradually replaced by homes as the highway enters Claverack, where NY23B meets NY9H and NY23 at a junction {{in the center of the}} community. NY23B ends here while NY23 continues east on the route's right-of-way.|$|E
25|$|NY9H {{begins at}} a {{junction}} of three major Hudson Valley roadways, US9, NY23, and NY82, in the Belle Pond section of Livingston. The route heads north through rural Livingston, overlapping with NY23 {{as the road}} passes Belle Pond and farms as a two-lane road. It soon enters the town of Greenport, where NY9H and NY23 turn eastward and intersect with the southern terminus of County Route29 (CR29, named <b>Spook</b> Rock Road). The two roads enter the town of Claverack, crossing under power lines before bending northward through town. NY9H and NY23 remain mainly rural through the southern parts of Claverack, bending northward at a junction with CR27 before entering the hamlet of Claverack. In Claverack, the two routes become residential before intersecting with the eastern terminus of NY23B. At this junction, NY23 turns eastward on NY23B's continuation, while NY9H continues north.|$|E
25|$|The World War II era {{also brought}} on rising {{production}} costs {{that resulted in}} a reduced number of elaborate gags and outdoor sequences, Del Lord's stock in trade; as such, the quality of the team's films (particularly those directed by Lord) began to slip after 1942. According to Okuda and Watz, entries such as Loco Boy Makes Good, What's the Matador?, Sock-A-Bye Baby (all 1942), I Can Hardly Wait and A Gem of a Jam (both 1943) are considered to be lesser quality works than previous films. <b>Spook</b> Louder (1943), a remake of Mack Sennett's The Great Pie Mystery (1931), is often cited as the Stooges' worst film because of its repetitious and rehashed jokes. Three Smart Saps (1942), a film considered to be an improvement, features a reworking of a routine from Harold Lloyd's The Freshman (1925), in which Curly's loosely basted suit begins to come apart at the seams while he is on the dance floor.|$|E
