5|$|The {{nucleobases}} {{are classified}} into two types: the purines, A and G, being fused five- and <b>six-membered</b> heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the <b>six-membered</b> rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U), usually takes {{the place of}} thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.|$|E
5|$|The planar {{aromatic}} chromophore {{portion of}} the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the <b>six-membered</b> daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, as evidenced by several crystal structures.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the previously known steroid compounds ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol acetate and ergosta-4,6,8-(14),22-tetraene-3-one, three unique triterpenes—derivatives of 3-hydroxy-lanostane—have been isolated from fruit bodies of A.hygrometricus. The compounds, named astrahygrol, 3-epi-astrahygrol, and astrahygrone (3-oxo-25S-lanost-8-eno-26,22-lactone), have δ-lactone (a <b>six-membered</b> ring) in the side chain—a chemical feature previously unknown in the Basidiomycetes. A previously unknown steryl ester (3β, 5α-dihydroxy-(22E, 24R)-ergosta-7,22-dien-6α-yl palmitate) has been isolated from mycelia grown in liquid culture. The compound has a polyhydroxylated ergostane-type nucleus.|$|E

5|$|The {{core of the}} exosome {{contains}} a <b>six-membered</b> ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex {{is present in the}} cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus, although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to substrates specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and many species of small RNAs. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the 3′ end in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.|$|E
5|$|This ring {{structure}} {{is very similar}} to that of the proteins RNase PH and PNPase. In bacteria, the protein RNase PH, which is involved in tRNA processing, forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical RNase PH proteins. In the case of PNPase, which is a phosphorolytic RNA-degrading protein found in bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic organisms, two RNase PH domains, and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein, which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome. Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure, these complexes are thought to be evolutionarily related and have a common ancestor. In bacteria, a separate RNase PH protein exists that is involved in transfer RNA processing, which has been shown to adopt a similar <b>six-membered</b> ring structure, but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits. The RNase PH-like exosome proteins, PNPase and RNase PH all belong to the RNase PH family of RNases and are phosphorolytic exoribonucleases, meaning that they use inorganic phosphate to remove nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA molecules.|$|E
25|$|Several {{research}} groups have studied <b>six-membered</b> ring pyrazole bioisosteres. For example, one 2,3-diarylpyridine derivative {{was shown to}} be potent and selective CB1 inverse agonist. The structure of this compound demonstrates {{the possibility that the}} amide moiety of rimonabant could be split into a lipophilic (benzyloxy) and a polar (nitrile) functionality. Other <b>six-membered</b> ring analogs are for example pyrimidines and pyrazines.|$|E

25|$|Secondary and {{tertiary}} phosphines {{occur in}} cyclic forms. Three-membered rings are phosphiranes (unsaturated: phosphirenes), five-membered rings are phospholanes (unsaturated: phosphole), and <b>six-membered</b> rings are phosphinanes.|$|E
25|$|The word phenol is {{also used}} to refer to any {{compound}} that contains a <b>six-membered</b> aromatic ring, bonded directly to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Thus, phenols are a class of organic compounds of which the phenol discussed in this article is the simplest member.|$|E
25|$|Like many monosaccharides, ribose {{exists in}} an {{equilibrium}} among 5 forms—the linear form H−(C=O)−(CHOH)4–H and {{either of the}} two ring forms: alpha- or beta-ribofuranose (“C3'-endo”), with a five-membered ring, and alpha- or beta-ribopyranose (“C2'-endo”), with a <b>six-membered</b> ring. The beta-ribopyranose form predominates in aqueous solution.|$|E

25|$|Black {{phosphorus}} has an orthorhombic {{structure and}} is the least reactive allotrope, {{a result of its}} lattice of interlinked <b>six-membered</b> rings where each atom is bonded to three other atoms. Black and red phosphorus can also take a cubic crystal lattice structure. A recent synthesis of black phosphorus using metal salts as catalysts has been reported.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the five and <b>six-membered</b> ring analogs there are other cyclic derivatives such as the azetidines. One example is the methylsulfonamide azetidine derivative which has a 1,1-diaryl group that mimics the 1,5-diaryl moiety of the diarylpyrazoles. The sulfonyl group serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The 1,1-diaryl group is also present in derivatives such as the benzodioxoles and hydantoins.|$|E
25|$|Aromaticity also {{occurs in}} {{compounds}} {{that are not}} carbocyclic or heterocyclic; inorganic six-membered-ring compounds analogous to benzene have been synthesized. For example, borazine is a <b>six-membered</b> ring composed of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms, each with one hydrogen attached. It has a delocalized π system and undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions appropriate to aromatic rings rather than reactions expected of non-aromatic molecules.|$|E

25|$|This {{transition}} state likely {{occurs because}} of favorable pi-stacking with the phenyl substituent. The enantioselectivity {{of the process}} is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent. The Diels-Alder reaction {{is one of the}} most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of natural products using the Diels-Alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of <b>six-membered</b> rings(scheme 18).|$|E
25|$|Intramolecular aldol {{reaction}} is the condensation reaction of two aldehyde groups or ketone {{groups in the}} same molecule. Five- or <b>six-membered</b> , -unsaturated ketone or aldehyde is formed as the product. This {{reaction is}} an important approach {{to the formation of}} carbon-carbon bond in organic molecules containing ring systems. For example, under strong basic conditions (e.g. sodium hydroxide), hexane-2,5-dione (compound A in Figure 1) can cyclize via intramolecular aldol reaction to form the 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (compound B).|$|E
25|$|Indole is an {{aromatic}} heterocyclic {{organic compound}} with formula C8H7N. It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a <b>six-membered</b> benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. Indole is widely distributed in the natural environment and can be produced {{by a variety of}} bacteria. As an intercellular signal molecule, indole regulates various aspects of bacterial physiology, including spore formation, plasmid stability, resistance to drugs, biofilm formation, and virulence. The amino acid tryptophan is an indole derivative and the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin.|$|E
