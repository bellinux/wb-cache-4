Zimmerman felt obliged to improve on the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge. Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; Zimmerman had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked but had never had the time or money to rework it previously.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] was generally mixed. Website Drowned in Sound described the song as [...] "sweet and charming" [...] but stated that, {{although it is}} a good album track it isn't strong enough to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> its own as a single and is rather [...] "bland" [...] compared to some of the band's other songs such as [...] "Demons" [...] and [...] "Fire in My Heart". The NME called the song [...] "a bit rubbish" [...] by the Super Furries' [...] "usual high standards" [...] and went as far as to claim that [...] "John Lennon was shot for less". The Dallas Observer claimed the track is [...] "guaranteed to induce the same type of melancholic, goose-bumpy splendor that tunes like The Kinks' 'Waterloo Sunset', Dennis Wilson's 'Forever' and Jack Bruce's 'Theme for an Imaginary Western' still do", Entertainment Weekly described it {{as one of the best}} songs on parent album Rings Around the World, comparing it to the work of The Beatles while The Daily Telegraph called it a [...] "honey-dripping pop classic". PopMatters claimed the track [...] "sounds like any of Blur's best ballads".|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E

500|$|The main rivalry {{leading into}} the event on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Randy Orton over the WWE Championship. At WWE's August {{pay-per-view}} event SummerSlam, Cena successfully defended the championship against Orton, and the following night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Orton interfered in Cena's match with King Booker and cost him the match. After the match ended, Orton attacked Cena's real-life father, in storyline, by kicking {{him in the head}}. As a result of Orton's actions, the two met in a championship match at WWE's September pay-per-view event Unforgiven, in which Cena was disqualified for ignoring the referee's commands; as per WWE rules, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Orton was not awarded the title. Following their match, Cena's father gained revenge on Orton by kicking him in the head the same way Orton had done to him earlier. Later in the night after the event went off the air, authority figure Jonathan Coachman made a rematch between the two at No Mercy in a Last Man Standing match, which involves two competitors fighting until one can not <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his feet before the referee counts to ten. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Cena legitimately tore his right pectoral muscle during a match with Mr. Kennedy, though the injury was blamed on television on a post-match attack by Orton. Due to the severity of his injury, Cena was forced to vacate the title. Although Cena's match against Orton was canceled, World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon stated that there would be [...] "a new WWE Champion crowned at No Mercy".|$|E

[...] He praised the game's closeness to the novel, but felt the gameplay featured nothing original. He concluded [...] "with the current glut of Tolkien-inspired games focusing directly on the brutal, tragic stories of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit offers up a story that's less dire and more of an enjoyable romp. The story still stands up, but the game that has been wrapped around it simply cannot keep up its end of the bargain." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} many wise people were there, yet {{they had to}} come to Moses, for they could not erect the Tabernacle on their own.

[...] So each of the wise people took a {{finished}} piece of work and came to Moses to present him the boards, the bars, and all the parts.

The Midrash clarified that Moses did not set it up by himself, for miracles were performed with it, and it rose of its own accord, for [...] says (using the passive voice), [...] "The Tabernacle was reared up."

Maura Johnston of The Village Voice reviewed the performance positively, saying: [...] "The night started off with 'End Of Time,' the militaristic yet ethereal paean to fidelity off her most recent album, 4. 'Say you'll never let me go,' a choir commands over a triple-time drumbeat, and as far as opening statements are concerned it was a convincing one; the small size of the venue and exclusivity of the gig... also helped, as much of this audience was ready to eat out of the palm of her hand." [...] A writer of Black Entertainment Television noted, [...] "She dazzled fans with an assortment of high-energy performances of her upbeat hits like... 'End of Time.'" [...] On February 3, 2013, Knowles performed the song during the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show.

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the back of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained.
