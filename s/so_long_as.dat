5|$|On 3 August 1936, Charles de Chambrun, French {{ambassador}} to Italy, presented the French government's non-intervention plan; Galeazzo Ciano promised to study it. The British, however, accepted {{the plan in}} principle immediately. The following day, it was put to Konstantin von Neurath, {{the foreign minister of}} Nazi Germany by André François-Poncet. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed, but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the USSR was present. It was mentioned at the meeting of the French with Neurath that both countries were already supplying the parties in the war, France the Republicans and Germany the Nationalists. A similar approach was made by the French to the Soviet Union. On 6 August, Ciano confirmed Italian support in principle. Despite a Pravda claim that 12,145,000 roubles had already been sent by Russian workers to Spain, the Soviet government similarly agreed in principle, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> Portugal was included, and <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> Germany and Italy stopped aid immediately.|$|E
5|$|Souls {{provide a}} variety of effects, and are {{separated}} into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can only have one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. Bullet souls are Soma Cruz's replacement for Sub Weapons in this game, and enable the player to consume a set amount of magic points to use an ability, often some form of projectile. Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures and summoning familiars. Guardian souls continually drain magic points <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> they are activated. Enchant souls are continuously active <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> they are equipped, and provide increases in statistics or other innate abilities—such {{as the ability to}} walk on water. Ability souls give the player innate abilities, which are often required to traverse certain areas of the castle. Because the souls are automatically activated and stay active unless the player specifically disables them, they do not consume magic points.|$|E
