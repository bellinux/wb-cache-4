5|$|HMS Neptune {{was laid}} down in 1873 for the Brazilian Navy {{under the name of}} Independencia by J & W Dudgeon in Cubitt Town, London. The {{shipyard}} attempted to launch her on 16 July 1874, but <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> fast and did not budge. A second attempt was made on 30 July during which the ship got about one-third down the slipway and stuck, extensively damaging her bottom plating. She was finally launched on 10 September, after she had been lightened, and she was towed to Samuda Brothers for repairs and fitting out. The cost of the accident resulted in the bankruptcy of Dudgeons in 1875.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald's {{extensive}} radio career {{may have}} begun on a 1929 radio broadcast of the Publix Hour. She was on the Academy Awards ceremony broadcast in 1931. She hosted her own radio show, Vicks Open House, from September 1937 to March 1938, for which she received $5,000 a week. However, the time demands of doing a weekly live radio show while filming, touring in concerts, and making records proved enormously difficult, and after fainting on-air during one show, {{she decided not to}} renew her radio contract with Vicks {{at the end of the}} 26-week season. Thereafter, <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> to guest appearances.|$|E

25|$|During the 1860s, Patti {{possessed a}} sweet, high-lying voice of birdlike purity and {{remarkable}} flexibility which was ideal for such parts as Zerlina, Lucia and Amina; but, as Verdi noted in 1878, her lower notes gained fullness and beauty when she grew older, enabling her {{to excel in}} weightier fare. Patti, however, turned into a conservative singer in {{the final phase of}} her operatic and concert career. She knew what suited her aging voice to perfection and <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> to it. Typically, her recital programs during the 1890s featured an array of familiar, often sentimental, not-too-demanding popular tunes of the day, which were sure to appeal to her adoring fans.|$|E
500|$|Then {{the only}} U.S. {{battleship}} in commission, Missouri was proceeding seaward on a training mission from Hampton Roads early on 17 January 1950 {{when she ran}} aground [...] from Thimble Shoal Light, near Old Point Comfort. She hit shoal water a distance of three ship-lengths from the main channel. Lifted some [...] above waterline, <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> hard and fast. With the aid of tugboats, pontoons, and a rising tide, she was refloated on 1 February 1950 and repaired.|$|E
500|$|The article {{begins by}} recounting a 1995 meeting between Preckwinkle and Obama {{in which he}} {{discussed}} a possible run for the Illinois Senate seat then held by Alice Palmer. [...] According to the New Yorker's account, Preckwinkle [...] "soon became an Obama loyalist, and <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> {{with him in a}} State Senate campaign that strained or ruptured many friendships but was ultimately successful." [...] In 1995, she successfully challenged the signatures of Obama's opponents in the Democratic Primary for the Illinois Senate, allowing Obama to run unopposed.|$|E
50|$|A recent legacy made Cassandra Palmer heir to {{the title}} of Pythia, the world's chief clairvoyant.

500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte Gainsbourg as [...] "She": French actress Eva Green was {{initially}} approached {{for the female}} lead. According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the pre-production process. Eventually Gainsbourg turned up, and by Trier's words she was very eager to get cast: [...] "Charlotte came in and said, 'I'm dying to get the part no matter what.' So I {{think it was a}} decision she made very early and <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> to it. We had no problems whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bonham Carter played Bellatrix Lestrange in {{the final}} four Harry Potter films (2007â€“2011). While filming Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, she accidentally {{ruptured}} the eardrum of Matthew Lewis (playing Neville Longbottom) when <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> her wand in his ear. Bonham Carter received positive reviews as Bellatrix, described as a [...] "shining but underused talent". She played Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney Todd's (Johnny Depp) amorous accomplice in the film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Broadway musical, , directed by Tim Burton. Bonham Carter received a nomination for the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her performance. She won the Best Actress award in the 2007 Evening Standard British Film Awards for her performances in Sweeney Todd and Conversations With Other Women, along with another Best Actress award at the 2009 Empire Awards. Bonham Carter also appeared in the fourth Terminator film entitled Terminator Salvation, playing a small but pivotal role.|$|E

And Nual, in her job, takes men to their destinations, but never to where she needs to be. <b>She's</b> <b>stuck</b> there, working to send money home to her family in the rural provinces.|$|R
2500|$|The {{night before}} her execution, Catherine is {{believed}} to have spent many hours practising how to lay her head upon the block, which had been brought to her at her request. She died with relative composure, but looked pale and terrified; she required assistance to climb the scaffold. She made a speech describing her punishment as [...] "worthy and just" [...] and asked for mercy for her family and prayers for her soul. According to popular folklore, her final words were, [...] "I die a Queen, but I would rather have died the wife of Culpeper", however no eyewitness accounts support this. Instead, reporting that <b>she</b> <b>stuck</b> to traditional final words, asking for forgiveness for her sins and acknowledging that she deserved to die 'a thousand deaths' for betraying the king; who had always treated her so graciously. Catherine was beheaded with a single stroke of the executioner's axe.|$|E

5000|$|Mara Jade {{was chosen}} by IGN as the 19th top Star Wars {{character}}. IGN's Jesse Schedeen also listed the character as the top 10th Star Wars hero, noting that she [...] "entered the Expanded Universe early, and <b>she's</b> <b>stuck</b> around for so long because she's just a great character". UGO Networks called the character the seventh top Star Wars Expanded Universe character, calling her complex. In 2006, Zahn called Mara and Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created.|$|R

Club noted, it [...] "finds Maslany trapped in the numbing routines of a modern relationship with a partner (Noah Segan) oblivious to her empty feeling. Soon, weâ€™re cutting to a mysterious facility where Maslany holds sway over obedient followersâ€”but, oddly, these rituals soon start to look just as hollow and meaningless as the ones <b>sheâ€™s</b> <b>stuck</b> with at home." ...|$|R
