5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living. The most noticeable deficit is <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.|$|E
5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory.</b> Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E

25|$|Visual <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> is the {{capacity}} for holding {{a small amount of}} visual information in mind in an active, readily available state {{for a short period of}} time (usually no more than 30 seconds). Although visual <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> is essential for the execution of a wide array of perceptual and cognitive functions, and is supported by an extensive network of brain regions, its storage capacity is severely limited.|$|E

25|$|Among other symptoms, {{post-traumatic}} stress disorder involves anxiety, over-alertness, sleeplessness, chronic fatigue syndrome, motor difficulties, failing <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory,</b> amnesia, nightmares and sleep-paralysis. Flashbacks are characteristic to the disorder: the patient experiences the traumatic event, or pieces of it, again and again. Depression is also characteristic for PTSD-patients and may also occur without accompanying PTSD.|$|E

25|$|Psychogenic amnesia {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of retrograde amnesia (the inability to retrieve stored memories leading up to the onset of amnesia), and an absence of anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new long term memories). Access to episodic memory can be impeded, while the degree of impairment to <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory,</b> semantic memory and procedural memory is thought to vary among cases. If other memory processes are affected, they are usually much less severely affected than retrograde autobiographical memory, which is taken as the hallmark of psychogenic amnesia. However the wide variability of memory impairment among cases of psychogenic amnesia raises questions as to its true neuropsychological criteria, as despite intense study {{of a wide range of}} cases there is little consensus of which memory deficits are specific to psychogenic amnesia.|$|E
25|$|A savant {{syndrome}} {{is described as}} a person with a low IQ but who has superior performance in one particular field. Sloboda, Hermelin and O'Connor (1985) discussed a patient, NP, who was able to memorize very complex musical pieces after hearing them three or four times. NP's performance exceeded that of experts with very high IQs. However, his performance on other memory tasks was average for a person with an IQ in his range. They used NP to suggest that high IQ is not needed for the skill of musical memorization and in fact, other factors must be influencing this performance. Miller (1987) also studied a 7 year old child who was said to be a musical savant. This child had superior <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> for music that was found to be influenced by the attention given to the complexity of the music, the key signature, and repeated configurations within a string. Miller (1987) suggests that a savant's ability is due to encoding the information into already existing meaningful structures in long term memory.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common cause}} of {{psychotic}} symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve {{after a period of}} observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency room, as it is a long term condition. Both acute alcohol intoxication as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions. Acting as a depressant of the central nervous system, the early effects of alcohol are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete anesthesia of the respiratory system. Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual hallucinations, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic alcoholics may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. Antipsychotics are often used to treat these symptoms.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. The recency effect occurs when the {{short-term}} memory is used to remember the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the long-term memory has encoded the earlier items. The recency effect can be eliminated {{if there is a}} period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the holding time of short-term memory (15–30 seconds). This occurs when a person is given subsequent information to recall preceding the recall of the initial information. The primacy effect, however, is not affected by the interference of recall. The elimination of the last few items from memory is due to the displacement of these items from <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory,</b> by the distracting task. As they have not been recited and rehearsed, they are not moved into long-term memory and are thus lost. A task as simple as counting backwards can change memory recall; however an empty delay interval has no effect. This is because the person can continue to rehearse the items in their working memory to be remembered without interference. Cohen (1989) found that there is better recall for an action in the presence of interference if that action is physically performed during the encoding phase. It has also been found that recalling some items can interfere and inhibit the recall of other items. Another stream of thought and evidence suggests that the effects of interference on recency and primacy are relative, determined by the ratio rule (retention interval to inter item presentation distractor rate) and they exhibit time-scale invariance.|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson and Shiffrin's 1968 model {{consists}} of separate components for {{short and long}} term memory storage. It states that <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> is limited by its capacity and duration. Research suggests that musical <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> is stored differently from verbal <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory.</b> Berz (1995) found dissimilar results for the correlation between modality and recency effects in language versus music, suggesting that different encoding processes are engaged. Berz also demonstrated different levels of interference on tasks as a result of language stimulus vs. musical stimulus. Finally Berz provided evidence for a separate store theory through the [...] "Unattended Music Effect", stating [...] "If there was a singular acoustic store, unattended instrumental music would cause the same disruptions on verbal performance as would unattended vocal music or unattended vocal speech; this, however, [...] not the case".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} found by Deutsch that lefthanders with mixed hand {{preference}} [...] outperform righthanders in tests of <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memory</b> for pitch.

40|$|Memory {{is thought}} to be divided into two {{separate}} stores, one <b>short</b> <b>term</b> and one long term. The mechanism behind <b>short</b> <b>term</b> storage is significantly less well understood than that of long term storage and it is the storage of <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>memories</b> that is the focus of this work. A computational approach is taken to exploring a possible mechanism by which they are encoded and stored. This mechanism is comprised of a temporally patterned signal which exists persistently in a pre-existing network that has been stochastically constructed to support such behaviour. It is found that persistence of activity is achievable in a full neuronal model by introducing negative feedback {{in the form of a}} delay period in which a synapse may not fire. In addition, it is found that network cycles which could support storage of temporally patterned signals are achievable in simplified models constructed in analogy to the full model. Finally, some signs that storage may also be present in the full model are observed...|$|R

2500|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to cocaine {{has also been}} linked to decreased cognitive functioning in school aged children, including lower scores in short-term memory assessments. Short-term memory is the memory system responsible for holding information in an easily accessible state {{for a short period}} of time. [...] One particular study examined the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure, among other factors, on cognitive ability in children. In this specific assessment, the Stanford-Binet IV Test, an IQ test, was given to children who were exposed to cocaine in utero (before birth) as well as a control group of children (not exposed to cocaine in utero). [...] Overall, those children who were exposed to cocaine during pregnancy had lower scores on the <b>Short</b> <b>Term</b> <b>Memory</b> scale than unexposed children at all age levels, especially boys. Cocaine exposure also predicted lower IQ scores in general. Exposing prenatal offspring to cocaine can cause irreversible damage and increase developmental risks, especially for boys.|$|E
