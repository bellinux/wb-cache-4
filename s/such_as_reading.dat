5|$|People {{who engage}} in {{intellectual}} activities <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading,</b> playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This {{is compatible with the}} cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. Education delays the onset of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease. Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was not an}} {{especially}} pious king by medieval standards. In England, he provided steady patronage to the monastic houses, but established few new monasteries and was relatively conservative in determining which he did support, favouring those with established links to his family, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Reading</b> Abbey. In this regard Henry's religious tastes {{appear to have been}} influenced by his mother, and indeed before his ascension a number of religious charters were issued in their joint names. Henry did found a number of religious hospitals in England and France. After the death of Becket, Henry built and endowed various monasteries in France, primarily to improve his popular image. Since travel by sea during the period was dangerous, he would also take full confession before setting sail and use auguries to determine the best time to travel. Henry's movements may also have been planned to take advantage of saints' days and other fortuitous occasions.|$|E

25|$|Boys {{and girls}} had {{separate}} classes until about 1870. Boys learned useful {{skills such as}} woodshop, surveying, and bookkeeping, and girls had classes like sewing.

50|$|There is no true {{equivalent}} to the gerundive in English; the closest translation is a passive to-infinitive non-finite clause <b>such</b> <b>as</b> books to be read.

25|$|Ramakrishna's {{father died}} in 1843, after which family {{responsibilities}} fell on his elder brother Ramkumar. This loss drew him closer to his mother, and he spent his time in household activities and daily worship of the household deities and became more involved in contemplative activities <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading</b> the sacred epics. When Ramakrishna was in his teens, the family's financial position worsened. Ramkumar started a Sanskrit school in Calcutta and {{also served as a}} priest. Ramakrishna moved to Calcutta in 1852 with Ramkumar to assist in the priestly work.|$|E
25|$|The World Bank {{considers}} that the curriculum should change from {{its focus on}} a few high levels achievers to education for all. Curriculum content differentiation should start in grades 9 and 10 and undergo further differentiation in grades 11 and 12 to provide alternatives to university. There should be continued expansion and improvement of quality in both primary and secondary education {{to prepare students for}} different career options in the growing economy. This should take priority over expanding university education. Primary and secondary education should be laying the foundation for lifelong learning by promoting metacognitive skills <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading</b> meaningfully, learning how to learn, group learning, real understanding, cognitive restructuring and information retrieval.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include {{the texts of}} prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues {{are more likely to}} incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading</b> from the Torah. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.|$|E

25|$|Apraxia {{of speech}} can be {{diagnosed}} by a speech language pathologist (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech. The oral mechanisms exam involves {{tasks such as}} pursing lips, blowing, licking lips, elevating the tongue, and also involves {{an examination of the}} mouth. A complete exam also involves observation of the patient eating and talking. SLPs do not agree on a specific set of characteristics that make up the apraxia of speech diagnosis, so any of the characteristics from the section above could be used to form a diagnosis. Patients may be asked to perform other daily tasks <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading,</b> writing, and conversing with others. In situations involving brain damage, an MRI brain scan also helps identify damaged areas of the brain.|$|E

In 2003, Osbourne became the host of her own television talk show, The Sharon Osbourne Show, which was syndicated to various US channels and also shown in the UK on Sky One. The show {{was meant to be}} a reflection of her personality and home life – similar to her reality show but with the inclusion of guest interviews and performances. During the episodes, she conducted some of her interviews on a giant bed. However, the ratings were never successful and critics panned her inability to perform the basic tasks required of a talk show host, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading</b> cue cards and conducting interviews. The show was canceled in early 2004 after one season.|$|E
25|$|Psychology {{has much}} to discuss about pseudoscience thinking, {{as it is the}} illusory {{perceptions}} of causality and effectiveness of numerous individuals that needs to be illuminated. Research suggests that illusionary thinking happens in most people when exposed to certain circumstances <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading</b> a book, an advertisement or the testimony of others are the basis of pseudoscience beliefs. It is assumed that illusions are not unusual, and given the right conditions, illusions are able to occur systematically even in normal emotional situations. One of the things pseudoscience believers quibble most about is that academic science usually treats them as fools. Minimizing these illusions in the real world is not simple. To this aim, designing evidence-based educational programs can be effective to help people identify and reduce their own illusions.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s, at {{the height}} of the Chartist movement, there was a general {{tendency}} towards reformism in the United Kingdom. This prompted much new legislation to be passed, such as the Parliamentary Reform Act 1832, the Factory Act 1833, the first instance of a Government grant for education in the same year and the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The Capitalist economic model had created shift patterns which left workers with free time, in contrast to the agrarian model, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers’ free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders. Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading,</b> would promote greater social good.|$|E
25|$|Introverts {{often take}} {{pleasure}} in solitary activities <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading,</b> writing, using computers, hiking and fishing. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, scientist, engineer, composer and inventor are all highly introverted. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though they may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity {{at a time and}} like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents. They are more analytical before speaking. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment.|$|E
25|$|Stimulus control {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} for patients who have conditioned themselves to associate the bed, or sleep in general, with a negative response. As stimulus control therapy involves taking steps to control the sleep environment, it is sometimes referred interchangeably {{with the concept of}} sleep hygiene. Examples of such environmental modifications include using the bed for sleep or sex only, not for activities <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>reading</b> or watching television; waking {{up at the same time}} every morning, including on weekends; going to bed only when sleepy and when there is a high likelihood that sleep will occur; leaving the bed and beginning an activity in another location if sleep does not result in a reasonably brief period of time after getting into bed (commonly ~20 min); reducing the subjective effort and energy expended trying to fall asleep; avoiding exposure to bright light during nighttime hours, and eliminating daytime naps.|$|E
