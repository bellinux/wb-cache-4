5|$|The lakes were {{deliberately}} {{designed so}} that their orientation was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> Capital Hill—the future location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was {{designed so that}} looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly {{at the foot of}} Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.|$|E

5|$|Evancho began a 42-stop tour {{to promote}} the album in August 2012, {{beginning}} in Japan with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The first leg of the tour included concerts in two dozen North American cities through June 2013. Evancho also appeared on television shows on NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox and CNN in late 2012, where she sang songs from the album and was interviewed. A second leg <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> late 2013 to August 2014.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have sometimes been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E

50|$|FAM83H has two known domains. The PLDc_FAM83H (phospholipase like domain) domain <b>stretches</b> <b>from</b> 17-281 on FAM83H. It {{lacks the}} {{functionally}} important histidine, so {{while it may}} share similar structure it most likely lacks PLD activity. The MIP-T3 microtubule binding domain <b>stretches</b> <b>from</b> 909-1176.|$|R
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, the stretch from Ticonderoga to Keeseville (now concurrent with NY9N) was designated solely as Route22. The {{north end of}} NY47 was also located at an intersection with Route22 in Ticonderoga. At Westport, NY22 connected to NY195, an east–west highway leading to Elizabethtown. At the time, Route9N only <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> Elizabethtown to Keeseville. NY9N was extended southward to Lake George , supplanting NY47 and NY195 and becoming concurrent with NY22 between Ticonderoga and Westport.|$|E
5|$|JG 1's {{role was}} to provide air cover over {{a large portion of}} the North Sea coastline. Its {{commander}} was Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher. Their operational area <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> the Netherlands to Southern Norway. On 5 January 1942, Schumacher handed over command to Major Erich von Selle to become commander of the fighter forces for Luftflotte 5 (Jagdfliegerführer Norwegen).|$|E
5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E

5|$|RAF Handforth was a {{large and}} {{important}} storage facility that contributed directly to the war effort. The site <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate Adlington Park in Woodford/Poynton was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew {{the extent of the}} war, mainly due to the large and visible presence of the RAF and could hear the sounds of air-raids on Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{creation}} following the 1930 census, the 12th district had been represented by Democrats. The 12th <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> {{just south of}} Pasadena to the Orange and San Bernardino county lines, encompassing such small towns as Whittier, Pomona and Covina. The area has since been entirely absorbed into the Los Angeles megalopolis, {{but at the time}} it was principally agricultural. The freeway system had barely touched the 12th district; only a small segment of the Pasadena Freeway cut across its northwest corner.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 74, usually {{abbreviated}} as SH-74 or OK-74 (or simply Highway 74) is the numbering of {{two different}} highways maintained by the U.S. state of Oklahoma. These highways were once a single major north–south route, connecting Oklahoma City to more rural parts of the state. The original road <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> SH-7 near Tatums, Oklahoma to SH-11 west of Deer Creek.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{developed}} from Lithuanian Kingdom (King Mindaugas, 1253) which territory started its existence between Nemunas and Neris rivers and {{existed in the}} center of Europe in the 13th–18th centuries and comprised entire territories of contemporary Belarus, Ukraine, partially Poland, Lithuania and Latvia and <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{founders of}} the first city may have been Sumerians or more {{probably}} East Semitic speaking people from Terqa in the north. I. J.

5|$|The system {{formed on}} a cold front that tracked across the Midwest and <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> the {{northern}} Great Lakes to Tennessee. The front was enhanced by a strong jet stream and warm, humid air ahead of it, allowing thunderstorms to develop. A severe thunderstorm watch was issued for the region just west of Evansville as the main threat appeared to be straight-line winds.|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} Rundstedt to Hitler in October 1943 {{regarding}} the weak defences in France {{led to the}} appointment of Rommel to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion-front, which <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Nazi Germany's tangled command structure {{made it difficult for}} Rommel to achieve his task. He was not allowed to give orders to the Organisation Todt, which was commanded by armaments minister Albert Speer, so in some places he had to assign soldiers to do construction work.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have <b>stretched</b> <b>from</b> Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E
