40|$|Growth of Bacteria and Archaea {{has been}} {{observed}} at temperatures up to 95 and 110 °C, respectively. These thermophiles are adapted to environments of high temperature by changes in the membrane lipid composition, higher thermostabilities of the (membrane) proteins, higher turnover rates of the energy transducing enzymes, and/or the (exclusive) use of <b>sodium-ions</b> rather than protons as coupling ion in energy transduction. The proton permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and archaea was observed to increase with the temperature. This increased proton permeability limits the maximum temperature of growth of bacteria. Higher growth temperatures {{can be reached by}} an increased proton pumping activity by using the less permeable sodium ions as coupling ions or by changing the lipid composition of the cytoplasmic membrane. The Na+/H+/glutamate transport proteins of the thermophiles Bacillus stearothermophilus (GltTBs) and Bacillus caldotenax (GltTBc) were studied extensively. These transportproteins have unique features. Transport of L-glutamate occurs in symport with 1 Na+ and 1 H+ when the transport proteins are expressed in their natural environment. The sodium ion dependency of the GltT transporters of these Bacillus strains was found to increase with temperature. However, when the GltT proteins are expressed in the mesophile Escherichia coli, electrogenic symport of L-glutamate occurs with ≥ 2 H+. These observations suggest that the conformation of the transport proteins in the E. coli and the Bacillus membranes differs, and that the conformation influences the coupling ion selectivity. The Na+/H+/glutamate transport proteins of B. stearothermophilus (GltTBs) and B. caldotenax (GltTBc) are homologous to transport systems of glutamate and structurally related compounds from mesophilic organisms. Both sodium, as well as proton coupled transporters, belong to this family of carboxylate transporters (FCT). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of sorption on the biodegradation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (DCP) by Ralstonia eutropha was investigated using organoclays. The {{aim was to}} examine the suitability of organoclays combined with biodegradation in remediation techniques. Two types of organoclays were used: a dodecyltrimethylammonium montmorillonite. where 89 % of the former sodium ions were exchanged by the cationic surfactant (C- 12 -MM), and a dioctadecyldimethylammonium montmorillonite complex (35 % exchange of the <b>sodium-ions)</b> (2 C(18) -MM). The organoclays showed high sorption affinity to DCP resulting in the intercalation of DCP into the interlayers of the organoclay. The sorption processes were reversible and completed within minutes. Neither organoclay was inhibitory to R. eutropha degrading fructose. This was different with DCP as sole energy and carbon source. In the presence of DCP C- 12 -MM led to a decrease in cell numbers caused by a coupled effect of DCP and small amounts of free C- 12 in solution. This was not observed with 2 C(18) -MM, as the concentration of 2 C(18) in solution was lower because of the lesser degree of exchange (35 % compared to 89 %). The addition of 2 C(18) -MM enabled complete biodegradation of DCP in initially toxic DCP concentration ranges. Adsorption lowered the DCP concentration to a non-toxic level. Because the sorption process was reversible, DCP was desorbed when R. eutropha reduced the DCP concentration in the liquid phase by biodegradation. The whole amount of DCP-dissolved and initially adsorbed-was degraded as confirmed by oxygen consumption and cell concentration measurements. Organoclays can be very helpful tools in remediation when the exchanged amount of surfactant remains low. They even allow bioremediation under toxic circumstances, as was shown with 2 C(18) -MM.

Data on the concentration dependence of p-NP-β-d-Glc uptake indicated that two carrier-mediated systems are involved. The uptake via the high-affinity site required an inwardly directed <b>sodium-ion</b> concentration gradient, while the uptake via the low-affinity site proceeded such a gradient. d-Glucose competitively inhibited the initial uptake of p-NP-β-d-Glc via the high-affinity site with a Ki value of 301 μM.
