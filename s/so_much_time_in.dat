500|$|... "The Fight" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{and several}} commentators noted that Ann's new part-time job {{at city hall}} provides a good explanation for why she is always spending time around the parks department despite working at the hospital. The scenes at the Snakehole Lounge were also praised as particularly funny, especially a shot where Ron Swanson dances drunkenly while wearing April's small woman's hat. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode was a good character study {{of the relationship between}} Leslie and Ann, and that the bar scenes [...] "gave the whole episode a chaotic yet welcoming feel, like it was the show's drunken greatest hits". Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she loved the episode and called the Snakehole Lounge scenes a [...] "tour-de-force" [...] that highlighted the comedic skills of the entire cast. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com enjoyed the silliness of the episode, and claimed that the characters are so well-developed and likable that watching the Snakehole Lounge scenes felt like hanging out with real-life friends at a bar. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called it a [...] "stellar" [...] episode that was [...] "loose, silly, rich with details and heart". He praised the fast pace and comedic timing of the jokes, and wrote, [...] "it felt like the director was having as much fun as possible in 'The Fight.'" [...] Scott Meslow of The Atlantic called [...] "The Fight" [...] a very funny episode which offers a [...] "great solution" [...] to why Ann Perkins spends <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> city hall, which he called one of the show's [...] "last nagging questions".|$|E
500|$|Postbellum {{criticism}} of Longstreet {{claims that he}} was ordered by Lee to attack {{in the early morning}} and that his delays were a significant contributor to the loss of the battle. However, Lee agreed to the delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for the attack until 11 a.m. Although Longstreet's motivations have long been clouded by the vitriol of the Lost Cause partisans (see Legacy), many historians agree that Longstreet did not aggressively pursue Lee's orders to launch an attack as early as possible. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert wrote, [...] "Longstreet deserves censure for his performance on the morning of July 2. He allowed his disagreement with Lee's decision to affect his conduct. Once the commanding general determined to assail the enemy, duty required Longstreet to comply with the vigor and thoroughness that had previously characterized his generalship. The concern for detail, the regard for timely information, and the need for preparation were absent." [...] Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote, [...] "Unenthusiastic about the attack, Longstreet consumed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> properly assembling and aligning the corps that the assault did not commence until 4 p.m. During all the time that passed, Meade continued to move in troops to bring about a more and more complete concentration; by 6 p.m. he had achieved numerical superiority and had his left well covered." [...] Campaign historian Edwin Coddington presents a lengthy description of the approach march, which he described as [...] "a comedy of errors such as one might expect of inexperienced commanders and raw militia, but not of Lee's [...] "War Horse" [...] and his veteran troops." [...] He called the episode [...] "a dark moment in Longstreet's career as a general." [...] Gettysburg historian Harry Pfanz concluded that [...] "Longstreet's angry dissidence had resulted in further wasted time and delay." [...] David L. Callihan, in a 2002 reassessment of Longstreet's legacy, wrote, [...] "It is appalling that a field commander of Longstreet's experience and caliber would so cavalierly and ineptly march and prepare his men for battle." ...|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the film}} centers on the {{conflict}} between local officials, the fishing industry, and the Exxon official sent out to oversee the clean-up and take the rap. The filmmakers point out {{that much of the}} aftermath could have been minimized had the officials in charge been better prepared and not spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> involved <b>in</b> useless red-tape and petty bureaucratic bickering.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{well-known}} admirals {{of the day}} visited Brixham. Not only Nelson, but also Lord St. Vincent, Cornwallis, Hood, Rodney and Hawke. There was also Earl Howe, who earned the nickname of Lord Torbay because he spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> ashore <b>in</b> Brixham. A notorious visitor was Napoleon Bonaparte, who, as a prisoner on HMS Bellerophon, spent several days off Brixham waiting {{to be taken to}} exile on St. Helena.|$|R
2500|$|HLFI West Baden unsuccessfully marketed the {{property}} nationally {{for more than}} five years before realizing that casino gaming would be the key to their success. HLFI joined the Cook Group, Boykin Lodging (owner of the French Lick Springs Hotel), and Orange County citizens to lobby the Indiana legislature to allow casino gambling in the area. The coalition members spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Indianapolis lobbying for their cause that they became known as [...] "The Orange Shirts", in reference to the color of their T-shirts bearing the slogan, [...] "Save French Lick and West Baden Springs".|$|E
2500|$|Ikeda has {{mentioned}} that he has great respect for real-life teachers, so he designed the monster ones to contrast that and be more comical. He also introduced Fangfang Huang {{to increase the number}} of male characters and to attract more female readers. He created a male counterpart that looks feminine to increase the comic element. During the development of Season II, he also acknowledged that the series would have a finite ending. He introduced San Otonashi to reflect the feelings and struggles of young people as they ponder their futures and transitioning into the working world. In Season II, Volume 8, he noted that he had to postpone the publishing date because he took <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> drawing it. In Season II, Volume 11, he mentions his favorite manga characters from other series are: Dio (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure), Toguro (Yu Yu Hakusho), Hakumen (Ushio To Tora), and Master Kogan (Shigurui) - the villains who [...] "have an inimitable style and play by their own rules. They're powerful and dark, but there's something melancholy about them too as well...and that's what draws me to them." [...] He hopes his villains (Aqua, Gyokuro, Miyabi, Kiria, and others) would draw readers.|$|E

Blanc wrote in his 1988 biography That's Not All Folks!: [...] " [...] spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> together <b>in</b> studios that I used to refer jokingly to her as the 'other woman' in my life." ...|$|R

In The Outback, she becomes [...] "The Jungle Queen", an all-powerful goddess. She spends <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> dwelling <b>in</b> her Outback that the real world and The Outback gradually become unstable.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s, Hall had a {{house for}} his family built nearby. He {{nevertheless}} spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> working <b>in</b> the office, sometimes sleeping there, {{that he and his}} family grew distant. In 1885 the state insisted he work out of one of its offices; however he continued to {{spend a great deal of}} his time at the 1852 office until he died 13 years later. Its interior, essentially one large room at the time, was lined with charts, specimens and books. Off to one side was his spartan bedroom.|$|R

6000|$|... "This is a noble sight, Mr. Littlepage," [...] Guert remarked, after {{gazing at}} the {{measured}} but quick movement of the flotilla, for some time, in silence--"a truly noble sight, {{and it is a}} reproach to us three for having lost <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the woods, when we ought to have been there, ready to aid in driving the French from the province." ...|$|E

5000|$|Criticisms {{tended to}} fall into two camps. Some, such as Official PlayStation Magazines review, felt that the game dragged too much: [...] "With each chapter I became more {{discouraged}} {{by the lack of}} action and the overwhelming amounts of story thrust upon me... Suikoden III forces you to spend <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> weaving <b>in</b> and out of the different storylines that you barely have time to enjoy any combat." [...] Others were from some fans of the first two Suikodens who felt that Suikoden III had tampered too much with what they enjoyed of the first two games.|$|R
500|$|Rolling Stone {{describes}} Swift as [...] "a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". According to The Village Voice, she uses third-verse {{point of view}} reversals frequently. In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardians words, [...] "she spends <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> kissin' <b>in</b> the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot". Slant Magazine adds, [...] "to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs {{over the course of}} [...] album". Although reviews of Swift's work are [...] "almost uniformly positive", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed [...] "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".|$|R
60|$|It was {{fortunate}} we spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> such discussion; fortunate that Saul differed from me {{as to what}} we had best do, for while we lay there disputing we heard a crashing of the underbrush where the growth was thick, {{and a moment later}} little Frenchie, looking heated and so nearly breathless that for a full minute he could not speak so we might understand, came into view.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O no! I should lose <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> {{going to}} and fro, and besides I {{like to be}} among the people.

60|$|It {{could not}} be because these gentlemen {{did not know the}} {{arguments}} and see the necessity. Mr. Crewe had had them to dinner, and had spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their company presenting his case--to which they absolutely agreed--that they took to a forced seclusion. The member from Leith also wrote letters and telegrams, and sent long typewritten arguments and documents to Mr. Flint. Mr. Crewe, although far from discouraged, began to think there was something mysterious about all this seemingly unnecessary deliberation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; {{if that is}} {{what your}} {{business}} and feeling prompt.
