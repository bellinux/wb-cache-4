40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the perceived and expected roles and responsibilities of paraeducators in a moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> classroom. This study involved collection of data through a survey that targeted individuals working in the moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> classroom in a high school setting in an urban setting. A total number of 15 participants were chosen to participate in the study. The participants were staff members working in the moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> classrooms. The participants voluntarily completed a needs assessment survey that was created to determine the perceived and expected roles and responsibilities of paraeducators in a moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> classroom. The results of the needs assessment and information from diverse literature were used to create a handbook addressing roles and responsibilities of paraeducators in a moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> classroom. This handbook is anticipated to be a special tool that would be helpful to educators in a moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> classroom...|$|R

40|$|<b>Severe</b> <b>disability</b> is an {{important}} predictor of nursing home admissions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the role of <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> pacing on risk of short- and long-term nursing home stays. Respondents who devel-oped <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> were assigned into one of two pacing trajectories: catastrophic or progressive disability. The author analyzed seven waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study and created a series of discrete-time event history models. The analysis showed that the risk associated with <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> and nursing home stays varied based on severe dis-ability pacing. Progressive and catastrophic disability were associated with increased risk of short- and long-term stays; however, the risk of nursing home stays was much greater for respondents with catastrophic disability for short- and long-term stays. The findings have implications for policy and research. The author suggests that future research focus on interventions aimed at slowing the pace of <b>severe</b> <b>disability...</b>|$|R

25|$|Absorbent {{underwear}}: Absorbent underwear or diapers {{can reduce}} embarrassment for bedwetters and make cleanup easier for caregivers. These products {{are known as}} training pants or diapers when used for younger children, and as absorbent underwear or incontinence briefs when marketed for older children and adults. Some brands of diaper are marketed especially for people with bedwetting. A major benefit is the reduced stress on both the bedwetter and caregivers. Absorbent underwear can be especially beneficial for bedwetting children wishing to attend sleepovers or campouts, reducing emotional problems caused by social isolation and/or embarrassment in front of peers. Extended diaper usage may interfere with learning to stay dry at night, at least in adults with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the most {{relevant}} determinants of <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> in a heterogeneous sample of patients with neurological conditions.

We calculated count-based extension indexes to address <b>severe</b> <b>disability,</b> and hierarchical logistic regression to assess the association between <b>severe</b> <b>disability,</b> sociodemographic and health status information. Results show that sociodemographic variables played a minor role, while health state information was a stronger determinant of <b>severe</b> <b>disability.</b> Compared to the reference value of TBI patients, those with MG, PD and epilepsy had higher odds to have severe difficulties undertaking daily activities despite the presence of environmental factors.

25|$|In the United States, {{low profit}} margins and an {{increase}} in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s. In 1982, the television documentary DPT: Vaccine Roulette depicted the lives of children whose <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities</b> were incorrectly blamed on the DPT vaccine by reporter Lea Thompson. The ensuing negative publicity led to many lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. By 1985, vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining liability insurance. The price of DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading providers to curtail purchases, limiting availability. Only one manufacturer remained in the US by the end of 1985. To correct the situation, Congress in 1986 passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which established a federal no-fault system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines. The majority of claims that have been filed through the NCVIA have been related to injuries allegedly caused by the whole-cell DPT vaccine.|$|E

In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Education budgeted $98 million for tuition of children in approved private schools and $36.8 million for students attending the charter schools for the deaf and blind.

[...] There was an intellectual disability class called Class J, and a Class H for people with <b>severe</b> <b>disabilities.</b> BSNW classification events included swimming races from 50 to 1500 metres. [...] The system was later expanded to include nine classes before it was discontinued. The BSNW system did not gain international support, and only was used inside Germany.

She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic equestrian medal. Two days after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she performed to music with Nothing To Lose.

50|$|Generally, {{people with}} {{disability}} who were employed {{were more likely}} than people without disability to work part-time (38% and 31% respectively).

Among the five disability groups, psychological and intellectual disabilities have greater association with fewer working hours. More than a third (35%) of people with psychological disability who worked, usually worked no more than 15 hours, followed by people with intellectual disability (30%).

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} selective head cooling with mild systemic hypothermia in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborn infants. Study design Infants with HIE {{were randomly assigned to}} the selective head cooling or control group. Selective head cooling was initiated within 6 hours after birth to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 34 degrees +/- 0. 2 degrees C and rectal temperature of 34. 5 degrees to 35. 0 degrees C for 72 hours. Rectal temperature was maintained at 36. 0 degrees to 37. 5 degrees C in the control group. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 18 months of age. The primary outcome was a combined end point of death and <b>severe</b> <b>disability.</b> Results One hundred ninety-four infants were available for analysis (100 and 94 infants in the selective head cooling and control group, respectively). For the selective head cooling and control groups, respectively, the combined outcome of death and <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> was 31 % and 49 % (OR: 0. 47; 95 % CI: 0. 26 - 0. 84; P =. 01), the mortality rate was 20 % and 29 % (OR: 0. 62; 95 % CI: 0. 32 - 1. 20; P =. 16), and the <b>severe</b> <b>disability</b> rate was 14 % (11 / 80) and 28 % (19 / 67) (OR: 0. 40; 95 % CI: 0. 17 - 0. 92; P =. 01).
