5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the <b>Skyhook,</b> {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships. <b>Skyhook</b> would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that <b>Skyhook</b> {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{received for}} modification as Combat Talons were assigned in July 1965 to the 464th Troop Carrier Wing at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina. Because {{of a lack}} of ramp space caused by the buildup of forces for deployment to South Vietnam, they were temporarily housed at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee. The wing's 779th TCS was designated as the training squadron for the modified C-130E(I)s, under Project <b>Skyhook,</b> in addition to its normal airlift function. Selected crew members received instructor training in their respective systems and returned to Pope by May 1 to begin crew training of six crews for deployment to Vietnam under Project Stray Goose.|$|E

500|$|An elite athlete, Federer is an all-court, {{all-around}} player {{known for}} his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, {{being one of the}} best volleyers in the game. He has a powerful, accurate smash and very effectively performs rare elements playing tennis, such as backhand smash and <b>skyhook,</b> half-volley and jump smash (slam dunk). David Foster Wallace compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of [...] "a great liquid whip", while John McEnroe has referred to Federer's forehand as [...] "the greatest shot in our sport." [...] Federer is also {{known for his}} efficient movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand and instead hit a powerful inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} its secrecy, many of the project's {{balloons}} carried instruments for open scientific research. [...] For example, from January 20, 1953, [...] until February 4, 1953, with Winzen Research, Inc, the project launched 13 flights at Pyote Air Force Base in Texas. [...] Several of these carried packages for cosmic ray research, {{one of which was}} designated as [...] "ballast". [...] These were <b>Skyhook</b> flights, which is the generic term used by the Office of Naval Research to designate balloon flights whose primary objectives were scientific, rather than military. [...] Some milestones of more than 1500 <b>Skyhook</b> flights are: the first <b>Skyhook</b> launch (1947), the first shipboard launch (1949), the Rockoon program (1952), the tetroon record flight of September 1956, Stratoscope (1957 - 1971), and <b>Skyhook</b> Churchill (1959 - 1976).|$|E

2500|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{was well}} known for his {{trademark}} [...] "skyhook", a hook shot in which he bent his entire body (rather than just the arm) like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height——the <b>skyhook</b> was difficult for a defender to block without goaltending. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the <b>skyhook</b> with either hand, which made him {{even more difficult to}} defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the <b>skyhook</b> with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was [...] "the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed back in my face".|$|E
2500|$|MEO Skyhook: As {{part of an}} AFRL study, Roger Lenard {{proposed}} a MEO <b>Skyhook.</b> [...] It appears that a gravity gradient-stabilized tether with its center of mass in MEO can be constructed of available materials. [...] The bottom of the <b>skyhook</b> {{is close to the}} atmosphere in a [...] "non-keplerian orbit". [...] A re-usable rocket can launch to match altitude and speed with the bottom of the tether which is in a non-keplerian orbit (travelling much slower than typical orbital speed). [...] The payload is transferred and it climbs the cable. [...] The cable itself is kept from de-orbiting via electric propusion and/or electromagnetic effects.|$|E
