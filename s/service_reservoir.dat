5|$|The entire Lam Tin area {{is served}} by both tap water and {{flushing}} sea water supplies. The tap water is piped either from surface water or Dongjiang River into two service reservoirs and then pumped to individual households. The two service reservoirs that serve Lam Tin are Lam Tin Low Level Fresh Water <b>Service</b> <b>Reservoir</b> and Lam Tin High Level <b>Service</b> <b>Reservoir.</b> Built together with Lam Tin Estate, the low level reservoir {{is covered with a}} concrete-surfaced football field. The reservoir is now located between Kai Tin Estate and Tak Tin Estate. The high level reservoir, on the other hand, is farther away from residential estates. It is located near Lam Tin Park, on the slope of Black Hill.|$|E
25|$|Up to 1837 Wakefield {{relied on}} wells and springs for its water supply; {{water from the}} River Calder was polluted, and various water supply schemes were {{unsuccessful}} until reservoirs on the Rishworth Moors and a <b>service</b> <b>reservoir</b> at Ardsley were built providing clean water from 1888.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1888, {{the firm}} of [...] "J Monier constructeur" [...] was {{declared}} bankrupt, and in April 1889 went into liquidation. However, in 1890 he formed a new firm: [...] "L'Entreprise générale de travaux en ciment J Monier". In 1891 came yet another application for a patent: for conduits for telephone and electricity cables. About this time Monier built his last-known project, a <b>service</b> <b>reservoir</b> for an Old People's Home at Clamart, donated by Marie de Ferrari, duchesse de Galliera (global coordinates 48.79756, 2.261623). The reservoir structure is 10 metres high and 8 metres in diameter. The floor of the tank is 8cm thick, and the roof 5cm thick. The exterior decoration was designed by architect Prosper Bobin in a neo-classical style. The reservoir is still extant (2010). [...] After this, it seems that Joseph was at least semi-retired, living with his three elderly sisters and his second wife.|$|E
50|$|<b>Service</b> <b>reservoirs</b> perform several functions, {{including}} ensuring sufficient head {{of water}} in the water distribution system and providing water capacity to even out peak demand from consumers, enabling the treatment plant to run at optimum efficiency. Large <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs</b> can also be managed to reduce the cost of pumping, by refilling the reservoir at times of day when energy costs are low.|$|R

2500|$|Haden Carr {{reservoir}} {{was completed}} in 1899, together with a [...] pipeline (the Nidd Aqueduct) to deliver the water to Chellow Heights <b>service</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{on the outskirts of}} Bradford. The route included over [...] of tunnels. Gouthwaite reservoir was built concurrently by a different contractor, between 1893 and 1901. The Corporation next turned their attention to Angram, but the level of activity in the valley had attracted outside interest, and Power & Traction Ltd of London applied for a Light Railway Order to construct a line from the terminus of the Nidd Valley Railway at Pateley Bridge to Lofthouse. The board of Power & Traction included Thomas Greenwood of Greenwood and Batley, which made electric vehicles and equipment for electric tramways. Following a hearing at Harrogate on 9 October 1900, the Light Railway Commissioners awarded an order to Power & Traction for a [...] gauge railway. Bradford Corporation initially agreed to invest £2,000, by buying shares in the light railway, but following meetings between them, the newly formed Nidd Valley Light Railway Company, Power & Traction, and Henry Jackson the nominated contractor, the Company decided not to proceed with the project, and Bradford withdrew their offer to buy shares.|$|E

50|$|The Murnane <b>Service</b> <b>Reservoir,</b> {{named after}} him, is a <b>service</b> <b>{{reservoir}}</b> {{located near the}} Bukit Timah Expressway and the Pan Island Expressway in Singapore. Built {{at a cost of}} $5.5 million, the reservoir supplements and provides backup water supply for the western regions of Singapore. The first section, with storage capacity of 16 million gallons, was opened in 1956 by the Singapore Governor Sir Robert Black. At the time, it was 'believed to be the largest covered <b>service</b> <b>reservoir</b> in the world', with eventual capacity of 56 million gallons of water.|$|E

50|$|<b>Service</b> <b>reservoirs</b> store fully treated {{potable water}} {{close to the}} point of distribution. Many <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are {{constructed}} as water towers, often as elevated structures on concrete pillars where the landscape is relatively flat. Other <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs</b> can be almost entirely underground, especially in more hilly or mountainous country. In the United Kingdom, Thames Water has many underground reservoirs, sometimes also called cisterns, built in the 1800s, most of which are lined with brick. A good example is the Honor Oak Reservoir in London, constructed between 1901 and 1909. When it was completed it was said to be the largest brick built underground reservoir in the world and it {{is still one of the}} largest in Europe. This reservoir now forms part of the southern extension of the Thames Water Ring Main. The top of the reservoir has been grassed over and is now used by the Aquarius Golf Club.|$|R

50|$|Everard also {{specialised}} {{in water}} supply projects. He helped initiate the Derwent Valley scheme supplying water to Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Derby, {{taking responsibility for}} the Leicester section of the scheme from Sawley to Hallgates, which included an aqueduct across the River Trent and two covered <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs</b> each holding two million gallons of water. His work also included buildings at Swithland Reservoir, completed in 1896.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the city}} {{residents}} rely on borewells for water. For the growing usage by the city residents, the Public Health Department and the municipality took initiate for a water project, which includes, {{the construction of a}} head water works reservoir at VSR and NVR College compound, six other overhead <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and a filtration plant. These are supplied with the Krishna river water from Prakasam Barrage at Sitanagaram.|$|R

50|$|The low-lying, {{rectangular}} and gable-roofed structures {{behind the}} Old Windmill Tower conceal Brisbane's first inground <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The earlier smaller structure {{has a single}} gable roof, while the larger, later one is double-gabled. Excavated deep into {{the crest of the}} hill, the disused reservoirs comprise two box-form structures divided into compartments by high arched baffle walls, cast-iron inlet and outlet, valve chambers and pits, and main, outlet and scour pipes. Built of brick before the age of concrete, this type of construction was necessary to withstand external pressure, while the inside walls were rendered to obviate ground water infiltration. The corrugated iron roofs with ample ventilation right along the raised ridges, timber-louvered gables and doorways to descending iron ladders were added later, and evidently painted in contrasting coloured stripes as was the fashion. The <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> which were built to store water from the Enoggera Dam and improve pressure within the city, played a most important role in Brisbane's first reticulated gravity supply system for the best part of a century.|$|R
50|$|The {{water in}} the supply network is {{maintained}} at positive pressure to ensure that water reaches {{all parts of the}} network, that a sufficient flow is available at every take-off point and to ensure that untreated {{water in the}} ground cannot enter the network. The water is typically pressurised by pumps that pump water into storage tanks constructed at the highest local point in the network. One network may have several such <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of Aeromonas spp. from the unchlorinated water supply for a Western Australian city of 21, 000 people was monitored at several sampling points {{during a period}} of 1 year. Membrane filtration techniques were used to count colonies of Aeromonas spp., coliforms, and Escherichia coli in water sampled before entry to <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> during storage in <b>service</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> and in distribution systems. Aeromonas spp. were identified by subculture on blood agar with ampicillin, oxidase tests, and the use of Kaper medium and then were tested for production of enterotoxins and hemolysins. During the same period, two-thirds of all fecal specimens sent for microbiological examination were cultured on ampicillin-blood agar for Aeromonas spp. Recovery of Aeromonas spp. from water supplies at distribution points correlated with fecal isolations and continued during autumn and winter. Coliforms and E. coli were found most commonly in late summer to autumn. This pattern differs from the summer peak of Aeromonas isolations both from water and from patients with Aeromonas spp. -associated gastroenteritis in Perth, Western Australia, a city with a chlorinated domestic water supply. Of the Aeromonas strains from water, 61 % were enterotoxigenic, and 64 % produced hemolysins...|$|R
