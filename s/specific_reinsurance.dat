The assessment {{reveals that}} insurance supervision in Italy occurs within a legal framework that incorporates the relevant European Union Directives. More {{than two-thirds of}} the principles have been assessed as being observed or largely observed. Furthermore, the authorities in Italy are actively pursuing a number of legislative and supervisory initiatives that hold the potential to materially improve the level of observance in the near future.

S. health care survey, to {{simulate}} the impact of reinsurance on insured health care expenditures for different cohorts.
