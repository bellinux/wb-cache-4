40|$|Two Devonian red {{carbonate}} rock sections are {{studied in}} the Montagne Noire, at Coumiac (Frasnian/Famennian) and at the Pic de Vissou (Eifelian/Givetian). The sediments are grey-red mudstones and wackestones rich in pelagic fossils. They are characteristic of an outer ramp. The Coumiac sequence is condensed with numerous hardgrounds and hiatuses. The Pic de Vissou succession is more complete and shallower origin. In both cases, {{the origin of the}} red coloration of the micritic matrix is probably linked to bacterial activity which produced submicronic hematite. Both iron and manganese concentrations are low (average 0. 2 %). Bacteria from ferruginous microstromatolites, blisters, microtufts, 'hedgehogs' filling sponge perforations and thin continuous mineralized films (probably biofilms). Hardgrounds are underlined by ferruginous microstromatolites. The origin of the matrix color is probably related to the destruction of these bacterial constructions, the submicronic hematite ultimately coating the crystal faces of the calcite mosaic. During early lithification, microfissures appeared and were invaded by microbial colonies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that these colonies are composed of spheroidal beads. This suggests continuity of the bacterial activity during early diagenesis. Later on, these early fissures were cut by burrows. Subsequently a <b>secondary</b> <b>fissure</b> network transected all the previously mentioned sedimentary structures. This late fissure network is characterized by diagenetically remobilized hematite and/or calcite. The latest alterations are stylolites and ultimate tectonic fractures.

40|$|The {{brain is}} {{particularly}} sensitive to folate metabolic disturbances, because methyl groups {{are critical for}} brain functions. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different dietary levels of folic acid (FA) on postnatal cerebellar morphology, including the architecture and organisation of the various layers. A total of forty male OFA rats (a Sprague–Dawley strain), 5 weeks old, were classified into the following four dietary groups: FA deficient (0 mg/kg FA); FA supplemented (8 mg/kg FA); FA supra-supplemented (40 mg/kg FA); and control (2 mg/kg FA) (all n 10 per group). Rats were fed ad libitum for 30 d. The cerebellum was quickly removed and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Slides were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (to label Bergmann glia), calbindin (to label Purkinje cells) and NeuN (to label post-mitotic neurons). Microscopic analysis revealed two types of defect: partial disappearance of fissures and/or neuronal ectopia, primarily in supra-supplemented animals (incidence of 80 %, P≤ 0 · 01), but also in deficient and supplemented groups (incidence of 40 %, P≤ 0 · 05), compared with control animals. The primary fissure was predominantly affected, sometimes accompanied by defects in the <b>secondary</b> <b>fissure.</b> Our findings show that growing rats fed an FA-modified diet, including both deficient and supplemented diets, have {{an increased risk of}} disturbances in cerebellar corticogenesis. Defects caused by these diets may have functional consequences in later life. The present study is the first to demonstrate that cerebellar morphological defects can arise from deficient, as well as high, FA levels in the diet...|$|E
40|$|Zipro 1 a {{zinc finger}} transcnption factor {{that has a}} {{restricted}} pattern of expression in several tissues. The main cells expressing Ziprol are proliferating cells from epidermal lineages. This includes the cerebellar granule cells (GCs), nasal epithelia and dermal papilla. Through gene dosage experiments we have shown that Ziprol is involved in proliferation GCs, Hair follicles and the Cranio-facial process. Overexpression of Ziprol results {{an increase in the}} number of G C s, this increase in G C s directly regulates the appearance of <b>secondary</b> <b>fissure</b> in the cerebellum. Overexpression also results in follicular dysplasia caused by an increase in cells within dermal papilla. Ziprol null mutants show a restricted phenotype of decreases in proliferation in the cranio-facial process. To understand h o w Ziprol effects these changes it is necessary to know which genes Ziprol regulates. Using gene arrays we have found a gene, which is regulated by Ziprol this gene, is the Ski oncogene. The regulation can be seen in the Ziprol 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7, which show deficits in Ski expression in the cranio-facial process. This coupled with database searches of genomic sequences using the consensus Ziprol binding site (ZBS) has shown us Ski promotor region contains 2 such sites. Using a transciption assay utilizing a Secreated Alkaline Phosphotase (pSEAP sytem from Clontech) it was shown that transciption from the Ski promotor is dependant on the presence of Ziprol. Also transcription from this promotor under the control of Ziprol is highly context dependant In M C F 7 (human breast cancer) under in Fetal Calf serum the Ski promoter is activated, in N I H 3 T 3 cells the Ski promoter cannot be activated by Ziprol. Deletion of the 2 Z B S abolishes transcnption. The reason for the specificity has been shown to be the presence of SDF-lalpha in the Fetal Bovine Media this serum factor is downregulated in adulthood. SDF-lalpha modulates Ziprol activity through a phosphorylation dependant modulation of SUMOlaytion. This study has shown a role for Ziprol acts as a rheostat that is available to adjust the numbers of cells in highly proliferative populations...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallurgical coke for blast furnace and foundry use, and for some domestic boiler cokes are produced by carbonising coals in slot-type ovens. The coal is heated by heat transferred from the hot oven walls (usually 1250 °C) so that a temperature gradient is set up within the oven charge. A layer of plastic coal is formed (350 - 500 °C) which moves progressively towards the oven centre as carbonisation proceeds. Immediately after re-solidification, and again near 700 °C, the semi-coke suffers shrinkage as the carbon structure reorganises The post re-solidification shrinkage is the more severe and results in large, horizontal and vertical primary fissures being formed which allow breakage of the charge into lumps as it is pushed from the oven. A large central fissure, formed when the two plastic layers meet, divides the charge into two. Further breakage occurs at primary fissures on handling the coke after pushing. Smaller <b>secondary</b> <b>fissures</b> present in the resultant coke lump {{are believed to be}} a result of the shrinkage near 700 °C. Coke has three roles in the blast furnace: as a source of heat, a source of reducing agents and as a support for the burden. The latter function is particularly important {{at the bottom of the}} stack when coke is the only solid material present. The blast furnace output is dependent on the quantity of air that can be pushed up the stack. This depends on the permeability of the coke bed in the lower reaches of the stack. To maintain permeability, the coke should not suffer size degradation as it progresses down the stack; a mixture of large and small coke particles is disastrous. Thus coke quality tends to be assessed in terms of resistance to size degradation in a drum test. Size degradation occurs as a result of volumetric breakage at fissures and abrasion of surfaces. Brittle fracture theory suggests that volumetric breakage should occur as a result of the propagation of <b>secondary</b> <b>fissures</b> in coke lumps [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Cranial sonographic {{examinations}} of 199 neonates were evaluated (1) {{to determine the}} incidence of an echogenic paHern in the occipital lobe that simulated a mass, (2) to relate that finding to the birth weight, and (3) to correlate it with the gyral development of the occipital lobe. This echogenic paHern was seen in infants weighing less than 1750 g at birth and was identified {{on both sides of}} the midline on the most medial paramedian sagiHal sonogram scans of the head. This pseudomass was found to be due to close approximation of a large occipital horn and calcarine fissure joining other adjacent <b>secondary</b> <b>fissures.</b> The multiple fissures formed an echogenic star, and the proximity of the occipital horn and premature brain tissue texture contributed to the relatively hypoechoic background of the pseudomass. The pseudomass is limited superiorly by the parietooccipital fissure and inferiorly by the tentorium. This sonographic paHern should be recognized as a normal variant. A characteristic echogenic pattern superimposed over a hypoechoic background is often seen in the occipital lobes of newborns on cranial sonography. This pattern may be seen {{on both sides of the}} midline and can appear prominent enough t...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{view of the}} {{relatively}} recent introduction of the chinchilla as an experimental model in human neurological research, there rises {{a need for a}} precise knowledge of the anatomy and structure of the different segments composing this species’ encephalon. Our study aimed to enrich the current data pool, by providing a macroscopical and histogical description of the chinchilla's cerebellum. 10 samples were harvested from commercially slaughtered young adults of both sexes. 5 samples were macroscopically examined and 5 samples were serially cut and stained (both Hematoxylin-Eosin and a modified Luxol-Cresyl protocol). The external features and the structure of the cerebellum were assessed and compared to literature data on other similar species (such as the rat and the rabbit). The macroscopic examination revealed that the chinchilla's cerebellum is well developed in size (average width of 2 cm) relative {{to the size of the}} encephalon (average width of 2. 4 cm). The cerebellar hemispheres are globulous, with a prominent paraflocculus and the vermis is very thick. The ratio between these segments resembles that of the rabbit's. Histological samples revealed that the cerebellar cortex presents the main layers common for cerebellar cytoarchitectonics. The segmentation of the vermis is similar to that o the rat, but there are variations in lobular size, lobular orientation and placement of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>fissures.</b> Our results indicate that, although the structure of the chinchilla's cerebellum generally complies to rodent literature descriptions, experiments demanding stereotaxic location of lobules and foliae cannot completely rely on the existing neuroanatomic maps of other species (such as the rat), benefiting from the present description...|$|R

Therefore, PCD is considered a different phenotype by the Montreal Classification, in which it appears as a differentiated subclassification [5]. It is possible that these lesions result from the deepening of distal rectal ulcers or <b>fissures</b> <b>secondary</b> to the forces exerted during defecation. It also seems clear that microbiological, immune, and genetic factors are involved in the aetiology of perianal fistulas [6].|$|R

50|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. The rocks of the Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest found in England; the geology {{is responsible for the}} quality of Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high <b>secondary</b> permeability via <b>fissures.</b> Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 L per minute to over 350 L per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|R
40|$|Analisamos retrospectivamente 11 pacientes submetidos à técnica do transporte ósseo de Ilizarov, todos portadores de falha óssea diafisária secundária a ressecção de segmentos ósseos infectados, 5 localizadas no fêmur e 6 na tíbia. No grupo de pacientes com lesão femoral a falha óssea variou de 7 cm a 12 cm, em dois destes pacientes havia encurtamento do membro de 2 cm. No grupo com lesão tibial a falha óssea variou de 2, 5 cm a 10 cm, com encurtamento do membro em dois pacientes de 1, 5 cm e 2 cm respectivamente. O tempo médio de seguimento desde o final do tratamento até essa avaliação foi de 49 mêses para os pacientes portadores de lesão femoral e de 28, 3 meses para os pacientes portadores de lesão tibial. O transporte femoral foi do tipo bifocal, o transporte tibial foi bifocal em 4 pacientes e trifocal em 2 pacientes. Em todos nossos pacientes ocorreu formação do regenerado. A consolidação do foco alvo foi naturalmente obtida em 7 pacientes, um paciente necessitou enxertia óssea para obtenção da consolidação deste foco. Em 3 pacientes a não união do foco alvo fez com que fosse modificado o método de tratamento, com a retirada do fixador {{circular}} externo. Em todos os pacientes ocorreu infecção no trajeto dos fios. Houve quebra dos fios de toda montagem feita na coxa. Todos fios perderam a tensão que inicialmente lhes foram imposta. Dois pacientes submetidos ao transporte femoral evoluíram com artrite séptica do joelho. A mobilidade do joelho foi severamente comprometida nos pacientes que realizaram o transporte femoral, o mesmo ocorrendo em relação ao tornozelo dos pacientes submetidos ao transporte tibial. Todos os pacientes com lesão na tíbia terminaram o tratamento com encurtamento do membro, o mesmo ocorrendo em 2 pacientes tratados devido a lesão femoral. Durante o tratamento nenhum paciente sentiu-se confortável e todos necessitaram de suporte para conseguir apoio parcial do membro. Todos pacientes ficaram satisfeitos com o resultado do tratamento. Concluímos que a resposta biológica ao transporte ósseo é formidável, com a formação do regenerado reparando grandes falhas ósseas. Entretanto, consideramos que o aparelho circular externo preconizado por Ilizarov traz consigo diversas complicações principalmente relacionadas a presença dos fios transfixantes, causando sofrimento para os pacientes, principalmente quando instalados no fêmur. Eleven patients carrying diaphyseal bone <b>fissure</b> <b>secondary</b> to ressection {{of infected}} bone segments, 5 in the femur and 6 in the tibia, {{submitted to the}} Ilizarov bone transport technique were retrospectively analyzed. In the group of patients with femoral lesion the bone fissure varied from 7 cm to 12 cm, and in two there was a 2 cm shortening of the limb. In the group with tibial lesion the bone fissure varied from 2. 5 cm to 10 cm, with limb shortening in two patients, respectively 1. 5 cm and 2 cm. The mean follow-up period {{since the end of}} the treatment until evaluation was 49 months for the femoral lesion patients and 28. 3 months for the tibial lesion patients. The femoral transports were bifocal and the tibial transports were bifocal in 4 patients and trifocal in 2. In all, patients formation of regenerate occurred. Consolidation of the target focus was naturally obtained in 7 patients; one patient needed bone grafting to obtain the focus consolidation. In three patients the nonunion of the target focus demanded modification of the treatment method with the external circular fixator withdrawal. In all the patients infection adjacent to the wires was observed. There was rupture of the wires in all assemblies made in the thigh. All the wires lost the tension initially imposed to them. Two patients submitted to femoral transport evolved with septic arthritis of the knee. Mobility of the knee was severely impaired in the patients submitted to femoral transport, and the same was observed in relation to the ankle of patients submitted to tibial transport. All the patients with tibial lesions finished treatment with limb shortening, as well as 2 patients treated due to femoral lesion. During treatment none of the patients felt comfortable and all needed help to achieve partial support of the limb. All the patients were satisfied with the result. We concluded that the biological response to bone transport is remarkable, with the regenerate formation repairing big bone fissures. However, we consider that the external circular device recommended by Ilizarov causes several complications mainly related to presence of transfixing wires, causing suffering to the patients mainly when installed in the femur...|$|R
