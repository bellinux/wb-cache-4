5000|$|The Commissioner {{attributed}} {{that there}} are still large numbers of non-citizens, particularly with regard to children, to [...] "lack of commitment" [...] on the part of <b>Latvian</b> <b>authorities,</b> whose response was that Latvia is materially committed to the rights of its minorities, and that from a practical standpoint there is little additional benefit and motivation to become a citizen versus remaining a non-citizen.|$|R

50|$|March 16 {{events have}} been quite confrontational in recent years, with Latvian {{nationalist}} organizations (such as All For Latvia! and National Power Unity) marching {{in support of the}} Latvian Legion, and predominantly-Russian organizations (For Human Rights in United Latvia) holding protests and attempting to block the marches. Due to a particularly harsh controversy around the official commemoration of the Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires in 1998, the Latvian officials refrain from its official honoring. Currently, the official position of <b>Latvian</b> <b>authorities</b> is that the Day is a primarily private business of the veterans and their relatives.|$|R

50|$|Falling budget {{revenues}} have significantly limited Latvia's ability to co-finance any EU projects.

Internet access is not viewed by <b>Latvian</b> <b>authorities</b> as a significant problem; therefore, an increase in funding to communication infrastructure projects is unlikely. Furthermore, Latvia has decided to divert the funds the European Commission allocated to expansion of broadband networks, as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan, to projects in the dairy sector.|$|R

50|$|Having {{completed}} his studies, Buchardt returned to Riga, where {{he tried to}} organize a national German-Baltic movement {{under the leadership of}} Erhard Kroeger. Buchardt funded and contributed to the pro-Nazi newspaper Rigaschen Rundschau, which was closed by the <b>Latvian</b> <b>authorities</b> in May 1934 because it had too many connections with Nazi Germany. This plunged Buchardt into financial difficulties, so he became a lawyer for a marketing company in Germany, and then the economics head of the Baltic Institute. While working at the University of Königsberg, he met Dr. Franz Six, the future leader of Vorkommando Moskau. On Six's advice, Buchardt was recruited by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, the SS intelligence service), working under Six's command. He studied the topography and economy of the Soviet Union, and the distribution of Jews who lived there. By the late 1930s, he held a prestigious position at the Wannsee Institut, the German center for studies of the Soviet Union.|$|R
40|$|In 1996 Latvia {{became one}} of the first {{countries}} in the world to adopt the notional defined-contribution (NDC) pension system. The authors have been studying the distribution of old-age pension benefits in Latvia and its dynamics over recent years. They conclude that the Latvian pension formula practically lacks any redistribution mechanism, pension benefits do not have any upper limits, and the minimum level is set as inadequately low. Pure NDC systems are not adequate for countries with a relatively large gap between the rich and the poor (as is the case of Latvia); material stratification is not evened out in old age, and combined with low replacement rates it leads to massive poverty among the elderly. <b>Latvian</b> <b>authorities</b> have recently recognized the need for NDC pension system improvement, and elaboration of the basic pension concept in Latvia should start in 2015. The authors provide a brief comparison with the situation in neighbouring Estonia, where the distribution of pension benefits is much more even. </p...|$|R

Latvia prefers having many citizens with full rights to having many non-citizens with many rights, at the same time acknowledging that any restrictions must have strong justification and shall be in accordance with international standards. Furthermore, there are no international standards on voting rights to non-citizens and at present it is not a widely accepted practice among the CoE Member States.
