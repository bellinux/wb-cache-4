40|$|First paragraph: The Scottish Executive is {{determined}} to reform the way local government works. Government is keen to ensure that local councils and the <b>statutory</b> <b>public</b> <b>bodies</b> they work with better co-ordinate their activities. This is popularly articulated by Government through its {{use of the term}} 'promoting joined-up government' (Lloyd 1997). Ensuring better co-ordination, and thus achieving greater financial efficiency, is, however, only one dimension of this policy ambition. Government is also keen to ensure that local government engages with the 'community' itself in developing the policies which will affect them. This element of policy is seen to be one part of a wider drive to secure the democratic renewal of Scotland. To achieve both these ends, Government has promoted and encouraged {{the development of a new}} planning tool for local government, namely Community Planning...|$|R

40|$|Compelling {{evidence}} exists {{that differences in}} health status, access to care, {{and the provision of}} physical and mental health services are significantly related to race, ethnicity, primary language, geography, and various measures of socioeconomic position, such as educational status, income, wealth, and conditions in childhood. Efforts to improve health care and eliminate health disparities in the United States are an important element of the Secretary of Health and Human Services 500 Day Plan: Longer, Healthier, and Better Lives (www. os. dhhs. gov/ 500 DayPlan/ 500 DayPlan. pdf). These efforts can succeed only when researchers, policy-makers, health care professionals, and community groups are equipped with complete and accurate data on the differences in health status, access to care, and the provision of services experienced by specific population groups in the U.

40|$|Since 1974, {{governments have}} created a series of <b>statutory</b> <b>public</b> {{involvement}} institutions in the English NHS: Community Health Councils; Patient and Public Involvement Forums; Local Involvement Networks; and, from 2013, local Healthwatch. This study presents the role of these institutions as a puzzle, given the growth of alternative forms of public involvement. Public involvement in the NHS tends to be studied for its contribution to democratising the NHS or for its role in a choice-led consumer market, but these analyses generally focus on involvement led by NHS personnel or by independent patient organisations. This dissertation uses a different body of political science theory to assess roles that <b>statutory</b> <b>public</b> involvement institutions may play in Ministers’ political management of the NHS. One approach is to see these institutions as ‘sheepdogs’, rounding up and organising diverse groups, thus providing a form of corporatist interest intermediation. Alternatively, they could be ‘watchdogs’, raising the alarm when standards slip critically and thereby helping to safeguard the NHS against disasters. The explanatory value of these two interpretations is reviewed over the period 1974 - 2010, using policy documents and archive material, including the records of these organisations and the archives of public inquiries into problems in hospitals. The findings suggest that at various times national political actors have used <b>statutory</b> <b>public</b> involvement institutions to manage the representation and mobilisation of interests and to alert them to problems in local health services. There is more recent evidence for the watchdog than for the sheepdog role. The watchdog role has been reappraised following the failure of statistical monitoring and regulatory police patrols to prevent disasters in the NHS. The discussion also shows how the sheepdog powers of these institutions mean that they can round up opposition, rather than moderating it, resulting in Ministerial reforms to <b>statutory</b> <b>public</b> involvement institutions...|$|R
