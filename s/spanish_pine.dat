40|$|Management {{implications}} {{associated with}} two different silvicultural strategies in two <b>Spanish</b> <b>pine</b> forests (Scots pine stands in northern Spain and Mediterranean Maritime pine stands in Central Spain) were explored. Whole-stand yield, growth models and individual tree equations {{were used to}} estimate carbon stock in forests under different silvicultural alternatives and site indexes. Each alternative was evaluated {{on the basis of}} the land expectation value (LEV). Results reveal the appropriateness of implementing carbon payments, because it can clearly complement traditional management objectives in economic terms. Longer rotations on the poorest sites result in a positive economic return by introducing carbon output. The proportion of carbon stock in the final harvest relative to total fixed carbon is always higher in long rotation scenarios. However, short rotation systems produce the highest values of carbon MAI regardless of site index. The impact of carbon price is higher on the Maritime pine stands than on Scots pine stands. For both the species, changes in the discount rate have a minor impact on Carbon LEV. Notwithstanding, the proportion of total LEV due to carbon is greater when the discount rate increases.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Ancient Forest Exploration & Research (AFER) {{conducted}} a fine-filter field survey {{to determine if the}} Gawgige-Jiwong Watershed located in Solski, Tofflemire and Oullette Townships in Ontario's Lower Spanish Forest is pristine (unlogged) (see watershed map). It is the largest known complete watershed dominated by old-growth red and eastern white pine forest (35 % of the forest cover- Table 1) at 3, 500 ha (see photographs of its headwaters-Fig. 1). In 1993, less than 5 % of the watershed had been logged in a small portion near the Spanish River- the remainder was pristine. Since E. B. Eddy purchased a mill the Sault Ste. Marie area that is tooled for cutting white and red pine lumber, they have been sending these species from the Lower <b>Spanish</b> <b>Pine</b> Landscape to the mill. Because E. B. Eddy continues to cut endangered old-growth pine, AFER and OPIRG sent letters to their managers in an effort to stop this logging (see attached letters). At the very minimum, this logging should cease until the Provincial Lands for Life Public Consultation concludes and recommendations for land protection are submitted to the Minister of Natural Resources by the Citizen's Committee (Round Table). Logging these forests precludes any consideration of their natural heritage value as part of this current Lands for Life process. George Weston Ltd., the parent corporation of E. B.

The Spanish visual strength-grading standard UNE 56544 (2011) efficiency applied to large cross-section structural timber was analyzed using a sample of 363 specimens of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.

40|$|Soil {{respiration}} {{is a major}} carbon pathway {{sensitive to}} environmental changes. Using prescribed burnings to reduce fuel accumulation and lower risks of large-scale wildfires has recently become more important. Prescribed burning can significantly alter the soil environment, but its effect in practice on soil respiration is not sufficiently understood. We evaluated the effects of prescribed burning on soil respiration before and after burning (May–July 2016). Prescribed burning was conducted in two natural pine areas by comparing a mixed stand of Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii with Pinus pinaster Ait. to a pure stand of Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii in the central Iberian Peninsula. Soil respiration was measured by an EGM- 4 (Environmental Gas Monitor) infrared gas analyser in both burned and unburned (control) plots. Burnings were low-intensity, and slightly more energetic in the pure stand given its larger litter volume. Post-burning soil respiration followed a similar evolution {{to that in the}} control plots, but was greater in the pure stand burned zone and slightly lower in the burned plots in the mixed stand. No significant differences were found in any stand. Soil respiration significantly changed in temporal evolution due to increasing temperatures when summer began. We conclude that prescribed fire induces no changes in SR immediately after fire. This study helps understand how prescribed burnings can affect soil respiration in pure and mixed <b>Spanish</b> black <b>pine</b> forest stands...|$|R
40|$|Aim of study: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the influence of topography and stand-structure on the characteristics of shrub communities and tree regeneration in a Mediterranean forest. Area of study: The Navahondona forest in Cazorla mountain range (SE Spain). Material and Methods: Data from 298 inventory plots were analysed by means of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to test the effects of aspect, altitude and stand basal area on shrub cover and diversity. Likewise, the effects of these three factors plus shrub cover on the recruitment of <b>Spanish</b> black <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra spp. salzmannii) and two oak species (Quercus ilex and Q. faginea) were analysed by GLMs. Additionally, the influence of topography and forest structure on the specific distribution of shrub species was analysed with multivariate methods. Main results: Shrub cover and diversity were generally low and did not change across the topographic gradient. Tree density was the only study variable affecting (negatively) shrub cover. However, shrub composition changed with aspect and altitude. Both pine and oak regeneration benefited from partial tree cover at intermediate values of stand density, but only oak regeneration was facilitated by shrubs. Research highlights: Altitude, aspect and stand basal area influence the characteristics of shrub communities and tree regeneration. Proactive management of dense pinewoods might be needed to increase shrub and tree diversity. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} Mediterranean vegetation cover on {{the biological and}} biochemical quality of soil is not well understood. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effects that different types of vegetation (forestry plots, mainly dominated by <b>Spanish</b> black <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra Am. ssp salzmannii) and herbaceous plots, where overstorey density is lower and natural herbaceous percentage is higher than in forestry plots) have in the biological properties of soil in Mediterranean humid climate. The impact of these plant communities on the biological soil quality was determined by several sensitive parameters related to the microbial activity of the soil such as soil respiration and some enzyme activities (urease, phosphatase and dehydrogenase). Development of vegetation (herbaceous and pines) was also determined and correlated with microbiological and biochemical indicators. Organic matter content in herbaceous sites {{was significantly higher than}} in forestry sites, ranging from 5. 27 to 6. 70 g 100 g(- 1) in herbaceous sites to 1. 64 - 2. 81 g 100 g(- 1) in forested areas. Herbaceous sites showed higher values of basal respiration and dehydrogenase activity than pine areas. However, the decrease of organic carbon content in pine areas led microbial activity enrichment per unit of carbon. These results conclude that vegetation cover significantly impacts soil microbial processes in Mediterranean humid climates, herbaceous vegetation having a more positive influence than forest vegetation on the biochemical and microbial activity of the soil, principally due to the higher accumulation of organic matter from plant remains.

40|$|International audienceAbstractKey messageShrub cover has visible effects onPinus nigraArn ssp. salzmanniiseedling emergence, {{but only}} in drier years under {{moderate}} basal area (25 – 30  m 2 [*] ha− 1). In the wetter year, shrub cover favours seedling survival without basal area influence. ContextShrubs are known to favour tree seedling recruitment in difficult climate environments, but facilitation may prove optimal in intermediate-level rather than harsh conditions, although such an effect remains to be specified. AimsThe main aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of stand basal area (15 – 20, 25 – 30 and 35 – 40  m 2  ha− 1) [*]×[*]with/without shrub facilitation on seedling recruitment in <b>Spanish</b> black <b>pine</b> (P. nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii), which has been struggling to regenerate natural forests since the late nineteenth century, sometimes jeopardizing stand persistence. MethodsIn spring 2012 and 2013, 72 subplots of 25 [*]×[*] 25  cm were established in Cuenca Mountains, central-eastern Spain (four replicates, each counting three subplots[*]×[*] 2 shrub conditions, both under and outside shrub cover, in three different stand basal areas). All plots were randomly distributed at least 500  m apart within each stand basal area. Each subplot comprised 20 seeds previously collected at the experimental forest site. Seedling emergence and early survival were monitored every month in 2012 and 2013. ResultsSeedling recruitment was strongly influenced by year. The year 2012 was drier and warmer than 2013. In 2012, seedling emergence was higher under the 25 – 30 -m 2  ha− 1 stand basal area and favoured by shrub cover, whereas in 2013, neither basal area nor shrub cover had significant effects. No seedling survived the summer in 2012. Higher seedling survival was found outside shrub cover at every basal area interval in 2013 with living seedlings {{until the end of}} the year. ConclusionClimate is the main factor controlling seedling emergence and survival. Shrub facilitation has visible effects on seedling emergence, {{but only in}} drier years under moderate light (moderate basal area). Facilitation collapses at extreme stress levels. In wetter years, shrub cover does not promote seedling survival and basal area is not an influential factor...|$|R
