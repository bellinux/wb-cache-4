25|$|Level {{crossings}} {{constitute a}} significant <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> internationally. On average, each year around 400 {{people in the}} European Union and over 300 in the United States are killed in level crossing accidents. Collisions can occur with vehicles as well as pedestrians; pedestrian collisions {{are more likely to}} result in a fatality. Among pedestrians, young people (5–19 years), older people (60 years and over) and males are considered to be high risk users.|$|E
25|$|The MHRA {{launched}} a criminal inquiry in October 2003 into GSK's conduct. This {{was based on}} two concerns: (a) {{the length of time}} between the end of the trials and GSK's passing the safety concerns to the MHRA; and (b) {{the manner in which the}} material had been handed over. Rather than alerting the MHRA of a risk, GSK had supplied the data in relation to an application to extend the indications of paroxetine to children. The MHRA deemed this inappropriate for an urgent <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> because of the length of time such applications can take.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> if released from the engine.|$|E
25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor <b>safety</b> <b>concern,</b> especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, the FSIS {{approved}} the gaseous disinfection system {{as an intermediate}} step before the roller press freezer, and {{approved the}} disinfected product for human consumption, as an additive. The FSIS agreed with BPI's suggestion that ammonia was a [...] "processing agent" [...] which {{did not need to}} be listed on labels as an ingredient. FSIS microbiologists Carl Custer and Gerald Zirnstein stated that they argued against the product's approval for human consumption, saying that it was not [...] "meat" [...] but actually [...] "salvage", and that the USDA should seek independent verification of its safety, but they were overruled. In 2003, BPI commissioned a study of the effectiveness and safety of the disinfection process; the Iowa State University researchers found no <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> in the product or in ground beef containing it.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{substantial}} move towards architecture-based development for safety-critical software applications. Nevertheless, techniques for architectural design have not been developed {{to the extent necessary}} to guarantee the safety of these systems. In particular, current practices often focus upon architectural modelling without making the underlying design deliberation explicit. Although a number of protection mechanisms have been codified in both research and practice, there is little practical guidance mi how to exploit them to address application-specific <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> This thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent and effective approach to eliciting and formulating <b>safety</b> <b>concerns,</b> evaluating and mitigating <b>safety</b> <b>concerns,</b> and arguing about safety within the evolutionary architecting process. The elicitation and formulation of <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> are based upon the unification of goals and scenarios from both positive. and negative perspectives. The evaluation of <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> is based upon the application of Object-Oriented Bayesian Belief Networks and mitigation space is informed by the evaluation results and the formulation of <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> <b>Safety</b> argumentation of architectures is based upon the definition of a set of patterns of argument. Guidance on safety argument review is also provided. Through addressing <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> in the early system development lifecyc 1 e, there can be an increased level of design confidence in the architectures developed for safety-critical software applications. Evaluation of the approach is conducted through a number of academic and industrial case studies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
500|$|Clackline Bridge {{continued}} to be a <b>safety</b> <b>concern,</b> with several accidents occurring in the 1970s. The narrow road and small curve radius were considered major factors in the accidents, and there was roughness in the road surface between the original and widened sections. A reinforced concrete overlay was installed on the bridge in 1978, initially with a single coat surface, but then upgraded to a [...] bituminous concrete surface in 1987. The 1980s saw the closure and removal of the Perth–Northam railway line, as well a number of major and sometimes fatal accidents involving prime movers. There were also several car accidents, and the [...] "screaming brakes of cars and hiss of airbrakes" [...] were often heard at night in Clackline. After each accident, damaged sections of the bridge – usually the guardrails, handrails, or bridge entry section – needed to be repaired. A 1989 prime mover accident severely damaged the footpath. Rather than repair the narrow footpath, and given that the railway had been removed, a new pedestrian path was constructed on the ground below the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Health {{literacy}} {{is a common}} and serious <b>safety</b> <b>concern.</b> [...] A study of 2,600 patients at two hospitals determined that between 26-60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard informed consent, or basic health care materials. This mismatch between a clinician's level of communication and a patient's ability to understand can lead to medication errors and adverse outcomes.|$|E

A review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated {{with the amount of}} taurine used in energy drinks, including Red Bull.

40|$|Emergent {{evidence}} suggests that patients can identify and report safety issues while in hospital. However, {{little is known about}} the best method for collecting information from patients about <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> This study presents an exploratory pilot of three mechanisms for collecting data on <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> from patients during their hospital stay. Three mechanisms for capturing <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> were coproduced with healthcare professionals and patients, before being tested in an exploratory trial using cluster randomisation at the ward level. Nine wards participated, with each mechanism being tested over a 3 -month study period. Patients were asked to feed back <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> via the mechanism on their ward (interviewing at their bedside, paper-based form or patient <b>safety</b> 'hotline'). <b>Safety</b> <b>concerns</b> were subjected to a two-stage review process to identify those that would meet the definition of a patient safety incident. Differences between mechanisms on a range of outcomes were analysed using inferential statistics. <b>Safety</b> <b>concerns</b> were thematically analysed to develop reporting categories. 178 patients were recruited. Patients in the face-to-face interviewing condition provided significantly more <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> per patient (1. 91) compared with the paper-based form (0. 92) and the patient safety hotline (0. 43). They were also significantly more likely to report one or more concerns, with 64 % reporting via the face-to-face mechanism, compared with 41 % via the paper-based form and 19 % via the patient safety hotline. No mechanism differed significantly in the number of classified patient safety incidents or physician-rated preventability and severity. Interviewing at the patient's bedside is likely to be the most effective means of gathering <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> from inpatients, potentially providing an opportunity for health services to gather patient feedback about safety from their perspective...|$|R

After some debate, Norris backed him and set up a new laboratory on land Cray owned in his hometown of Chippewa Falls. Some of the reason for the move may also have to do with Cray's worries about an impending nuclear war, which he felt made Minneapolis a serious <b>safety</b> <b>concern.</b> His house, built a few hundred yards from the new CDC laboratory, included a huge bomb shelter.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Food and Drug Administration {{released}} its own test results of several soft drinks containing benzoates and ascorbic or erythorbic acid. Five tested drinks contained benzene levels above the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended standard of 5 ppb. The Environmental Working Group has uncovered additional FDA test results {{that showed the}} following results: Of 24 samples of diet soda tested between 1995 and 2001 {{for the presence of}} benzene, 19 (79%) had amounts of benzene in excess of the federal tap water standard of 5 ppb. Average benzene levels were 19 ppb, about four times tap water standard. One sample contained 55 ppb of benzene, 11 fold tap water standards. Despite these findings, as of 2006, the FDA stated its belief that [...] "the levels of benzene found in soft drinks and other beverages to date do not pose a <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> for consumers".|$|E

2500|$|The {{methanol}} {{produced by}} the metabolism of aspartame is absorbed and quickly converted into formaldehyde and then completely oxidized to formic acid. The methanol from aspartame {{is unlikely to be}} a <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> for several reasons. [...] Fruit juices and citrus fruits contain methanol, and there are other dietary sources for methanol such as fermented beverages and the amount of methanol produced from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages is likely to be less than that from these and other sources that are already in people's diets. With regard to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame are trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs. At the highest expected human doses of consumption of aspartame, there are no increased blood levels of methanol or formic acid, and ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than what would be considered toxic.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{effort was}} also {{put into a}} [...] "frangible booster" [...] for the Ajax, whose casing would destroy itself in flight. This was a concern because the Ajax {{boosters}} were built in steel tubes that fell {{back to the ground}} close to the launcher sites and presented a real range <b>safety</b> <b>concern.</b> Martin produced the T48E1 and E2 designs for Ajax used a fibreglass casing that was destroyed by small explosives, but this engine proved overweight and did not boost the Ajax to the required speed. Redstone Arsenal then presented the T48E3 which was somewhat larger and longer to reach reasonable performance, but only at the cost of having to modify all of the Ajax launcher rails. The Army eventually decided not to proceed with any Ajax modifications as Hercules would be arriving shortly anyway. Similar experiments for Hercules boosters led to the XM-61 single-chamber booster, but when the XM-42 cluster proved to be even less expensive than expected, this effort was also dropped.|$|E
2500|$|The {{low cost}} of SDS, {{its lack of}} impact on taste, its {{potential}} impact on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs, which contribute to malodorous breath), and its desirable action as a foaming agent {{have led to the}} use of SDS in the formulations of toothpastes. A series of small crossover studies (25-34 patients) have supported the efficacy of SLS in the reduction of VSCs, and its related positive impact on breath malodor, although these studies have been generally noted to reflect technical challenges in the control of study design variables. While primary sources from the group of Irma Rantanen at University of Turku, Finland conclude an impact on dry mouth (xerostomia) from SLS-containing pastes, a 2011 Cochrane review of these studies, and of the more general area, concludes that there [...] "is no strong evidence… that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth." [...] A <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> has been raised on the basis of several studies regarding the effect of toothpaste SDS on aphthous ulcers, commonly referred to as canker or white sores.

2500|$|The International Menopause Society, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, The Endocrine Society, [...] the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), United States Food and Drug Administration, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society and the Mayo Clinic have {{released}} statements {{that there is}} a lack of evidence that the benefits and risks of bioidentical hormones are different from well-studied nonbioidentical counterparts; until such evidence is produced the risks should be treated as if they are similar; and that compounded hormone products may have additional risks related to compounding. A major <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is that there is no requirement to include package inserts, despite the potential for serious adverse effects (including life-threatening adverse effects) associated with HRT. This can lead to consumers being deceived (and harmed), as they are misled into believing that any hormone-related problems and dangers are exclusively related to nonbioidentical hormones, and that BHRT is therefore safe and has no side effects. In reality, the risks of bioidentical hormones have not been studied to the extent of nonbioidentical hormones, so the risks are not well understood. Regulatory bodies require pharmacies to include important safety information with conventional hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) via package inserts.|$|E
2500|$|A recent {{increase}} in work hours and overtime shifts of nurses {{has been used}} to compensate for the decrease of registered nurses (RNs). Logbooks completed by nearly 400 RNs have revealed that about [...] "40 [...] percent of the 5,317 work shifts they logged exceeded twelve hours." [...] Errors by hospital staff nurses are more likely to occur when work shifts extend beyond 12 hours, or they work over 40 hours in one week. Studies have shown that overtime shifts have harmful effects on the quality of care provided to patients, but some researchers [...] "who evaluated the safety of 12-hour shifts did not find increases in medication errors." [...] The errors which these researchers found were [...] "lapses of attention to detail, errors of omission, compromised problem solving, reduced motivation" [...] due to fatigue as well as [...] "errors in grammatical reasoning and chart reviewing." [...] Overworked nurses are a serious <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> to their patients wellbeing. Working back to back shifts, or night shifts, are a common cause of fatigue in hospital staff nurses. [...] "Less sleep, or fatigue, may lead to increased likelihood of making an error, or even the decreased likelihood of catching someone else's error." [...] Limiting working hours and shift rotations could [...] "reduce the adverse effects of fatigue" [...] and increase the quality of care of patients.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used hearing protection device (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E
