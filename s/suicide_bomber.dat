40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relation}} between human capital of <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> and outcomes of their suicide attacks. We argue that human capital {{is an important factor}} in the production of terrorism, and that if terrorists behave rationally we should observe that more able <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> are assigned to more important targets. We use a unique data set detailing the biographies of Palestinian <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers,</b> the targets they attack, and the number of people that they kill and injure to validate the theoretical predictions and estimate the returns to human capital in suicide bombing. Our empirical analysis suggests that older and more educated <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> are being assigned by their terror organization to more important targets. We find that more educated and older <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> are less likely to fail in their mission, and are more likely to cause increased casualties when they attack. ...|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{present a}} "Durkheimian" {{analysis}} of terrorism, using Durkheim's theories of social cohesion and suicide. Which social factors influence {{the development of}} radical and terrorist feelings and thoughts in individuals? And what are the motives of terrorists generally and <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> in particular? The concepts of social cohesion, altruism and fatalism {{play a key role}} in this analysis. The lack of social cohesion in today's individualistic Western society is of major influence on the development of radical and terrorist thoughts and feelings in individuals. The motives of <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> can be regarded as altruistic, and as having certain elements of the fatalistic. <b>Suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> sacrifice their lives, among other reasons, because they feel so connected with the social group of terrorists that they place greater value on the group target than on their own lives. On the other hand the fatalistic motive is also seen in <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers,</b> who miss the connection with regular society and view life as meaningless. Furthermore, there are more <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> in states with a totalitarian regime, which is also in line with the fatalistic motive. This suggests that <b>suicide</b> <b>bombers</b> can be labeled under a new category of fatalistic altruistic suicide...|$|R
