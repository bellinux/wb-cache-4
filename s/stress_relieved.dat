40|$|Abstract-Gear teeth failure due to fatigue is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} observed. Even a slight reduction in the root tensile stress results in great increase in the fatigue life of a gear. If gear fails in tensile fatigue, the results are catastrophic and occur {{with little or no}} warnings. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned above, this work is of more practical importance. For many years, gear design has been improved by using improved material, hardening surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, and shot penning to improve surface finish etc. Few more efforts have been made to improve the durability and strength by altering the pressure angle, using the asymmetric teeth, altering the geometry of root fillet curve and so on. Most of the above methods do not guarantees the interchangeability of the existing gear systems. This work presents the possibilities of using the stress redistribution techniques by introducing the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features in the stressed zone to the advantage of reduction of root fillet stress in spur gear. This also ensures interchangeability of existing gear systems. In this work, combination of circular and elliptical <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features are used and better results are obtained than using circular <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features alone which are used by earlier researchers. A finite element model with a segment of three teeth is considered for analysis and <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features of various sizes are introduced on gear teeth at various locations. Analysis revealed that, combination of elliptical and circular <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features at specific, locations are beneficial than single circular, single elliptical, two circular or two elliptical stress reliving features.

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims {{to study}} the effect of <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> on Limit Dome Height (LDH) of Ti-TWBs at {{elevated}} temperatures. This is achieved by developing a newly constructed heating system. The elevated temperature of the system can be varied and monitored by a separately control panel.

Meanwhile, the temperature of tool heating system was also adjusted from room temperature to 550 ℃. Specified tests were carried out to examine the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> effects of Ti-TWBs on the LDHs with the temperature control panel. In addition, investigations were carried out to ascertain whether the elevated temperatures of the critical tooling components, i. e. the die and the blank holder, could result in any significant effects on LDHs of Ti-TWBs. The findings show that LDHs of Ti-TWBs can be improved by <b>stress</b> <b>relieving.</b> The <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> condition can be obtained by nearly isothermal forming of specimens at a range of 550 °C to 600 °C...|$|R

In this paper the stress analysis of mating gears of the spur gear with three different materials is done to determine the contact stresses generated in the gear teeth.

The materials of spur gear used for analysis are grey cast iron, high carbon steel and medium carbon steel. In this paper the stresses which were calculated has been reduced by introducing <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> feature of different shapes. It was found that <b>Stress</b> <b>relieving</b> feature having the shape of aero- fin yielded better results when compared to elliptical and circular holes. KEYWORDS:...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{superalloy}} of Inconel 718 {{variety is}} widely used to produce compressor blade in gas turbine engine. The blade tip invariably wears in services and thus requires frequent metallization for repairing. In most commercial Turbine Engine Industries the metallised blades, after grinding, undergo a <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> heat treatment at 760 0 C before return for applications. In this study, the metallised blade is heat treated at different conditions and compared its microstructure and hardness {{with those of the}} standard <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> treatment blades used in most industries. The microstructure of the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> sample contains dendrite with hardness of 230 HV for the melt zone, 190 HV for the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and 420 HV for the parent metal. Solutionising at 982 or 1066 0 C developed hardness less than 220 HV in all sections. By long time ageing treatment of the solutionised sample developed high hardness across the whole blade. These treatments homogenized the microstructure and produced high hardness values by precipitation of secondary phase structures across the blade...|$|R

50|$|Alpha and near-alpha alloys {{cannot be}} {{dramatically}} changed by heat treatment. Stress relief and annealing are {{the processes that}} can be employed for this class of titanium alloys. The heat treatment cycles for beta alloys differ significantly from those for the alpha and alpha-beta alloys. Beta alloys can not only be <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> or annealed, but also can be solution treated and aged. The alpha-beta alloys are two-phase alloys, comprising both alpha and beta phases at room temperature. Phase compositions, sizes, and distributions of phases in alpha-beta alloys can be manipulated within certain limits by heat treatment, thus permitting tailoring of properties.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with a significant number of technologies is that they are installed through a nozzle and are exposed to products. This can create several problems, especially when retrofitting new equipment to vessels that have already been <b>stress</b> <b>relieved,</b> as it may not be possible to fit the instrument at the location required. Also, as the measuring element is exposed to the contents within the vessel, it may either attack or coat the instrument causing it to fail in service. One of the most reliable methods for measuring level is using a Nuclear gauge, as it is installed outside the vessel and doesn't normally require a nozzle for bulk level measurement. The measuring element is installed outside the process and can be maintained in normal operation without taking a shutdown. Shutdown is only required for an accurate calibration.|$|E
