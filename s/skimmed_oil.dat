50|$|On September 6, 1967, Standard Oil of California's 18,000-ton tanker, SS R. C. Stoner {{was driven}} onto the reef at Wake Island {{by a strong}} southwesterly wind after the ship failed to moor to the two buoys near the harbor entrance. An {{estimated}} 6 million gallons of refined fuel oil, including 5.7 million gallons of aviation fuel, 168,000 gallons of diesel oil and 138,600 gallons of bunker C fuel spilled into the small boat harbor and along the southwestern coast of Wake Island to Peacock Point. Large numbers of fish were stranded and killed by the oil spill, and personnel from the FAA and crewman from the ship cleared the area closest to the spill of dead fish. The U.S. Navy salvage team Harbor Clearance Unit Two and Pacific Fleet Salvage Officer, Commander John B. Orem flew to Wake to assess the situation and by September 13, Navy tugs USS Mataco and USS Wandank, salvage ships USS Conserver and USS Grapple, tanker USS Noxubee, and USCGC Mallow, arrived from Honolulu, Guam and Subic Bay in the Philippines, {{to assist in the}} cleanup and removal of the vessel. At the boat harbor, the salvage team pumped and <b>skimmed</b> <b>oil</b> which they burned each evening in nearby pits. Recovery by the Navy salvage team of the R. C. Stoner and its remaining cargo, however, was hampered by strong winds and heavy seas. On September 16, Super Typhoon Sarah made landfall on Wake Island at peak intensity with winds up to 145-knots, causing widespread damage. The intensity of the storm had the beneficial effect of greatly accelerating the cleanup effort by clearing the harbor and scouring the coast. Oil did remain, however, embedded in the reef's flat crevices and impregnated in the coral. The storm also had broken the wrecked vessel into three sections and, although delayed by rough seas and harassment by blacktip reef sharks, the salvage team used explosives to flatten and sink the remaining portions of the ship that were still above water.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the <b>oil</b> <b>skimming</b> market and {{evaluate}} what drives company competitiveness and market attractiveness. Throughout the thesis, the total <b>oil</b> <b>skimming</b> market has been divided into an industrial market and an offshore market as these applications have entirely different requirements. However, the skimming market in general is underdeveloped and the long lifetime of the equipment has {{a negative impact on}} the market development speed. It is therefore characterised by a fragmented body of competitors and diverging pricing. Instead of price being an order-winning aspect, recovery rate and ability to pick up a large variety of oils {{has been found to be}} important.   In this inductive, and interpretivistic case study, a model for market analysis of an underdeveloped market is developed and applied to Sandvik Process Systems’ <b>oil</b> <b>skimming</b> business. The study is based on an extensive interview program with <b>oil</b> <b>skimming</b> equipment manufacturers, and oil spill response companies. The model comprises of an external, and an internal analysis synthesised into a SWOT-matrix from which five strategic directions are extracted. These directions are described as well as their respective business impact on Sandvik Process Systems.   Sandvik Process Systems’ skimmer is a steel belt skimmer developed in the 1960 ’s. With a lifting height of up to three metres and a width of up to 400 mm, the Sandvik oil skimmer is capable of lifting 354 litres per hour in optimal conditions. Compared to its competitors, the skimmer is a low cost alternative priced at 66 - 75 % below industry average.   However, the results of the analysis indicate a poor competitiveness of Sandvik Process Systems’ product. Due to an inferior technology, Sandvik Process Systems’ skimmer lacks the capacity needed to target the offshore market. Therefore, the product can only target the industrial market. Meanwhile, many competitors offer complete solution packages including as pumps, storage tanks, and a variety of specialised skimmers in order to increase their competitiveness.   Looking at the competitors it is clear that Sandvik Process Systems’ skimmer does have advantages. However, many of the advantages are based on organisational strengths which are difficult to leverage. Also, the organisation does not have any experience from the <b>oil</b> <b>skimming</b> market and due to the small size of the market, it is doubtful if Sandvik Process Systems are able to devote the necessary resources to overcome this hurdle. Due to a revenue target set at EUR 2. 33 million, Sandvik Process System’s skimmer would require a 23. 9 % of the market value or 119 % of the number of skimmers sold.   Despite this thesis reaching the conclusion that Sandvik Process Systems should not enter the <b>oil</b> <b>skimming</b> market; it also stipulates that Sandvik Process Systems does have the potential to successfully sell skimmers. However, reaching the goal of EUR 2. 33 million is deemed unlikely...|$|R

50|$|Oil {{was known}} {{to exist in the}} Oil Creek Valley of northwestern Pennsylvania, but there was no {{practical}} way to extract it. Its main use to that time had been as a medicine for animals, humans and the early development of kerosene. In the late 1850s Seneca Oil Company (formerly the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) sent its manager, Colonel Edwin L. Drake, to develop a way to produce more ‘Rock oil’ from the ‘Oil Creek’. His employer secured a piece of leased land just south of Titusville, a slow-growing and peaceful community. Lumber was the principal industry at the time, with at least 17 sawmills in the area. The land was chosen because for hundreds of years Native Americans <b>skimmed</b> surface <b>oil</b> from the water near a naturally occurring ‘Oil seep’. (Even today Oil Creek still has some natural seeps). Drake tried many ways to access and <b>skim</b> more <b>oil.</b> Eventually he attempted to dig a deep hole by hand. When a hole collapse nearly killed his men, Drake attempted drilling. He was told by local water well drillers that “You cannot drill for Rock Oil”. Drake had to travel to New Kensington, PA, (over 90 miles away), to find and hire a salt well driller, William A. Smith, in the summer of 1859. After many difficulties, they finally drilled a commercially successful well on August 27. Considered the birth of the oil industry, it was an event that changed the world.|$|R

"The April 20, 2010, {{explosion and}} collapse of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the release of millions of barrels of oil into Gulf waters. The response to this disaster involved the efforts {{of tens of thousands of}} workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and tar ball removal from beaches, <b>oil</b> <b>skimming</b> and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil release was an unprecedented event in the United States in many respects, requiring response work across a vast area of multiple jurisdictions. The type, location, and quantities of oil released; the types and quantities of dispersant used; and climatic and geographical conditions differentiate this release from past oil spills. On May 28, 2010, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a request for a health hazard evaluation (HHE) from BP management concerning health effects experienced by responders to the oil release. The request was prompted by the May 26, 2010, hospitalization of seven fishermen who were working in BP's Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program in the Gulf of Mexico. The fishermen had been hospitalized for symptoms that were initially believed to be related to exposures experienced during their response activities, particularly booming and <b>skimming</b> <b>oil.</b> In response to this request, we began an investigation on June 2, 2010, with an opening meeting held at the BP Operations Center in Houma, Louisiana. In attendance were representatives from NIOSH, BP, the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health (CTEH), O'Brien's Response Management, the U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Objectives of this opening meeting were to discuss the initial investigations conducted by CTEH and OSHA into the events surrounding the hospitalization of the fishermen and to plan the NIOSH investigation. These plans included interviews, health symptom surveys, and on-site industrial hygiene assessments of response work activities similar to those performed by the fishermen. As the plans were developing, BP requested that we expand the scope of the HHE to include all major offshore response activities. In addition to <b>oil</b> booming and <b>skimming</b> conducted by workers on VoO vessels, these activities included aerial and vessel-based dispersant releases, in-situ surface oil burning, containment and recovery work at the oil source, and other related offshore oil removal activities. In the weeks that followed, teams of NIOSH industrial hygienists, medical officers, and other occupational health specialists conducted on-site investigations at locations throughout the Gulf region to collect quantitative and qualitative data on potential worker exposures, health symptoms, work practices and procedures, and work organization. On June 22, 2010, NIOSH received a request from BP for a second HHE to investigate potential hazards associated with onshore response work activities. In response to this request, teams of NIOSH personnel evaluated practices and procedures including wildlife cleanup operations, beach cleanup operations, and decontamination and waste management activities throughout the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. In contrast to the offshore evaluations, which relied on traditional industrial hygiene exposure assessment methodologies and quantitative exposure monitoring to identify potential hazards, the onshore assessment relied on qualitative assessment techniques, including the use of professional judgment and expertise during observations of onshore work activities. Health symptom surveys, however, were similar to those used for the offshore evaluations. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. These assessments were not intended to describe or investigate potential long-term or chronic health effects. The results of these investigations were reported in a series of nine interim reports and report summaries posted on the NIOSH website. The full reports were distributed electronically to key contacts for each work activity evaluated. Included in the reports were conclusions regarding the extent of hazards and exposures identified as well as recommendations for improving workplace conditions. Furthermore, all exposure and health symptom survey data were compiled in electronic spreadsheets and posted on the NIOSH website. This information can be accessed at [URL] Additional information about other components of the NIOSH Deepwater Horizon response activities outside of the HHE investigation, including response worker rostering efforts, analyses of injury and illness data, and guidance and educational materials developed for the response can be found on the NIOSH website at [URL].

However, yields with soybean hulls (SBH) replacing glucose were lower. This work was undertaken to reduce the yield loss when using SBH as the carbon source and to evaluate two other soy by-products, namely fiber and <b>skim</b> from aqueous <b>oil</b> extraction as alternative carbon and nitrogen sources. Fermentation of soybean hulls, fibers and skim at various concentrations produced lower FA-Glu titers compared to S- 7 medium. Neither increasing their amount nor supplementing with glucose increased the FA-Glu titer, suggesting {{the presence of an}} inhibitor in these feedstocks. By using a mixture of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, over 65 % of SBH solids were converted to soluble carbohydrates. FA-Glu titers obtained from SBH hydrolysates containing residual hull solids were still low; however, with the removal of the solids, cell growth improved and FA-Glu yield was 60 % higher than with glucose. Thus, this low-cost material can be converted to a substrate for production of FA-Glu biosurfactant. Unmodified fiber and skim components of aqueous oil extraction were not beneficial...|$|R
