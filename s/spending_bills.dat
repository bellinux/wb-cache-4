5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required <b>spending</b> <b>bills</b> to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate.

Needing to pass a federal budget for the 2016 fiscal year beginning October 1, the Freedom Caucus, now consisting of approximately 40 conservative Republicans affiliated with the Tea Party movement, threatened to block a resolution from passing unless it would defund Planned Parenthood and to initiate a vote to vacate the speakership if Boehner did not support their demands. [...] The caucus sought the following promises: (1) the decentralization of the House Steering Committee, so that the Speaker and House Majority Leader are not solely in charge of committee assignments, (2) not supporting {{an increase in the}} U.S. debt ceiling without entitlement reform, (3) willingness to impeach John Koskinen, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and (4) passing <b>spending</b> <b>bills</b> approved by the caucus rather than a continuing resolution favored by Democrats in the United States Senate.|$|E

2500|$|Greenspan {{discusses}} in his book, {{among other}} things, his history {{in government and}} economics, capitalism and other economic systems, current issues in the global economy, and future issues that face the global economy. In the book Greenspan criticizes President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and the Republican-controlled Congress for abandoning the Republican Party's principles on spending and deficits. Greenspan's criticisms of President Bush include his refusal to veto <b>spending</b> <b>bills,</b> sending the country into increasingly deep deficits, and for [...] "putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies". Greenspan writes, [...] "They swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither. They deserved to lose [...] ". He praised Bill Clinton above all the other presidents for whom he'd worked for his [...] "consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth". Although he respected {{what he saw as}} Richard Nixon's immense intelligence, Greenspan found him to be [...] "sadly paranoid, misanthropic and cynical". He said of Gerald Ford that he [...] "was as close to normal as you get in a president, but he was never elected". Regarding future U.S. economic policy, Greenspan recommends improving the U.S. primary and secondary education systems. He asserts this would narrow the inequality between the minority of high-income earners and most workers whose wages have not grown in proportion with globalization and the nation's GDP growth.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his term}} the state adopted a new districting system {{that for the}} first time granted more seats in the Indiana General Assembly to urban areas. The {{situation}} created by the new development caused a split in the party between the urban and rural Republicans. Urban Republicans and their representatives tended to favor increasing government provided services and spending, while the rural Republicans tended to favor reduced spending and more limited government. Whitcomb found himself in party with the rural Republicans, while Bowen, who had become speaker of the house, grew to become a leader among the urban members. Whitcomb vetoed a number of <b>spending</b> <b>bills</b> passed by the assembly and began a fight for control of the party leadership. [...] Whitcomb suffered a stunning political setback on Nov. 25, 1970, when aides failed to block what the Indianapolis News called [...] "a unanimous vote" [...] to elect former Whitcomb supporter and State Treasurer John K. Snyder to the post of Republican Party chairman. The Indianapolis Star, under the front page banner [...] "Snyder to Head State GOP" [...] on Nov. 25, chronicled the Whitcomb political disaster. Highlighting the depth of the defeat, then-President Richard Nixon personally wrote Snyder on Dec. 15, 1970 to express his personal support. (In later years Whitcomb and Snyder resumed their former friendship, which in 1970 was described by the Indianapolis News as [...] "bitter.") In a hardball political move following Snyder's election, Whitcomb diverted Republican political contributions to a special fund in the Governor's office and nearly bankrupted the state party. Snyder subsequently resigned from his leadership position and Whitcomb installed a new chairman, Jim Neal, a newspaper editor from Noblesville, who remained friendly to his positions, but neutral at the 1972 convention. Contemporaneously, Whitcomb resumed collection of the fund to state party coffers. Bowen, meanwhile, had been able to install a number of people in key county leadership positions that effectively gave his wing of the party real control.|$|E
