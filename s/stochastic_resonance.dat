5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that <b>stochastic</b> <b>resonance</b> {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E

40|$|Box orbits in {{triaxial}} potentials are generically thin, that is, {{they lie}} close in phase space to a resonant orbit satisfying a {{relation of the}} form lω 1 + mω 2 + nω 3 = 0 between the three fundamental frequencies. Boxlets are special cases of resonant orbits in {{which one of the}} integers (l, m, n) is zero. Resonant orbits are confined for all time to a membrane in configuration space; they play roughly the same role, in three dimensions, that periodic orbits play in two, generating families of regular orbits when stable and stochastic orbits when unstable. Stable resonant orbits avoid the center of the potential; orbits that are thick enough to pass near the destabilizing center are typically <b>stochastic.</b> <b>Resonances</b> in triaxial potentials are most important at energies far outside the region of gravitational influence of a central black hole. Near the black hole, the motion is essentially regular, although resonant orbits exist in this region as well, including at least one family whose elongation is parallel to the long axes of the triaxial figure. 1...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-isochronous {alpha}-like bucket can be {{important}} in providing ultra short bunches. the instability of a bunch inside the bucket {{is found to be}} severely affected by rf phase modulation. The synchrotron tune drops to zero at the bucket edge very rapidly, indicating the possibility of a thick chaotic layer due to overlapping of resonance islands. The approach to chaos comes from a sequence of bifurcation into 2 : 1 parametric resonances. When quantum excitation is included in addition to radiation damping, the instability is worsened. the steady-state particle distribution in the longitudinal phase space is Gaussian in the phase coordinate and non-Gaussian in the momentum coordinate, unless the bunch is small. The size of the bunch is governed only bye the ``thermal energy`` {ital E{sub th}} = D{sup 2 }/ 2 A, where D and A are, respectively, the normalized diffusion and damping coefficients. The quantum lifetime of the particle bunch, for the D and A that have been enhanced by the smallness of the phase- slip factor, is studied and turns out to be much longer than expected. Phase modulation tends to enhance quantum diffusion at high frequencies, but leads to <b>stochastic</b> <b>resonances</b> instead at low frequencies...|$|R

40|$|Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is {{a recent}} and well known {{technique}} used to separate mixtures of signals. While in general the researchers put their attention {{on the type of}} signals and of mixing, we focus our attention on a quite general class of models which act as sources of the time series, the dynamical systems. In this paper we focus our attention on the general problem to understand the behaviour of ICA methods with respect to the time series deriving from a specific dynamical system, selecting large classes of them, and using ICA to make separation. This study gives some interesting results that are very useful both to highlight some properties related to dynamical systems and to clarify some general aspects of ICA, by using both synthetic and real data. From one hand we study the features of the linear (simple and coupled) and non-linear (single and coupled) dynamical systems, <b>stochastic</b> <b>resonances,</b> chaotic and real dynamical systems. We have to stress that we obtain information about the separation of these systems and substantially how from the entropy of the complete system we can obtain the entropies of the single dynamical systems (so that we also could obtain a more realistic analogic circuit). On the other hand these results show the high capability of the ICA method to recognize the dynamical systems independently from their complexity {{and in the case of}} stochastic series ICA perfectly recognizes the different dynamical systems also where the Fourier Transform is irresolute. We also note that in the case of real dynamical systems we showed that ICA permits to recognize the information connected to the sources and to associate to it a phenomenological dynamical system that reproduce it (i. e.

The first, like the crayfish experiment, consisted of a pure tone pressure signal at 23 Hz in a broadband noise background of varying intensities. A power spectrum analysis of the signals yielded maximum SNR for a noise intensity equal to 25 times the signal stimulus resulting in a maximum increase of 600% in SNR. 14 cells in 12 animals were tested, and all showed an increased SNR at a particular level of noise, meeting the requirements for the occurrence of <b>stochastic</b> <b>resonance.</b>|$|E

The analysis identifies several additional short-lasting events, increasing {{the total number of}} DO events to 27 in the period 12 – 90 kyr before present (BP). The quasi-regular occurrence of the DO events could indicate a <b>stochastic</b> or coherent <b>resonance</b> mechanism governing their origin.

40|$|Intuitively {{one might}} expect {{independent}} noise {{to be a powerful}} tool for desynchronizing a population of synchronized neurons. We here show that, intriguingly, for oscillatory neural populations with adaptive synaptic weights governed by spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) the opposite is true. We found that the mean synaptic coupling in such systems increases dynamically in response to the increase of the noise intensity, and there is an optimal noise level, where the amount of synaptic coupling gets maximal in a resonance-like manner as found for the <b>stochastic</b> or coherence <b>resonances,</b> although the mechanism in our case is different. This constitutes a noise-induced self-organization of the synaptic connectivity, which effectively counteracts the desynchronizing impact of independent noise over a wide range of the noise intensity.
