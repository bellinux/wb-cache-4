40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{treatment}} of malignant pleural mesothelioma {{continues to be}} a clinical challenge. The question, however, is no longer whether to provide active treatment or not, but how aggressive the treatment should be in view of the limited life expectancy of patients with this disease. RECENT FINDINGS: With platin and pemetrexed-based combination chemotherapy having become the preferred systemic therapy, the major questions now evolve around the identification of a suitable second line therapy and the quest for innovative new approaches. Surgical interventions from pleurectomy and decortication to extrapleural pneumonectomy have increasingly come of use in <b>specialized</b> <b>centres.</b> With neoadjuvant chemotherapy and extrapleural pneumonectomy median survival times of almost 2 years have been reported. Studies on high-dose hemithoracic radiotherapy after extrapleural pneumonectomy suggested a beneficial effect on local recurrence. However, both extrapleural pneumonectomy and high-dose hemithoracic radiotherapy are associated with potential treatment-related mortality and morbidity and cannot yet be recommended outside <b>specialized</b> <b>centres.</b> SUMMARY: More than ever, the diagnosis and {{treatment of}} patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma mandate a multidisciplinary approach...|$|R

40|$|Our aim was {{to study}} and compare {{pharmacoepidemiology}} of headache treatment in two different settings: inside and outside a <b>specialized</b> <b>Centre.</b> We analysed the differences in headache treatment between 612 subjects admitted for the first visit ('naive') (F/M: 2. 41; mean age = 37. 31 +/- 14. 09 years) and 620 subjects admitted for a control visit (F/M: 3. 18; mean age = 44. 30 +/- 15. 37 years) to the Headache Centre of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Most patients suffered from migraine. As acute treatment, on the first visit, 49. 4 % of them were taking drugs prescribed by a doctor; 41. 5 % were taking over-the-counter analgesics (OTCAs); 9. 1 % were not taking any drug. On the control visit, 81. 3 % of patients were taking prescription drugs; 15. 8 % OTCAs; 2. 9 % were not taking drugs (overall chi-square = 139. 229, P < 0. 001). Non-selective analgesics were the most-used drugs. Triptans were used by 9. 1 % of 'naive' patients and by 31. 8 % of patients attending for the control visit (Fisher's Z = 7. 655, P < 0. 001). Nimesulide was the most-used drug. A prophylactic treatment was made by 16. 8 % of 'naive' patients, and by 58. 2 % of patients admitted to the control visit (Fisher's Z = 12. 135, P < 0. 001). Antidepressants were the class of drugs most used for prophylaxis. Amitriptyline was the drug for prophylaxis most frequently used by patients attending the control visit, while flunarizine was {{the most frequently used}} by 'naive' patients.

40|$|SummaryThe {{prevalence}} of {{congenital heart disease}} among adults in Europe, or in any country in Europe, is not known. This {{is due to a}} lack of agreement on the incidence of congenital heart disease, with estimations varying from four per 1000 births to 50 per 1000 births, and it is not known how many patients with congenital heart disease have died. Based on several studies that estimated and calculated the number of adult patients with congenital heart disease, the number of patients should be much higher than the number of patients that are actually seen in <b>specialized</b> <b>centres</b> throughout Europe. This implies that either a large proportion of adult patients with congenital heart disease do not receive appropriate medical care, or that the calculations and estimations are grossly wrong. A combination of the two is also possible. A substantial expansion of the number and size of <b>specialized</b> <b>centres</b> for adult congenital heart disease is advocated, but since setting up (and running) a service for this disease is a costly affair, and because uncertainty remains about the actual number of patients needing specialized care, this has been difficult to realize in most European countries in the past few years...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{idiopathic}} thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is {{a relatively}} common cause of an acquired hemostatic defect. It is important for family physicians to recognize this disorder, because of its insidious onset {{and the fact that}} it most commonly affects women of childbearing age. Chronic ITP is due to an antibody in the plasma which attaches to platelets and leads to their destruction in the reticuloendothelial system. The antibody can cross the placenta and affect the fetus. Although the condition may not disappear, in the vast majority of patients it can be controlled with current therapy, including prednisone, splenectomy and immunosuppressive agents. Although the mortality rate is low, patients with severe thrombocytopenia may have significant bleeding problems requiring special measures such as platelet transfusions, intravenous gammaglobulin, plasmapheresis and emergency splenectomy.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a <b>specialized</b> <b>centre</b> (Auticentrum) in České Budějovice, where {{children}} with Autism spectrum disorder (further on only as "ASD") can spend their free time. Autism spectrum disorder is a pervasive developmental disorder, spreading through every important area of a child's development. Shortcomings are obvious in three main areas social, communication and {{in the area of}} imagination. Deficits in any of those areas are projected into the everyday life of the child. The theoretical part is divided into three chapters. The first chapter deals with the characteristics of the Autism spectrum disorder, the second chapter explains the concept of free time in the relation to Autism and the third chapter is designated to selected non-profit organizations in České Budějovice. The goal of the practical part {{of this paper is to}} determine real possibilities of spending free time that children with ASD have in České Budějovice, to analyse and to find objective reasons which limit the children's choice of free time activities. A set of information was gathered with the use of method of qualitative research. The collection of data was executed by half-structured interviews within a selected experiment sample of respondents. Interviews were carried out with questions on topics prepared beforehand with selected respondents, who were mothers of children with the Autism spectrum disorder. The results of this paper contain a free transcription of interviews with respondents and key questions answering goals of this experiment are listed in synoptic tables. From results of interviews with mothers, it is apparent that the foremost obstacle for children with ASD is their differences in behaviour. When choosing a free-time activity for a child with ASD, their specific needs and individuality must be taken into account. These children have specific capabilities and abilities and, therefore, also an approach to them must be specific. During the research, certain benefits were discovered for children with ASD that the <b>specialized</b> <b>centre</b> (Auticentrum), which selected children visited, or have visited. Respondents see as the largest advantage the fact that their children with Autism found friends, with whom they can spend their free time even outside of controlled hobbitry activities. Respondents are aware of further possibilities of free time activities in the offer of schools which children attend, but except after-school daycare, their children participate in activities only in the <b>specialized</b> <b>centre.</b> This bachelor thesis only confirms the fact that possibilities how children with autism can spend their free time are not sufficient in number. It also points out that it is necessary, when choosing an activity, to follow individual approach, to respect specific needs and capabilities of the child in question. This thesis could serve parents of children with autism as an informative material about possible use of free-time education in Auticentrum in České Budějovice. Further, it could serve other organizations as an inspiration on the offer of free-time activities of children with autism...|$|E
