50|$|A Marvin <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder</b> is a <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder</b> {{which uses}} a clock type {{mechanism}} to record the sun.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorders.</b> One type uses the sun itself as a {{time-scale}} for the sunshine readings. The other type uses some form of clock for the time scale.|$|R
50|$|Older {{recorders}} {{required a}} human observer {{to interpret the}} results; recorded results might differ among observers. Modern <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorders</b> use electronics and computers for precise data that do not depend on a human interpreter. Newer recorders can also measure the global and diffuse radiation.|$|R
40|$|Daily {{sunshine}} duration is commonly reported at weather stations. Beyond the basic duration report, {{more information is}} available from scorched cards of Campbell-Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorders,</b> such as the estimation of direct-beam solar irradiance. Sunshine cards therefore potentially provide information on sky state, as inferred from solar-radiation data. Some sites have been operational since the late 19 th century, hence sunshine cards potentially provide underexploited historical data on sky state. Sunshine cards provide {{an example of an}} archive source yielding data beyond the measurements originally sought...|$|R

30|$|Institute of Energy (RERC) {{measured}} global {{solar radiation}} from January 2003 to December 2005 using two Eppley PSP pyranometers at 1 -min interval for 24  h. Sunshine duration data were recorded using Campbell–Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorders</b> by both BMD and Institute of Energy. We have used the monthly averaged daily solar radiation data and their corresponding other parameter data, such as sunshine duration, precipitation, and temperature to perform the regression analysis. Only five sites, where measured solar radiation data are available, are taken to find {{the parameters of the}} models. Data of all the other sites are used to test the models. DLR satellite time series data (German Aerospace Center 2015) of {{global solar radiation}} were also available for ten sites from Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) project database (Schillings et al. 2004). NASA’s Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) (NASA 2015) data which are the 22 -year average satellite data are also collected. As the DLR data and NASA SSE data are actually estimated data, they were not used to find model parameters, rather they are just used to show a comparison among the results.|$|R
40|$|Aerosols play a {{significant}} yet complex and {{central role in the}} Earth's radiation budget, and knowledge of long-term changes in the atmospheric turbidity induced by aerosols is therefore fundamental for a better understanding of climate change. However, there is little available information on changes in aerosol concentration in the atmosphere, especially prior to the 1980 s. The present paper reviews publications reporting the suitability of sunshine duration records with regard to detecting changes in atmospheric aerosols. Some of the studies reviewed propose methods for estimating aerosol-related magnitudes, such as turbidity, from sunshine deficit at approximately sunrise and sunset, when the impact of aerosols on the solar beam is more easily observed. In addition, there is abundant evidence that one cause of the decadal changes observed in sunshine duration records involves variations in atmospheric aerosol loading. Possible directions for future research are also suggested: in particular, detailed studies of the burn (not only its length but also its width) registered by means of Campbell-Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorders</b> may provide a way of creating time series of atmospheric aerosol loading metrics dating back to over 120 -years from the present. Key Points Sunshine records suitability to detect atmospheric aerosol is reviewed Despite short comings of the data, aerosol effect on sunshine is evident Possible directions for future research are highlighted. © 2014.

50|$|A <b>{{sunshine}}</b> <b>recorder</b> is {{a device}} that records the amount of sunshine at a given location. The results provide information about the weather and climate {{as well as the}} temperature of a geographical area. This information is useful in meteorology, science, agriculture, tourism, and other fields. It has also been called a heliograph.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{harmonize}} the data measured worldwide, in 1962 the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defined a standardized {{design of the}} Campbell-Stokes recorder, called an Interim Reference <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Recorder</b> (IRSR). In 2003, the sunshine duration was finally defined as the period during which direct solar irradiance exceeds a threshold value of 120 W/m².|$|E
50|$|The Campbell-Stokes {{recorder}} (sometimes {{called a}} Stokes sphere) {{is a kind}} of <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder.</b> It was invented by John Francis Campbell in 1853 and modified in 1879 by Sir George Gabriel Stokes. The original design by Campbell consisted of a glass sphere set into a wooden bowl with the sun burning a trace on the bowl. Stokes's refinement was to make the housing out of metal and to have a card holder set behind the sphere.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{can measure}} the {{intensity}} of sunlight using a <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder,</b> pyranometer, or pyrheliometer. To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both Earth's elliptical orbit and the attenuation by Earth's atmosphere {{have to be taken}} into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance (...) , corrected for the elliptical orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by where dn=1 on January 1st; dn=32 on February 1st; dn=59 on March 1 (except on leap years, where dn=60), etc. In this formula dn-3 is used, because in modern times Earth's perihelion, the closest approach to the Sun and, therefore, the maximum [...] occurs around January 3 each year. The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989 AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033 AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{theoretical}} maximum of daytime duration {{for a given}} location, {{there is also a}} practical consideration at which point the amount of daylight is sufficient to be treated as a [...] "sunshine hour". [...] "Bright" [...] sunshine hours represent the total hours when the sunlight is stronger than a specified threshold, as opposed to just [...] "visible" [...] hours. [...] "Visible" [...] sunshine, for example, occurs around sunrise and sunset, but is not strong enough to excite the sensor. Measurement is performed by instruments called sunshine recorders. For the specific purpose of sunshine duration recording, Campbell-Stokes recorders are used, which use a spherical glass lens to focus the sun rays on a specially designed tape. When the intensity exceeds a pre-determined threshold, the tape burns. The total length of the burn trace is proportional to the number of bright hours. Another type of recorder is the Jordan <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder.</b> Newer, electronic recorders have more stable sensitivity than that of the paper tape.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare daily {{sunshine}} duration data measured using a Campbell-Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder</b> (CS) and a CSD 3 sunshine duration sensor (AUTO) as well as to attempt to explain discrepancies between the two data sets. The paper is based on heliographic data and cloudiness observations for 2007 – 2012. All the data come from the research station of the Jagiellonian University located in Krakow, Poland. Both instruments tend to produce similar sunshine duration data; however, the electronic sensor tends to show more sunshine duration than the CS. The difference may amount to several hours a day, especially on days with maximum solar radiation. The CSD 3 sensor is twice as sensitive as the CS and reacts quickly to solar radiation. This is especially true for the first hour following sunrise, the last hour before sunset and when the Sun’s disc becomes visible for short periods of time due to changes in cloudiness. However, there are days when the CSD 3 registers less sunshine duration (up to an hour) than the CS. This happens with Cumulus clouds in the sky, which tend to pass the Sun’s disc very quickly. The CSD 3 sensor does not register sunshine in the presence of thick Altostratus and Cirrostratus clouds due to the relative lack of direct radiation. The <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder,</b> on the other hand, registers this low level of sunshine...|$|E
40|$|Sunlight is the {{electromagnetic}} radiation given {{off by the}} sun. It is passed through the atmosphere to the Earth, where the solar radiation is reflected as daylight. Sunshine results when the solar radiation is not blocked. Sunlight is {{the primary source of}} energy to the Earth. It provides infrared, visible, and ultraviolet (UV) electromagnetic radiation with different wavelengths. Small sections of the wavelengths that are visible to the human eye are reflected as rainbow colors. Sunlight may be recorded using a <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder.</b> Electromagnetic waves are waves that are capable of transporting energy through the vacuum of outer space and that exist with an enormous continuous range of frequencies known as {{the electromagnetic}} spectrum. The spectrum is divided into smaller spectra on the basis of interactions of electromagnetic waves with matter...|$|E
30|$|Knowledge of {{the amount}} of global solar {{radiation}} is essential to utilize solar power. Without prior knowledge of solar radiation, it is impossible to design solar energy systems and models. Local global solar radiation data are also required in many applications, including evapotranspiration estimates, irrigation, and architectural design. In spite of the great importance of solar radiation measurements, due to the high cost, maintenance, and calibration requirements, it is not readily available to the designers of solar energy systems (Almorox and Hontoria 2004). In fact, there is no solar radiation measurement instruments installed in any stations of Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Rather there is Campbell–Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder</b> installed in 35 stations of Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) 2015). So {{there is a need to}} develop methods for estimating solar radiation from sunshine duration data or from other meteorological parameters like cloud cover, temperature, precipitation, or humidity.|$|E
30|$|If Eq. (3) is valid, {{then all}} points should lie {{clustered}} along the straight line {{passing through the}} origin and the (1, 1) point. Unfortunately, cloud cover estimation is not free from error. Rather {{it depends on the}} perspective of the viewer. In some extreme cases, it is possible that a small hole in the cloud could remain open {{for a long period of}} time or one small cloud could keep the sun obscured for a long time while moving with the sun (Iqbal 1983). The reflection of solar radiation from the edges could also increase the insolation enough to burn the card of Campbell–Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder.</b> So the plot of Eq. (3) will not coincide with y = x line. Rather it will deviate from ideal conditions. Therefore, a correlation is necessarily to be found to estimate sunshine duration. In this study, we have established correlations between cloud cover with sunshine hour for different stations of Bangladesh.|$|E
40|$|The Campbell–Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder</b> (CSSR) {{has been}} one of the most {{commonly}} used instruments for measuring sunshine duration (SD) through the burn length of a given CSSR card. Many authors have used SD to obtain information about cloudiness and solar radiation (by using Ångström–Prescott type formulas), but the burn width has not been used systematically. In principle, the burn width increases for increasing direct beam irradiance. The aim of this research is to show the relationship between burn width and direct solar irradiance (DSI) and to prove whether this relationship depends on the type of CSSR and burning card. A method of analysis based on image processing of digital scanned images of burned cards is used. With this method, the temporal evolution of the burn width with 1 min resolution can be obtained. From this, SD is easily calculated and compared with the traditional (i. e., visual) determination. The method tends to slightly overestimate SD, but the thresholds that are used in the image processing could be adjusted to obtain an improved estimation. Regarding the burn width, experimental results show that there is a high correlation between two different models of CSSRs, as well as a strong relationship between burn widths and DSI at a high-temporal resolution. Thus, for example, hourly DSI may be estimated from the burn width with higher accuracy than based on burn length (for one of the CSSR, relative root mean squared error is 24 and 30...|$|E
40|$|A systematic, {{semi-automatic}} {{method for}} imaging the cards from the widely used Campbell–Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder</b> is described. We {{show how the}} application of inexpensive commercial equipment and practices can simply and robustly build an archive of high-quality card images and manipulate them into a form suitable for easy further analysis. Rectified and registered digital images are produced, with the card's midday marker {{in the middle of}} the longest side, and with a temporal scaling of 150 pixels per hour. The method improves on previous, mostly manual, analyses by simplifying and automating steps into a process capable of handling thousands of cards in a practical timescale. A prototype method of extraction of data from this archive is then tested by comparison with records from a co-located pyrheliometer at a resolution of the order of minutes. The comparison demonstrates that the Campbell–Stokes recorder archive contains a time series of downwelling solar-irradiance-related data with similar characteristics to that of benchmark pyrheliometer data from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network. A universal transfer function for card burn to direct downwelling short-wave radiation is still some way off and is the subject of ongoing research. Until such time as a universal transfer function is available, specific functions for extracting data in particular circumstances offer a useful way forward. The new image-capture method offers a practical way to exploit the worldwide sets of long-term Campbell–Stokes recorder data to create a time series of solar irradiance and atmospheric aerosol loading metrics reaching back over 100 yr from the present day...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a procedure}} that was adopted {{for the development of}} a linear regression model for estimating solar radiation in Malawi. By making use of sunshine-hours data recorded at six selected meteorological stations in the country, namely: Salima, Makoka, Karonga, Bolero, Chileka and Mzimba over the period 1991 - 1995, a set of Angstrom constants were obtained and averaged in order to develop the linear regression model. This model has potential for generating ground observation data of solar radiation at any given location in the country using sunshine hours as the only required input. The Gunn-Bellan Spherical Pyranometer and the Campbell Stokes <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Recorder</b> were respectively used in the measurement of incident radiation (Ib) in J·cm– 2 /day (converted to MJ·m– 2 ·day– 1 ) and sunshine hours. An Angstrom model of monthly average Clearness Index with normalized sunshine duration was then developed for each of the six meteorological stations. The resulting linear regression model was applied in estimating monthly average daily solar radiation. Regression analysis between computed and measured radiation data was applied to assess the reliability of the generated Angstrom constants. The results generally show a high degree of agreement between the two variables, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 63 to 0. 90. Angstrom constants obtained at the six meteorological stations were thereafter averaged in order to develop a linear regression model for estimating solar radiation in Malawi. Solar radiation values obtained using this model were noted to be in good agreement with those developed for each of the six meteorological stations...|$|E

The method offers a practical way to exploit long-term sets of CSSR cards to create long time series of DSI.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} perceived problem of Thermal Discomfort in Malawi. One observable effect of thermal discomfort was the amount of foreign exchange that was spent to import air conditioning devices. The purpose of the work was to find out, and quantify the problem of thermal discomfort and outline its effects {{to the people and}} country. In order to investigate the problem of thermal discomfort in depth in a place where the necessary data hardly existed a lot of work had to be done. The work has been outlined in four stages of research, analysis and documentation and these are as follows 1 Literature Review The subject of Thermal Comfort appears to be location specific, but the general principles are universal. In that context it was necessary to read widely on both historical and contemporary current work. The problem of thermal comfort in general was being discussed as early as 1758 and still remains a big area of research and discussion today. A considerable number of literature that specifically relate to the problem of thermal comfort in the tropics has been reviewed. The problem of scales for thermal comfort measurement has been discussed in detail. It is still not possible to quote a scale that is satisfactory. However, the recent approach of Adaptive Thermal Comfort Model seems to be closer to the answer than the others 2 Analysing Existing Relevant Information And Data In Malawi In the course of this work it was found out that quite a large amount of useful data existed in Malawi. However, this data was not standardised. Most of this data had to be cleaned and updated. Some of the old formulae are quoted in their original formats in order not to confuse the referencing. The data that exists in Malawi has been recorded on three types of instruments; namely the Gunn Bellum Spherical Pyranometer, the Camp Bell Stoke <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Recorder</b> and the Eppley Pyranometer. Most of the data was recorded using the Camp Bell Stokes <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Recorder.</b> The data recorded on the Gunn Bellum Spherical Pyranometer had to be related to that from the Camp Bell Stokes <b>Sunshine</b> <b>Recorder.</b> The former gave data that was more accurate as was found out when a comparison was made with data recorded on an Eppley Pyranometer. A paper on this subject was accepted for publication in the Renewable Energy Journal of WREN. Wind speeds, air temperatures, and humidity have been analysed to investigate the severity of thermal discomfort relative to locations in Malawi. This has resulted in the identification of three climatic zones. A tool for testing Thermal Discomfort severity of a location by calculating number Degree Days (D. d) if the altitude (AL) has been developed; as D. d = - 575. 994 In AL + 4226. 6 3 Field Measurements In order to investigate {{some of the issues that}} came out of this work, it was felt simpler to conduct field measurements. For example it would have been possible to build typical experimental houses, and extract performance data on Thermal Comfort from these buildings. However, this approach would have been very expensive. On the other hand it was felt that it was possible to find in the field that were representative of typical buildings and could be prepared and tested to extract performance data for use in the work. The latter approach was adopted and has proved to be more realistic than the former. 4 Field Surveys There were certain areas where the only way to find information was not to conduct experiments but to conduct field conduct surveys. This was done once to find the Preferred Bath Water Temperature (PBWT) and deduce the Neutral Temperature Range for Malawi. This yielded very useful results. The first published paper on this work was in this area (copy of this publication is attached). The second area of field survey was to survey traditional buildings in seven selected districts stretching from latitude 9 ??S to 17 ??S; covering a terrestrial distance of over 1000 km; over altitudes from 52 to over 1600 metres above mean sea level (m. a. m. s. l). This again yielded very useful environmental data that explained why traditional buildings have certain structural elements as functions of the environment and the need to achieve Thermal Comfort. A number of useful equations have been developed. From that sub routine of this research of PBWT survey an equation was developed that related the bath temperature (h) to the air temperature (tab) as; tb = 0. 3772 tab + 36. 4401. Part of this work was also published separately in 2001. From this equation the Thermal Comfort Temperature Range for Malawi was deduced as 22 - 27 ??C. From the survey of the traditional buildings, a number of structural elements were that are functions of Thermal Comfort were identified as derivatives of the desire to have Thermal Comfort in the buildings. A regression equation that can give values of irradiation of the locality in MJm 1 Day' was developed. Lastly the results have been extracted as recommendations directed at policy makers, and both Architects and Engineers to use this data and the results in their design work. It is also further recommended that the national buildings regulations could be updated and revised to incorporate some of the findings. It is strongly believed that some of the findings will be incorporated to update the two main Laws that regulate Public Health in Malawi. These are the Public Health Act; Cap. 34. 01, and the Health and Safety at Work Act, 1977; of the Malawi Laws. All data that has been cleaned up or measured specifically for this work has been organised and tabulated into ready-to-use tables and are included...|$|E
40|$|A 1 -year {{inter-comparison}} {{of classical}} and modern radiation and sunshine duration (SD) instruments has been performed at Izaña Atmospheric Observatory (IZO) located in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) starting on 17 July 2014. We compare daily {{global solar radiation}} (GSR H) records measured with a Kipp & Zonen CM- 21 pyranometer, taken {{in the framework of}} the Baseline Surface Radiation Network, with those measured with a multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR), a bimetallic pyranometer (PYR) and GSR H estimated from sunshine duration performed by a Campbell–Stokes <b>sunshine</b> <b>recorder</b> (CS) and a Kipp & Zonen sunshine duration sensor (CSD). Given that the BSRN GSR H records passed strict quality controls (based on principles of physical limits and comparison with the LibRadtran model), they have been used as reference in the inter-comparison study. We obtain an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of [*]∼[*]  0. 9  MJm − 2 (4  %) for PYR and MFRSR GSR H, 1. 9 (7  %) and 1. 2  MJm − 2 (5  %) for CS and CSD GSR H, respectively. Factors such as temperature, relative humidity (RH) and the solar zenith angle (SZA) have been shown to moderately affect the GSR H observations. As an application of the methodology developed in this work, we have re-evaluated the GSR H data time series obtained at IZO with two PYRs between 1977 and 1991. Their high consistency and temporal stability have been proved by comparing with GSR H estimates obtained from SD observations. These results demonstrate that (1)  the continuous-basis inter-comparison of different GSR H techniques offers important diagnostics for identifying inconsistencies between GSR H data records, and (2)  the GSR H measurements performed with classical and more simple instruments are consistent with more modern techniques and, thus, valid to recover GSR H data time series and complete worldwide distributed GSR H data. The inter-comparison and quality assessment of these different techniques have allowed us to obtain a complete and consistent long-term global solar radiation series (1977 – 2015) at Izaña...|$|E
