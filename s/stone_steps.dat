5|$|Ricketts' {{stone house}} {{served as the}} base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's {{excursions}} on the mountain; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build the trails along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls.

40|$|AbstractThe way attackers execute attacks is incredible, they execute attacking {{commands}} form intermediate {{compromised host}} {{to remain anonymous}} instead from their own computers. These intermediate hosts are called as <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host and attacks that attackers perform using <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> are called as <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> attacks. One {{solution to the problem}} of <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> attack is to detect <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host so that we can break attacking path created and used by the attacker. In this paper, we propose a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection approach which analyses the traffic flowing through the host to find out whether this is a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host or normal host. Our approach classifies traffic into two categories <b>Stepping</b> <b>Stone</b> Traffic and Normal Traffic using Neural Network. If the traffic flowing through the host belongs to the class of <b>stepping</b> <b>Stone</b> Traffic this indicates that host whose traffic is being tested is a <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> host otherwise it is a normal host. Our approach allows attacker to insert chaff packets and fixed delay, reshuffling of packet, padding, and encryption of attacking traffic...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stepping</b> <b>stone</b> {{attacks are}} often used by network intruders to hide their identities.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} one of {{the issues}} that are not covered by current <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection based researches. Although dropped packet problems are well-known problem in real network environment, all of the <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection researches just assume that dropped packet problems do not occur. <b>Stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection research already in complex condition where each enhancement of the research attempts to solve problem such as encryption, delay and chaff without focused to solve dropped packet issues. For that situation, this research believes that to make sure that dropped packet problem can be solved; it should begin from the beginning of the <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> research. In other words, to solve dropped packet problem, we must solve it at the early stage of <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> research without combine it with current complex condition of <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> research. For that purpose, experiment has been executed by using NS- 2 to prove the existence of the dropped packet in <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection environment. The experiment has been setup for a basic <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> detection environment.

5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto <b>stone</b> <b>steps</b> and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E

The state bought {{a total of}} 16,000acres (6,500ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000acres (4,000ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000acres (1,200ha) acquired from others. A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the <b>stone</b> <b>steps</b> were replaced, and signs were added.

5|$|On the High Street, No. 106 and 107 {{stand on}} the site of Tackley's Inn; built around 1295, it was the first piece of {{property}} that Adam de Brome acquired when he began to found the college in 1324. It comprised a hall and chambers leased to scholars, behind a frontage of five shops, with the scholars above and a cellar of five bays below. The hall, which was open to the roof, was 33feet (10m) long, 20feet (6m) wide, and about 22feet (7m) high; at the east end was a large chamber with another chamber above it. The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally entered by <b>stone</b> <b>steps</b> from the street, it has a stone vault divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved corbels.|$|E

40|$|Network based intruders seldom attack {{directly}} {{from their own}} hosts but rather stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones ” to conceal their identity and origin. To track down and apprehend those perpetrators behind <b>stepping</b> <b>stones,</b> it is critically important {{to be able to}} correlate connections through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> Tracing intruders behind <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> and correlating intrusion connections through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> are challenging due to various readily available evasive countermeasures by intruders: • Installing and using backdoor relays (i. e. netcat) at intermediate <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to evade logging of normal logins. • Using different types of connections (i. e. TCP, UDP) at different portions of the connection chain through <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to complicate connection matching. • Using encrypted connections (with different keys) across <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to defeat any content based comparison. • Introducing timing perturbation at intermediate <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to counteract timing based correlation of encrypted connections. In this dissertation, we address these challenges in detail and design solutions to them...|$|R

5|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} south end of the church at the top of some <b>stone</b> <b>steps</b> on either side. A window (shaped, like all the others in the church, like a star) set in mosaic is positioned above the door, and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building; in between them, there are patterns of lights and coloured marble panels on the lower parts of the interior walls. The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall, built from masonry, underneath the church. The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011, when a carved crucifix, which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool, was also dedicated. The porch houses a sepulchral slab, dating from the latter half of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Ghats (<b>stone</b> <b>steps</b> laid on {{a gradual}} bank slope to descend {{to the lake}} edge) at Pushkar are {{integral}} to the lake. Ghats are also used for sacred bathing and rites, such as ancestor worship. Out of 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy bath in the lake, ten important ghats {{on the periphery of}} the lake, which have other contiguous ghats adjoining them, have also been declared as 'Monuments of National Importance'. These ghats are: the Varaha Ghat, the Dadhich Ghat, Saptarishi Ghats, Gwalior Ghat, Kota Ghat, Gau ghat, Yag Ghat, Jaipur Ghat, Karni Ghat and Gangaur Ghat. These ghats as well as the sacred Pushkar Lake (which is also a declared heritage monument) have been refurbished over the centuries by the Royal families of Rajasthan and by the Maratha kings. These are now undergoing further works as part of a heritage improvement programme launched with funds provided by the Government of Rajasthan and several departments of the Government of India. There are strict codes to be followed while taking a bath in the ghats, such as removing shoes away from the ghats and avoiding the passing of unwarranted comments about Hindu religious beliefs by non-Hindus, since the ghats and the temples are linked to the divine lake. The sacred water of the lake is said to be curative of many skin diseases. Local belief is that water around each ghat has a special curative power. While many ghats have been named after the Rajas who built them, some ghats have particular importance. Varaha ghat is so named since Vishnu appeared here in his incarnation of a boar (Varaha). Brahma Ghat is so named since Brahma bathed here. The Gau Ghat was renamed as Gandhi Ghat after Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed at this ghat. Nart Singh Ghat, close to Varaha Ghat, has a stuffed crocodile on display.|$|E
