5|$|The silicon-directed Nazarov {{cyclization}} {{reaction was}} subsequently {{employed in the}} synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the <b>silyl</b> alkene anti to the ether.|$|E
5|$|This {{discovery}} was preceded nearly eight years earlier by {{a report that}} treatment of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded the same products in low yields. The major improvement provided by Saegusa and Ito was the recognition that the enol form was the reactive species, developing a method based on <b>silyl</b> enol ethers.|$|E
5|$|The Saegusa–Ito {{oxidation}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry. It {{was discovered in}} 1978 by Takeo Saegusa and Yoshihiko Ito as a method to introduce α-β unsaturation in carbonyl compounds. The reaction as originally reported involved formation of a <b>silyl</b> enol ether followed by treatment with palladium(II) acetate and benzoquinone to yield the corresponding enone. The original publication noted its utility for regeneration of unsaturation following 1,4-addition with nucleophiles such as organocuprates.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the <b>silyl</b> group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It {{has been shown that}} the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{conditions for the}} Weinreb–Nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate {{a wide variety of}} functional groups elsewhere in the molecule, including alpha-halogen substitution, N-protected amino acids, α-β unsaturation, <b>silyl</b> ethers, various lactams and lactones, sulfonates, sulfinates, and phosphonate esters. A wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving aliphatic, vinyl, aryl, and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant side reaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silyl</b> ethers {{are mainly}} {{differentiated}} {{on the basis}} of sterics or electronics. In general, acidic deprotections deprotect less hindered <b>silyl</b> groups faster, with the steric bulk on silicon being more significant than the steric bulk on oxygen. Fluoride-based deprotections deprotect electron-poor <b>silyl</b> groups faster than electron-rich <b>silyl</b> groups. There is some evidence that some <b>silyl</b> deprotections proceed via hypervalent silicon species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silyl</b> triflate is more {{reactive}} {{and also}} converts ketones to <b>silyl</b> enol ethers.|$|E
25|$|When using a <b>silyl</b> chloride, {{no special}} {{precautions}} are usually required, {{except for the}} exclusion of large amounts of water. An excess of <b>silyl</b> chloride can be employed but is not necessary. If excess reagent is used, the product will require flash chromatography to remove excess silanol and siloxane. <b>Silyl</b> triflates are water sensitive and must be run under inert atmosphere conditions. Purification involves the addition of an aqueous acid such as saturated ammonium chloride solution. This quenches remaining <b>silyl</b> reagent and protonates amine bases, removing them from the reaction mixture. Following extraction, the product can be purified by flash chromatography.|$|E
25|$|Reaction with acids or {{fluorides}} such as tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride {{removes the}} <b>silyl</b> group when protection {{is no longer}} needed. Larger substituents increase resistance to hydrolysis, but also make introduction of the <b>silyl</b> group more difficult.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silyl</b> ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an alkoxy group. The general structure is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group. <b>Silyl</b> ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of <b>silyl</b> ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common <b>silyl</b> ethers are: trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively under mild conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silyl</b> ethers are {{extensively}} used as protective {{groups for}} alcohols.|$|E
25|$|The Mukaiyama aldol {{reaction}} is the nucleophilic addition of <b>silyl</b> enol ethers to aldehydes catalyzed by a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride (as boron trifluoride etherate) or titanium tetrachloride. The Mukaiyama aldol reaction {{does not follow}} the Zimmerman-Traxler model. Carreira has described particularly useful asymmetric methodology with <b>silyl</b> ketene acetals, noteworthy for its high levels of enantioselectivity and wide substrate scope.|$|E
25|$|The α-carbon is {{important}} for enol- and enolate-based carbonyl chemistry as well. Chemical transformations affected by the conversion to either an enolate or an enol, in general, lead to the α-carbon acting as a nucleophile, becoming, for example, alkylated {{in the presence of}} primary haloalkane. An exception is in reaction with <b>silyl</b> -chlorides, -bromides, and -iodides, where the oxygen acts as the nucleophile to produce <b>silyl</b> enol ether.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>silyl</b> acetylenes {{avoids the}} problem of {{competitive}} metalation of terminal alkenes. The stereoselectivity of hydroalumination can be altered through a change in solvent: tertiary amine solvents provide the trans alkenylalane and hydrocarbon solvents provide the cis isomer.|$|E
25|$|Hirama {{synthesized}} compactin {{and used}} one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence {{is shown in the}} schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in methanol and then silylation to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the <b>silyl</b> ether. The <b>silyl</b> ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with Ac2O and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in chlorobenzene for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.|$|E
25|$|Borane adducts with phosphines and amines {{are also}} available. Borane makes a strong adduct with triethylamine; using this adduct {{requires}} harsher conditions in hydroboration. This can be advantageous for {{cases such as}} hydroborating trienes to avoid polymerization. More sterically hindered tertiary and <b>silyl</b> amines can deliver borane to alkenes at room temperature. A few examples are shown below. Another advantage of these borane complexes {{is that it is}} possible to recover the amine carriers.|$|E
25|$|The {{selective}} deprotection of <b>silyl</b> ethers {{has been}} extensively reviewed. Although selective deprotections have been achieved under many different conditions, some procedures, outlined below, are more reliable. A selective deprotection will likely be successful {{if there is a}} substantial difference in sterics (e.g., primary TBS vs. secondary TBS or primary TES vs primary TBS) or electronics (e.g. primary TBDPS vs. primary TBS). Unfortunately, some optimization is inevitably required and it is often necessary to run deprotections partway and recycle material.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis of {{the upper}} part of the NanoPutian chain begins with 1,3-dibromo-2,4-diiodobenzene as the {{starting}} material. Sonogashira coupling with 4-oxytrimethylsilylbut-1-yne produces 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-1,4-di-bromobenzene. One of the bromine substituents is converted to an aldehyde through an SN2 reaction with the strong base, n-BuLi, and THF in the aprotic polar solvent, DMF to produce 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-4-bromobenzaldehyde. Another Sonogashira coupling with 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-ethynylbenzene attaches the lower body of the NanoPutian. The conversion of the aldehyde group to a diether “head” occurs in two steps. The first step involves addition of ethylene glycol and trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) in CH2Cl2 solvent. Addition of TBAF in THF solvent removes the <b>silyl</b> protecting group.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent (e.g. hexane). Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl <b>silyl</b> trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. Instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on gas chromatograph (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS). The mass spectrum for 5β-coprostanol - TMS ether {{can be seen in}} the figure.|$|E
25|$|A Shapiro {{reaction}} of the vinyllithium compound derived from hydrazone 4.1 with aldehyde 4.2 makes the first connection that will become the B ring. The control of stereochemistry in 4.3 {{is thought to be}} derived from the relative hindrance of the Si face in the orientation shown on the right, due to the proximity of the axial methyl group. Epoxidation with vanadyl(acetylacetate) converted alkene 4.3 to epoxide 4.4, which, upon reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, gave diol 4.5. This diol was then protected as carbonate ester 4.6. The carbonate group also served to create rigidity in the ring structure for the imminent pinacol coupling reaction. The two <b>silyl</b> ether groups were removed, and diol 4.7 was then oxidized to give dialdehyde 4.8 using N-methylmorpholine N-oxide {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of tetrapropylammonium perruthenate. In the final step of the formation of Ring B, a pinacol coupling using conditions developed by McMurry (titanium(III) chloride and a zinc/copper alloy) gave diol 4.9.|$|E
500|$|... (1) Most often, 5'-DMT {{group is}} removed {{at the end}} of the {{oligonucleotide}} chain assembly. The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or methylamine or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction mixture containing the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting <b>silyl</b> groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the crude product is desalted using ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange HPLC followed by desalting.|$|E
2500|$|Although many {{methods are}} {{available}} for forming <b>silyl</b> ethers, two common strategies for the silylation of alcohols are: reaction of the alcohol with a <b>silyl</b> chloride using an amine base at room temperature and reaction of the alcohol with a <b>silyl</b> triflate using a hindered amine base at low temperature. [...] <b>Silyl</b> triflates are more reactive than their corresponding chlorides, {{so they can be}} used to install <b>silyl</b> groups onto hindered positions. [...] One extremely reliable and rapid procedure is the Corey protocol in which the alcohol is reacted with a <b>silyl</b> chloride and imidazole at high concentration in DMF. If DMF is replaced by dichloromethane, the reaction is somewhat slower, but the purification of the compound is simplified. A common hindered base for use with <b>silyl</b> triflates is 2,6-lutidine. Primary alcohols can be protected in less than one hour while some hindered alcohols may require days of reaction time.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} useful silicon-containing groups is trimethylsilyl, Me3Si–. The Si–C bond {{connecting}} it {{to the rest of}} the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the fluoride ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic protons; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, selenium, or iodine), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in haloalkanes, but at the oxygen in <b>silyl</b> chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the <b>silyl</b> ether hexamethyldisiloxane, (Me3Si)2O. Conversely, while the SN2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (δ+) at the carbon, the analogous [...] "SN2" [...] reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the <b>silyl</b> triflates are so electrophilic that they react 108 to 109 times faster than <b>silyl</b> chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. Trimethylsilyl triflate is in particular a very good Lewis acid and is used to convert carbonyl compounds to acetals and <b>silyl</b> enol ethers, reacting them together analogously to the aldol reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Organosilyl {{chlorides}} {{are important}} commodity chemicals. [...] They are mainly {{used to produce}} silicone polymers as described above. [...] Especially important <b>silyl</b> chlorides are dimethyldichlorosilane (Me2SiCl2), methyltrichlorosilane (MeSiCl3), and trimethylsilyl chloride (Me3SiCl). [...] More specialized derivatives that find commercial applications include dichloromethylphenylsilane, trichloro(chloromethyl)silane, [...] trichloro(dichlorophenyl)silane, [...] trichloroethylsilane, and phenyltrichlorosilane.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to carbonyls, other electrophiles such as imines can be successfully used. For example, using a simple chiral thiourea catalyst, the asymmetric Mannich reaction of aromatic imines with <b>silyl</b> ketene acetals can be catalyzed with high ee in near quantitative conversion. The mechanism of this reaction {{is not fully}} resolved and the reaction is very substrate-specific, only effective on certain aromatic electrophiles.|$|E
2500|$|The silicon to {{hydrogen}} bond {{is longer than}} the C–H bond (148 compared to 105 pm) and weaker (299 compared to 338 kJ/mol). Hydrogen is more electronegative than silicon hence the naming convention of <b>silyl</b> hydrides. Commonly {{the presence of the}} hydride is not mentioned {{in the name of the}} compound. [...] Triethylsilane has the formula Et3SiH. [...] Phenylsilane is PhSiH3. [...] The parent compound SiH4 is called silane.|$|E
2500|$|Like many {{platinum}} compounds, {{chloroplatinic acid}} {{is used in}} catalysis. This compound was first reported by John Speier and colleagues from Dow Corning Corporation to catalyze the addition of <b>silyl</b> hydrides to olefins, hydrosilylation. [...] Early test reactions used isopropanol solutions of trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) with pentenes. Prior work on the addition of silanes to alkenes required radical reactions that were inefficient. As well as with Karstedt's catalyst, Speier's catalyst enjoys widespread use for hydrosilylation, the main drawback is the deliquescent properties of the catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} heteroatom-containing substituents promote lateral {{lithiation}} of an ortho methyl group. Generally, better results are obtained when the heteroatom {{is in the}} β position rather than the α position, as the latter tends to promote ortho lithiation. Lithation of primary benzylic positions is slower than lithiation of methyl groups due to inductive electron donation from the additional alkyl group (rather than steric effects). Electrophiles that react with the benzylic anions formed by these methods include aldehydes and ketones, activated (primary, allylic, or benzylic) halides, molecular oxygen, and <b>silyl</b> chlorides. [...] This section describes the scope of directing groups {{that may be used}} to effect site-selective lithiation in substituted benzenes and heterocycles.|$|E
2500|$|Toluene {{derivatives}} with heteroatom-containing substituents in the ortho position undergo site-selective benzylic lithiation in {{the presence}} of organolithium compounds (either alkyllithiums or lithium dialkylamides). Coordination of the Lewis acidic lithium atom to the Lewis basic heteroatom, as well as inductive effects derived from the electronegativity of the heteroatom, encourage selective deprotonation at the benzylic position. Competitive ring metalation (directed ortho-metalation) is an important side reaction, but a judicious choice of base often allows for selective benzylic metalation. Useful heteroatom-containing directing groups include dialkylamines, amides (secondary or tertiary), ketone enolates, carbamates, and sulfonates. Lateral lithiation of alkyl-substituted heterocycles incorporating heteroatom-containing substituents is also possible, although ring lithiation α to the ring heteroatom may compete with lateral lithiation. The products of lateral lithiation react with a variety of electrophiles, including reactive alkyl halides (allylic, benzylic, and primary), carbonyl compounds, <b>silyl</b> and stannyl chlorides, disulfides and diselenides, and others. A general, highly selective method for benzylic metalation using a mixed lithium and potassium metal amide (LiNK chemistry) has been developed which permits metalation regardless of the relative position (ortho, meta or para) of the methyl group to the heteroatom containing substituent ...|$|E
