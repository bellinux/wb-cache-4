5|$|Minneapolis is {{the largest}} city by {{population}} in the U.S. state of Minnesota, and the county seat of Hennepin County. The origin and growth {{of the city was}} <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on Saint Anthony Falls, which provided power for sawmills and flour mills.|$|E
5|$|Ayer {{has been}} a major {{railroad}} interchange since the Fitchburg Railroad opened through South Groton in 1845, followed by the Stony Brook Railroad, Worcester and Nashua Railroad, and Peterborough and Shirley Railroad in 1848. The original depot was replaced with a union station with a large trainshed in 1848. Land speculation and industrial development <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the railroad access expanded the tiny farm village into the independent town of Ayer.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{signed with}} Phoenix {{a year later}} to an {{entry-level}} contract worth an annual $1.2 million over three years, including bonuses. With his NHL contract, he decided to forgo his senior year of college hockey. The decision was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> his performance at the 2004 World Championships with Team USA, competing with NHL veterans. Ballard indicated that he would only leave the University of Minnesota if he was offered the maximum allowable contract for a rookie, as designated by {{the collective bargaining agreement}} of the time, which he received.|$|E

50|$|Fame is the Spur is a British {{television}} series which first aired on the BBC in 1982. It {{was based on}} the novel Fame Is the <b>Spur</b> <b>by</b> Howard Spring. It depicts a socialist politician who betrays his early beliefs as he grows older, and was believed to be based upon the Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. It had previously been adapted as a film Fame Is the <b>Spur</b> <b>by</b> the Boulting Brothers in 1947.|$|R
5|$|Born into a Fang family, Aubame was {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age. He {{was raised}} by the stepbrother of Léon M'ba, who became Aubame's chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon's first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. Aubame's quick rise in Gabonese politics was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> {{the support of the}} missions and administration, whereas much of M'ba's strength came from the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{eight people}} were killed and damage figures equated to US$71million. Widespread power outages took a toll on as many as 422,000homes and heavy rains flooded {{numerous}} fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage wrought by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the month was exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine {{people were killed}} due to car accidents <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's affects resulted in the death of 28people and roughly US$295million in damage.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{developments}} in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was {{the increased use of}} infantry and light cavalry. The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.|$|E
5|$|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming-of-age epistolary {{novel by}} American writer Stephen Chbosky which was first {{published}} on February 1, 1999, by Pocket Books. Set in the early 1990s, the novel follows Charlie, an introverted teenager, through his freshman {{year of high school}} in a Pittsburgh suburb. The novel details Charlie’s unconventional style of thinking as he navigates between the worlds of adolescence and adulthood, and attempts to deal with poignant questions <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> his interactions with both his friends and family.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary {{has been studied}} since the 1930s. Research <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> {{the possibility of an}} impact event at the K–Pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary, however, there is debate ongoing between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K–Pg boundary, and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary.|$|E

5|$|The {{planning}} {{of the metro}} was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> {{the development of the}} Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The principle of building a rail transit was passed by the Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992, with the Ørestad Act. The responsibility for developing the area, as well as building and operating the metro, was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation, a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality (45%) and the Ministry of Finance (55%). Initially, three modes were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|The private Cloud Club {{formerly}} {{occupied the}} 66th through 68th floors. It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite. Its creation was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> Texaco's wish {{for a proper}} restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a compromise between William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{struggle with}} the See of Rome continued through the Macedonian period, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the question of religious supremacy over the newly Christianised state of Bulgaria. Ending eighty years of peace between the two states, the powerful Bulgarian tsar Simeon I invaded in 894 but was pushed back by the Byzantines, who used their fleet to sail up the Black Sea to attack the Bulgarian rear, enlisting {{the support of the}} Hungarians. The Byzantines were defeated at the Battle of Boulgarophygon in 896, however, and agreed to pay annual subsidies to the Bulgarians.|$|E

5|$|While {{residents}} {{along the}} NY63 corridor {{are against the}} increased truck traffic along the corridor (<b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other groups, also fought the proposed expressway. The general consensus {{of all of these}} groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I-390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{announced}} he would resign as education secretary on May 7, 2010. His decision to leave was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the pending end of the Rendell administration, with the governor leaving the office by January 2011. At {{the time of his}} departure, there were no public school districts in the state with more than half of their students testing below basic levels in state standardized tests, although 14 districts fit that criterion before Zahorchak took the job.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his career as a {{director}} Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was <b>spurred</b> <b>by</b> the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E
50|$|A {{truncated}} spur is a spur, {{which is}} a ridge that descends towards a valley floor or coastline from a higher elevation, that ends in an inverted-V face and was produced by the erosional truncation of the <b>spur</b> <b>by</b> the action of either streams, waves, or glaciers.
