40|$|Fish are an {{important}} source of proteins and healthy lipids. However, they can accumulate nonpolar pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from their aquatic environment through absorption and/or adsorption. Human exposure to parent PAHs by fish consumption has not yet been determined. This study aims to assess the exposure of Malaysians to PAHs through fish ingestion and to estimate the lifetime cancer risk using the cancer risk assessment guidelines set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and previous studies. Giant <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> (barramundi) were collected from a fish farm on Langkawi Island. The mean concentration of 18 PAHs in the giant <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> was 573. 66 ± 47. 56 ng g− 1 dry weight. The abundance of low-molecular-weight PAHs (63 %) was higher than that of high-molecular-weight PAHs (37 %), indicating that petrogenic inputs were higher than pyrogenic inputs. The average daily intake of the 18 PAHs through giant <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> consumption was 294. 47 [ng/kg bwt/day]− 1. The lifetime cancer risks for the 18 PAHs were 1. 06 × 10 − 4, 4. 55 × 10 − 5, and 3. 69 × 10 − 6 when the frequencies of exposure were assumed as 365 days year− 1 for people who eat fish seven times a week, 156 days year− 1 for people who eat fish three times a week, and 52 days year− 1 for people who eat fish once a week, respectively. These results are within the acceptable criterion of the US EPA (10 − 6 to 10 − 4). The present study suggests that the consumption of giant <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> does not pose a significant source of PAH exposure to Malaysians...|$|R
40|$|In coastal {{populations of}} {{invertebrates}} and fishes, {{the distribution of}} discrete subpopulations is influenced by adult and larval dispersal, {{as well as by}} the effects of habitat heterogeneity on site fidelity or connectivity. Here, we examine evidence for spatial structure of <b>sea</b> <b>perch,</b> Helicolenus percoides, populations among four fjords in the Fiordland region of southwestern New Zealand. We examine patterns in adult morphology, length-at-age, δ 13 C and δ 15 N of muscle tissue, and trace elemental composition of whole otoliths as proxies for population isolation among the four inner fjord regions. A multivariate analysis of morphometrics reveals significant differences among populations from each of the four sites, suggesting existence of four distinct subpopulations. These patterns are consistent with observed differences in δ 13 C and δ 15 N, and length-at-age estimates among the four subpopulations. Differences in whole otolith concentrations of Sr, Ba, Mg and Li, and high classification scores based on the whole otolith elemental fingerprint are also consistent with significant subdivision among areas. Patterns across all four markers are consistent with discrete subpopulation structure of adult <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> among the four study sites.

In {{a comparison of}} the nucleotide sequences of the five different genomic regions, the CH- 1 appears to be closely related to the ISKNV, IVS- 1 and Ehime- 1 strains detected in China, Korea and Japan respectively. In quantitative comparison of the viral DNA, level of CH- 1 in tissue of imported fish was 10, 000 times lower than that of IVS- 1 strain presented in the infected rock bream Oplegnathus fascia-tus of moribund stage. It allowed us to speculate the possibility of the asymtomatic iridovirus infection in the culturing <b>sea</b> <b>perch.</b> Such possibility of asymptomatic infection was supported by result of no appear-ance of dead fish with typical symptoms of iridoviral disease in keeping experiment of the imported sea pearch in laboratory for more than three weeks.

40|$|In New Zealand marine {{recreational}} fishing is controlled mainly by bag limits and size restrictions, together with Area Management Tools (AMT) such as Taiāpure (local fishery reserve areas established under the Māori Fisheries Act 1989). We undertook {{a survey of}} {{recreational fishing}} within the Akaroa Harbour Taiāpure, Banks Peninsula, after its establishment in 2006. The aim {{was to determine the}} demographic of fishers, the fishing methods utilised and the species targeted and caught. Two types of fishing surveys were undertaken monthly between December 2007 and February 2009. Intercept surveys (451) were conducted from four of the most frequently used slipways and 138 trip records were returned by 35 people who regularly fished in the area. The catch information from 19 locations in the Harbour showed that the most frequently landed fish were blue cod (Parapercis colias), flatfish (Rhombosolea spp.), rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> (Helicolenus percoides). Since a previous survey undertaken in 1997, the fish species targeted have changed, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) for red cod (Pseudophycis bachus) has declined, and recreational fishing trips have shifted from the inner harbour to the harbour entrance and the immediate area outside.

(1) Concerning the reef-group submerged at the sea-front lying East of Kaimon mountain, it was ascertained that the depth at which the group was set-in showing 35 ~ 60 m, the shape being two-headed-hill type. The setting-in was made quite well, making full use of the topography of the sea-bottom, which gave good fish gathering effect on to the group; and the reef-group gathered a lot of useful fish, such as Sea pike Sphyraena schlegeli Saurel Trachurus japonicus Striped <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> Lutjanus vitta and Thick lip bream Plectorhynchus pictus. And the reef-group was noted to be playing a part as a sort of fish-leading reef added to the fishing ground of the Set Net. (2) On the other hand, in case of the reef-group submerged at the sea-front lying West of the Kaimon mountain, the reefs were set in a scattering condition, separated by a wide distance between the individual reefs. Adding to this, the reefs near the seashore were to be influenced by the waves, and were apt to be buried with sand and mud; as a matter of fact not a small number of them were wholly buried. To prevent them from being buried some of the reefs were set-in over the sea bottom covered with the preliminarily submerged small stones. However, the widely scattered reefs were incapable of getting a good fish-gathering effect. 昭和 59 年 9 月 27 日より 10 月 1 日にかけ,また昭和 60 年 7 月 23 日,鹿児島県薩摩半島南端の開聞町沖合海域に設置されている 6 個所の人工魚礁について潜水観察を実施し,下記のような知見を得た。(1) 開聞岳の東方海域の魚礁群は,設置水深が 35 ~ 60 mと深く,また形態は 2 山型をなしている。海底地形を巧みに利用しているため,カマス,マアジ,ヨコスジフエダイ,コロダイ等の有用魚を多く集めており,定置漁場の誘導魚礁的役割を果たしている。(2) 開聞岳の西方海域の魚礁群は,個体間隔の広い分散型に設置されている。沿岸に近い魚礁は,波浪の影響を強く受けるので,埋没し易く,魚礁の中にはほとんど埋没したものも多く認められた。埋没を防止するため,海底に敷きつめた丸石群の上にコンクリートブロックを設置した魚礁もあるが,広範囲に分散しているためか蝟集魚は貧相であった...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory of {{genetics}} and physiology 2 (LGP 2), {{a member of}} RIG-I like receptor (RLR) family, plays crucial roles in modulating cellular antiviral response during viral infection. However, the detailed roles of LGP 2 in different virus infection were controversial up to now. Here, we cloned a LGP 2 gene from orange-spotted grouper (EcLGP 2) and investigated its roles in response to grouper virus infection. EcLGP 2 encoded a 678 -aa protein which shared 83 % identity to <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> (Lateolabrax japonicas). Amino acid alignment showed that EcLGP 2 contained three conserved domains, including a DEAD/DEAH box helicase domain, a helicase superfamily C-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain of RIG-I. In healthy grouper, the transcript of EcLGP 2 could be predominantly detected in kidney, gill, fin, spleen and skin. Subcellular localization analysis showed that EcLGP 2 distributed throughout the cytoplasm in grouper cells. Notably, the intracellular distribution of EcLGP 2 was altered at the late stage of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) infection, but remained unchanged during red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection. Moreover, overexpression of EcLGP 2 in vitro significantly enhanced the viral replication of SGIV and RGNNV, evidenced by the acceleration of CPE occurrence and the up-regulation of the viral gene transcription or protein synthesis. Further studies indicated that overexpression of EcLGP 2 decreased the expression level of interferon related molecules or effectors, including IRF 3, IRF 7, ISG 15, IFP 35, MXI, MXII, and MDA 5, suggesting that the negative feedback of interferon immune response by EcLGP 2 might contribute to the enhancement of RGNNV infection. Moreover, the expression levels of pro-inflammation cytokines, including IL- 8 and TNF alpha were significantly decreased, but that of IL- 6 was increased by the ectopic expression of EcLGP 2. Thus, our results will contribute greatly to understanding the roles of fish LGP 2 in innate immune response during iridovirus and nodavirus infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
