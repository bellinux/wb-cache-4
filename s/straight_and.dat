5000|$|... <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> flushes: In some variants, <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> flushes {{count for}} two-card guts (making them higher than other no-pair hands). In others, <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> flushes do not count for three-card guts.|$|R
50|$|When ace-low <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> ace-low <b>straight</b> flushes are not counted, the {{probabilities of}} each are reduced: <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> <b>straight</b> flushes each become 9/10 {{as common as}} they {{otherwise}} would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.|$|R

5|$|The terrain {{flattens}} approaching Lindsay, {{which the}} highway bypasses. Between Lindsay and Coboconk, the route is generally <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> crosses through {{a mix of}} agricultural lands and forest. After passing through Coboconk, it descends from the flat limestone plateau into the rocky Canadian Shield south of Norland.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Twomile Run runs {{in approximately}} {{the same direction as}} the nearby Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline. To the north of the Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline is the Wellsboro Anticline and to the south is the Hyner Dome. The Huling Branch valley is relatively <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> narrow.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} end, Highway3 turns south onto Centennial Road and then east onto Talbot Line, {{following}} the historic Talbot Trail to east of Aylmer. This mostly <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> rural portion passes through several small villages before the Talbot Trail splits from it to follow Elgin/Norfolk County Road38 through Straffordville. Highway3 meanwhile curves northeast and passes through Tillsonburg, encountering Highway19. It then curves east and travels {{parallel to the}} St. Thomas and Eastern Railway to Courtland, remerging with the Talbot Trail and snaking towards Delhi, now within Norfolk County.|$|E

He really took it hard; but he finally agreed to harbor me and give me a chance--so mother told me next morning--which was Sunday. I had planned to get home Saturday night.|$|R
40|$|DIAMOND is a {{proposed}} 3 rd generation 3 GeV synchrotron radiation {{source for the}} UK. Flexibility in the lattice is provided by alternating high and low radial beta insertion <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> also by the inclusion of two super-long straights of about 20 m free space. This paper presents {{the details of the}} lattice and also covers other issues such as closed orbit correction, matching of the racetrack <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> inclusion of superconducting dipoles. ...|$|R

5|$|Braille {{created his}} own raised-dot system {{by using an}} awl, {{the same kind of}} {{implement}} which had blinded him. In the process of designing his system, he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own slate and stylus tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> readable.|$|E
5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held <b>straight,</b> <b>and</b> the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{started the}} Olympic {{year with the}} first Super Series tournament of the season, the Korea Open. In {{a repeat of the}} {{previous}} year's final, he avenged his loss to Lin Dan by defeating him in three sets. A week later, he captured his fifth <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> eighth Malaysia Open title, thus equalling the number of home titles held by Wong Peng Soon who won them between 1940 and 1953.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{this family}} have long, broad wings, are strong fliers and, rather surprisingly, given their size and weight, very capable soarers. The body tends to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> distinctively {{flattened}} in the spoonbills.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Borsuk-Białynicka {{assumed that}} in {{standard}} position the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly downward. This {{was based on}} the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament, which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of the head and neck. Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> were carried more horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While {{grooming}} is not difficult, breeders {{recommend that}} it be done daily to maintain {{the quality of the}} coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, <b>straight,</b> <b>and</b> harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.|$|E

50|$|Tubiferoceras {{is similar}} to Phragmocreas except that the dorsal {{expansion}} of the aperture sits on a tubular extension and the shell is <b>straighter</b> <b>and</b> more rapidly expanding.|$|R
5|$|The family Threskiornithidae {{includes}} the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings. Their bodies {{tend to be}} elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> distinctively flattened in the spoonbills. All five Australian mainland species have been recorded as vagrants in Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth and}} final launch from an M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three {{previous}} launches this one was performed <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> level, not in an outside loop {{to assist in the}} separation of the drone from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered engine problems and struck the M-21's tail after separation, leading to the destruction of both aircraft. The two crew ejected and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the Launch Control Officer, Ray Torick, drowned.|$|E
5000|$|Racing at Winton Motor Raceway {{is always}} {{exciting}} and close because the circuit has {{a combination of}} long fast <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> twisty and tight bends.

50|$|Dalby {{has long}} been a popular venue for rallying, its forest tracks, noted for their long <b>straights</b> <b>and</b> {{difficult}} bends, being used as special stages on many major national and international events.|$|R
5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of the}} hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
5|$|Threskiornithidae {{includes}} the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings {{and their bodies}} tend to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long and decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, and <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> distinctively flattened in the spoonbills. Four species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
50|$|This Cleveland Shales {{species has}} an infragnathal {{as large as}} that of T. clarkii, though T. rectus infragnathal is much <b>straighter,</b> <b>and</b> {{does not have a}} spatula-like process on its {{anterior}} end.|$|R
