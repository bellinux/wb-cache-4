25|$|In August 1991, {{there was}} a <b>small</b> <b>Apollo</b> facelift, given the {{designation}} JL, with an altered model range. The SL and SLX continued, with the SLE now available only as a sedan. The Executive pack was now no longer offered, and a sports version, dubbed GS was introduced in both body variants. Equipment levels mostly mirrored the previous JK, although the SLX was now similar in specification to the discontinued Executive and the GS to the JK SLE, albeit without standard automatic transmission. GS specification cars also added body stripes, red highlights, a tachometer and upgraded audio. Appearance-wise, the JK and JL are very similar, with the JL's grille treated with bolder chrome highlighting and slightly altered tail lamps on sedans. The XV10 Camry-based JM Apollo replaced the JL in March 1993.|$|E

60|$|There {{are some}} {{pictures}} {{in one or}} two of the rooms, and among them I recollect one by Perugino, in which is a St. Michael, very devout and very beautiful; indeed, the whole picture (which is in compartments, representing the three principal points of the Saviour's history) impresses the beholder as being painted devoutly and earnestly by a religious man. In one of the rooms there is a <b>small</b> bronze <b>Apollo,</b> supposed by Winckelmann to be an original of Praxiteles; but I could not make myself in the least sensible of its merit.|$|R

5000|$|... is a <b>small</b> <b>Apollo</b> {{asteroid}} {{that passed}} near Earth {{at an altitude}} of 63,500 km on 2 March 2009 at 13:44 UTC. It was discovered by Australian astronomers at the Siding Spring Observatory on 27 February 2009, only three days before its closest approach to the Earth. Its estimated diameter is between 15 and 23 metres. This is about the same size as a hypothetical object that could have caused the Tunguska event in 1908.|$|E

50|$|A notable {{precursor}} of the Temple of Friendship was the even <b>smaller</b> Temple of <b>Apollo</b> in the Amalthea Garden. The first work of architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, the Temple of Apollo {{was built in}} 1735 in the flower and vegetable garden created by Crown Prince Frederick (later Frederick II) in the town Neuruppin in Brandenburg, where he resided from 1732 to 1735 as the commander of a regiment stationed there.|$|R
50|$|The first European {{settlers}} were timber cutters in the 1850s who subsequently established sawmills. Farmers later {{moved into}} the area and a <b>small</b> settlement on <b>Apollo</b> Bay named Middleton developed. A Post Office of that name (with a fortnightly mail delivery) opened on 1 May 1873 (relocated to the township of Krambruk in 1881 and renamed Apollo Bay in 1898). During this period almost all access to the area was by sea.|$|R

It was discovered on 1 January 2014 by Richard Kowalski at the Mount Lemmon Survey at an apparent magnitude of 19 using a 1.52 m reflecting telescope at Mount Lemmon Observatory. 2014 AA was only observed over a short observation arc of about 70 minutes, and entered Earth's atmosphere about 21 hours after discovery.|$|E

40|$|A <b>small</b> <b>Apollo</b> {{object was}} found while photographing the split comet DuToit 2 -Hartley on February 27 / 28, 1982. Designated 1982 DB, this earth-crossing {{asteroid}} passed the earth {{at a distance}} of 4. 08 million km about 1 month prior to its discovery. Asteroid 1982 DB has been determined to be the most accessible near-earth minor planet known. It provides many excellent opportunities for rendezvous and sample return missions, and a rare dual rendezvous mission with 1980 AA as the second target. For a mission to be realized, opportunities to observe 1982 DB during future apparitions must be taken...|$|E
40|$|Two Apollo Soyuz {{experiments}} {{designed to}} detect gravity anomalies from spacecraft motion are described. The geodynamics experiment (MA- 128) measured large-scale gravity anomalies by detecting <b>small</b> accelerations of <b>Apollo</b> in the 222 km orbit, using Doppler tracking from the ATS- 6 satellite. Experiment MA- 089 measured 300 km anomalies on the earth's surface by detecting minute {{changes in the}} separation between Apollo and the docking module. Topics discussed in relation to these experiments include the Doppler effect, gravimeters, and the discovery of mascons on the moon...|$|R
50|$|In the past, the {{overwhelming}} majority of the monks in residence were 50 years of age or older, and through the tradition of the other desert fathers, their piety was linked to a quality of anti-intellectualism. St. Macarius the Great was a camel herder; St. Macarius of Alexandria was a <b>small</b> shopkeeper; St. <b>Apollo</b> was a goat herder, and St. Paphnutius and St. Pambo were illiterate. This trend has reversed since the revival of monasticism in Egypt in the 1960s. Today, monks are well-educated young men with extensive academic and professional backgrounds in the scientific fields such as engineering, medicine, pharmacy, and architecture.|$|R
500|$|The Robbins Company of Attleboro, Massachusetts, was {{contracted}} in 1968 {{to produce}} commemorative medallions beginning with Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo flight since the Apollo 1 disaster. These were purchased by astronauts and support crew personnel at NASA Astronaut Flight Office, {{and a total}} of over 3,000 sterling silver Robbins medallions were flown into space across the 12 manned flights of the Apollo program. Some of these were later sold in public auction for up to $60,000. The basic elements of the medallion design are consistent throughout the 12 medallions in the series, with the main design element and the mission name on the obverse, mission dates on the reverse, [...] primary flight crew names on either the obverse or reverse, and a serial number either on the lower reverse or on the rim. [...] A very <b>small</b> number of <b>Apollo</b> Robbins medallions were also struck in 14k gold, generally ordered by the mission crew as a personal memento. Sterling silver Robbins medallions have continued to be struck for every manned NASA spaceflight, including Skylab and Space Shuttle missions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] A 6 mm-diameter dark spherule, 15434, 28, {{from the}} {{regolith}} on the Apennine Front at the Apollo 15 landing site has a homogeneous glass interior with a 200 #m-thick rind of devitrified or crys-tallized melt. The rind contains abundant <b>small</b> fragments of <b>Apollo</b> 15 olivine-normative mare basalt and rare volcanic Apollo 15 green glass. The glass {{interior of the}} spherule has the chemical composition, including a high FeO content and high CaO/AI 203, of a mare basalt. Whereas the major element and Sc, Ni, and Co abundances {{are similar to those}} of low-Ti mare basalts, the incompatible elements and Sr abundances {{are similar to those of}} high-Ti mare basalts. The relative abundance patterns of the incompatible trace elements are distinct from any other lunar mare basalts or KREEP; among these distinctions are a much steeper slope of the heavy rare earth elements. The 15434, 28 glass has abundances of the volatile element Zn consistent with both impact glasses and crystalline mare basalts, but much lower than in glasses of mare volcanic origin. The glass contains siderophile elements such as Ir in abundances only slightly higher than accepted lunar indigenous levels, and some, such as Au, are just below such upper limits. The age of the glass, determined by the 4 °Ar/SgAr laser incremental heating technique, is 1647 _+ I 1 Ma (2 a); it is expressed as an age spectrum of seventeen steps over 96 % of the 39 At released, unusual for an impact glass. Trapped argon is negligible. The undamaged nature of the sphere demonstrates that it must hav...|$|R
