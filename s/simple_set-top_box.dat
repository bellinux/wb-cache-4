50|$|Kodi is thus officially not yet {{available}} for MIPS upstream in mainline source code repository from Team-Kodi, nor does it as yet support DirectFB or DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) rendering without OpenGL/GLES hardware accelerated graphics support. The combination of MIPS, DirectFB, and DRI is a popular architecture used today by <b>simpler</b> <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> like digital broadcasting (cable/satellite) boxes and low-end digital media players, such as those based on MIPS architecture chipsets from Sigma Designs or Realtek. Kodi ports to MIPS is, however, currently being actively worked on by several independent development teams.|$|R
50|$|Early Ekran {{satellites}} used orbital {{positions in}} the range from 48 degrees E to 95 degrees E, but recent Ekrans, including the current Ekran 20, have been stationed at 99 degrees E. These 3-axis stabilized satellites carry a single 24 MHz, 200 W transponder, feeding a 28 dB gain antenna transmitting on right-hand circular polarization to produce equivalent isotropically radiated powers in Siberia in the range 50 to 55 dBW at 714 MHz. The corresponding feeder link uses left-hand circular polarization at 6200 MHz. Therefore, almost every householder could receive the TV signal at home from Ekran's transponder using a simple Yagi-Uda antenna. There were also various kinds of collective or individual satellite receivers, such as Ekran KR-10, Ekran-KR-01 and Ekran. Latest version of receiver represents a <b>simple</b> individual TV <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> itself. A modified version of Ekran was called Ekran-M. Ekran satellites have been replaced by improved geostationary craft for DBS, such as Gorizont, Gals, and Express.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of ADB <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> {{can be used}} to receive television services from different types of transmission networks simultaneously. <b>Set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> with this capability are known in the television industry as hybrid <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|MetaTV {{was founded}} in 1999 {{on the promise of}} {{providing}} a better way to consume interactive content on TV. Initially, MetaTV created technologies to target existing <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> infrastructure. Early customers included InnMedia (services targeted to Liberate <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes)</b> and MSNBC (services targeted to WebTV). In order to enable a better consumer experience and provide cross set-top and cross MSO capabilities, MetaTV shifted to developing a <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> browser-like application to provide common functions across <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> (abstracting middleware behaviors) and to exploit individual <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> capabilities.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, ADB {{delivered}} <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> for {{the launch}} of digital terrestrial TV services in Italy, announced the world's first hybrid MHP Internet <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> with terrestrial reception {{and became the first}} company to supply the television industry with MHP-compliant <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b> The company received a German-Polish Innovation award and a Cable & Satellite International Product of the Year award for its i-CAN 3000 <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

Some <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> allow the software to be disabled. However, the software disrupts the proper functioning of some older <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> even when disabled. From the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> owners viewpoint therefore Radio Times Extra has similar characteristics to unwanted spam and computer viruses.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, ADB {{completed}} 1.5 million IPTV <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> deployments {{and announced}} <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> deals with TFN Media in Taiwan and Altibox in Norway and Denmark. At the 2009 TV Innovation Awards, ADB was named ‘TV Innovator of the Year’ {{and received the}} award for best <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> technology for its ADB-4820C set-back box. The company demonstrated DivX compressed video and Internet applications including YouTube and Facebook on television using a <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{the cable}} {{television}} networks transition from a broadcast-only network, to a high-bandwidth two-way network, the importance and functionality of the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> increases. However, developments in the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> industry have been restrained by the control the cable companies have over their equipment. Currently, a <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> includes closed, proprietary technology which prohibits its use on other cable systems' networks. This paper explores the possibility of abandoning closed, proprietary <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> standards in favor of open standards. This "opening" of the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> is not a trivial matter since it challenges cable companies' concerns about security, quality, etc. The paper includes a policy analysis of the impact the Cable Act of 1984 and 1992 and the implications it had on the <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b> To help quantify the benefits of open systems for cable television, economic analysis on <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> costs is included. Finally, {{the role of the}} set-top in the emerging National Information Infrastructure (NII) is explored...|$|R
50|$|Cable TV {{is through}} cable {{networks}} and DTH is wireless, reaching direct {{to the consumer}} through a small dish and a <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b> Although the government has ensured that free-to-air channels on cable are delivered to the consumer without a <b>set-top</b> <b>box,</b> DTH signals cannot be received without the <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

The <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> was free to any customer taking the Bundle One subscription package or for an addition fee to other customers, up to five additional <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> were available per account.|$|R
50|$|In June 2011 {{a report}} from the American National Resources Defense Council brought {{attention}} to the energy efficiency of <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes,</b> and the US Department of Energy announced plans to consider the adoption of energy efficiency standards for <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b> In November 2011, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association announced a new energy efficiency initiative that commits the largest American cable operators to the purchase of <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> that meet Energy Star standards and the development of sleep modes that will use less energy when the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> is not being used to watch or record video.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of flat-panel televisions, <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> are now deeper in profile than the tops of most modern TV sets. Because of this, <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> are often placed beneath televisions, and the term <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> has become {{something}} of a misnomer, possibly helping the adoption of the term digibox. Additionally, newer <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> that sit at the edge of IP-based distribution networks are often called net-top boxes or NTBs, to differentiate between IP and RF inputs. The Roku LT is around the size of a pack of cards and delivers Smart TV to conventional sets.|$|R

50|$|WebTV Networks' {{business}} model was to license a reference design to consumer electronics companies for a WebTV Internet Terminal, a <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> that {{attached to a}} telephone line and automatically connected to the Internet through a dial-up modem. The consumer electronics companies' income was derived from selling the WebTV <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b> WebTV's income was derived from operating the WebTV Service, the Internet-based service to which the <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> connected and for which it collected a fee from WebTV subscribers. The service provided features such as HTML-based email, and proxied websites accessed by the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> {{so as to make}} them display more efficiently on a television screen.|$|R
2500|$|TV One, TV2 and {{the hour}} delayed {{versions}} are available [...] "in the clear" [...] over DVB-S on Optus D1 as standard definition only. A Sky <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> is not required, any satellite <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> or tuner will work. However the high definition versions on DVB-S2 are scrambled and require a Sky Television H.264 <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> such as MySky, which costs {{the price of}} a basic subscription plus addition MySky rental fee.|$|R
50|$|IPTV (internet {{protocol}} television) {{is similar}} to a cable subscription, but instead of the <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> receiving information via a dedicated wire, video is transmitted over the public Internet or private internet protocol-based network to a <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There {{was much}} {{resistance}} from cable operators to the CableCARD rollout across the United States, preferring {{to support their}} own <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b> The adoption proceeded slowly with 141,000 units by February 2006. The resistance softened somewhat with the July 2007 FCC ban on integrated security in <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes,</b> which required all new <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> to use CableCARDs as their decryption mechanism. By June 2009, the top 10 [...] "incumbent" [...] U.S. cable operators had deployed more than 14 million operator-supplied set-tops with CableCARDs and 437,800 CableCARD modules for use in retail devices. [...] The National Cable Television Association reported in April 2016 that only 621,400 CableCARDs were deployed for use in retail devices by the nine largest incumbent cable operators, compared to 55 million operator-supplied <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> with CableCARDs.This indicates that the CableCARD failed to achieve {{the goal of a}} competitive retail market for <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper shows a grid {{computing}} architecture called Grid Any-where {{which aims}} at allowing {{the sharing of}} the computational resources from <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> (receiver) of an Interactive Digital Television System. This shar-ing is made in a {{such a way that}} the TV broadcaster can use the <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> tuned to it to get a high computational power and the user can also use remote resource of others devices (<b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> or personal computers) to increase the performance of the application executed in his receiver...|$|R
50|$|One minor {{loophole}} is {{that the}} cable company has {{no way of knowing}} where a given <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> is located, and once activated a box will function anywhere in the local cable system. Subscribers are often provided with several <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> as part of their subscription, and can give or sell unneeded activated boxes to neighboring nonsubscribers who can use them in their own residences, though a provider using IP location using the cable modem within a <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> featuring advanced two-way features can avert this situation.|$|R
