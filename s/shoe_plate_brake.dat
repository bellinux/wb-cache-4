40|$|Abstract. This paper {{described}} an industrial scale experience of melting as-cast high-ductility nodular iron. We discussed the rationale of selection of chemical compositions {{and the practice}} of speroidising and inoculation processes. The experimental results show that nodular iron castings with consistent quality at cast state can be produced using cupola melting technique. The castings of two heavy truck components–brake <b>shoes</b> and <b>brake</b> <b>plates</b> produced meet the technical requirements set in China standard GB/T 1348 - 2009...|$|R
40|$|A {{peristaltic}} pump is disclosed {{which includes a}} roller assembly on which is mounted a series of pump rollers. As the roller assembly is rotated by a drive gear the pump rollers are driven in reverse rotation {{by means of a}} stationary ring gear and pump roller gears. An upper pressure <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> and a lower pressure <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> are positioned above sets of flexible tubing. The tubing is sandwiched between the pressure <b>shoe</b> <b>plates</b> and the pump rollers. A highly compact pump is provided having twice as many fluid channel lines as is conventional. The {{peristaltic pump}} device may be remotely operated by means of a rotary actuator which rotates a driving hub to move the <b>shoe</b> <b>plates</b> by means of eccentrically mounted links. The pressure <b>shoe</b> <b>plates</b> may be moved by the rotary actuator to a loaded position in which the fluid lines are pinched by the pump rollers and fluid is pumped to an unloaded position in which the fluid lines are maintained in an undeformed, uncrimped configuration so that no creases or crimps are set into the fluid lines during periods of prolonged nonuse...|$|R

50|$|The Arai {{drum brake}} is used during long {{downhill}} descents where a rim brake might overheat the tire and possibly {{cause it to}} fail. The drum of the brake screws onto {{the left side of}} the tandem hub, which must be threaded for the drum. The <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> slips over the axle and a small reaction arm from the <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> engages with the bicycle frame to prevent the plate from turning. The drum brake is typically controlled by a friction shift lever like a BARCON or similar. The brake is designed to be engaged continuously during a descent to maintain a steady speed. The standard brakes can be used in addition as necessary.|$|R
50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>brake</b> tester is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} a vehicles braking system in a dynamic test. The unit consists of two moving parallel plates mounted on force transducers. A measurement of the braking force is made when a vehicle passes over the plates and then applies its brakes. The braking action causes the individual plates to ‘slip’ forwards allowing a calculation of braking force to be made. Brake imbalance between {{the left and right}} hand side can also be measured by the differences in voltage measured on each of the force transducers under the chassis. Due to the nature of it dynamic operation, <b>plate</b> <b>brake</b> testers are far less common than roller brake testers in UK garages although they are also an extremely accurate method of measurement.|$|R

50|$|There are {{at least}} 3 {{different}} types of brake tester {{used to calculate the}} braking efforts and efficiencies of a motor vehicle. Roller brake testers, which consist of a chassis with a driven roller system; <b>plate</b> <b>brake</b> testers, which consist of 2 parallel measuring plates, and decelerometers which are usually hand held devices.|$|R
40|$|Potential {{applications}} of high strength, lightweight composite {{technology in the}} orthotic field were studied. Several devices were designed and fabricated using graphite-epoxy composite technology. Devices included <b>shoe</b> <b>plates,</b> assistive walker devices, and a Simes prosthesis reinforcement.

Many others of his paintings take inspiration from the simple life in the countryside in idyllic compositions and by painting peasants having as models people living in Bavaria and Moldova regions.|$|R

However, a knee injury caused by a poorly fitted <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> led to a disappointing ride in Moscow, where he finished 45th. However, on return to France, August to October saw Roche win 19 races. That led to {{a contract with the}} Peugeot professional cycling team for 1981.|$|R

50|$|The TDM850 has an hybrid chassis : {{there is}} a Deltabox perimetric steel frame and rather long travel {{suspension}}s, more trail-like than pure road characteristics. The rear suspension is not progressive, the front suspension is a 41mm diameter cartridge fork. The engine is protected by a metal <b>plate.</b> The <b>braking</b> is far more efficient than with the XTZ, with also three disk-brakes. The front wheel has a rather unusual 18' diameter which limits the tyre's choice.|$|R
50|$|An older {{system is}} the {{toe-clip}} and toestrap. A toeclip is a metal cage attached {{to the front of}} the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the clipless pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with toe clip and strap keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback is that a rider had to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take his foot out of the pedal and for this reason toeclips have been made largely obsolete by clipless pedals. The second is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or a non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage of the rider's feet not being firmly attached to the pedals but had the advantage of being able to release from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand, and also any shoe can be used.|$|R
5000|$|On September 22, 2016, the Ministry of Transportation {{released}} several {{reports on}} the technical causes of the January 10, 2016 bearing failure. Two reports, from Surface Science Western and National Research Council Canada, were released pertaining solely {{to the analysis of}} the failed bolts connecting the bearing to the bridge girders. They both found that the bolts met all required standards and they failed progressively due to severe overloading beyond their capacities. The second component of the analysis involved an engineering evaluation, undertaken by ministry bridge engineers and an independent engineering consultant. They both found that there were 3 main causes for the failure; 1) The <b>shoe</b> <b>plate,</b> which connects the bearing to the girder, was too flexible - creating [...] "prying action" [...] which amplified the forces on some bolts, 2) The bearings could not properly rotate, increasing the load on some bolts, 3) Bolt tightening was not performed, subjecting the bolts to fatigue. The ministry also revealed that the permanent repair to the bridge would involve a [...] "linkage" [...] system that would hold down the bridge and allow horizontal movements due to thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge superstructure.|$|R

50|$|Where skin staples {{are used}} to seal a skin wound it will be {{necessary}} to remove the staples after an appropriate healing period, usually between 5 and 10 days, depending on the location of the wound and other factors. The skin staple remover is a small manual device which consists of a <b>shoe</b> or <b>plate</b> that is sufficiently narrow and thin to insert under the skin staple. The active part is a small blade that when hand-pressure is exerted it pushes down on the staple and pushes it through a slot in the shoe and deforms the staple into an 'M' shape to facilitate its removal, although in an emergency it is possible to remove them with a pair of artery forceps.Skin staple removers are manufactured in many shapes and forms, some disposable and some reusable.|$|R
