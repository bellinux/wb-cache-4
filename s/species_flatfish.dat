40|$|Identifying nursery {{habitats}} is {{of paramount}} importance to define proper management and conservation strategies for flatfish <b>species.</b> <b>Flatfish</b> nursery studies usually report upon habitat occupation, but few attempted to quantify the importance of those habitats to larvae development. The reliance of two sympatric flatfish species larvae, the European flounder Platichthys flesus and the common sole Solea solea, on the estuarine food web (benthic versus pelagic), was determined through carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. The organic matter sources supporting the production of P. flesus and S. solea larvae biomass originates chiefly in the benthic food web. However, these species have significantly different d 13 C and d 15 N values which suggest that they prey on organisms that use a different mixture of sources or assimilate different components from similar OM pools (or both).

40|$|International audienceMercury (Hg) in {{fish can}} present a {{potential}} risk to wildlife and human consumers. Mercury levels were determined in 12 fish species and 2 invertebrate species from the French {{coast of the}} Eastern English Channel collected in June and November 2012. Total mercury concentrations in the muscle tissues ranged between 0. 04 and 1. 63 µg g- 1 (d. w.). Dab and sandeel displayed a significant positive correlation between Hg concentrations and fish length. Seasonal differences in Hg concentrations were observed for dab and shrimp. The lesser weever showed significantly higher concentrations of Hg (0. 97 ± 0. 34 µg g- 1 d. w.) than all other species. Gobies and sprat, which had the smallest size, showed significantly lower concentrations than herring, whiting, pout and sardine. Among the considered <b>species,</b> <b>flatfish</b> such as dab, flounder, plaice and sole displayed intermediate levels of Hg. In the present study, the fish age expressed as specimen length {{seems to be one}} of the major factors governing Hg contents in muscle tissues. Finally, mercury concentrations in commercial fish from the Eastern English Channel were below the levels fixed by the European Union for total mercury in edible parts of fish products...|$|E
40|$|Predation {{by great}} {{cormorants}} Phalacrocorax carbo on juvenile flatfish in the Dutch Wadden Sea was estimated from otoliths found in 182 regurgitated pellets. Pellets were {{collected at the}} main night roosts and in one colony, in late summer when cormorant numbers peak in the area. Otoliths of at least 24 different fish species were found, including both marine and freshwater <b>species.</b> <b>Flatfish</b> on average amounted to 73 % of the fish found in numbers and contributed 79 % by mass to the birds' diet. Among the flatfish species, 0 -group fish were predominantly taken. Plaice Pleuronectes platessa was found most frequently (46 % of all 0 -group flatfish, n = 6318), followed by dab Limanda limanda (34 %), flounder Platichthys flesus (19 %) and sole Solea solea (1 %). Total consumption by cormorants was estimated by multiplying the number of cormorant-days over summer (184 days) by {{the mean number of}} flatfish found in the pellets per sampling location, under the assumption that each pellet contained the remains of the fish eaten during 24 hours and that the diet was similar in all summer months. In total about 28. 58 million flatfish were consumed over summer, 27. 46 million of which were 0 -group fish, including 12. 55 million 0 -group plaice, 9. 45 million dab, 5. 17 million flounder and 0. 29 million sole. These figures are underestimates, because some otoliths were clearly missing, and estimated average daily intake per cormorant on the basis of all otoliths found in the pellets (460 grams of fish) was only 70 to 90 % of the theoretical daily food requirement. In 1992 and 1993 0 -group flatfish abundance was very low and cormorant predation during the period July to September (92 days) accounted for 49. 5 % of the total stage mortality in 0 -group plaice in 1992 and 27. 3 % in 1993. However, in normal years the impact of cormorant predation will be much lower...|$|E

40|$|Groundfish surveys off the Washington coast were {{conducted}} in September of 1975 and 1976 between Cape Flattery and the Columbia River. The primary purposes of the surveys were to obtain estimates of biomass and further our knowledge on population parameters of important groundfish <b>species,</b> especially <b>flatfish,</b> occupying the continental shelf and upper continental slope. Survey design {{was based on a}} 5 x 6 N. mi grid with a random starting point. Samples were obtained for age, size and sex composition from important <b>flatfish</b> <b>species.</b> Weights were obtained from all species of fish. Estimates of biomass, all species, were 143, 447 and 147, 303 metric tons in 1975 and 1976, respectively. Pacific hake and English sole were the most abundant species. Estimates of biomass and potential yield were determined for six <b>species</b> of <b>flatfish.</b> Data indicate that most <b>flatfish</b> <b>species</b> are not fully exploited, but several species may be nearing full utilization. Increased yield could be obtained without increased fishing effort if market demand would increase on certain under-utilized species. Several population parameters were obtained. Age, length-weight constants, total annual and fishing mortality rates and exploitation rate were estimated for six <b>species</b> of <b>flatfish.</b> Distribution and abundance was depicted for major species by catch maps. Distribution of some species was closely correlated with depth and sediment type. Increase in mean weight was associated with increasing depth for many species, Strong year classes were indicated for several species.

40|$|Burial is an understudied {{behavior}} among <b>flatfish</b> <b>species.</b> This study aims {{to understand the}} role of undulations in <b>flatfish</b> burial. Five <b>species</b> of <b>flatfish</b> were filmed using high speed video cameras to assess {{the speed of the}} undulations and determine the amount of sand covering the animal after completing burial. A physical model was also built to test the effect of undulation speed on burial. The results of the physical model suggest that increased speed increases the surface area of sand on the burying object; however this benefit has diminishing returns at high speeds. The live animals suggest that undulations are not the only factor involved in flatfish burial. The posterior portion of the dorsal and anal fins may contribute to burial efficiency in these species...|$|R
