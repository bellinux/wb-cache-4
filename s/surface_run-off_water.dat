40|$|Introduction: Fresh produce are an {{important}} component of a healthy diet, yet the last decades an increase was observed in the number of foodborne outbreaks associated with the consumption of fresh produce. Outbreaks included leafy vegetables, sprouted seeds, soft red fruit and melons. Since strawberries are {{an important}} fruit in Belgium and little information is available about microbial risks and how to control these risks, strawberries were sampled during primary production (6 farms: 3 open field cultivation and 3 hydroponic cultivation), processing (1 company) and trade (2 companies). Materials and methods: At farm level, samples were taken of strawberries, water, hands and substrate/soil during 4 visits, whereas at the processing level, wash water, strawberries (fresh, cut and in fruit salad), hands and contact surfaces were sampled during 6 visits. In the case of the trading companies 41 batches of strawberries were sampled. The samples were distributed over strawberry batches coming from Belgium/The Netherlands (20), Spain (13) and Egypt (8). Hands and contact surfaces were analysed for E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae by using a petrifilm and VRBL agar respectively. Strawberries, water and substrate/soil were analysed for E. coli and {{the presence or absence of}} Salmonella spp. and Verocytotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC) by the use of a petrifilm and the GeneDisc Cycler (Multiplex PCR). Results and Discussion: In general, no Salmonella spp. (0 / 201; 95 % CI 0, 00 – 1, 88) or VTEC (0 / 201; 95 % CI 0, 00 – 1, 88) was detected in any of the strawberry samples analysed nor at the level of processing and trade, nor in primary production. Neither was E. coli detected (< 10 /g) as a hygiene indicator in any of the strawberry samples at processing or trade level. In primary production, E. coli was present in 2 strawberry samples (1, 0 x 101 and 9, 8 x 102 cfu/g). Generic E. coli were enumerated in 4 / 57 hand samples (2, 0 ± 1, 5 log cfu/ 25 cm²), 44 / 78 samples of irrigation water (1, 5 ± 1, 1 log cfu/ 100 ml), 4 / 24 soil samples (2, 5 ± 0, 5 log cfu/ 1000 cm²) and 7 / 24 substrate samples (1, 8 ± 1, 3 log cfu/g). Salmonella was not isolated from any of the environmental samples in primary production. On the other hand, 11 / 78 samples of irrigation water and 2 / 24 substrate samples were PCR-positive for VTEC, meaning that stx 1 and/or stx 2 and eae genes were detected. VTEC isolates from this irrigation waters or substrate samples were obtained in 4 out of 13 PCR-positive samples and confirmed as E. coli O 26 (2 x water, 2 x substrate; the 4 isolates from these samples being obtained at one time interval from one farm). After further statistical analysis, it was found that there was a higher probability to find VTEC PCR signals in water in primary production if water sources can receive <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> <b>water,</b> are not disinfected or are located adjacent to farm animals. In addition, elevated E. coli numbers are an indicator for the presence of PCR VTEC signals (respectively 0 / 16, 3 / 13 en 8 / 15 samples with 1 - 10, 10 - 100 and ≥ 100 E. coli cfu/ 100 ml, respectively, showed PCR VTEC positive signals) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{rapid and}} robust {{procedure}} is described for the decomposition of Actinide™ resin permitting the routine {{application of this}} resin as a preconcentrator. Although the classical Fe(OH) 3 precipitation is effective in scavenging actinides, the need for careful handling to recover the sticky precipitate makes the new method much more attractive. The known difficulty of decomposing Actinide™ resin, which is required prior to the subsequent separation of adsorbed actinides, is innovatively overcome by using a borate fusion attack. This procedure effectively solves the normally encountered problem by safely and speedily decomposing the resin in minutes rather than hours. The alternative and apparently simpler technique of direct ashing of the Actinide™ resin is not used since it leads to a residue that is not readily leachable. The new technique has been incorporated into a procedure for the isolation of Pu and U from natural water samples and their subsequent quantification by alpha spectrometry. The efficiency of loading of the elements onto Actinide™ resin has been tested using both batch and column-based approaches. The integrated method involving Actinide™ resin preconcentration, borate fusion, anion and UTEVA chromatography and electrodeposition provides limits of detection of 0. 001 Bq L? 1 and chemical recoveries in excess of 80 % from groundwater and seawater samples as large as 5 L.

Here, we evaluate the differences in impacts and adaptation issues for water resources in worlds corresponding to the policy objective (+ 2 ◦C) and possible reality (+ 4 ◦C). We simulate the differences in impacts on <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> and <b>water</b> resource availability using a global hydrological model driven by ensembles of climate models with global temperature increases of 2 ◦C and 4 ◦C.

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} from {{municipal solid}} waste (MSW) landfills is a long-term emission problem, which may last for several hundreds of years. The waste management resulting {{in this type of}} problem cannot be considered sustainable. This doctoral thesis focuses on the possibilities for changing leachate management strategies in order to enable a greater degree of sustainability. The first part of the study focuses on results from laboratory and field experiments and addresses the long-term behaviour of MSW leaching. Methodological considerations, qualitative differences between leachates and quantitative estimations are included. The second, applied, part of the study includes sampling at two different landfills in Sweden and focuses on evaluation of - the possibilities and limitations of separate collection of polluted waters within a landfill area and - the possibilities of extending the content of monitoring programmes without extending the analytical programme. The results of the first part show that predictions of leachate qualities should not be performed with small-scale shaking leaching tests. Landfill simulator reactors are more appropriate. The results also confirm that leachate poses a long-term problem and that nitrogen is likely associated with the longest lasting environmental concerns. The time required to reach concentration limit values depends largely on the actual landfill design. The period to reach concentration limits is more generally expressed in terms of liquid to solid ratios than time. The period may be shortened by enhanced stabilisation of MSW. This may be done by, e. g., an increased water addition to the waste, an increased recirculation and a decreased size of waste particles. The results further show that it would be beneficial to implement separate collection of different polluted waters within the landfill area, especially with respect to <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> <b>waters</b> and leachate, but potentially also with respect to different leachates. Such a separate collection would facilitate an effective pollutant-oriented treatment without the need to manage unnecessarily large quantities. The number of analyses within a leachate monitoring programme can, by means of multivariate data analysis (MVDA), be reduced without loss of crucial information about the excluded analyses. Alternatively, it may also be possible to retain the number of analyses, but extend the information to include additional substances, like specific organic compounds. In the latter case, the added substances need to be included in a reference set for model creation. Godkänd; 2002; 20060921 (pafi...|$|R

The Lippe tributary Seseke has a catchment area of 319,45 km² and drains the towns of Werl, Unna, Bönen, Kamen, Bergkamen, Lünen and the east of Dortmund. The Seseke catchment area suffered from “subsidence funnels” where waste <b>water,</b> <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> and <b>water</b> from the creeks gathered and digested; so interdisciplinary solutions were needed, comparable to the Emschergenossenschaft in the neighboring catchment area which hosted the Sesekegenossenschaft in the first years.

Those were normally the subcatchment parts where underground sewer systems were impossible as the mining subsidence would have caused damages continuously and waste water would have infiltrated in groundwater and soil. The Sesekegenossenschaft (and later the Lippeverband) then worked on the drainage capacity by cutting the meanders of the water courses, deepening the runways and lining them with concrete, constructing dykes and pumping stations and establishing waste water treatment plants. All discharge from industry, mines and households as well as rain, surface water and natural discharge were collected and drained in these new “concrete streams”. All costs were divided between the “users” of the Seseke system, depending on the volume and load of waste water or drainage capacity or causer (for example the mining companies).|$|R

However, monitoring is often inadequate or even absent in many poorer countries, rendering validated modelling impossible. It is these countries that are most at risk of mismanaging groundwater resources, and where the possibility of groundwater ceasing to flow is greatest.|$|R

We focus on the arrival-time and amplitude information of the dominant Rayleigh wave phase. Over a 46 -hour period we detect thousands of events using a cross-correlation based event identification method.

50|$|In the North of Germany the {{merging of}} {{adjoining}} land owners along rivers and creeks in cooperatives had a long tradition from the 13th century on. In the German Rhine catchment, downstream of Cologne, the industrialization in the 19th century was leading to a renaissance of the alliance ideas. Until {{the middle of the}} 19th century the river Emscher (running from the spring close to Dortmund in western direction to the Rhine) was a small meandering lowland river of 109 km and the villages along the river had only a few thousand citizens. The improvement of steam engines and the construction of the Cologne-Minden trunk line in the 1840s enabled the economic development and the excavation of vertical mine shafts in the northern Ruhr from the 1850s on. That was resulting in severe environmental and health problems due to mining subsidence: The hard coal excavation in some hundred meters depth caused geological reactions at the surface, too. Locally, the sinking was leading over a stretch of 100 years to 30 m of mining-induced subsidence. The Emscher catchment area suffered from “subsidence funnels” where waste <b>water,</b> <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> and <b>water</b> from the creeks gathered and digested. From the river Ruhr (running in parallel in the south of the Emscher) water supply was installed by pumping stations to the northern cities from the 1870s on but the water carried germs and contaminations, too. Along the Emscher and its tributaries putrid smell, polluted water and flooding were not only restraining economic developments but also causing diseases and epidemics like typhus and malaria. From 1885 on legislative initiatives started to develop catchment-wide solutions and finally in 1899 the mining companies, industrial players and the Lord Mayors of the growing cities established the Emschergenossenschaft to organize the regional water drainage. In the same year the water supply was improved by the foundation of the Ruhrtalsperrenverein that was responsible for the construction and operation of drinking water basins to support the industry and citizens.|$|R

The maximum <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> depth in the year 2000 was 134. 26 mm; in 2005 it was 139. 36 mm; and in 2010 it was 142. 76 mm. There {{was no significant difference between}} Kineros model and observation in field, the relative error was only 9. 09 %...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} data combined with computational modelling {{have been used}} to predict the pit water quality for the Highway Reward mine. Open pit mining of the Highway Reward copper-gold deposit has produced a final mining void with a diameter of 600 m and a depth of 280 m. This void will be left to fill with ground and surface water once pumping of pit water ceases. Several leaching tables were constructed to simulate weathering reactions and <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>run-off</b> in the major pit wall units during a 200 -day leaching experiment. To date, about three-quarters through the experiment, combined run-off from these cells has reached a pH < 4, corresponding to actual present day pit water pH values and chemistries. While sulfide oxidation in the pitwalls leads to an acid, metal-rich leachate, bicarbonate-rich groundwater inflow during the dry season acts as a buffer. Acid generating salts appear to have only a small impact on the overall pit water chemistry. The kinetic test data have been combined with measured pit water chemistry data, measured surface and seasonal groundwater inflows, climatic data, and calculated pit lake surface area and volume to produce a high-resolution pit water quality model. This high-resolution pit water quality model will aid in the mine decommissioning process...|$|R
50|$|The {{idea behind}} SuDS {{is to try}} to {{replicate}} the drainage patterns of natural systems by using cost-effective solutions with low environmental impact to drain away dirty and <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>run-off</b> through collection, storage, and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment, such as into water courses. This is to counter the effects of conventional drainage systems that often allow for flooding, pollution of the environment - with the resultant harm to wildlife - and contamination of groundwater sources used to provide drinking water. The paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining), rain gardens (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting), swales (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), filter drains (gravel filled trench drain), bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other wetland habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the permeable pavement constructed topdown by porous asphalt, compacted natural grading base materials, in-situ soil blended with coarse sand, and geotextile with crushed gravel. The permeable pavement was paved on the field testing site where it was installed a rainfall simulation device to control the intensity of rainfall. The coefficient of permeability and water content for each layer were collected {{as well as the}} volumetric water of infiltration and <b>surface</b> <b>run-off.</b> Test results show that the permeability of surface layer was degrading severely after nine years in service, while base and subbase remained functional. While rainfall simulation of 124 mm/hr performed, the permeable pavement can retain 0. 2139 m 3 of water with infiltration and <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> measured by 0. 4665 m 3 and 0. 1413 m 3, respectively. The analysis of flood peak present that permeable pavement can delay the occurrence of flood peak generated by the <b>surface</b> <b>run-off</b> and ease it quickly by continuous infiltration...|$|R
