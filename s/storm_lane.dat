5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 31, 2006. It moved westward without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 10. An area of convection developed along the wave axis, several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. Convection and banding features organized around a developing center, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 13. The system continued to organize and strengthened into Tropical <b>Storm</b> <b>Lane</b> early on September 14 about 90miles (145km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. Based on a potentially developing anticyclone over the storm and a track over warm water temperatures, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model issued a 46percent probability for rapid intensification of the storm.|$|E
50|$|The {{precursor}} to Lane was a tropical wave that {{formed in the}} Atlantic Ocean on August 20. The wave moved across the Atlantic basin without development and crossed Central America on August 29. By September 1, the system was beginning to organize south of Mexico. On September 4, the system became a tropical depression 140 miles (225 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The next day the tropical depression became Tropical <b>Storm</b> <b>Lane.</b> After becoming a tropical <b>storm,</b> <b>Lane</b> executed a counter-clockwise loop, during that maneuver, the storm crossed its own wake and weakened slightly. After the storm finished the loop, it continued to move westward where it reached hurricane strength on September 9 while passing over Socorro Island. By September 11, Lane encountered cooler waters which weakened the hurricane back to tropical storm strength. Lane then encountered a trough that had formed off the western United States coastline. The interaction with the system caused Lane to curve northeast towards the West Coast of the United States. On September 13, Lane passed over cooler waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical depression. Lane then dissipated on the next day.|$|E
50|$|Tropical <b>Storm</b> <b>Lane</b> {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} and high seas {{along the west}} coast of Mexico, including Acapulco where flood waters reached 16 inches (40 cm) in depth. The Acapulco airport also experienced flooding, though service was not interrupted. Throughout Mexico, the hurricane caused four deaths and $2.2 billion (2006 MXN, $203 million 2006 USD) in damage, half of which in Sinaloa where heavy crop damage was reported. An estimated 4,320 homes were affected by the hurricane, and 19,200 miles (30,000 km) of roads and highways were damaged to some degree, including some destroyed bridges.|$|E
60|$|Their hand-clasp was close, almost fierce, {{and neither}} spoke at once. But they looked intently into each other's faces. Emotion <b>stormed</b> <b>Lane's</b> heart. He {{realized}} that Blair {{loved him and}} that he loved Blair--and that between them was a measureless bond, a something only separation could make tangible. But little of what they felt came out in their greetings.|$|R
500|$|Colonel Philander P. Lane was the {{commander}} of the 11th Ohio Infantry. His regiment departed from its Summerville camp on November 24 with 500 men. The infantry's departure point and route were different from Paxton's cavalry. Lane's infantry marched through a rain storm on November 25, and reached the top of Cold Knob Mountain that eveningâ€”where there was a snow <b>storm.</b> <b>Lane's</b> report mentions frozen equipment and estimated that about [...] of snow was on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The 2000 {{game was}} {{postponed}} when a lightning <b>storm</b> developed over <b>Lane</b> Stadium (notably hitting ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso's rental car), {{the game was}} never rescheduled ...|$|R
50|$|The same {{tropical}} {{wave that}} spawned Tropical Depression Five in the Atlantic became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on September 3. It quickly became Tropical <b>Storm</b> <b>Lane.</b> A {{high pressure ridge}} centered itself north of Lane, keeping the storm on a westward track. This brought Lane into very favorable conditions, and Lane intensified. When the tropical storm reached hurricane strength, it entered a phase of rapid intensification, reaching winds of about 135 mi/h km/h, making it a category four hurricane. The high pressure ridge shifted eastward, and allowed Lane to enter unfavorable conditions. Lane dissipated on September 10.|$|E
50|$|On September 13, a {{tropical}} disturbance located about 125 miles (200 km) west-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, gradually became better organized and was designated the thirteenth tropical {{depression of the}} 2006 season. The depression intensified in a favorable environment, and was upgraded to Tropical <b>Storm</b> <b>Lane</b> later that night. As it moved parallel to the Mexican coast it continued to strengthen and became a hurricane on September 15, and a major hurricane early the next day. Hurricane Lane reached peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) before it made landfall {{on the coast of}} Sinaloa on September 16. It quickly weakened over land and dissipated on September 17.|$|E

50|$|The {{first move}} {{to make amends}} was to drop the 25/8 rule permanently. Two weeks later at Texas Motor Speedway, during the inaugural True Value 500, the {{increasing}} dissatisfaction with USAC's officiating hit the boiling point. A malfunction in the electronic scoring system scored Billy Boat as {{the winner of the}} race. Meanwhile, Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk <b>stormed</b> victory <b>lane,</b> claiming he was robbed of the victory. The following day, the error was discovered, and was another black mark on USAC's record. Two weeks later, USAC was officially relieved of the duty of sanctioing the IRL, and was replaced by an in-house effort.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{despite the}} {{peculiar}} species of ignominy and disgrace that Middleville gossips heaped upon Lane's {{head and the}} slow, steady decline of his speaking acquaintance with the elite, there were some who always greeted him and spoke if he gave them a chance. Helen Wrapp never failed of a green flashing glance of mockery and enticement. She smiled, she beckoned, she once called him to her car {{and asked him to}} ride with her, to come to see her. Margaret Maynard rose above dread of her mother and greeted Lane graciously when occasion offered. Dorothy Dalrymple and Elinor always evinced such unhesitating intention of friendship that Lane grew to avoid meeting them. And twice, when he had {{come face to face with}} Mel Iden, her look, her smile had been such that he had plunged away somewhere, throbbing and thrilling, to grow blind and sick and numb. It was the failure of his hopes, and the suffering he endured, and the vain longings she inspired that heightened his love. She wrote him after the last time they had passed on the street--a note that <b>stormed</b> <b>Lane's</b> heart. He did not answer. He divined that his increasing loneliness, and the sure slow decline of his health, and the heartless intolerance of the same class that had ostracized her were added burdens to Mel Iden's faithful heart. He had seen it in her face, read it in her note. And the time would come, sooner or later, when he could go to her and make her marry him.|$|R
5|$|The strongest {{storm of}} the season was Hurricane Ioke, which reached Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale in the central Pacific Ocean; Ioke passed near Johnston Atoll and later Wake Island, where it caused heavy damage but no deaths. The deadliest storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane John, which killed six people after {{striking}} the Baja California Peninsula, and the costliest <b>storm</b> was Hurricane <b>Lane,</b> which caused $203million in damage in southwestern Mexico (2006USD, $ USD).|$|R
50|$|A wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa, passed through the Caribbean Sea, and into the ITCZ of the eastern Pacific on September 20. The system {{developed}} organized deep convection, and strengthened into a tropical depression on September 21, while 300 miles (485 km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. As the low-level circulation organized further in the depression it intensified into Tropical <b>Storm</b> <b>Lane,</b> later on September 21. Lane developed further with an upper-level outflow pattern, and the cyclone turned into a hurricane on September 23. Later on September 23 and on September 24, an eye appeared on satellite imagery. A trough to the northwest of Lane disturbed its upper-level outflow on September 24. Diminishing convection and loss of its eye caused Lane to weaken to a tropical storm on September 27, and into a depression on September 28. Later on September 28, the cyclone moved into cooler waters and Lane lost nearly all of its deep convection. It weakened into a low-level swirl, and Lane dissipated on September 30. Lane caused no reported casualties or damage.|$|E
50|$|Lane {{formed from}} an area of low {{pressure}} that formed just west of Tropical Storm Kristy on September 13. At first, development was not expected as it was forecast to interact with Tropical Storm Kristy. Nevertheless, the system moved away from Kristy and organized into the twelfth depression of the season, on September 15. Twelve-E became better organized that day, and was upgraded to Tropical <b>Storm</b> <b>Lane,</b> the twelfth named storm of the season. At first, Lane was expected to remain a tropical storm before weakening because of it approaching less favorable conditions. However, due to the improving satellite appearance, and some additional intensification overnight, Lane was forecast to become a hurricane within 24 hours. Lane was upgraded to hurricane status at 0900 UTC on Monday, September 17, maintaining that status for approximately 30 hours before being downgraded back to a tropical storm at 1500 UTC, on Tuesday, September 18. Lane quickly degenerated into a tropical depression, and then a remnant low during the next day. The remnant low of Lane continued moving westward for another day, before dissipating on September 20.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, the IndyCar Series debuted at {{the track}} on a Saturday night in early June. It marked the first-ever superspeedway night race for American open wheel racing. During the race, one of the {{electronic}} scoring wires malfunctioned in the pit area, which caused unexpected scoring errors. Billy Boat was scored as the leader, and took the checkered flag as the winner. Arie Luyendyk, who felt he had been robbed of the win, <b>stormed</b> victory <b>lane,</b> where he was lunged at by Boat's owner, A. J. Foyt. Quickly the fight broke up. The next morning, {{it was determined that}} Luyendyk actually was the official winner. Foyt refused to return the trophy, and the race has since become a famous part of Texas Motor Speedway lore. Luyendyk received a replacement, and the [...] "official" [...] trophy years later, presented to him by track president Eddie Gossage.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Doreen and its {{remnants}} caused severe {{flooding in}} northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. In Mexico, heavy rainfall was reported on both Baja California and the mainland of Mexico. Flooding left 2,000 people homeless in Mexicali along the United States-Mexico border, in addition, 325 {{homes and businesses}} were destroyed in southern California. Several highways were also flooded during {{the passage of the}} <b>storm,</b> most notably, <b>lanes</b> on Interstate 8 and Interstate 15 were washed out. In San Diego and Imperial County, the total damage to agricultural interests was $25 million (1977USD). In addition, eight fatalities were reported in California. Elsewhere, impact from Doreen was relatively light.|$|R
50|$|Glacial Storm {{took the}} early lead {{and set the}} pace from Moon Madness and Unfuwain with Doyoun, Soft Machine and Silver Lane close behind whilst Mtoto was {{restrained}} in last place. Moon Madness took the lead with five furlong left to run but was overtaken on the turn into the straight by Unfuwain. With {{a quarter of a}} mile left to run Unfuwain still held the advantage, but Doyoun was still in contention whilst Tony Bin, Percy's Lass, Almaarad and (on the far outside) Mtoto were all emerging a challengers. Mtoto overtook Unfuwain a furlong from the finish and ran on in the closing stages to beat the favourite by two lengths. Tony Bin was a length and half back in third ahead of Almaarad, Percy's Lass and Doyoun. Soft Machine, Glacial <b>Storm</b> and Silver <b>Lane</b> came next with Moon Madness finishing last.|$|R
5|$|Later that day, <b>Lane</b> <b>storms</b> into a partners' meeting, {{shouting}} at Pete about how Edwin's wife has {{found out about}} Edwin's adultery and is devastated; Edwin has withdrawn his business as a result. Lane blames Pete's methods for losing the account, and Pete responds by citing Lane's redundant role at the firm and challenging his sexuality. To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave. She instead stays with Lane and forgives his blunder, claiming that he'd done to Pete what everyone in the office had wanted to do for some time.|$|R
50|$|While in Ahmedabad he innovated {{the concept}} of Site and Services, an {{approach}} to housing providing access to shelter via developed small plots, allowing poor families to construct their own homes, according to their means. For the World Bank and the Madras Urban Development Authority 1973 he designed over 20,000 such units in four locations, the largest being at Arambakum in Chennai. With the advent of institutional housing finance in India 1972 he created a unique neighborhood of small ground level houses for about five hundred households in Jamnagar, Gujarat. This was the first shelter program funded by the Government of India for the economically weaker section of society. In 1976-79, using funding from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), he built a township for low income households at Yusafguda, in Hyderabad with over two thousand houses, public amenities and shopping centres. This was the first project of the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority and provided owners with road access, street lights, storm drains, electricity and sanitary cores. Around these core facilities low income families could construct their own houses. For the World Bank and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Benninger {{was part of a}} team that devised the (slum) Busti Improvement Program. This approach brought sanitation, potable water, electricity, <b>storm</b> drains, paved <b>lanes</b> with street lighting and community services to millions of low income citizens of Kolkata.|$|R
