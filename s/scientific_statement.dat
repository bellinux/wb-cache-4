The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes {{as a function of}} the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.|$|E

As poetry, these lines are vivid and admirable; as a <b>scientific</b> <b>statement,</b> which they must be taken to be if any one is justified in comparing them with another <b>scientific</b> <b>statement,</b> they fail to convey any intelligible conception to my mind.|$|E

40|$|As {{the amount}} of {{scholarly}} communication increases, it is increasingly difficult for specific core <b>scientific</b> <b>statements</b> to be found, connected and curated. Additionally, the redundancy of these statements in multiple fora {{makes it difficult to}} determine attribution, quality and provenance. To tackle these challenges, the Concept Web Alliance has promoted the notion of nanopublications (core <b>scientific</b> <b>statements</b> with associated context). In this document, we present a model of nanopublications along with a Named Graph/RDF serialization of the model. Importantly, the serialization is defined completely using already existing community-developed technologies. Finally, we discuss the importance of aggregating nanopublications and the role that the Concept Wiki plays in facilitating it. Â© 2010 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to argue that ontological choices in {{scientific}} practice undermine common formulations of the value-free ideal in science. First, I argue that the truth values of <b>scientific</b> <b>statements</b> depend on ontological choices. For example, statements about entities such as species, race, memory, intelligence, depression, or obesity are true or false relative to the choice of a biological, psychological, or medical ontology. Second, I show that ontological choices often depend on non-epistemic values. On the basis of these premises, I argue that it is often neither possible nor desirable to evaluate <b>scientific</b> <b>statements</b> independently of non-epistemic values. Finally, I suggest that considerations of ontological choices do not only challenge the value-free ideal but also help to specify positive roles of non-epistemic values in an often neglected area of scientific practic...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{consequences}} {{are dependent on}} premises that are logical proportions of the phenomena concerned. These proportions are verbal and linguistic statements, and therefore, at the initial philosophical thinking they all include vagueness and imprecision. As more and more scientific evidence becomes available either rationally or empirically the validity degree these statements increases, or vagueness proportion decreases. In the philosophy of science so far <b>scientific</b> <b>statements</b> are either assumed as absolutely correct but more often they are accepted with some probability. However, objective probability attachment to <b>scientific</b> <b>statements</b> is a difficult task, and therefore, subjective (Bayesian) proportions are attached to these statements in practice.

60|$|The fact, thus {{explicitly}} stated, {{is implied}} in all poetry, in allegory, in fable, {{in the use}} of emblems, and in the structure of language. Plato knew of it, as is evident from his twice bisected line, in the sixth book of the Republic. Lord Bacon had found that truth and nature differed only as seal and print; and he instanced some physical proportions, with their translation into a moral and political sense. Behmen, and all mystics, imply this law in their dark riddle-writing. The poets, in as far as they are poets, use it; but it is known to them only, as the magnet was known for ages, as a toy. Swedenborg first put the fact into a detached and <b>scientific</b> <b>statement,</b> because it was habitually present to him, and never not seen. It was involved, as we explained already, in the doctrine of identity and iteration, because the mental series exactly tallies with the material series. It required an insight that could rank things in order and series; or, rather, it required such rightness of position, that the poles of the eye should coincide with the axis of the world. The earth has fed its mankind through five or six millenniums, and they had sciences, religions, philosophies; and yet had failed to see the correspondence of meaning between every part and every other part. And, down to this hour, literature has no book in which the symbolism of things is scientifically opened. One would say, that, as soon as men had the first hint that every sensible object,--animal, rock, river, air,--nay, space and time, subsists not for itself, nor finally to a material end, but as a picture-language, to tell another story of beings and duties, other science would be put by, and a science of such grand presage would absorb all faculties; that each man would ask of all objects, what they mean: Why does the horizon hold me fast, with my joy and grief, in this center? Why hear I the same sense from countless differing voices, and read one never quite expressed fact in endless picture-language? Yet, whether it be that these things will not be intellectually learned, or, that many centuries must elaborate and compose so rare and opulent a soul,--there is no comet, rock-stratum, fossil, fish, quadruped, spider, or fungus, that, for itself, does not interest more scholars and classifiers than the meaning and upshot of the frame of things.|$|E

6000|$|As we find, {{after this}} manner, that Browning does not act satisfactorily {{as that which}} we have decided that he shall be--a logician--it might {{possibly}} be worth while to make another attempt to see whether he may not, after all, be more valid than we thought as to what he himself professed to be--a poet. And if we study this seriously and sympathetically, we shall soon come to a conclusion. It is a gross and complete slander upon Browning to say that his processes of thought are scientific in their precision and analysis. They are nothing of the sort; if they were, Browning {{could not be a}} good poet. The critic speaks of the conclusions of a poem as [...] "transcendental and inept"; but the conclusions of a poem, if they are not transcendental, must be inept. Do the people who call one of Browning's poems scientific in its analysis realise the meaning of what they say? One is tempted to think that they know a scientific analysis when they see it as little as they know a good poem. The one supreme difference between the scientific method and the artistic method is, roughly speaking, simply this--that a <b>scientific</b> <b>statement</b> means the same thing wherever and whenever it is uttered, and that an artistic statement means something entirely different, according to the relation in which it stands to its surroundings. The remark, let us say, that the whale is a mammal, or the remark that sixteen ounces go to a pound, is equally true, and means exactly the same thing, whether we state it {{at the beginning of a}} conversation or at the end, whether we print it in a dictionary or chalk it up on a wall. But if we take some phrase commonly used in the art of literature--such a sentence, for the sake of example, as [...] "the dawn was breaking"--the matter is quite different. If the sentence came at the beginning of a short story, it might be a mere descriptive prelude. If it were the last sentence in a short story, it might be poignant with some peculiar irony or triumph. Can any one read Browning's great monologues and not feel that they are built up like a good short story, entirely on this principle of the value of language arising from its arrangement. Take such an example as [...] "Caliban upon Setebos," [...] a wonderful poem designed to describe the way in which a primitive nature may at once be afraid of its gods and yet familiar with them. Caliban in describing his deity starts with a more or less natural and obvious parallel between the deity and himself, carries out the comparison with consistency and an almost revolting simplicity, and ends in a kind of blasphemous extravaganza of anthropomorphism, basing his conduct not merely on the greatness and wisdom, but also on the manifest weaknesses and stupidities, of the Creator of all things. Then suddenly a thunderstorm breaks over Caliban's island, and the profane speculator falls flat upon his face-- ...|$|E
