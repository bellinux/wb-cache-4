25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{problem in the}} design of decompression tables is that the <b>simplified</b> <b>rules</b> that govern a single dive and ascent do not apply when some tissue bubbles already exist, as these will delay inert gas elimination and equivalent decompression may result in decompression sickness. Repetitive diving, multiple ascents within a single dive, and surface decompression procedures are significant risk factors for DCS. These have been attributed {{to the development of a}} relatively high gas phase volume which may be partly carried over to subsequent dives or the final ascent of a sawtooth profile.|$|E

The proportion of patients categorized as PE "unlikely" was similar using the original (78 %) and the simplified (70 %) Wells rule. The prevalence of PE was 13 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 11 - 16 %) and 12 % (95 %CI, 9. 7 - 15 %) for the original Wells and simplified Wells "unlikely" categories, respectively. None of the patients with PE "unlikely" and a normal D-dimer test experienced VTE during three-month follow-up.
