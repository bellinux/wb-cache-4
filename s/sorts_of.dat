5|$|The {{magnitude}} of diffusion damping is calculated as a damping factor or suppression factor, {{represented by the}} symbol , which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB.

5|$|Both the Sui and Tang Dynasties {{had turned}} away from the more feudal culture of the {{preceding}} Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil Confucianism. The governmental system was supported by a large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations.

The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> entertainment, while Chinese literature blossomed and was more widely accessible with new printing methods.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels.
