500|$|From 1905 to 1907 the <b>ship</b> was rebuilt <b>with</b> <b>forecastle</b> and poop decks {{added and}} her {{armament}} was revised. The heavy 10-inch guns were replaced with two quick-firing (QF) [...] guns {{and the six}} breech-loading 6-inch guns were replaced by four QF 6-inch guns, two on each side amidships.|$|R
2500|$|Armstrong's design used five Yarrow {{water-tube}} boilers to feed {{steam turbines}} {{supplied by the}} Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company rated at [...] These drove three propeller shafts, with one propeller per shaft. Three short funnels were fitted. The two forward 12-pounder guns were mounted side-by-side on the <b>ship's</b> <b>forecastle,</b> <b>with</b> the third gun aft. Two spare torpedoes were carried.|$|R
5000|$|HMS Ghurka {{was ordered}} from Hawthorn Leslie {{as one of}} five Tribal-class destroyers {{purchased}} under the 1905-06 shipbuilding programme. The Tribals derived from a requirement by the First Sea Lord [...] "Jackie" [...] Fisher, for a steam turbine powered, oil-fueled destroyer capable of at least 33 kn. Armament was specified as three 12 pounder (3 inch, 76 mm) 12 cwt guns and two 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. The Hawthorn Leslie design for Ghurka was powered by steam turbines fed by five Yarrow boilers, driving three propeller shafts and rated at [...] The <b>ship</b> was fitted <b>with</b> three low funnels. A high-pressure turbine drove the centre shaft, while the exhaust steam from this turbine fed two low-pressure turbines on the outer shafts. Separate cruising turbines were also fitted to the outer shafts. Two of the 12 pounder guns were mounted on the <b>ship's</b> <b>forecastle,</b> <b>with</b> the remaining gun situated aft.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the cold war, the British Royal Navy was in urgent need of fast escort ships to counter the large number of Whiskey class {{submarines}} being built by the Soviet Union which were faster than the Royal Navy's existing Sloops and Frigates. Britain had large numbers of War Emergency Programme destroyers, which while relatively new, were poorly equipped for modern fleet purposes, with poor anti-aircraft armament and fire control. It was therefore decided to convert the Emergency Programme destroyers to interim escorts to meet the Royal Navy's requirements until new-build ships (which eventually became the Type 12 and Type 14 frigates) could be designed and built. The initial design was the Type 15 frigate or Rapid class, which was a major rebuild of the <b>ships,</b> <b>with</b> an extended <b>forecastle</b> and new superstructure giving improved accommodation and complete replacement of the ships' armament and sensors. At one time, it was planned to convert 57 destroyers to the Type 15 standard, but the cost of such a large programme proved prohibitive, <b>with</b> only 23 <b>ships</b> becoming Type 15 frigates. Instead, a simpler and cheaper conversion, the Type 16 was ordered.|$|R

2500|$|Hawkins made {{important}} {{improvements in}} ship construction and rigging. He is {{less well known}} for his inventiveness as a shipwright than for his management. His innovations included sheathing the underside of his <b>ships</b> <b>with</b> a skin of nailed elm planks sealed {{with a combination of}} pitch and hair smeared over the bottom timbers, as a protection against the worms which attacked the wooden hulls in tropical seas. Hawkins also introduced detachable topmasts; they could be hoisted and used in good weather and stowed in heavy seas. Masts were stepped further forward, and sails were cut flatter. His ships were [...] "race-built", being longer and <b>with</b> <b>forecastle</b> and aftcastle (or poop) greatly reduced in size.|$|R
5000|$|Calypso {{was built}} to the same {{technical}} drawings as the five other Echo-class ships: , , , , and [...] The class {{was designed to be}} 16-gun <b>ship</b> sloops <b>with</b> quarterdecks and <b>forecastles.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 1877–1898, {{served as}} a {{defensive}} cruiser in the French Navy. Lapérouse was built at Brest, with work commencing in 1875, launched in 1877 and was subsequently wrecked in 1898 in the East Indies. The unarmoured cruisers of the Lapérouse class were wooden-hulled <b>ships</b> <b>with</b> iron beams. These ships had plough bows <b>with</b> a <b>forecastle,</b> a displacement of 2,363 tons, a speed of 15 knots and had a complement of 264 sailors. Armament was fifteen [...] M1870M guns later replaced in Primauget with Quick Firing Conversions. Each ship also had eight 1-pounder revolvers.|$|R
60|$|At {{the other}} end of the <b>ship</b> the <b>forecastle,</b> <b>with</b> only one lamp burning now, was going to sleep in a dim {{emptiness}} traversed by loud breathings, by sudden short sighs. The double row of berths yawned black, like graves tenanted by uneasy corpses. Here and there a curtain of gaudy chintz, half drawn, marked the resting-place of a sybarite. A leg hung over the edge very white and lifeless. An arm stuck straight out with a dark palm turned up, and thick fingers half closed. Two light snores, that did not synchronise, quarrelled in funny dialogue. Singleton stripped again--the old man suffered much from prickly heat--stood cooling his back in the doorway, with his arms crossed on his bare and adorned chest. His head touched the beam of the deck above. The nigger, half undressed, was busy casting adrift the lashing of his box, and spreading his bedding in an upper berth. He moved about in his socks, tall and noiseless, with a pair of braces beating about his calves. Amongst the shadows of stanchions and bowsprit, Donkin munched a piece of hard ship's bread, sitting on the deck with upturned feet and restless eyes; he held the biscuit up before his mouth in the whole fist and snapped his jaws at it with a raging face. Crumbs fell between his outspread legs. Then he got up.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Heine Brothers {{became a}} {{founding}} member of Cooperative Coffees, Inc., an importer of fairly traded and organically grown green coffee operating in the United States and Canada. In early 2015, in a partnership <b>with</b> <b>Forecastle</b> Foundation and Whole Foods Market, Heine Brothers created [...] "Kentucky Dream", a fair trade coffee blend benefiting conservation efforts.|$|R
50|$|Crescent and Royal Arthur {{were built}} to a {{slightly}} modified design <b>with</b> a raised <b>forecastle</b> {{and a pair}} of 6 inch guns replacing the forward 9.2 inch gun, and are sometimes considered a separate class. The Edgar class are noted for being the first <b>ships</b> fitted <b>with</b> anti torpedo bulges, when four ships of the class had a refit in 1914.|$|R
50|$|The three-island {{principle}} was {{a technique}} {{used in the}} construction of steel-hulled ships whereby a <b>ship</b> was built <b>with</b> a <b>forecastle,</b> bridge deck, and poop. The technique allowed the economical and efficient construction of ships and was particularly common in tramp steamers and smaller vessels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Knight of Malta, for instance, a 1929 steam ferry of only 16ft draught that operated between Malta and Sicily, was built on the principle.|$|R
50|$|The Swedes had 16 <b>ships</b> <b>with</b> 392 guns, and the Dutch element had 21 <b>ships</b> <b>with</b> 483 guns (making a {{total of}} 37 <b>ships</b> <b>with</b> 875 guns). The Danes had 17 <b>ships</b> <b>with</b> 448 guns. The Swedes {{expended}} two fireships and the Dutch lost one ship. The Danes lost 10 ships captured, including their largest three, and two wrecked.|$|R

25|$|In general layout, the Shiratsuyu-class vessels closely {{resembled the}} Ariake sub-class, or {{final version of}} the Hatsuharu class, differing only in the more compact bridge design and the shape and {{inclination}} of the funnels. The hull retained the general configuration of the Hatsuharu class <b>with</b> a long <b>forecastle</b> <b>with</b> a pronounced flare to improve sea-keeping at high speeds by adding buoyancy and reducing the spray and water coming over the deck.|$|R

50|$|An oblong {{building}} {{joined together}} with a prismatic tower with an entrance gate formed the original fortress. Gradually a <b>forecastle</b> <b>with</b> auxiliary buildings and a water cistern {{were added to the}} castle. At the turn of the 15th to the 16th century the safety of the castle was increased by building a bulky fortress in the foreground, on the rock behind the moat. With the increasing risk of Ottoman raids the Ostrý Kameň castle was expanded <b>with</b> a second <b>forecastle</b> <b>with</b> a circular corner bastion. In {{the second half of the}} 16th century additional forecastles were added. Today only some fragments of walls of three bastions are left although there were also auxiliary buildings, residential buildings, storerooms, a bakery and a forge erected on the castle grounds.|$|R
