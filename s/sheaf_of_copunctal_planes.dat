40|$|An {{important}} part of the classical theory of real or complex manifolds is the theory of (smooth, real analytic or complex analytic) vector bundles. With any vector bundle over a manifold (M,F) the <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> its (smooth, real analytic or complex analytic) sections is associated which is a locally free <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> F-modules, and in this way all the locally free <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> F-modules over (M,F) can be obtained. In the present paper, locally free <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> O-modules over a complex analytic supermanifold (M,O) are studied. The main results of the paper are the following ones. Given a locally free <b>sheaf</b> E <b>of</b> O-modules over a complex analytic supermanifold (M,O), we construct a locally free sheaf over the retract of (M,O) which is called the retract of E. Our first result is a classification <b>of</b> locally free <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> modules which have a given retract in terms of non-abelian 1 -cohomology. The case <b>of</b> the tangent <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> a split supermanifold is studied in more details. Then we study locally free <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> modules over projective superspaces. A spectral sequence which connects the cohomology with values in a locally free <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> modules with the cohomology with values in its retract is constructed.

40|$|This {{article is}} the first report of an ongoing project aimed at finding a {{geometric}} interpretation of the Witten genus and other tmf classes. Section 2 reviews the <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> chiral differential operators (CDOs) over a complex manifold, including their construction, obstructions and relation with the Witten genus. In section 3, the structure <b>of</b> each <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> CDOs is reorganized in terms of modules over the <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> holomorphic functions.
