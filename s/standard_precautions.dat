Although the principle of universal precautions is widely advocated and followed throughout the dental community, additional precautionary measures - termed <b>standard</b> <b>precaution</b> may be necessary to help control the spread of this highly contagious disease. Patient assessment should include questions on recent travel to SARS infected areas and, contacts of patients, fever and symptoms of respiratory infections. Special management protocols and modified measures that regulate droplet and aerosol contamination in a dental setting have to be introduced and may include the reduction or avoidance of droplet/aerosol generation, the disinfection of the treatment field, application of rubber dam, pre-procedural antiseptic mouthrinse and the dilution and efficient removal of contaminated ambient air.

40|$|Abstract Background Many Highly Resistant Gram Negative Rod (HR-GNR) {{positive}} {{patients are}} found unexpectedly in clinical cultures, besides {{patients who are}} screened and isolated based on risk factors. As unexpected HR-GNR positive patients are isolated after detection, transmission to contact patients possibly occurred. The added value of routine contact tracing in such situations within hospitals with <b>standard</b> hygiene <b>precautions</b> is unknown. Methods In 2014, this study was performed as a prospective cohort study. Index patients were defined as those tested unexpectedly HR-GNR positive in clinical cultures to diagnose a possible infection and were nursed under <b>standard</b> hygiene <b>precautions</b> before tested positive. After detection they were nursed in contact isolation. Contact patients were still hospitalized and shared {{the same room with}} the index patient for at least 12  h. HR-GNR screening was performed by culturing a rectal and throat swab. Clonal relatedness of HR-GNR isolates was determined using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results Out of 152 unexpected HR-GNR positive patients, 35 patients (23. 0 %) met our inclusion criteria for index patient. ESBL E. coli was found most frequently (n =  20, 57. 1 %), followed by Q&A E. coli (n =  10, 28. 6 %), ESBL K. pneumoniae (n =  3, 8. 5 %), ESBL R. ornithinolytica (n =  1, 2. 9 %) and multi resistant P. aeruginosa (n =  1, 2. 9 %). After contact tracing, 69 patients were identified as contact patient of an index patient, with a median time between start of contact and sampling of 3 days. None were found HR-GNR positive by nosocomial transmission. Conclusions In a local setting within hospitals with <b>standard</b> hygiene <b>precautions,</b> routine contact tracing among unexpected HR-GNR positive patients may be replaced by appropriate surveillance as we found no nosocomial transmission in short term contacts...|$|R
40|$|To reexamine {{measures}} for preventing of hospital infections caused by medical staff {{and in order}} to decrease hospital infection rates, MRSA inhabitation and transmission patterns were investigated in two facilities (hospitals X and Y), by gene analysis using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The DNA patterns of MRSA isolated from patients and from the fingers and uniforms of nurses, who cared for the patients, were identical, indicating inadequate <b>standard</b> <b>precaution</b> (SP) practice, including proper hand washing and gown technique. The results were reported to the facilities, and new infection control procedures were instituted. After implementation of the revised guidelines, the same survey was repeated in the same wards. In hospital X, no MRSA strain was isolated from individuals other than the MRSA patients. The new procedures based on the epidemiological investigation by PFGE were effective in preventing of hospital infections. In contrast, hospital Y was unable to institute systematic {{measures for}} infection control, and contamination and transmission of MRSA appeared in the second investigation, showing that the survey results had no effect.
