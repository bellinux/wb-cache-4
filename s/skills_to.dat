40|$|Introduction: Informal {{caregivers}} {{provide a}} significant part of the total care needed by dependent older people poststroke. Although informal care is often the preferred option of those who provide and those who receive informal care, informal caregivers often report lack of preparation to take care of older dependent people. This article outlines the development and psychometric testing of informal caregivers’ skills when providing care to older people after a stroke – ECPICID-AVC. Design: Prospective psychometric instrument validation study. Methods: Eleven experts participated in a focus group in order to delineate, develop and validate the instrument. Data were gathered among adult informal caregivers (n = 186) living in the community in Northern Portugal from August 2013 to January 2014. Results: The 32 -item scale describes several aspects of informal caregiver’s skills. The scale has eight factors: <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> feed/hydrate by nasogastric feeding, <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> assist the person in personal hygiene, <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> assist the person for transferring, <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> assist the person for positioning, <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> provide technical aids, <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> assist the person to use the toilet, <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> feed/hydrate and <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> provide technical aids for dressing/undressing. Analysis demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 83) and good temporal stability 0. 988 (0. 984 – 0. 991). Conclusion: The psychometric properties of the measurement tool showed acceptable results allowing its implementation in clinical practice by the nursing community staff for evaluating practical skills in informal caregivers when providing care to older stroke survivors living at home.
