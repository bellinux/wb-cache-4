50|$|<b>Sitagliptin</b> (Januvia) has a novel {{structure}} with β-amino amide derivatives (Figure 7). Since <b>sitagliptin</b> has shown excellent selectivity and in vivo efficacy it urged researchers {{to inspect the}} new structure of DPP-4 inhibitors with appended β-amino acid moiety. Further studies are being developed to optimize these compounds {{for the treatment of}} diabetes.In October 2006 <b>sitagliptin</b> became the first DPP-4 inhibitor that got FDA approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Crystallographic structure of <b>sitagliptin</b> along with molecular modeling has been used to continue the search for structurally diverse inhibitors. A new potent, selective and orally bioavailable DPP-4 inhibitor was discovered by replacing the central cyclohexylamine in <b>sitagliptin</b> with 3-aminopiperidine. A 2-pyridyl substitution was the initial SAR breakthrough since that group plays a significant role in potency and selectivity for DPP-4.|$|E

The patent for simvastatin expired in 2006 and many companies began to create a generic product of simvastatin. By creating a combined-dosage form of simvastatin and <b>sitagliptin,</b> Merck was able to increase their sales of simvastatin while meeting the need of patients who take both simvastatin and <b>sitagliptin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Canagliflozin is an anti-diabetic drug used {{to improve}} glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. In {{extensive}} clinical trials, canagliflozin produced a consistent dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c levels of 0.77% to 1.16% when administered either as monotherapy, in combination with metformin, in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, in combination with metformin and pioglitazone, or in combination with insulin, from initial HbA1c levels of 7.8% to 8.1%. When added to metformin, canagliflozin daily was shown to be non-inferior to both <b>sitagliptin</b> 100 mg daily and glimepiride in reducing HbA1c levels at one year, whilst canagliflozin 300 mg successfully demonstrated statistical superiority over both <b>sitagliptin</b> and glimiperide in decreasing HbA1c levels. Secondary efficacy endpoints of higher reductions in weight and blood pressure (versus <b>sitagliptin</b> and glimiperide) were also observed in studies. Canagliflozin produces beneficial effects on HDL cholesterol whilst increasing LDL cholesterol to produce no change in total cholesterol.|$|E
5000|$|Simvastatin/sitagliptin (brand name Juvisync) is a fixed-dose {{combination}} drug consisting of <b>sitagliptin</b> and simvastatin. <b>Sitagliptin</b> is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor {{used to treat}} type 2 diabetes and simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used to treat hypercholesterolemia.

50|$|Glycemic {{variability}} {{and chronic}} sustained hyperglycemia {{are the main}} components of dysglycemia in diabetes. The previous studies suggested that different pharmacodynamic profiles between DPP-4 inhibitors have been associated with the different effects on glycemic variability. In this study, a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group, open-label, exploratory study was designed to evaluate the efficacy on glycemic variability and safety of initial combination therapy of gemigliptin 50 mg qd versus <b>sitagliptin</b> 100 mg qd, or glimepiride 2 mg qd with metformin in patients with T2DM (study identifier: LG-DPCL012, STABLE study; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01890629). The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and SD of glucose were used for assessing glucose fluctuations from the baseline after 12 weeks of treatment. At 12 weeks, MAGE was significantly lower in the DPP-4 inhibitor groups (gemigliptin and <b>sitagliptin)</b> than in the glimepiride group (-43.1, -38.3, and -21.7 mg/dL, respectively). Furthermore, the SD of mean glucose was significantly lower in patients with gemigliptin when compared with <b>sitagliptin</b> (P=0.023) and glimepiride (P=0.0058).|$|E

[...] One study with lab rats published in 2009 concluded that some of the possible risks of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer may be reduced when it is used with metformin.

50|$|A 24-week, multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study (study identifier: LG-DPCL006; ClinicalTrials.gov {{registration}} number: NCT01602003) {{was designed}} to assess the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin 50 mg compared to the active control (<b>sitagliptin)</b> added to ongoing metformin therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin alone (HbA1c, 7% to 11%). After 24 weeks, the reduction from baseline for HbA1c was 0.81% for gemigliptin 25 mg twice a day (bid) and 0.77% for gemigliptin 50 mg qd, and {{the differences in the}} least square mean changes from baseline between groups (each group of gemigliptin-sitagliptin group) were −0.011% in gemigliptin 25 mg bid and 0.004% in gemigliptin 50 mg qd. The proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c <7% at week 24 (gemigliptin 25 mg bid group, 50%; gemigliptin 50 mg qd group, 54.07%) was comparable to the results with <b>sitagliptin</b> 100 mg qd (48.87%). The efficacy of lowering HbA1c in the gemigliptin group was generally consistent across the subgroups based on age (<65 or ≥65 years), gender, duration of T2DM (5, >5 to 10, or >10 years), and baseline body mass index (BMI, <25 or ≥25 kg/m2). In addition, gemigliptin groups led to a significantly greater inhibition of plasma DPP-4 compared to <b>sitagliptin.</b> This study was extended by 28 weeks in order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of gemigliptin. All treatment groups showed clinically and statistically (P<0.0001) significant improvement in glycemic control from baseline after 52 weeks. The reduction from the baseline in HbA1c was -1.06 (95% CI, -1.28 to -0.85) in the patients who continued to receive gemigliptin 50 mg qd.|$|E

5000|$|This is a {{different}} class of inhibitors that was identified with HTS. [...] Aromatic heterocyclic-based DPP-4 inhibitors have gained increased attention recently. The first patents describing xanthines (Figure 10) as DPP-4 inhibitors came from Boehringer-Ingelheim(BI) and Novo Nordisk.When xanthine based DPP-4 inhibitors are compared with <b>sitagliptin</b> and vildagliptin it has shown a superior profile.

In a joint letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, the agencies stated {{that they had not}} yet reached a final conclusion regarding a possible causative relationship.|$|E
50|$|Interactions {{are very}} {{important}} for SGLT2 inhibitors because most T2DM patients are taking many other medications. There is low risk of clinically relevant pharmacokinetics drug interactions because of the metabolic pathway of SGLT2.According to Bhartia and his co-workers, {{it is safe to}} consume dapagliflozin along with pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride, or <b>sitagliptin</b> and dose adjustment is unnecessary for either drug. It is unlikely that food intake has clinical meaningful impact on the efficacy of dapagliflozin, therefore it can be administered without regard to meals.|$|E
50|$|Results are in µg/mL.

Values over 10 µg/mL indicate glucose on average is below 180 mg/dL. Those with values below 10 µg/mL could benefit from nutritional counseling, and medications which target post meal glucose spikes, such as pramlintide, exenatide, <b>sitagliptin,</b> saxagliptin, repaglinide or rapid acting insulins.|$|E
