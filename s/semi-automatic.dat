5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– <b>semi-automatic</b> fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces <b>semi-automatic</b> fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{there is a}} relatively high proportion of <b>semi-automatic</b> firearms in the country, which are generally considered better suited for self-defense. The most owned firearms {{in the country are}} CZ 75 Compact and Glock 17. Other popular guns include 1911 clones and <b>semi-automatic</b> rifles made by Czech manufacturers, especially vz. 58 and AR 15 (of which there are 3 manufacturers). There are relatively fewer revolvers, mostly from US manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Colt, or Czech producers ALFA and Kora.|$|E
5|$|During {{the scene}} at the town hall, several {{citizens}} are seen stroking guns: Smithers has a revolver, an unidentified woman also has a revolver, Moe has a shotgun, Skinner has a <b>semi-automatic</b> handgun with a suppressor attached, and Barney has a derringer.|$|E
5|$|Includes {{single shot}} or bolt action rifles longer than 280 mm, shotguns, <b>semi-automatic</b> rifles not {{included}} in B, air rifles with muzzle energy over 16 J and black powder repeaters.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{month after}} Wood's conviction, the Hungerford {{massacre}} took place, in which Michael Robert Ryan killed 16 people. This prompted Parliament to pass the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, which banned civilian ownership of nearly all <b>semi-automatic</b> weapons.|$|E
5|$|The first Bond film, Dr. No, saw M {{ordering}} Bond {{to leave}} his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK, which the film Bond used in eighteen films. In Tomorrow Never Dies and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the Walther P99 <b>semi-automatic</b> pistol.|$|E
5|$|As MalcolmX and his bodyguards {{tried to}} quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing <b>semi-automatic</b> handguns. MalcolmX was {{pronounced}} dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} of the P90 {{led to the creation}} of the P90 TR model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 triple rail interface for mounting accessories. This model was introduced in late 1999 and continues to be offered alongside the standard P90. More recently, the P90 has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90, a <b>semi-automatic</b> carbine intended for personal protection and sporting use.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a <b>semi-{{automatic}}</b> or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Since the electrode is continuous, welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, 1995, Adams {{was arrested}} {{at his home in}} Kona, Hawaii, after {{narcotics}} officers searched his home and discovered 500 units of anabolic steroids and several unregistered <b>semi-automatic</b> guns. He was released on $10,275 bail. On October 28, 1995, he was sentenced to five years probation after pleading no-contest to 11 counts of drug and weapons charges.|$|E
5|$|Police {{officers}} are not armed with firearms during patrolling, but have weapons locked {{down in the}} patrol cars. Arming of the locked-down weapons requires permission from {{the chief of police}} or someone designated by him. The police use Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 <b>semi-automatic</b> pistols. The Emergency Response Unit uses Diemaco C8 assault rifles. Norwegian police officers do not use electroshock weapons.|$|E
5|$|Risk to {{defensive}} capabilities: Security {{forces are}} not changing armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end of firearms manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, familiarity with <b>semi-automatic</b> versions of army rifles by civilians {{is a clear}} defensive advantage in case these {{people need to be}} drafted to defend the country.|$|E
5|$|Some {{items of}} sports equipment, which rely on {{high-performance}} materials, {{have been made}} with scandium-aluminium alloys, including baseball bats and bicycle frames and components. Lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium. The American firearm manufacturing company Smith & Wesson produces <b>semi-automatic</b> pistols and revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.|$|E
5|$|The Kauhajoki school {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} 23 September 2008, at the Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences {{in the former}} province of Western Finland. The gunman, 22-year-old student Matti Juhani Saari, shot and killed ten people with a Walther P22 <b>semi-automatic</b> pistol, before shooting himself in the head. He died {{a few hours later}} in Tampere University Hospital. One woman was injured but was in a stable condition.|$|E
5|$|The note further elaborates {{that unlike}} {{the rest of}} the EU, where most guns are owned for hunting, the vast {{majority}} of Czech gun owners possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, <b>semi-automatic</b> rifles (which are subject to the proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).|$|E
5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are <b>semi-automatic.</b> Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the {{brothers}} in the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a <b>semi-automatic</b> firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} <b>semi-automatic</b> or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a <b>semi-automatic</b> pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher. An earlier version of the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, {{but this was the first}} time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Sometime after 4p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc Lépine {{arrived at}} the {{building}} housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, armed with a <b>semi-automatic</b> rifle and a hunting knife. He had purchased a Ruger Mini-14 on November 21, 1989 in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal, telling the clerk {{that he was going}} to use it to hunt small game. Lépine was familiar with the layout of the building since he had been in and around the École Polytechnique at least seven times in the weeks leading up to the event.|$|E
5|$|The P90 is {{currently}} in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, such as Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Greece, India, Malaysia, Poland, and the United States. In the United States, the P90 is in use with over 200 law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service. While developed and initially marketed as a PDW, {{it can also be}} considered a submachine gun or compact assault rifle. The standard selective fire P90 is restricted to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2005, a <b>semi-automatic</b> version has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90.|$|E
5|$|The Platte Canyon High School {{hostage crisis}} was a hostage taking and {{shooting}} at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, on September 27, 2006. The gunman, 53-year-old Duane Roger Morrison, took six female students hostage and sexually assaulted them, later releasing four. When police broke open the classroom's door with explosives, Morrison opened {{fire with a}} <b>semi-automatic</b> pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head. The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed, and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had committed suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom. Keyes was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. MDT (23:32 UTC) at Saint Anthony's Hospital in Denver, Colorado after undergoing emergency surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} {{arrived at}} the church and promptly arrested the brothers, tying them with their hands behind their backs. After the arrest, Nhung and Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa sat with Diệm and Nhu inside the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. They stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip where, by all accounts, the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn later determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a <b>semi-automatic</b> firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing their bodies with a knife.|$|E
5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, he scanned the area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly to the elevator at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) <b>semi-automatic</b> rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt. He took the elevator to the top floor.|$|E
5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was <b>semi-automatic,</b> the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E
5|$|Approval {{was given}} on 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of the}} AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A <b>Semi-Automatic</b> Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a <b>semi-automatic).</b> He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore <b>Semi-Automatic</b> Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6, {{launched}} on a Proton 8K82K rocket on 29 September 1977, marked {{the switch from}} engineering development stations to routine operations, and united the most effective elements {{from each of the}} previous stations. Its navigation system, made up of the Delta <b>semi-automatic</b> computer to depict the station's orbit and the Kaskad system to control its orientation, was based on that used on Salyut 4, as was its power system, which consisted of a trio of steerable solar panels together producing a peak of 4kilowatts of power over 51m². The station's thermal regulation systems, which made use of a sophisticated arrangement of insulation and radiators, was also derived from that used on Salyut 4. In addition, Salyut 6 made use of environmental systems first used on Salyut 3, and controlled its orientation using gyrodynes first tested on that station.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 White House {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} November 11, 2011, when Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an unemployed 21-year-old man, fired a <b>semi-automatic</b> rifle at the White House, the official {{residence of the}} U.S. President in Washington, D.C. At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama were home at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the shooting from an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, {{to find out why}} the first family had not been informed.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's <b>semi-automatic</b> rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as <b>semi-automatic</b> and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. <b>Semi-automatic</b> pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by <b>semi-automatic</b> pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
