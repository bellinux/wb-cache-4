5|$|Shakshuka, a North-African (Tunisian) dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, is a {{national}} favorite, especially in the winter. It is traditionally served up in a cast iron pan with bread to mop up the sauce. Some variations of the dish are cooked with liberal use of ingredients such as eggplant, chili peppers, hot paprika, <b>spinach,</b> feta cheese or safed cheese.|$|E
5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and <b>spinach)</b> are not associated with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer and spirits.|$|E
5|$|The {{two most}} popular Hannukah foods are potato pancakes, levivot, also known by the Yiddish latkes; and jelly doughnuts, known as sufganiyot in Hebrew, pontshkes (in Yiddish) or bimuelos (in Ladino), as these are deep-fried in oil. Hannukah pancakes are made {{from a variety of}} ingredients, from the {{traditional}} potato or cheese, to more modern innovations, among them corn, <b>spinach,</b> zucchini and sweet potato.|$|E
5|$|Apart from American and Soviet {{strategic}} forces, however, camouflage {{continued to}} be applied tactically. For example in the Korean War, American B-29 bombers were switched to night flying with black undersides when Chinese fighters became a significant threat. In the Vietnam War, Vietcong MiG-21 fighters were painted by hand in green ground camouflage patterns, while the USAAF and US Navy both restarted experiments with painted camouflage. In the Soviet–Afghan War, Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters were camouflaged in a sand and <b>spinach</b> pattern.|$|E
5|$|Bourekas are savory {{pastries}} {{brought to}} Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They {{are made of}} a flaky dough {{in a variety of}} shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, <b>spinach,</b> potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by home cooks. They are often served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E
5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps {{have been taken}} to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael. Vegetables such as <b>spinach</b> and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E
5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, <b>spinach,</b> potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E
5|$|Shakshouka, {{originally}} a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically {{served in the}} same frying pan {{in which it is}} cooked, with thick slices of white bread to mop up the sauce, and a side of salad. Modern variations include a milder version made with <b>spinach</b> and feta without tomato sauce, and hot chili shakshouka, a version that includes both sweet and hot peppers and coriander.|$|E
5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, <b>spinach,</b> sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} sausage {{are part of}} Sephardi and Mizrahi cuisine in Israel. Jews from Tunisia make a sausage, called osban, with a filling of ground meat or liver, rice, chopped <b>spinach,</b> and a blend of herbs and spices. Jews from Syria make smaller sausages, called gheh, with a {{different}} spice blend while Jews from Iraq make the sausages, called mumbar, with chopped meat and liver, rice, and their traditional mix of spices.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian cuisine also {{includes}} many small pizza-like foods, including Manakish, sfiha, fatayer,sambusac and ikras. Sfiha is a baked miniature flatbread, topped with lamb and cooked red peppers or tomatoes. Manakish is a baked flat bread, usually topped with za'atar and olive oil. Sfiha are meat patties decorated with spices and peppers. Sambusac and fatayer are baked or sometimes fried doughs stuffed with minced meat and cooked onions or snobar (pine nuts). Fatayer is usually folded into triangles and unlike sambusac, {{it could be}} filled with arabic cheese or za'atar. Ikras is similar to sambusac and fatayer, by using dough stuffed with either meat or <b>spinach,</b> however they are not fried (like sambusac), and are usually served as a meal rather than meal addition or side dish.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes food {{not found}} in its {{original}} culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malay dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes also cooked using styles taken from another culture, For example, sambal belacan (shrimp paste) are commonly used as ingredients by Chinese restaurants to create the stir fried water <b>spinach</b> (kangkung belacan). This means that although much of Malaysian food {{can be traced back}} to a certain culture, they have their own identity. Rice is popular in many dishes. Chili is commonly found in local cuisine, although this does not necessarily make them spicy.|$|E
5|$|The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans {{recommends}} consuming five to nine {{servings of}} fruit and vegetables daily. The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes {{are not included in}} the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as lettuce and <b>spinach,</b> a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, <b>spinach,</b> squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
5|$|In Naju, the country's largest {{producer}} of pears, approximately 1,400hectares (3,460acres) of pear trees, or 60% {{of the total}} crop, was destroyed. Agriculture as a whole suffered significantly from the storm, {{with a total of}} 9,000hectares (22,000acres) of apple and pear plantations being destroyed. As a result, the price of produce across the nation jumped substantially. In Yesan alone, a town where more than 1,500 families relies on their apple orchards for a living, losses to the orchards reached ₩300billion (US$265.4million). The prices of <b>spinach,</b> cabbage, and lettuce rose by 124%, 72%, and 26% respectively in just one day. Total losses throughout the country were estimated at ₩420billion (US$374.3million). More than 500 people were left homeless as a result of Bolaven, mostly in South Jeolla Province. Additionally, economic losses to airlines related to the typhoon reached ₩17billion ($15million). Korean Air and Asiana Airlines suffered the greatest losses of the affected companies.|$|E
5|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{a variety of}} food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas—the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts may also contain dopamine at levels of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, <b>spinach,</b> beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms {{similar to those that}} animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized. The receptors that mediate these actions have not yet been identified, nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian {{imperial}} refugees eventually {{settled in}} Quebec, {{which had the}} advantage of being French-speaking (the younger children were not yet fluent in English). As they were cut off from all European funds, finances were more stretched than ever. At one stage, Zita was reduced to making salad and <b>spinach</b> dishes from dandelion leaves. However, all her sons were active in the war effort. Otto promoted the dynasty's role in a post-war Europe and met regularly with Franklin Roosevelt; Robert was the Habsburg representative in London; Carl Ludwig and Felix joined the United States Army, serving with several American-raised relatives of the Mauerer line; Rudolf smuggled himself into Austria {{in the final days of}} the war to help organise the resistance. In 1945 Empress Zita celebrated her birthday on the first day of peace, 9 May. She was to spend the next two years touring the United States and Canada to raise funds for war-ravaged Austria and Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from <b>spinach</b> and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and <b>spinach)</b> or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E
5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top colors were dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colors were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and <b>Spinach,</b> in dark brown and light green.|$|E
25|$|The Environmental Working Group {{reported}} <b>spinach</b> {{is one of}} {{the dozen}} most heavily pesticide-contaminated produce products. Depending on the soil and location where the <b>spinach</b> is grown, <b>spinach</b> may be high in cadmium contamination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spinach</b> is {{packaged}} in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. Some packaged <b>spinach</b> {{is exposed to}} radiation to kill any harmful bacteria that {{may be on the}} leaves. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of <b>spinach</b> leaves up to 4.0 kilograys; however, using radiation to sanitize <b>spinach</b> is of concern because it may deplete the leaves of their nutritional value. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service experimentally tested the concentrations of vitamins C, E, K, B9, and four carotenoids in packaged <b>spinach</b> following irradiation. They found with increasing level of irradiation, four nutrients showed little or no change. Those nutrients include vitamins B9, E, K, and the carotenoid neoxanthin. This study showed the irradiation of packaged <b>spinach</b> to have little or no change to the nutritional value of the crop, and the health benefits of irradiating packed <b>spinach</b> to reduce harmful bacteria seem to outweigh the loss of nutrients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spinach</b> {{also has}} a {{moderate}} calcium content which can be affected by oxalates, decreasing its absorption. The calcium in <b>spinach</b> is among the least bioavailable of food calcium sources. By way of comparison, the human body can absorb {{about half of the}} calcium present in broccoli, yet only around 5% of the calcium in <b>spinach.</b>|$|E
25|$|In AD 827, the Saracens {{introduced}} <b>spinach</b> to Sicily. The first {{written evidence}} of <b>spinach</b> in the Mediterranean {{was recorded in}} three 10th-century works: the medical work by al-Rāzī (known as Rhazes in the West) and in two agricultural treatises, one by Ibn Waḥshīyah and the other by Qusṭus al-Rūmī. <b>Spinach</b> became a popular vegetable in the Arab Mediterranean and arrived in Spain by {{the latter part of}} the 12th century, where it was called , 'the chieftain of leafy greens'. <b>Spinach</b> was also the subject of a special treatise in the 11th century by Ibn Ḥajjāj.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spinach</b> {{beet leaves}} are eaten as a pot herb. Young {{leaves of the}} garden beet are {{sometimes}} used similarly. The midribs of Swiss chard are eaten boiled while the whole leaf blades are eaten as <b>spinach</b> beet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spinach</b> first {{appeared}} in England and France in the 14th century, probably via Spain, and it gained quick popularity because it appeared in early spring, when other vegetables were scarce and when Lenten dietary restrictions discouraged consumption of other foods. <b>Spinach</b> is mentioned in the first known English cookbook, the Forme of Cury (1390), where it {{is referred to as}} 'spinnedge' and/or 'spynoches'. Smooth-seeded <b>spinach</b> was described in 1552.|$|E
25|$|Common <b>spinach,</b> S. oleracea, {{was long}} {{considered}} {{to be in the}} family Chenopodiaceae, but in 2003, that family was merged into the family Amaranthaceae in the order Caryophyllales. Within the family Amaranthaceae sensu lato, <b>Spinach</b> belongs to subfamily Chenopodioideae.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spinach</b> is sold loose, bunched, {{packaged}} {{fresh in}} bags, canned, or frozen. Fresh <b>spinach</b> loses {{much of its}} nutritional value with storage {{of more than a}} few days. While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, <b>spinach</b> will lose most of its folate and carotenoid content, so for longer storage, it is blanched and frozen, cooked and frozen, or canned. Storage in the freezer can be for up to eight months.|$|E
25|$|Pizza strips are {{prepared}} in Italian bakeries {{and sold in}} most supermarkets and convenience stores. They are rectangular strips of pizza without cheese. Their rich flavor comes solely from a dense, zesty tomato paste baked on a half-inch (1.3cm) thick pan pizza crust, and may be enjoyed warm or cold. Party pizza is a box of these pizza strips. <b>Spinach</b> pies are similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned <b>spinach</b> instead of meat, sauce, and cheese. Variations can include black olives or pepperoni with the <b>spinach.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{long-lasting}} persistent myth is that <b>spinach</b> contains {{significantly more}} iron than other green vegetables. The source behind the myth {{was a study}} from the 1930s which misplaced a decimal point and thus made it appear as if <b>spinach</b> contained ten times as much iron as it really did.|$|E
