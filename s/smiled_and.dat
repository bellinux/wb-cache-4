5|$|There were 10 gunmen, nine of {{whom were}} {{subsequently}} shot dead and one captured by security forces. Witnesses reported that {{they seemed to be}} in their early twenties, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and that they <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> looked happy as they shot their victims.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E

25|$|Gibson was {{a fierce}} {{competitor}} who rarely <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{was known to}} throw brushback pitches to establish dominance over the strike-zone and intimidate the batter, similar to his contemporary and fellow Hall of Famer Don Drysdale.

25|$|Wisdom's career revived in the 1990s, {{helped by}} the young comedian Lee Evans, whose act was often {{compared}} to Wisdom's work. His films for Rank were playing to new audiences via television screenings, with young fans in the United Kingdom and abroad. The high point of this new popularity was the knighthood he was awarded, for services to entertainment, in the 2000 New Year's honours list. During the ceremony, once he had received his knighthood, he walked away and again performed his trademark trip, at which the Queen <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> laughed.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Belafonte {{appeared}} on a Petula Clark primetime television special on NBC. In {{the middle of a}} duet of On the Path of Glory, Clark <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> briefly touched Belafonte's arm, which prompted complaints from Doyle Lott, the advertising manager of the show's sponsor, Plymouth Motors. Lott wanted to retape the segment, but Clark, who had ownership of the special, told NBC that the performance would be shown intact or she would not allow it to be aired at all. Newspapers reported the controversy, Lott was relieved of his responsibilities, and when the special aired, it attracted high ratings.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> {{laughter}} {{have received}} considerable attention from researchers, {{little is known}} about the way they are displayed in naturally occurring group interactions. This aspect could be crucial if we want to understand the function of affiliative behaviours in social relationships. Naturalistic observations were conducted in areas where people could be watched interacting in small groups. Focal sampling of men and women allowed the recording of <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter frequencies, as well as group size and composition in terms of age <b>and</b> sex. Overall, <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter were influenced by group size and age of people involved. <b>Smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter were also affected by other aspects of social context, depending on the type of behaviour concerned and the sex of individuals. By deriving predictions from three hypotheses - sexual advertisement, social competition, and cooperation - this study revealed that <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter are likely to be involved in the formation of cooperative relationships. © 2008 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|R

Forty-six infants were presented pairs of facial expressions, and their preferential looking time was recorded.

Analyses revealed that the infants reliably discriminated between varying intensities of <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> frowning facial expressions and a paired neutral expression.
