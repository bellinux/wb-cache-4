2500|$|In 1953 Bolikango {{became a}} <b>substitute</b> <b>member</b> of the Conseil de la {{province}} de Léopoldville. He {{served in the}} post for three years. In December 1957 he unsuccessfully entered Léopoldville's first municipal elections. The Bangala as a whole did not {{do well in the}} campaign; their only form of organisation was Bolikango's Liboka Lya Bangala, an association with little cohesion. Following the electoral defeats, Bolikango decided to organise the Interfédérale, a federation among various regional and ethnic groups of the northern Congo that became the basis of his new Parti de l'Unité Congolaise. Almost immediately after its creation the party collapsed due to ethnic differences, while in the autumn of 1959 the Interfédérale became a part of the Parti National du Progrès (PNP). He did not follow them, instead founding the Front de l'Unite Bangala (FUB), a political party representing the Bangala people of the northeastern Congo. Among them he was a popular figure; Bangala nicknames for him included [...] "the Sage" [...] and even [...] "Moses". Bolikango hoped that by promoting the idea of a grande ethnie bangala he could enhance his political prospects. The Bangala were, however, only unified as a political faction in the capital, so he began to look elsewhere for support.|$|E
