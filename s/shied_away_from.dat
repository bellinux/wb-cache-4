5|$|Impossible {{to ignore}} was Day's {{disparity}} to his rival, Paige. Historians {{have noted that}} Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day's reserved demeanor; Paige was tall and Day was short and slender; and Paige worked hard to promote his name while Day <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> attention. The pitchers' infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from.</b> Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} site in Hong Kong's Central District {{was less}} than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World WarII, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.|$|E
5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to take this one step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E

25|$|Although he specializes on poetry, Leitner is {{also the}} author of short stories, essays, as well as {{literary}} critique and reviews. Additionally, he has published children's books and audiobooks. He has been instrumental in raising public awareness for the art form since the early 80s and has concentrated his efforts on fostering a broad environment for poetry that crosses cultural and intergenerational boundaries.

While red and brown brick accented by limestone have remained the favored façade materials, large windows have become more commonplace in buildings constructed since the late-1990s to emphasize natural lighting. Examples of this architecture include the Alumni Center, Art and Journalism Building, Music Instruction Building, and the David Letterman Communication and Media Building.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to growing {{concerns for the}} economy, observers believed that many voters <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Islamism after several local elections resulted in victories for Islamic parties. Once elected, these officials began experimenting with sharia, or Islamic law, prompting resistance among the local population. Most notably, legislators had proposed an anti-pornography bill in 2006 to gain the favor of religious groups. However, the bill's vagueness meant that practicing yoga {{could be construed as}} a pornographic action. Additionally, several corruption charges were brought against officials representing Islamic parties, which had previously been considered clean compared to other political parties.|$|E

25|$|He met Sylvia Bernice Baumgarten, a {{literary}} agent with Brandt & Kirkpatrick, whom he married {{at city hall}} in New York City on December 27, 1927, and who successfully edited and marketed his books. She was his apparent antithesis — Jewish and a liberal Democrat — but their marriage lasted successfully until both died in 1978. They had no children. Except for military service during World War II, the Cozzenses lived in semi-seclusion near Lambertville, New Jersey, and <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> all but local contact.

In addition to Societatea de Mâine, Gând Românesc, and the ISR's Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială and Sociologie Românească, these include Familia, Tribuna, Viața Românească, Revista Fundațiilor Regale, Independența Economică, and Semne. Falling in line with the Societatea de Mâine group, and influenced by physician Iuliu Moldovan, Herseni became an visible supporter of eugenics and biopolitics, introducing eugenicist language to works he wrote alongside Gusti.|$|E

He opposed the company theatre's obsession with mythology and stories of royalty and <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> loading his plays with music. Instead, he introduced simple, realistic sets. Kailasam chaired the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana held at Madras in 1945. He spent almost 10 years in a place he called 'NOOK'. It was a very dirty place, yet he loved it and wrote many dramas in there. He dictated his stories to his students at the 'NOOK', usually starting after 10 pm. He was a chain smoker.|$|E

25|$|Cooper {{took his}} concept to Paramount Studios {{in the first}} years of the Great Depression but {{executives}} <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, David O. Selznick brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant, and, to sweeten the deal, promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing The Most Dangerous Game, a story about a big game hunter, and hired his friend and former film partner, Ernest B. Schoedsack, to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, Creation, a story about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of dinosaurs. The film employed special effects wizard Willis O'Brien.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of counting, the Division of Elections showed Murkowski with a lead of some 1,700 votes over Miller, with about 8,000 {{write-in}} votes yet to be counted, and a trend of counting 97 percent of the write-ins as for Murkowski. Murkowski's campaign <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> declaring a victory before the count was finished. As of November 17, (the {{last day of the}} hand count), the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes, meaning that even if all the 8,000 challenged ballots were discounted, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes. The Miller campaign then demanded a hand recount of the entire election, claiming that as Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection Miller should get the same opportunity. The Division of Election officials responded that any recount of non-write-in votes would not be done by hand, but would be done using optical scanners.|$|E
25|$|Rav Kook never <b>shied</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> gently {{offering}} constructive criticism to his peers, {{religious and}} secular. Rav Kook {{was interested in}} outreach and cooperation between different groups and types of Jews, and saw both the good and bad in each of them. His sympathy for them as fellow Jews and desire for Jewish unity should not be misinterpreted as any inherent endorsement of all their ideas. That said, Rav Kook's willingness to engage in joint-projects (for instance, his participation in the Chief Rabbinate) with the secular Zionist leadership {{must be seen as}} differentiating him from many of his traditionalist peers. In terms of practical results, it would not be incorrect to characterize Kook as being a Zionist, if one defines a Zionist as one who believes in the re-establishment of the Jewish people as a nation in their ancestral homeland. Unlike other Zionist leaders, however, Kook's motivations were purely based on Jewish law and Biblical prophecy.|$|E
