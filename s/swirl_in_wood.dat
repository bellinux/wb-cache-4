50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the reverse-flow cylinder head is that both the entering inlet charge and the exiting exhaust gas cause a tendency to <b>swirl</b> <b>in</b> the same direction in the combustion chamber. In a crossflow head the inlet and exhaust gases promote <b>swirl</b> <b>in</b> opposite directions so that during overlap the swirl changes directions. The constant swirl during overlap which results in a reverse-flow cylinder head promotes better mixing and hence better scavenging of the end gas. The fact that the inlet charge must change direction before going out the exhaust makes it less likely that fresh mixture will make it out the exhaust before mixing during overlap. Overall this improves volumetric efficiency and reduces emissions.|$|R
40|$|Turbulent {{isothermal}} flow {{inside an}} axisymmetric dump diffuser and casing-liner annulus {{has been studied}} by using realizable k-ε model with and without swirl. Hemispherical, ellipsoidal and vertical ellipsoidal shapes of dome have been considered as liner heads in the simulation. The effects of different dome shapes on the flow pattern in the domain and pressure distributions along the casing and liner walls have been studied over a range of inlet swirl number. The static pressure recovery across the diffuser has been evaluated from the pressure distribution for each case. It is noticed that despite the variation in the size and intensity of the recirculating vortices, the pressure recovery remains nearly {{the same for all}} the three dome shapes for a particular <b>swirl</b> level <b>in</b> the inlet. However, <b>swirl</b> <b>in</b> the inlet flow considerably influences the pressure recovery. As the inlet swirl level increases, the size of the corner recirculation decreases, but a central reciculation is additionally formed. The static pressure recovery increases with the inlet <b>swirl</b> level <b>in</b> the range of swirl number considered. This indicates higher effectiveness in pressure recovery with <b>swirl</b> <b>in</b> flow...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing more air at higher engine speeds, the system also creates a <b>swirl</b> <b>in</b> the combustion chamber at lower rpms. The swirl makes for more efficient combustion, and {{is due to the}} asymmetric nature of the airflow with one intake runner closed.|$|R
