In 1989, Miskovsky helped establish the Archdiocesan Legal Network, a free legal clinic run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The clinic aided people with non-criminal legal issues such as bankruptcy, evictions, suspended licenses or delayed social <b>security</b> <b>checks.</b> Miskovsky was originally tasked with recruiting other lawyers for the clinic, but was eventually promoted to chairmen of the clinic's board.|$|E

Some of these were already introduced at the Chess World Cup 2015 (also in Baku), which included transmission delay of (some) games, random <b>security</b> <b>checks</b> of players, ban for bringing pens and watches into the playing hall and installment of electronic checkpoints for players {{at the entrance of}} the playing hall (see below).|$|E

5|$|Richard Edmund Neal {{was born}} February 14, 1949, in Worcester, Massachusetts, {{the oldest of}} three children. He and his two younger sisters were raised in Springfield by their mother, a housewife, and their father, a {{custodian}} at MassMutual. Neal's maternal grandparents were from Northern Ireland and his paternal grandparents were from Ireland. Neal's mother {{died of a heart}} attack when he was 13, and he was attending Springfield Technical High School when his father, an alcoholic, died. Neal and his two younger sisters moved in with their grandmother and later their aunt, forced to rely on Social <b>Security</b> <b>checks</b> as they grew up.|$|E

Once these were completed, Friley brought in Harold V. Gaskill, the Dean of Science, as the Ames Project's administrator. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took control of the Manhattan Project in June 1942, and the Ames Project in late 1942.|$|E
5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper <b>security</b> <b>checks</b> on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1920, the Sturmabteilung (SA) was {{the first}} of many {{paramilitary}} protection squads that worked to protect Nazi officials. In 1923, a small bodyguard unit, which became known as the Stosstrupp-Hitler (SSH), was set up specifically for Hitler's protection. It was {{under the control of the}} SA. Then in 1925, as the Nazi Party grew, the Schutzstaffel (SS) was created as a sub-section of the SA. Initially only about a hundred men, it was also originally a personal protection unit for Hitler. Several other bodyguard organisations, such as the Führerbegleitkommando (FBK), Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) and Reichssicherheitsdienst (RSD) were created as sub-sections of the SS. Police and security forces available included the Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo), Ordnungspolizei (Orpo), Kriminalpolizei (Kripo) and Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo). In addition, the Nazi intelligence organization, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), investigated and performed <b>security</b> <b>checks</b> on people, including party members. If the SD personnel determined an arrest was to be made, they passed the information on to the Gestapo. Like many autocratic rulers, Hitler surrounded himself with security units for protection.|$|E

The program permits {{citizens}} of selected countries to enter the US for up to 90 days without having to apply for an entry visa.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{widespread}} use of information and communication technology has greatly changed information security risks that businesses and institutions encounter. Along with this situation, {{in order to ensure}} security and have confidence in electronic trading, it has become important for organizations to take competent information security measures to provide international confidence that sensitive information is secure. Against this backdrop, the approach to information <b>security</b> <b>checking</b> has come to an important issue, which is believed to be common to all countries.

25|$|In 1983, Hopewell again {{received}} {{negative publicity}} {{from the national}} news media when {{it was discovered that}} Evelyn Rust Wells, an elderly woman, had been held captive and terrorized in her home in the City Point section.

A local grocer noted a change in purchases from when neighborhood kids assisted Wells, and called the police. They investigated and freed Wells who was by then severely malnourished.|$|E
25|$|Medicare Part B {{premiums}} {{are commonly}} deducted automatically from beneficiaries' monthly Social <b>Security</b> <b>checks.</b> They {{can also be}} paid quarterly via bill sent directly to beneficiaries. This alternative is becoming more common because whereas the eligibility age for Medicare has remained at 65 per the 1965 legislation, the so-called Full Retirement Age for Social Security has been increased to 66 and will go even higher over time. Therefore, many people delay collecting Social Security and have to pay their Part B premium directly.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to pre-entry <b>security</b> <b>checks,</b> all MDP officers {{are required to}} hold at least UK Government Security Check (SC) clearance (which clears the holder to UK Secret level).

DV status clears the officer to UK Top Secret level. Not all officers pass the DV process; such officers are then employed at SC security level within the force.|$|E
