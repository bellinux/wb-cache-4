5|$|Compactification {{can be used}} to {{construct}} models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional.

In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> a Calabi–Yau manifold. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau.|$|E
