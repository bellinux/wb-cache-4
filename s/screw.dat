5000|$|Pentalobe <b>screws</b> {{were first}} {{used in the}} iPhone 4. At first, #00 Phillips <b>screws</b> were used; however, many iPhone 4 models now have pentalobe <b>screws.</b> The <b>screws</b> used are {{slightly}} smaller than a Torx TS1, about 0.8 mm. If brought in to an Apple Store for repair, iPhone 4 models with #00 Phillips <b>screws,</b> if any, are replaced with 0.8 mm pentalobe <b>screws.</b> Third-party manufacturers rushed to produce screwdrivers that would remove 0.8 mm pentalobe <b>screws</b> after the iPhone 4's release in June 2010. These inexpensive, easily purchased drivers will remove pentalobe <b>screws</b> quite easily. Many are sold as [...] "kits" [...] containing a 5-point driver and Phillips #00 <b>screws,</b> in order to replace pentalobe <b>screws</b> with easily removable Phillips <b>screws.</b> Most other security screwdrivers will strip the miniature heads, effectively locking the user out of their device.|$|R

5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the <b>screw</b> turns, feeding the next shot to the front <b>screw.</b> This causes the <b>screw</b> to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover <b>screw.</b> A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover <b>screw</b> is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Various {{fabrication}} {{methods are}} used to improve the stability and osseointegration of <b>screws</b> within the host bone. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether roughened surface titanium <b>screws</b> fabricated by electron beam melting can provide better stability and osseointegration as compared with smooth titanium <b>screws</b> in sheep cervical vertebrae. METHODS: Roughened surface titanium <b>screws,</b> fabricated by electron beam melting, and conventional smooth surface titanium <b>screws</b> were implanted into sheep for 6 or 12 weeks (groups A and B, respectively). Bone ingrowth and implant stability were assessed with three-dimensional imaging and reconstruction, as well as histological and biomechanical tests. RESULTS: No <b>screws</b> in either group showed signs of loosening. Fibrous tissue formation could be seen around the <b>screws</b> at 6 weeks, which was replaced with bone at 12 weeks. Bone volume/total volume, bone surface area/bone volume, and the trabecular number were significantly higher for a define region of interest surrounding the roughened <b>screws</b> than that surrounding the smooth <b>screws</b> at 12 weeks. Indeed, for roughened <b>screws,</b> trabecular number was significantly higher at 12 weeks than at 6 weeks. On mechanical testing, the maximum pullout strength was significantly higher at 12 weeks than at 6 weeks, as expected; however, no significant differences were found between smooth and roughened <b>screws</b> at either time point. The maximum torque to extract the roughened <b>screws</b> was higher than that required for the smooth <b>screws.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Electron beam melting is a simple and effective method for producing a roughened surface on titanium <b>screws.</b> After 12 weeks, roughened titanium <b>screws</b> demonstrated a high degree of osseointegration and increased torsional resistance to extraction over smooth titanium <b>screws...</b>|$|R

5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating <b>screw.</b> Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The <b>screw</b> delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} <b>screw</b> into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the <b>screw</b> from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the <b>screw</b> to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the <b>screw</b> shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the <b>screw</b> reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the <b>screw</b> reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

30|$|Coating pedicle <b>screws</b> with {{hydroxyapatite}} {{can also}} improve implant stability. In ovariectomized sheep, coated <b>screws</b> displayed significantly greater resistance to extractive torque stress [2]. In addition, in an experimental canine model, Hasegawa et al. [3] found that hydroxyapatite-coated <b>screws</b> offered 1.6 -fold greater resistance to pull-out stresses than uncoated titanium <b>screws.</b> Nevertheless, bone/screw interface integration {{is not expected}} to happen immediately, so primary stability does not differ much from that of standard <b>screws.</b>|$|R

5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews of The Turn of the <b>Screw.</b> The acting and {{tone of the}} {{production}} were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its ambiguity, and critics disagreed {{about the extent to}} which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of the <b>Screw</b> was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.|$|E

5|$|During the Crimean War Cunard {{supplied}} 11 ships for war service. Every British North Atlantic route {{was suspended}} until 1856 except Cunard's Liverpool–Halifax–Boston service.

Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of saloon passengers and in 1862 commissioned Scotia, the last paddle steamer to win the Blue Riband. Inman carried more passengers because of its success in the immigrant trade.
