30|$|In {{a report}} by Wernovsky et al., in which {{neonatal}} arterial <b>switch</b> <b>operation</b> was the standard surgical treatment for D-TGA, 46  % of patients had abnormal collateral arteries as in our case, {{and most of the}} cases had silent symptoms, with only 5 of 119 cases needing coil embolization after arterial <b>switch</b> <b>operation</b> [4]. One of the possible reasons for the development of anomalous vessels is a long period of desaturation [7]. Therefore, we believe that it is crucial to consider the presence of abnormal aortopulmonary shunts in patients with congestive heart failure, who have received nitrogen inhalation to control pulmonary blood flow before operations.

The decision to perform arterial <b>switch</b> <b>operations</b> in babies with low body weight depends on the experience and skill of the surgical team.

5000|$|Switching (either {{moving from}} track to track or to/from Monorail Shop): When moving trains from one beam to another, other trains on both lines were {{required}} to hold outside of the block (or section) containing the switch. Trains being moved were emptied of guests and the entire process was controlled by way of clearance delivered by radio between the switch beam operator (who stood under the switch), the train operator, and Monorail Base (the lead at TTC). At that time Monorail Base had responsibility of oversight for the entire system (Monorail Concourse now has the duty). The entire process is carefully coordinated and executed. To engage the train's motors during a <b>switching</b> <b>operation,</b> the pilot must override the automatic anti-collision system throughout (MAPO) the entire switch. Speed through the switches was strictly limited to [...] "nudging" [...] (extremely slow) {{over most of the}} switches due to the degree of change; except for the Epcot switches where speed was limited to 15 mph (the Epcot switches are beam replacement style and have less degree of change). Drivers announced by radio when they had reached designated support pylons at various parts in the switching process. Whenever operationally possible, the <b>switching</b> <b>operation</b> was completed with the train moving in forward and the pilot occupying the cab which allowed him/her to see consistent with the forward operation. Occasionally the <b>switching</b> <b>operation</b> a portion of the operation to be completed in reverse. Because operating a train presents significant safety concerns, such operations were only conducted when other trains had been removed from the system and the entire process was supervised by additional personnel to ensure the train would not approach an open switch. Reverse operations with guests on board were prohibited except in extreme situations. Rather than operate a train in reverse with guests on board, having the train towed was preferred.|$|E

50|$|This is {{an issue}} because calling kernel-mode {{operations}} from user-mode requires performing a system call (i.e., making the CPU switch to kernel mode). This is a slow operation, taking {{on the order of}} microseconds to complete. During this time, the CPU can perform no operations. As such, minimizing the number of times this <b>switching</b> <b>operation</b> occurs would improve performance. For example, if the GPU's command buffer is full of rendering data, the API could simply store the requested rendering call in a temporary buffer and, when the command buffer is nearly empty, it can perform a switch to kernel-mode and add a set of stored commands in a batch.

In the proof of his theorem, Ryser also described a reconstruction algorithm, the very first reconstruction algorithm for a general discrete set from two orthogonal projections.

The multilevel inverters are basically classified into three topologies namely, the flying capacitor inverter, the diode clamped inverter and the cascaded H-bridge inverter.

All other mainline railroads terminated along the New Jersey and Brooklyn shorelines and ferried their railcars to Manhattan by car floats. They operated dozens of big and small rail yards on Manhattan and employed scores of coal-fired switchers. The worst offender was the West Side freight yards below 33rd Street, where coal-firing switchers hauled their cargoes along 11th Avenue (popularly called the [...] "Death Avenue") and adjacent streets {{in what is now}} Hudson Yards and Chelsea. The government handled safety and pollution problems separately: ordinances to eliminate grade crossings were effected on a case-by-case basis, complete elimination of steam traction became the target of the 1923 bill introduced by Victor R.

50|$|In {{their early}} history, MOSFETs became {{known for their}} absence of {{secondary}} breakdown. This benefit {{was due to the}} fact that ON-resistance increases with increasing temperature, so that part of the MOSFET which is running hotter (e.g. due to irregularities in the die-attachment etc.) will carry a lower current density, tending to even out any temperature variation and prevent hot spots. Recently, MOSFETs with very high transconductance, optimised for <b>switching</b> <b>operation,</b> have become available. When operated in linear mode, especially at high drain-source voltages and low drain currents, the gate-source voltage tends to be very close to the threshold voltage. Unfortunately the threshold voltage decreases as temperature increases, so that if there are any slight temperature variations across the chip, then the hotter regions will tend to carry more current than the cooler regions when Vgs is very close to Vth. This can lead to thermal runaway and the destruction of the MOSFET even when it is operating within its Vds, Id and Pd ratings. Some (usually expensive) MOSFETs are specified for operation in the linear region and include DC SOA diagrams, e.g. IXYS IXTK8N150L.|$|E
50|$|The VTEC system {{provides}} the engine with valve timing optimized for both {{low and high}} RPM operations. In basic form, the single barring shaft-lock of a conventional engine is replaced with two profiles: one optimized for low-RPM stability and fuel efficiency, and the other designed to maximize high-RPM power output. The <b>switching</b> <b>operation</b> between the two cam lobes {{is controlled by the}} ECU which takes account of engine oil pressure, engine temperature, vehicle speed, engine speed and throttle position. Using these inputs, the ECU is programmed to switch from the low lift to the high lift cam lobes when the conditions mean that engine output will be improved. At the switch point a solenoid is actuated which allows oil pressure from a spool valve to operate a locking pin which binds the high RPM cam follower to the low RPM ones. From this point on, the valves open and close according to the high-lift profile, which opens the valve further and for a longer time. The switch-over point is variable, between a minimum and maximum point, and is determined by engine load. The switch-down back from high to low RPM cams is set to occur at a lower engine speed than the switch-up (representing a hysteresis cycle) to avoid {{a situation in which the}} engine is asked to operate continuously at or around the switch-over point.|$|E
