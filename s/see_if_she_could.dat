25|$|Around the World in Seventy-Two Days by American woman {{journalist}} Nellie Bly (birth name Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman, 1864–1922). It {{is a true}} {{account of}} her journey in 1889 to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> beat the fictional journey in Jules Verne's 1873 novel, Around the World in Eighty Days.|$|E
25|$|Empire Star {{transmitted}} a {{distress signal}} {{and the order}} was given to abandon ship. The crew launched the remaining three lifeboats and five liferafts. The boat were fitted with skates, which enabled the port ones to be launched despite the heavy list. Despite a heavy sea, all passengers and crew were evacuated except the four killed in the engine room. The three boats then stood off as the ship righted herself and settled low in the water. The First Officer, Leslie Vernon, considered whether to reboard the ship to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be saved.|$|E
25|$|Cutts {{secured a}} {{mortgage}} {{to build the}} house, and on August 22, 1828, the bank holding the mortgage sold it to ex-President James Madison for $5,750. When James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison held the mortgage. Her husband's death had left Dolley Madison in a financially difficult position, so to reduce her expenses she took up residency in the house in November 1837. Presidents James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, James K. Polk, and Zachary Taylor all visited her in the home, as did John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster. Dolley Madison's financial difficulties continued, however. She also owned Montpelier, her husband's country estate and farm in the Piedmont of Virginia. But Montpelier's finances were in poor condition, and Dolley {{moved out of the}} Cutts–Madison House in 1839 to live once more at Montpelier and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> save the estate. She rented out the Cutts–Madison house, but was unable to stabilize Montpelier. She moved back to the Cutts–Madison House in 1843, and sold Montpelier in 1844.|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not keep}} these tidy little trained {{children}} in order, {{she would not}} have much chance with the street Arabs she had read of.|$|R
50|$|The {{night before}} the {{inspection}} Karin and her colleague Bror sneak away to visit a nightclub in Copenhagen. There, Karin suddenly, when she hears the nightclub singer sing, on a whim wants to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> possibly <b>could</b> do it better? She gets herself up on stage and starts to sing. And is greeted by cheers and standing ovations.|$|R
60|$|Angry {{at her own}} trepidation, {{she opened}} it. It was none of all these. It told her that Mr. Saville, his brother-in-law, was staying at the Holt with his second wife, and that he begged her to take {{advantage}} of this opportunity to come to visit the old place, adding, that he had not been well, and he wished much to <b>see</b> her, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> spare a few days to him from her children.|$|R
500|$|Pollin finds no {{evidence}} that Imlay had been refused a position at her aunts' school, only that such a scheme may have been [...] "in contemplation", as Godwin later wrote, although Seymour grants this explanation some plausibility. St Clair claims that Imlay {{was on her way}} to join her maternal aunts in Ireland when she decided to commit suicide. He believes that it was to be a probationary visit, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be a teacher in their school. Godwin's modern biographer, Richard Holmes, dismisses this story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{news article}} and video entitled, [...] "SF library offers Social Services to Homeless," [...] speaks about the San Francisco library having a {{full-time}} social worker {{at the library}} to reduce and help homeless patrons. It mentions that Leah Esguerra, who is a psychiatric social worker, has a usual routine which is done by making her rounds to different homeless patrons and greeting them to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> help them. She offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons with services or providing them with mental health counseling. She also supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful employment in the library for the formerly homeless (Knight, 2010). The changes have garnered positive results from all patrons. Since this service started, staff at the library stated that they have noticed a drop in inappropriate behavior.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Miss Havisham {{had sent}} for me, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take a fancy to me. But she couldn't,--at all events, she didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he gives}} {{some of his}} time {{to the passage of}} a good dinner into cold victuals it would help his dyspepsia. But I suppose he will come when he is ready, and all I have to say is that I would like to <b>see</b> Calthea Rose <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> catch sight of them this minute." ...|$|R
60|$|She sighed {{a sigh of}} deep, of passionate regret and longing. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> her husband; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{only look}} for one second into those laughing, lazy eyes, wherein she alone knew how to fathom the {{infinity}} of passion that lay within their depths; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but once feel his--ardent kiss on her lips, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> more easily endure this agonising suspense, and wait confidently and courageously for the issue.|$|R
60|$|But {{she wanted}} to go to her husband. She felt that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> face death more easily on the morrow <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> him once, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but look once more into the eyes that had {{mirrored}} so much enthusiasm, such absolute vitality and whole-hearted self-sacrifice, and such an intensity of love and passion; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but kiss once more those lips that had smiled through life, and would smile, she knew, {{even in the face of}} death.|$|R
60|$|His {{mother looked}} at him and said nothing. And then she took Kate out into a little grove behind the house to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find some ripe oranges.|$|E
60|$|The old {{man said}} nothing at table, but, when Mela went up to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} for Christine, he asked Mrs. Mandel again about all the facts of her last interview with Beaton.|$|E
60|$|This comfort Mr. Delaplaine kept to himself, and on {{the second}} day out, the food which was served to them being most wretchedly cooked, Dame Charter ventured into the galley to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} in the way of improvement.|$|E
60|$|But {{the strong}} feeling of his breast, the strongest {{next to his}} love, was {{a desire to be}} revenged. He cared little now for his father, little for that {{personal}} dignity which he had intended to return by his silence, little for pecuniary advantages and prudential motives, in comparison with his strong desire to punish Marie for her perfidy. He would go over to Granpere, and fall among them like a thunderbolt. Like a thunderbolt, at any rate, he would fall upon the head of Marie Bromar. The very words of her love-promises were still firm in his memory, and he would <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> also <b>could</b> be made to remember them.|$|R
25|$|Davydova {{was born}} in Voronezh, 500 {{kilometres}} south of Moscow. She became interested in gymnastics at age six after seeing on television the famous Soviet Olympic gold medallists Larisa Petrik and Natalia Kuchinskaya. She practicised the splits to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> also <b>could</b> do them. Deciding {{she wanted to be}} a gymnast Elena went by herself to be enrolled in Voronezh's famous Spartak Gymnastics school, yet was turned away, as she was very small, and considered at the time to have the wrong physique for the sport."They would call me Kolobok after the little fairytale pancake". Rather than giving up however, she secretly watched the lessons through windows and tried to imitate in the schoolyard what she had observed."My Mom wanted me to do Piano and I would run away from it to do gymnastics".|$|R
60|$|Captain Hampton's cogitations came to nothing. He {{walked up}} and down his little room until the lodger in the parlour below went out in despair to his club. He tried the effect of an hour's stroll in the least frequented part of Kensington Gardens. He drove to Mr. Slippen's to inquire if any clue had been {{obtained}} as to Truscott's movements. He ate a solitary dinner at his lodgings and smoked an enormous quantity of tobacco, but could see no clue whatever to the mystery. The meeting he had witnessed was to him a piece of evidence far more damning than that of the jeweller and his assistants. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> explain that, the other matter might be got over, though he <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> how. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not explain it, it was evident that {{he had nothing to do}} but to advise her father to settle the business at any cost.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] murmured Leila, and {{her eyes}} looked very soft. [...] "Poor child! We shall be wanting an extra hand next week. I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> come now. I'll speak to our Matron, and let you know to-night." [...] She {{squeezed}} his hand hard.|$|E
60|$|For {{some moments}} {{they sat in}} silence. Then Dot reached out her hand to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel anything; but the cool, damp air was all around them. Then she reached upward, and her hand struck against a piece of {{projecting}} rock which hurt her.|$|E
60|$|The Dryad, who {{had often}} {{come to the}} cottage to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find an {{opportunity}} of carrying out Old Pipes's affectionate design, now happened by; and seeing that the much-desired occasion had come, she stepped up quietly behind the old woman and gently kissed her on each cheek, and then as quietly disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Nan ate alone, {{and spent}} a long {{afternoon}} attached to the sofa. Mrs. Bhaer lengthened her bonds so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> look out of the window; and there she stood watching the boys play, and all the little summer creatures enjoying their liberty. Daisy had a picnic for the dolls on the lawn, so that Nan might <b>see</b> the fun <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not join in it. Tommy turned his best somersaults to console her; Demi sat on the steps reading aloud to himself, which amused Nan a good deal; and Dan brought a little tree-toad to show her as the most delicate attention in his power.|$|R
60|$|But now, {{when the}} {{paroxysm}} of temptation was past, dread and despondency began to thrust themselves, like cold heavy mists, {{between her and}} the heaven to which she wanted to look for light and guidance. The temptation would come again--that rush of desire might overmaster her the next time--she would slip back again into that deep slimy pit from which she had been once rescued, and there might be no deliverance for her more. Her prayers did not help her, for fear predominated over trust; she had no confidence that the aid she sought would be given; the idea of her future fall had grasped her mind too strongly. Alone, in this way, <b>she</b> was powerless. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Mr. Tryan, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> confess all to him, she might gather hope again. She must see him; she must go to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you see? You must {{understand}} all now! Don't you <b>see</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> believed so too, and <b>if</b> she----" [...] <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not go on.|$|R
60|$|One evening, a week later, Anne {{walked down}} to the Point, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get some fresh fish from Captain Jim, leaving Little Jem for the first time. It was quite a tragedy. Suppose he cried? Suppose Susan did not know just exactly what to do for him? Susan was calm and serene.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} queer. Old Granny Fox {{sat down to}} think who would dare steal {{anything}} from her. Then she walked in a big circle with her nose to the ground, sniffing and sniffing. What was she doing that for? Why, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find the tracks of anyone who might have stolen her chicken.|$|E
60|$|One evening, as she was, {{according}} to her custom, rambling round about the courts and yards of the palace to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> smell any fresh meat, she heard, in a ground room, little Day crying, for his mamma was going to whip him, {{because he had been}} naughty; and she heard, at the same time, little Morning begging pardon for her brother.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{only know}}! <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only {{know what he}} meant to do.|$|R
2500|$|Anna T. Jeanes was {{a wealthy}} Quaker {{who lived in}} Philadelphia. She had outlived her other family members. She has been {{described}} as [...] "a remarkable woman with a vision for Christian peace which she used her fortune to promote." [...] As she neared the end of her life, she was approached by Dr. Booker T. Washington and others to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would help fund their efforts. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>she</b> wanted to help [...] "the little country schools", and set aside $1 million from her family inheritance to establish a fund called the Jeanes Foundation. The purpose was to maintain and assist rural schools for African Americans in the South. The organization provided funds to employ supervisors of teachers who were dedicated to upgrading vocational training programs for teachers of black students.|$|R
6000|$|As soon as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak, <b>she</b> said, [...] "We {{will go to}} Lucy, Tom; we'll go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is safe, {{and then}} we can help the rest." ...|$|R
60|$|Kate felt subdued and reverent, {{and loved}} her new {{relations}} {{more and more}} for their sorrows; {{and she began to}} dream out castles of the wonderful goodness by which she would comfort them; then she looked for her uncle's hand to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> dare to stroke it, but one was over his brow, the other out of reach, and she was shy of doing anything.|$|E
6000|$|Just as we {{was going}} up to bed Miss Pondar {{came to me and}} said that the gentleman had called down to her and asked if he could have a new-laid egg for his breakfast, and she asked if she should send Hannah early in the morning to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get a {{perfectly}} fresh egg from one of the cottages. [...] "I thought, ma'am, that perhaps you might object to buying things on Sunday." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{morning as}} he was hobbling through the streets he met his old enemy prowling to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find anyone to decoy. He went up to her and, imitating {{the voice of a}} woman, he said, [...] "Do you happen to have a pair of scales you could lend me? I have just come from Persia and have brought with me five hundred gold pieces, and I am anxious to see if they are the proper weight." ...|$|E
