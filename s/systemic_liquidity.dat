40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{framework}} {{for the assessment of}} financial market liquidity and identifies two types: search liquidity and <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Search liquidity, i. e. liquidity in “normal” times, is driven by search costs required for a trader to find a willing buyer for an asset he/she is trying to sell or vice versa. Search liquidity is asset specific. <b>Systemic</b> <b>liquidity,</b> i. e. liquidity in “stressed” times, is driven by the homogeneity of investors - the degree to which one’s decision to sell is related to the decision to sell made by other market players at the same time. <b>Systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> is specific to market participants’ behaviour. This framework proves fairly powerful in identifying the role of credit derivatives and transparency for liquidity of corporate bond markets. We have applied it to the illiquid segments of the European credit market and found that credit derivatives are likely to improve search liquidity as well as <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity.</b> However, it is possible that in their popular use today, credit derivatives reinforce a concentration of positions that can worsen <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity.</b> We also found that post-trade transparency has surprisingly little bearing on liquidity in that where it improves liquidity it is merely acting as a proxy for pre-trade transparency or transparency of holdings. We conclude that if liquidity is the objective, pre-trade transparency, as well as some delayed transparency on net exposures and concentrations, is likely to be more supportive of both search and <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> than post-trade transparency.

We investigate their behaviour in CHAPS, the United Kingdom’s large-value payment system. Our estimates suggest that in normal times, banks increase their payment outflows when their liquidity is above target and immediately following the receipt of payments. We use these estimates to determine the robustness of this payment system to two hypothetical behavioural changes. In the first, a single bank stops sending payments, perhaps because of an operational problem. In the second, it pays out exactly what it previously received, relying exclusively on the liquidity provided by other system members. Using the observed uncertainty around our estimated behavioural equations, we derive probabilistic statements about the time at which the bank’s counterparties would run out of liquidity if they followed their estimated normal-time behaviour.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} the economic and regulatory concept of bank liquidity in the context of <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock. A formal model analysis shows that the application of liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) based on Basel III will lead to a significant adaptation of banks liquidity management. LCR causes a change in bank’s liquidity allocation and funding to be less effective and more costly and restrictive for providing credits comparing with economic determinants. It is demonstrated that the application of LCR underestimates actual liquidity position of a bank and leads to allocation ineffectiveness. The empirical part contains simulation of impacts of <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock on the banking sector’s ability to withstand the unfavourable credit shock while solvency is maintained. The results confirm the robustness of the Czech banking system ensuing from the systemic surplus of liquidity, high volume of bank capital and its high profitability.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of market power on bank liquidity; the {{association}} between competition and systemic liquidity; and whether the associations between liquidity and stability at both bank- and systemic- levels are affected by competition. The first research question is explored {{in the context of}} 101 countries over 1996 - 2013 while the second and the third, which require listed banks, use a smaller sample of 32 nations during 2001 - 2013. The Panel Least Squares and the system Generalized Method of Moments estimators are employed to assess these associations. These research issues are further examined separately for countries with different level of economic development. Such divisions are essential since these countries exhibit varying degrees of market power, banking competition, liquidity risk preference, regulations and financial infrastructures. Regarding the market power-liquidity relationship, the findings suggest an inverted U-shaped association between market power and bank liquidity. With an initial increase in market power, banks increase their liquid assets and become net lenders in the interbank markets. When market power exceeds a certain threshold, however, banks hold less liquid assets and become net interbank borrowers. For a given level of market power, ceteris paribus, banks in more developed nations have lower investments in asset liquidity and obtain more funding through the interbank market than those in their developing country counterparts. While competition benefits bank-level asset and funding liquidity, it decreases <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity.</b> By affecting loan profitability and banks’ incentives to hold liquid reserves, competition influences interbank market liquidity and thus asset prices. This in turn influences banks’ ability to withstand liquidity shocks and <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> crises. On {{the impact of}} competition on the association between liquidity and stability, bank market power seems to reinforce the positive impact of funding liquidity on bank stability. In contrast, banking <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> appears only to enhance systemic stability in less competitive markets. This is because greater competition encourages banks to assume more risks (i. e. credit and capital risks) that offset systemic liquidity’s positive impact. This thesis offers several contributions to the bank liquidity hoarding and industrial organization literatures by showing that bank liquidity risk varies with market power. It similarly expands the financial intermediation literature by providing evidence that strategic interactions among banks expose them to <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> crises. It further adds to the competition-stability literature by providing evidence that competition leads to a reversal of the benefits of liquidity on stability at both bank- and systemic- levels. It also improves the prior methodology by deriving a <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk indicator using a Principal Component Analysis, examining both bank- and systemic-levels of liquidity and stability, employing a three year rolling window to reflect more frequent changes of competition over time and using bank distance-to-capital proposed by Chan-Lau and Sy (2007) in addition to the traditional distance-to-default in calculating banking systemic stability. These findings should have implications for policymakers, regulators, central bankers and investors in wide-range of countries. Policy makers should benefit from learning that the new international bank liquidity standards (fully implemented by 2019) incorporate an adjustment to reflect bank market power and competition. Regulators should also avoid “one size fits all” approach as bank liquidity is influenced by cross-country differences in regulation, industry characteristics, financial development and presence/absence of explicit deposit guarantees. Central bankers should learn the impact of competition on liquidity and stability when extending their liquidity support. Finally, investors should be aware their banks’ competitive environment and liquidity position before investing...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The global {{financial}} crisis {{raises questions about}} the proper objectives of financial regulation and how best to meet them. Traditionally, capital requirements have been the cornerstone of bank regulation. However, the run on the investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008 led to its demise even though Bear Stearns met the letter of its regulatory capital requirements. The risk-based capital requirements that underpin the Basel approach to bank regulation fail to distinguish between the inherent riskiness of an asset and its <b>systemic</b> importance. <b>Liquidity</b> requirements that constrain the composition of assets may be a necessary complement. A maximum leverage ratio—an idea that has gained favor in the United States and more recently in Switzerland— may also prove beneficial, deriving its rationale not from the traditional view that capital is a buffer against losses on assets, but rather from the importance of stabilizing liabilities in an interrelated financial system. The {{global financial}} crisis of 2008 has raised fundamental questionsabout the conceptual foundations of financial regulation.

40|$|Illiquidity is at {{the core}} of the various {{currency}} and banking/financial crises of the 1990 s. In the wake of the Asian crisis of 1997 / 98 the term "systemic liquidity" has been coined to refer to adequate arrangements and practices which permit efficient liquidity management and which provide a buffer during financial distress. A constructed balance-sheet-based variable that captures the essence of the risk from <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> is funding volatility ratio, FVR. Using data covering January 1990 to July 2003 and employing cointegration techniques, this study attempts to quantify the purported link between FVR and the measurable determinants of a balanced liquidity infrastructure for Indonesia, the country that suffered the most from the Asian crisis. A good fit is obtained for the dynamic regression model and estimates of short-run and long-run impacts and elasticities are computed. FVR is shown to be increasing in the rupiah-US dollar exchange rate, the Jakarta stock market index, interest rate and the number of banks, and decreasing in capital:asset ratio and foreign liabilities: total asset ratio. The best option for lowering the FVR in the short run is increasing bank capital; over the long term enduring increases in foreign-currency accounts and reduction in the number of banks seem to hold the best prospect for lowering the FVR. autoregressive distributed lag model, cointegration, funding volatility ratio, <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity,</b> Financial Economics, C 22,...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{financial}} intermediary leverage cycles {{in the context of}} a dynamic model of the macroeconomy. The interaction between a production sector, a financial intermediation sector, and a household sector gives rise to amplification of fundamental shocks that affect real economic activity. The model features two state variables that represent the dynamics of the economy: the net worth and the leverage of financial intermediaries. The leverage of the intermediaries is procyclical, owing to risk-sensitive funding constraints. Relative to an economy with constant leverage, financial intermediaries generate higher output and consumption growth and lower consumption volatility in normal times, but at the cost of <b>systemic</b> solvency and <b>liquidity</b> risks. We show that tightening intermediaries' risk constraints affects the systemic risk-return trade-off by lowering the likelihood of systemic crises at the cost of higher pricing of risk.

40|$|Defining {{whether a}} {{financial}} institution is systemically important (or not) is challenging due to (i) the inevitability of combining complex importance criteria such as institutions’ size, connectedness and substitutability; (ii) the ambiguity of what an appropriate threshold for those criteria may be; and (iii) the involvement of expert knowledge as a key input for combining those criteria. The proposed method, a Fuzzy Logic Inference System, uses four key systemic importance indicators that capture institutions’ size, connectedness and substitutability, and a convenient deconstruction of expert knowledge to obtain a Systemic Importance Index. This method allows for combining dissimilar concepts in a non-linear, consistent and intuitive manner, whilst considering them as continuous –non binary- functions. Results reveal that the method imitates the way experts them-selves think about the decision process regarding what a systemically important financial institution is within the financial system under analysis.

40|$|It is a {{commonly}} held view that International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), {{adopted by the}} European Union in 2005 and by other jurisdictions, compounded the recent fi nancial crisis. Application of the IAS 39 rule that governs loan-loss provisions and extends mark-to-market valuation of assets meant that when credit prices fell sharply in 2007 and assets were revalued using the new lower prices, it triggered a need for institutions to raise capital by selling assets, which pushed prices down further, causing more revaluations and more selling in a vicious circle. Mark-to-market volatility added to this unstable dynamic by keeping new buyers away. Fair value accounting rules are pro-cyclical and {{can contribute to the}} <b>systemic</b> disappearance of <b>liquidity.</b> 1 The price of assets if they were to be sold immediately fell substantially below the price of the same assets if they were to be held to maturity or for some time period beyond the crisis.

40|$|Traditional {{explanations}} of market crashes {{rely on the}} collapse of an asset price bubble or the exacerbation of an information asymmetry sufficient to cause less-informed participants {{to withdraw from the}} market. We show that markets can crash even though asset prices have not deviated from fundamental values and information is shared symmetrically among all market participants. We present a model in which markets crash when investors shift their beliefs about the liquidity of the secondary market. While such shifts in liquidity may be a factor in explaining many market crashes, the collapse of the market for perpetual floating-rate notes (perps) provides an especially clear illustration of the theory because a shift in liquidity beliefs appears to have been the sole determinant of the market crash. Such a shift can be precipitated by a <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock that is transitory or permanent. The latter proved to be the case with perps because perceptions of the liquidity of the secondary market were permanently altered. In addition to providing new insights into why markets crash, our findings are particularly relevant for unseasoned financial products that are often priced and marketed on the assumption that liquid secondary markets will develop. The perp episode also highlights the importance of broad placement of securities. Since market liquidity arises endogenously from the diversity of liquidity needs across the investor base, the broader the investor base, the lower the probability of a <b>systemic</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock.

40|$|The worst {{financial}} crises since the Great Depression has forced central bankers and policymakers across Europe {{and around the}} globe to take unprecedented policy measures to deal with systemic risk, i. e. {{the risk that the}} financial system ceases to perform its function of allocating capital to the most productive use because of financial difficulties among a significant number of financial institutions. This paper develops a parsimonious model of systemic risk in the form of amplification effects whereby adverse developments in financial markets and in the real economy mutually reinforce each other and lead to a feedback cycle of falling asset prices, deteriorating balance sheets and tightening financing conditions. The paper shows that the free market equilibrium in such an environment is generically inefficient because constrained market participants do not internalize that their actions entail amplification effects. Therefore they undervalue the social benefits of liquidity during crises and take on too much systemic risk. We use our framework to shed light on a number of current policy issues. We show that banks face socially insufficient incentives to raise more capital during systemic crises, that bailouts which are anticipated can be ineffective, and that expectational errors are considerably more costly during crises than in normal times. Furthermore we develop an analytical framework for macro-prudential capital adequacy requirements that take into account systemic risk. We also analyze a new channel of financial contagion and explain why private agents will take insufficient precautions against contagion from other sectors in the economy. {{financial crises}}, amplification effects, <b>liquidity,</b> <b>systemic</b> risk, systemic externalities, social pricing kernel, macroprudential regulation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This thesis investigates {{various issues}} in regulation, with three {{chapters}} on financial fragility and banking regulation, and one chapter on competition policy. Chapter 2 studies banks’ herding driven by {{their need for}} market liquidity, highlighting a trade-off between <b>systemic</b> risk and <b>liquidity</b> creation. The model also suggests that systemic risk and leverage are mutually reinforcing, offering an explanation of why banks collectively exposed themselves to mortgage-backed securities prior to the crisis, and why the exposure grew when banks were increasingly leveraged using wholesale short-term funding. Chapter 3 examines the possible trade-off between banking competition and financial stability by highlighting banks' endogenous leverage. Competition is shown to affect portfolio risk, insolvency risk, <b>liquidity</b> risk and <b>systemic</b> risk differently. The model leads us to revisit the existing empirical literature using a more precise taxonomy of risk and take into account endogenous leverage, thus clarifying a number of apparently contradictory empirical results. Chapter 4 presents a model where fire-sales and bank runs are self-fulfilling and mutually reinforcing. With endogenous fire sale prices, the model delivers two new policy insights: First Bank capital can have unintended consequences on illiquidity and contagion, and therefore is not a panacea for financial stability. Second, as acknowledging a crisis aggravates financial contagion, full commitment to regulatory transparency can be suboptimal from a social welfare point-of-view. Chapter 5 is devoted to antitrust policy. It studies how cost asymmetry affects the effectiveness of corporate leniency programs. The analysis shows that using leniency programs involves a trade-off between ex-ante deterrence and ex-post efficiency. For traditional antitrust investigation can both deter cartels and improve allocation, leniency programs {{should be viewed as}} a second best solution for budget-constrained antitrust authorities. ...|$|R
40|$|The core {{principles}} of financial crisis management call upon central banks to lend freely, against good quality collateral, {{and at a}} penalty rate of interest, to solvent but illiquid banks and other financial institutions during periods of widespread panic and instability. While often taken for granted, these principles were designed for {{a world in which}} central banks have the capacity to create money denominated in the domestic currency, and where banks and other financial institutions issue deposits and other short-term liabilities denominated in the same currency. Unfortunately, this is not {{the world in which we}} live. The application of these principles is far from straightforward where financial institutions rely on short-term foreign currency liabilities as a source of financing. This is the world of the Eurodollar market. The global financial crisis vividly illustrated the potential systemic risks arising from the existence of a large Eurodollar market. Faced with a <b>systemic</b> foreign currency <b>liquidity</b> crisis, central banks struggled to secure access to the foreign currency reserves needed to provide emergency liquidity assistance to their domestic banking systems. In response, the U. S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks establishing a network of swap lines with the objective of providing foreign currency liquidity assistance to the international financial system. The central bank swap lines have been hailed as one of the most important and effective policy responses to the financial crisis. However, while it may be tempting to view them as an effective prophylactic against future foreign currency liquidity crises, the current structure of the swap lines fails to establish truly credible international commitments or constrain the moral hazard problems stemming from this ambitious form of statesponsored liquidity insurance. This paper examines the unique policy challenges posed by foreign currency liquidity problems, along with how to build a more effective framework for the provision of foreign currency liquidity assistance. </p...|$|R
