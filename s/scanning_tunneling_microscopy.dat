Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of study are field ion microscopy and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopy.</b> By visualizing the displacement of atoms or clusters over time, it is possible to extract useful information regarding {{the manner in which the}} relevant species diffuse-both mechanistic and rate-related information. In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas, as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field-ion microscopy experiments.|$|E

The introduction of edge misfit dislocations after a critical thickness, and the inhomogeneous strain field inside the islands, lead to an intra-island ripening mechanism.

40|$|<b>Scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> {{topography}} and spectroscopy {{are performed}} below 100 [*]mK on granular nanocrystalline boron-doped diamond (BDD) films. We found the superconductivity behavior to follow mainly the granular {{features of the}} BDD films. The temperature dependence of the local differential conductance spectra shows our nanocrystalline BDD films as made of grains with a supercondutivity either BCS-like or non-BCS-like. Such a distribution is not discernible in transport measurements, which present a sharp macroscopic superconducting transition at a temperature of a few Kelvins. Our local <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopies</b> also confirm the good coupling between these grains: only a few opaque interfaces are detected. Such a transparency of intergrain interfaces is responsible for a proximity effect in weakly superconductive grains and an inverse proximity effect in strongly superconducting grains...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} characterization of selected polymeric materials which received exposure on the LDEF is reported. The specimens examined include silvered {{fluorinated ethylene propylene}} (FEP) teflon thermal blanket material, polysulfone matrix resin/graphite fiber reinforced composites, and several high performance polymer films. These specimens came from numerous LDEF locations and, thus, received different environmental exposures. The results of infrared, thermal, x ray photoelectron, and various solution property analyses have shown no significant change {{at the molecular level}} in the polymer that survived exposure. However, scanning electron and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopies</b> show resin loss and a texturing of the surface of some specimens which resulted in a change in optical properties.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{influence}} of the Si (111) surface preparation on both the structural and the magnetic properties of iron thin films grown onto them. Two different substrate preparation procedures were used, in one of which the substrate was purposely oxidized. The surface analysis was performed by using atomic force and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopies,</b> and the magnetic behavior of the films was observed by magneto-optic Kerr effect polarimetry. A strong relationship between the substrate preparation procedure, morphology, and the magnetic response of the iron films was found. A phenomenological model was used to interpret the experimental magnetization data and to derive the anisotropy parameters for both types of Fe samples. It was found that the magnetic response of the film grown onto the oxidized substrate is dominated by the uniaxial anisotropy originated from the substrate topology (a terracelike structure); the behavior of the other film, grown onto the unoxidized substrate, is determined by both cubic and easy-plane anisotropies...|$|R

2500|$|The {{thicknesses}} of SAMs can {{be measured}} using ellipsometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which also give information on interfacial properties. [...] The order in the SAM and orientation of molecules can be probed by Near Edge Xray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in Reflection Absorption Infrared Spectroscopy (RAIRS) studies. Numerous other spectroscopic techniques are used such as Second-harmonic generation (SHG), Sum-frequency generation (SFG), Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), [...] as well as High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). [...] The structures of SAMs are commonly determined using scanning probe microscopy techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopy</b> (STM). STM {{has been able to}} help understand the mechanisms of SAM formation as well as determine the important structural features that lend SAMs their integrity as surface-stable entities. In particular STM can image the shape, spatial distribution, terminal groups and their packing structure. AFM offers an equally powerful tool without the requirement of the SAM being conducting or semi-conducting. AFM has been used to determine chemical functionality, conductance, magnetic properties, surface charge, and frictional forces of SAMs. More recently, however, diffractive methods have also been used. The structure can be used to characterize the kinetics and defects found on the monolayer surface. These techniques have also shown physical differences between SAMs with planar substrates and nanoparticle substrates.|$|E

40|$|This thesis further {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} of scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) in both materials and life sciences. Two experimental SNOM setups were developed: one designed for infrared spectroscopy applications {{and the other for}} the imaging of fluorescently labeled samples. The results of the experiments that were conducted with both setups are presented and analyzed in this thesis. Diffraction limits the resolution of lens-based microscopes to a value close to that of the wavelength of the light that is used to illuminate the samples. SNOM instruments overcome this limit by probing the near-field light — the light that remains within close vicinity of the sample and decays exponentially away from it. The SNOM concept and instrumental design are described. A comparison of SNOM with other novel microscopies (electron, atomic force, and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopies)</b> outlines the main advantages of SNOM — the sole optical microscopy technique with a nanometer resolution. Aperture-based infrared SNOM (IR-SNOM), performed in the spectroscopic mode using the Vanderbilt University free electron laser, recently started delivering spatially resolved information on the distribution of chemical species and on other laterally fluctuating properties. The IR-SNOM combines the IR spectroscopy's chemical specificity and the SNOM's high optical and topographical resolutions. The IR-SNOM experimental setup is described in detail and results from the study of cells, boron nitride and lithium fluoride thin films are presented and analyzed. They demonstrate the great potential of this new technique. An overview of the development of IR-SNOM, as well as a consideration of its future possibilities are presented. The newly built SNOM instrument at EPFL was used for experiments that are complementary to the aforementioned IR-SNOM experiments. Specifically, the new SNOM enabled the study of fluorescently marked samples. Images of fluorescently labeled cells and carbon nanotubes are presented and analyzed. The results further demonstrate the exciting possibilities of SNOM...|$|R
