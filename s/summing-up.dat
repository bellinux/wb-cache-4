"The law {{as it was}} did not {{distinguish}} between {{a case of the}} kind just related, of the starving, sorely-tempted Shergold, and that of the systematic thief: sheep-stealing was a capital offence and the man must be hanged, unless recommended to mercy, and we know what was meant by 'mercy' in those days. That so barbarous a law existed within memory of people to be found living in most villages appears almost incredible to us; but despite the recommendations to 'mercy' usual in a large majority of cases, the law of that time was not more horrible than the temper of the men who administered it. There are good and bad among all, and in all professions, {{but there is also a}} black spot in most, possibly all hearts, which may be developed to almost any extent, to change the justest, wisest, most moral men into 'human devils.' In reading the old reports and the expressions used by the judges in their <b>summings-up</b> and sentences, it is impossible not to believe that the awful power they possessed, and its constant exercise, had not only produced the inevitable hardening effect, but had made them cruel in the true sense of the word. Their pleasure in passing dreadful sentences was very thinly disguised by certain lofty conventional phrases as to the necessity of upholding the law, morality, and religion; they were, indeed, as familiar with the name of the Deity as any ranter in a conventicle, and the 'enormity of the crime' was an expression as constantly used in the case of the theft of a loaf of bread, or of an old coat left hanging on a hedge, by some ill-clad, half-starved wretch, as in cases of burglary, arson, rape, and murder.|$|R

However, the basis on which the lower court reached its verdict may be brought into consideration and edited.

Had Tchaikovsky written this work as a piano quartet or piano quintet, he would have availed himself of a string complement well able to play complete harmony and could therefore have been allotted autonomous sections to play. With only two stringed instruments, this option was not available. Instead, Tchaikovsky treats the violin and cello as melodic soloists, with the piano both conversing with them and providing harmonic support.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of printed marriage poems (epithalamia) in 17 th and 18 th century Sweden was a comprehensive, and {{for almost a}} century also a highly esteemed, poetical activity. To date these Swedish epitha¬lamia have not attracted much scholarly attention, {{and that is why}} the study, after due intro¬ductions, instead of directly addressing the central questions, begins by featuring the genre’s quantitative as well as qualitative characteristics in the six periods selected for investigation: the years 1600 - 1660, the 1670 ’s, 1690 ’s, 1720 ’s, 1750 ’s and 1790 ’s; the number of printed epithalamia being respectively 150, 287, 417, 1. 126, 983 and 149 in the main collection of casual poetry in the Uni–versity Library in Uppsala. Until 1660 most Swedish epithalamia were written in Latin, but around the middle of the century the ones written in the Swedish language began to increase. Now the poets also began to use the reper¬toires of the Neo-Latin epithalamia (from antique as well as from renaissance literature) instead of ones garnered from the Bible, previously seen as the only legitimate sources for poetry in the Swedish language. The present investigation targets these broadened repertoires, defined as a common heritage and shared property of all those having received the requisite education, repertoires which they—at least in the seventeenth century—so to say had on hand in their own mental larder. The principal interest of the investigation concerns these repertoires’ beginnings, heydays and declines, studied primarily by means of literary ana¬lyses and <b>summing-ups</b> of such analyses, focusing upon the changes in literary taste from Renaissance to Romanticism as, primarily, an effect of the gradual lapse of an oral orientation as well as the increasing attention being paid to the literacy of literature. Some of the new orientations can be observed as early as in the material from the 1690 ’s, but the greatest changes occur in the 1720 ’s, when old repertoires and new inventions are employed side by side. In the 1750 ’s, the repertoires of the old kinds are only sparsely taken in use, and in the 1790 ’s the authors of wedding poems in Sweden have seemingly altogether laid the old repertoires to rest...|$|R
25|$|The trial {{had several}} {{important}} legal ramifications. It established {{the doctrine of}} double effect, whereby a doctor giving treatment {{with the aim of}} relieving pain may, as an unintentional result, shorten life. Secondly, because of the publicity surrounding Adams's committal hearing, the law was changed to allow defendants to ask for such hearings to be held in private. Finally, though a defendant had never been required to give evidence in his own defence, the judge underlined in his <b>summing-up</b> that no prejudice should be attached by the jury to Adams not doing so. The case, and the inability to convict Adams of murder, is also known for widely suspected political interference from Sir Roland Gwynne, ex-Attorney-General Sir Hartley Shawcross, and various members of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's government.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1966, Lane {{became a}} {{full-time}} Judge of the Queen's Bench Division (with the customary Knighthood), {{as well as}} a Bencher at Gray's Inn. He delivered some notable judgments: in 1968, he awarded damages against a school for a pupil who had been injured in 'horseplay' between his peers, saying that the school had a responsibility to stop it getting out of hand; and while acting as an appeal judge, he found for the publishers of Last Exit to Brooklyn who had been convicted of publishing an obscene book, because of faults in the trial Judge's <b>summing-up.</b> He was picked to head the inquiry into the Staines air disaster in 1972, and concluded that the underlying cause was an undiagnosed heart condition of the pilot which impaired his judgement, coupled with the pilot's known bad temper which led to his junior crew being unwilling to challenge him.|$|E
500|$|After closing {{addresses}} from Kenealy and Hawkins, Cockburn began <b>summing-up</b> on 29 January 1874. His {{speech was}} prefaced by a severe denunciation of Kenealy's conduct, [...] "the longest, severest and best merited rebuke ever administered from the Bench {{to a member}} of the bar" [...] according to the trial's chronicler John Morse. The tone of the <b>summing-up</b> was partisan, frequently drawing the jury's attention to the Claimant's [...] "gross and astonishing ignorance" [...] of things he would certainly know if he were Roger Tichborne. Cockburn rejected the Claimant's version of the sealed package contents and all imputations against Katherine Doughty's honour. Of Cockburn's peroration, Morse remarked that [...] "never was a more resolute determination manifested [...] to control the result". While much of the press applauded Cockburn's forthrightness, [...] his <b>summing-up</b> was also criticised as [...] "a Niagara of condemnation" [...] rather than an impartial review.|$|E
500|$|On 18 June {{the judge}} began his <b>summing-up.</b> He drew the jury's {{attention}} to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as [...] "men of hitherto unblemished reputation." [...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug" [...] whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was [...] "deplorable"; Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still be telling the truth. It {{is a question of}} belief." [...] Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, [...] "determined to milk the case as hard as he can." [...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that the man {{was a member of a}} conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The <b>summing-up</b> became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International. Cook's version, according to Freeman and Penrose, was [...] "actually not that different from the original." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the trial}} in May 1979, the prosecution's case {{depended}} heavily on the evidence of Scott, of Thorpe's former parliamentary colleague Peter Bessell, and of the hired gunman, Andrew Newton. None of these witnesses impressed the court; Bessell's credibility was undermined by the revelations of his financial arrangements with The Sunday Telegraph. In his <b>summing-up</b> the judge was scathing [...] about the prosecution's evidence, and all four defendants were acquitted. Nevertheless, Thorpe's public reputation was damaged irreparably by the case. He had chosen not to testify at the trial, which left several matters unexplained amid public disquiet.|$|E

500|$|On 18 June, after closing speeches from {{prosecution}} and defence counsels, the judge began his <b>summing-up.</b> While emphasising Thorpe's distinguished public record, he was scathing about the principal prosecution witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug", Scott a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but {{of course he}} could still be telling the truth." [...] Newton was [...] "determined to milk the case {{as hard as he}} can." [...] On 20 June the jury retired; they returned two days later and acquitted the four defendants on all charges. In a brief public statement, Thorpe said that he considered the verdict [...] "a complete vindication." [...] Scott said he was [...] "unsurprised" [...] by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, 9 June, Coleridge {{began his}} four-hour summing up. His summary {{was a response}} to Clarke's, and he went through on a point-by-point basis to discredit the solicitor general's speech, although in places his description [...] "was directly contrary to the evidence". Tomes relates that [...] "many opined that the judge's <b>summing-up</b> had been unacceptably biased"; Havers, Grayson and Shankland call Coleridge's speech [...] "biased", while The National Observer considered it [...] "a melancholy and flagrant violation of the best traditions of the English bench." [...] Some sections of the press, however, were more sympathetic; The Pall Mall Gazette thought the summing up to be justified, while The Daily Telegraph thought Coleridge's summary to have been [...] "nobly comprehensive and eloquent... he fulfilled his duty perfectly, displaying nothing but impartial desire for the truth".|$|E
500|$|The {{justice of}} Bellingham's {{conviction}} was first questioned by Brougham, who condemned the trial as [...] "the greatest disgrace to English justice". In {{a study published}} in 2004 the American academic Kathleen S. Goddard criticises the timing of the trial so soon after the act, when passions were running high. She also draws attention to the court's refusal to allow an adjournment that would permit the defence to contact possible witnesses. There was, she [...] maintains, insufficient evidence produced at the trial to determine the true state of Bellingham's sanity, and Mansfield's <b>summing-up</b> showed significant bias. Bellingham's claim to have acted alone was accepted in court; Linklater's 2012 study posits that he could been an agent of other interests—perhaps Liverpool merchants, who bore the main brunt of Perceval's economic policies and had much to gain by his demise. Comments by a Liverpool newspaper, says Linklater, indicate that talk of assassination was common in the city. It remains unknown how Bellingham gained the funds to spend freely in the months preceding the assassination, when he was not apparently engaged in any business. This conspiracy theory has not convinced other historians; the columnist Bruce Anderson points to the lack of any concrete evidence to support it.|$|E
500|$|Time magazine's Lev Grossman {{named it}} one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium. Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that [...] "...the spectacularly complex interplay of {{narrative}} and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of <b>summing-up</b> has been crammed into one volume." [...] In a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, the reviewer said, [...] "Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun". They also praised {{the second half of the}} novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it [...] "provocatively sketchy". In another review from The Times, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was [...] "not an original, high-concept author", she was [...] "right up there with other greats of children's fiction". Craig went on to say that the novel was [...] "beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which [...] "is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century".|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said, [...] "The movie's being promoted as the third in the director's unofficial trilogy of faith, after The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997), and {{it feels like a}} self-conscious masterpiece, a <b>summing-up</b> from a filmmaker who, at 74, may be thinking of his legacy." [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese has hit the rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's the kind of work a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he’s as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese’s career." ...|$|E

[...] He added that the <b>summing-up</b> of the case was [...] "such as to deny the appellant [...] the fair trial which is the birthright of every British citizen".

2500|$|In {{response}} to a barb in The Daily Telegraph that the show was recycled material, Cook wrote a satire of the <b>summing-up</b> by Mr Justice Cantley {{in the trial of}} former Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe, a summary thought by some to show bias in favour of Thorpe. Cook performed it that same night (Friday 29 June – the third of the four nights) and the following night. The nine-minute opus, [...] "Entirely a Matter for You", is considered by many fans and critics {{to be one of the}} finest works of Cook's career. Cook and show producer Martin Lewis brought out an album on Virgin Records entitled Here Comes the Judge: Live of the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial.|$|E
2500|$|Jean Rochette's lawyer implicitly {{accepted}} {{that his client}} was a murderer, pleading that Rochette was {{not responsible for the}} murders because he had been unable to break free of the influence of his masters. This plea contributed to the fate of the accused. Some historians think that the culpability of the Martins in the [...] "assassination" [...] of Enjolras is far from being proven, arguing that the latter simply {{died of a heart attack}} after having too much to drink, and that this would explain why Marie Martin tried to make him drink herbal tea. The <b>summing-up</b> of the president of the court was effectively a second closing speech for the prosecution; the argument of the defence, that Chaze was a drunken down-and-out whose testimony was implausible, was ignored.|$|E
