25|$|The {{remaining}} eight crewmen {{clung to}} the wreckage throughout the night but by dawn the next morning, Captain Bell and seaman Bill Cunningham had succumbed to hypothermia and died, still afloat nearby in their life-jackets. Through the sea mist Norris spotted a beach several miles off. It was decided that each man should try {{to make his own}} way to shore, and so at intervals of maybe 15 minutes one-by-one the men left the floating planks and struck-out for the beach. Nagle, who didn't have a life-jacket, went first, followed by Thomsen and Fitzsimmons. After about an hour Fizsimmons passed the earlier two, still alive but near exhaustion, and at around 10am he <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> Woonona beach where he flagged down a Hubbards Bakery truck driven by a Mr Hobbs, who took him to Bulli Police Station where he broke the news of the shipwreck.|$|E

500|$|After a {{month in}} Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England. They rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean. [...] "We rehearsed in the dungeons {{and it was really}} creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again." [...] While working in the dungeon, Iommi <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> the main riff of [...] "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath", which {{set the tone for the}} new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and {{building}} off the stylistic changes introduced on Volume 4, new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings, and complex arrangements. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought in as a session player, appearing on [...] "Sabbra Cadabra".|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Omen" [...] {{explores the}} theme of occultism. Mustaine {{described}} [...] "Bad Omen" [...] like [...] "two happy campers who have <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> a Satanic orgy {{in the middle of}} the woods" [...] and then [...] "they see these fools waiting around for Satan's blessing". Asked whether the band members really believe in the subject matters they write, Mustaine responded: [...] "We're aware of the subjects we write about—witchcraft, Satanic sacrifices and the like—but we're not condoning them." [...] "I Ain't Superstitious" [...] was written by Willie Dixon and originally recorded by Howlin' Wolf in 1961. However, Megadeth's version is vastly different from the original. [...] "My Last Words" [...] is about a game of Russian roulette and the fear one goes through when playing the game. Despite being one of the lesser known tracks on the record, music journalist Martin Popoff said that the song was an example of the band's [...] "fast thrashers" [...] and an evidence why Megadeth were dubbed as the [...] "fearless speed progenitors".|$|E

500|$|The Earp posse briefly {{returned}} to Tombstone, where Sheriff Behan {{tried to stop}} them. The heavily armed posse brushed him aside. Hairlip Charlie and Warren remained in Tombstone, and the rest set out for Pete Spence's wood camp in the Dragoon Mountains. They found and killed Florentino [...] "Indian Charlie" [...] Cruz. Two days later, near Iron Springs (later Mescal Springs), in the Whetstone Mountains, they were seeking to rendezvous with a messenger for them. They unexpectedly <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> the wood camp of Curly Bill Brocius, Pony Diehl, and other outlaw Cowboys. According to reports from both sides, the two sides immediately exchanged gunfire. Except for Wyatt and Texas Jack Vermillion, whose horse was shot, the Earp party withdrew to find protection from the heavy gunfire. Curly Bill fired at Wyatt with a shotgun, but missed. Eighteen months prior, Wyatt had protected Curly Bill against a mob ready to lynch him, and then provided testimony that helped spare Curly Bill from a murder trial for killing Sheriff Fred White. Now, Wyatt returned Curly Bill's gunfire with his own shotgun and shot Curly Bill in the chest from about 50 feet (15m) away. Curly Bill fell into the water by {{the edge of the}} spring and died.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} (and final) book is a {{discussion}} of paranatellonta via the myth of Andromeda and Perseus. Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Andromeda was chained to a cliff, but, before the creature could consume its victim, Perseus (who had just vanquished Medusa) <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> the scene. He instantly {{fell in love with}} Andromeda, killed the sea monster, and saved the young woman's life. According to Green, the digression, which is by far the longest in the poem, [...] "is very well chosen, in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at the same time: Andromeda (e.g.5.544), Perseus (e.g.5.67), the Sea Monsterstrictly, Cetus (cf.5.600), but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as belua (5.544, 608) and monstrum (5.581)Medusa's head (e.g.5.567), and Andromeda's parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia". Green contends that the story is perfect for Manilius (he is able to use it to justify the constellations' proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement, as he had previously argued in 1.354360). Conversely, Housman compared it unfavorably to Ovid's version of the story, and called Manilius's retelling [...] "a sewn-on patch of far from the best purple" [...] (purpurae non sane splendidissimae adsutus pannus). A similar sentiment was expressed by the Cambridge classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall, who wrote that while the episode {{was meant to be a}} [...] "show piece", it comes across as [...] "a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace". Between lines 5.70910, there is a large lacuna (raising the possibility that the Astronomica is an unfinished work), and then the last few lines of the book [...] concern stars and other stellar phenomena, and the book ends with a simile about the [...] "res publica of stars". This sectionin which Manilius proposes that the stars constitute an elaborate and organized commonwealth, defined by a hierarchy that prevents [...] "cosmic disaster"seems to be a way for Manilius to assert the legitimacy of the Roman state through analogy.|$|E

Indeed, Ernest Jones (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that [...] "Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'".|$|E

2500|$|According to the mythographic {{compendium}} Bibliotheke, {{different stories}} were {{told of the}} cause of his blindness, the most direct being that he was simply blinded by the gods for revealing their secrets. An alternative story told by the poet Pherecydes was followed in Callimachus' poem [...] "The Bathing of Pallas"; in it, Tiresias was blinded by Athena after he <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> her bathing naked. His mother, Chariclo, a nymph of Athena, begged Athena to undo her curse, but the goddess could not; instead, she cleaned his ears, giving him the ability to understand birdsong, thus the gift of augury. In a separate episode, Tiresias was drawn into an argument between Hera and her husband Zeus, on the theme of who has more pleasure in sex: the man, as Hera claimed; or, as Zeus claimed, the woman, as Tiresias had experienced both. Tiresias replied, [...] "Of ten parts a man enjoys one only." [...] Hera instantly struck him blind for his impiety. Zeus could do nothing to stop her or reverse her curse, but in recompense he did give Tiresias the gift of foresight and a lifespan of seven lives.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2008, {{all five}} issues of What If...? {{featured}} the Runaways becoming the Young Avengers as back-up stories. The five-part back-up feature (entitled What If Runaways became Young Avengers?) illustrates how Iron Lad recruits the Runaways {{as the next}} new wave of the Avengers, forcing them to be an actual super-hero team with costumes. Although it is later revealed that the Iron Lad that brought them together was actually Victor Mancha – Iron Lad ran into Victor's future self when attempting to flee to the Avengers' era, with Victorious travelling back with him and using Victor to hi-jack his equipment – Kang's attempt to rescue his younger self results in Iron Lad being killed and Kang being erased from history while Victor destroys his future self and departs via Kang's time-belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor after he was injured {{in a fight with}} Victorious. Written by C.B. Cebulski and drawn by Patrick [...] "Spaz" [...] Spaziante, the story had originally been called What If the Runaways didn't run away? But it was not until Cebulski accidentally <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> the Young Avengers storyline that he decide to merge the two stories. Joe Quesada, editor in chief of Marvel Comics revealed early in his online interview feature, [...] "MyCup o' Joe", that the main villain in the What if? storyline is Victorious, though Kang the Conqueror makes an appearance. A reviewer, Jesse Schedeen of IGN cited What If...? itself as [...] "a let down", although the Runaways back-up story was positively received.|$|E

6000|$|The {{examination}} {{in no way}} {{altered the}} tone of public opinion. The general opinion was that Ned had followed his stepfather to the mill, intending to attack him, that he had <b>stumbled</b> <b>onto</b> the coil of rope, and the idea occurred to him of tying it across the road and upsetting the gig on its return. Charlie's evidence as to the savage assault upon his brother had created a stronger feeling of sympathy than had before prevailed, and had the line of defense been that, smarting under his injuries, Ned had suddenly determined to injure his stepfather by upsetting the gig, but without any idea of killing him, the general opinion would have been that under such provocation as Ned had received a lengthened term of imprisonment {{would have been an}} ample punishment. More than one, indeed, were heard to say, [...] "Well, if I were on the jury, my verdict would be, Served him right." ...|$|E
