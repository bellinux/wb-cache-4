5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E
5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> from growing {{on or near}} them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, <b>sea</b> <b>squirts,</b> and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|The PEDF gene {{is present}} in {{vertebrates}} from human to fish, but not present in <b>sea</b> <b>squirts,</b> worms, or fruit flies. <b>Sea</b> <b>squirts</b> express several serpin genes, suggesting that the PEDF gene may have arisen from another serpin family member after the evolution of vertebral animals. The gene most homologous to PEDF is its adjacent neighbor on chromosome 17, SerpinF2.|$|E
25|$|Vanabins: Also {{known as}} {{vanadium}} chromagens, {{they are found}} in the blood of <b>sea</b> <b>squirts.</b> They were once hypothesized to use the rare metal vanadium as an oxygen binding prosthetic group. However, although they do contain vanadium by preference, they apparently bind little oxygen, and thus have some other function, which has not been elucidated (<b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> also contain some hemoglobin). They may act as toxins.|$|E
50|$|Pycnoclavella diminuta, {{common names}} white-spotted <b>sea</b> <b>squirt,</b> white-spot ascidian,and white-spotted ascidian is {{a species of}} {{tunicate}} (<b>sea</b> <b>squirt),</b> in the genus Pycnoclavella. Like all ascidians, these sessile animals are filter feeders.|$|R

50|$|The stalked <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> (Styela clava), {{also known}} as the club <b>sea</b> <b>squirt,</b> club tunicate, Asian tunicate, {{leathery}} <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> or rough <b>sea</b> <b>squirt,</b> is a solitary, hermaphroditic, ascidian tunicate that is native to the Pacific coast of Asia, ranging from the Sea of Okhotsk to Japan, Korea and northeast China. It has been introduced widely around the world such as off Australia, New Zealand, both coasts of North America, and Europe. It is considered invasive outside the native range, as adults lack natural predators, can outcompete native animals, feed on their planktonic larvae, and foul fishing gear and boats. In the most extreme cases, it can reach densities of up to 1,500 per square meter (140 per square foot).|$|R
25|$|The seas {{around the}} island are rich in marine life.

25|$|Early phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{demonstrated that}} the sequence of pre-mir-155 and miR-155-5p was conserved between human, mouse, and chicken. Recent annotated sequencing data found that 22 different organisms including, mammals, amphibians, birds, reptiles, <b>sea</b> <b>squirts,</b> and sea lampreys, express a conserved miR-155-5p. Currently much less sequence data is available regarding miR-155-3p, therefore, {{it is not clear}} how conserved this miRNA is across species.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{may have}} evolved from an animal {{similar to a}} coral-like sea squirt (a tunicate), whose larvae {{resemble}} early fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> do today), Vertebrates, among them the first fishes, originated about 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion, which saw the rise in organism diversity.|$|E
25|$|Reefs {{are home}} to a large variety of animals, {{including}} fish, seabirds, sponges, cnidarians (which includes some types of corals and jellyfish), worms, crustaceans (including shrimp, cleaner shrimp, spiny lobsters and crabs), mollusks (including cephalopods), echinoderms (including starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers), <b>sea</b> <b>squirts,</b> sea turtles and sea snakes. Aside from humans, mammals are rare on coral reefs, with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins being the main exception. A few of these varied species feed directly on corals, while others graze on algae on the reef. Reef biomass is positively related to species diversity.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{this theory}} of alien genetic-evolutionary {{intervention}} on Earth {{argue that if}} the Greys (or similar beings) were performing genetic manipulations with pre-human life forms on Earth that these aliens may have attempted to influence the evolution of life forms here in a direction consistent with their own genetic makeup, and similar to their own physiology and general physical structure, since genetically {{that is what they}} would presumably be most familiar with. Counter to this view, the anatomy, physiology, and genetic makeup of primates and humans are extremely similar to other animals on Earth, including those with divergent non-humanoid forms such as sea urchins, <b>sea</b> <b>squirts,</b> and acorn worms.|$|E

25|$|During tidal immersion, {{the food}} supply to {{intertidal}} organisms is subsidized by materials carried in seawater, including photosynthesizing phytoplankton and consumer zooplankton. These plankton are eaten by numerous forms of filter feeders—mussels, clams, barnacles, <b>sea</b> <b>squirts,</b> and polychaete worms—which filter seawater {{in their search for}} planktonic food sources. The adjacent ocean is also a primary source of nutrients for autotrophs, photosynthesizing producers ranging in size from microscopic algae (e.g. benthic diatoms) to huge kelps and other seaweeds. These intertidal producers are eaten by herbivorous grazers, such as limpets that scrape rocks clean of their diatom layer and kelp crabs that creep along blades of the feather boa kelp Egregia eating the tiny leaf-shaped bladelets. Crabs are eaten by goliath grouper, which are then eaten by sharks. Higher up the food web, predatory consumers—especially voracious starfish—eat other grazers (e.g. snails) and filter feeders (e.g. mussels). Finally, scavengers, including crabs and sand fleas, eat dead organic material, including dead producers and consumers.|$|E
25|$|Huxley {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} to spend {{a year at the}} Naples Marine Biological Station where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds such as the common redshank (a wader) and grebes (which are divers). Bird watching in childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the great crested grebe, later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.|$|E
500|$|Since Titanic's wreck was {{discovered}} in 1985, radical changes have been observed in the marine ecosystem around the ship. The 1996 expedition recorded 75 per cent more brittle stars and sea cucumbers than Ballard's 1985 expedition, while crinoids and <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> had taken root all over the sea bed. Red krill had appeared and an unknown organism had built numerous nests across the seabed from black pebbles. The amount of rusticles on the ship had increased greatly. Curiously, the same thing had happened over about the same timescale to {{the wreck of the}} German battleship Bismarck, sunk at a depth of [...] {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic. The mud around the ship was found to contain hundreds of different species of animals. The sudden explosion of life around Titanic may be a result of an increased amount of nutrients falling from the surface, possibly a result of human overfishing eliminating fish that would otherwise have consumed the nutrients.|$|E

500|$|Sirenians are {{referred}} to as [...] "sea cows" [...] because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. They ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although they will feed on just the leaves if this is not possible. Manatees, in particular the West Indian manatee, are known to consume over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants, such as shoalweed, water lettuce, muskgrass, manatee grass, and turtle grass. Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10%-15% of their body weight, or , per day, which requires the manatee to graze for several hours per day. However, 10% of the diet of the African manatee is fish and mollusks. Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets. As opposed to bulk feeding, dugongs target high-nitrogen grasses to maximize nutrient intake, and, although almost completely herbivorous, dugongs will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, <b>sea</b> <b>squirts,</b> and shellfish. Some populations of dugongs, such as the one in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when their supply of seagrasses decrease. In other dugong populations in western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. Populations of Amazonian manatees become restricted to lakes during the July–August dry season when water levels begin to fall, and are thought to fast during this period. Their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates – only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate – allow them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food.|$|E
2500|$|Most tunicates {{appear as}} adults in two major forms, {{both of which}} are soft-bodied filter-feeders that lack the {{standard}} features of chordates: [...] "sea squirts" [...] are sessile and consist mainly of water pumps and filter-feeding apparatus; salps float in mid-water, feeding on plankton, and have a two-generation cycle in which one generation is solitary and the next forms chain-like colonies. However, all tunicate larvae have the standard chordate features, including long, tadpole-like tails; they also have rudimentary brains, light sensors and tilt sensors. The third main group of tunicates, Appendicularia (also known as Larvacea) retain tadpole-like shapes and active swimming all their lives, and were for a long time regarded as larvae of <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> or salps. The etymology of the term Urochorda(ta) (Balfour 1881) is from the ancient Greek οὐρά (oura, [...] "tail") + Latin chorda ("cord"), because the notochord is only found in the tail. The term Tunicata (Lamarck 1816) is recognised as having precedence and is now more commonly used.|$|E
