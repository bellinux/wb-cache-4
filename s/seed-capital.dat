This put pressure on the government to create a dynamic environment for business creation. Business Incubator is one example of a partly governmental owned organization operating to help entrepreneurs starting their business by providing mentoring and education. A crucial factor when starting a business is to gather enough <b>seed-capital.</b> However, many entrepreneurs lack the capital to finance the start-up from own savings or loans constituting a gap between supply and demand of financing. Instead the entrepreneurs need to look for alternative equity sources of capital. Therefore, the aim of the report is to focus on the interaction between the entrepreneur, Business Incubator and equity investor. The purpose of the report is to analyze the availability and attractiveness of equity financing for start-ups participating in a Business Incubator. The method used in order to fulfill the purpose is a mixed research approach, meaning that the findings are based on both quantitative- as well as qualitative data. A survey aimed at Business Incubator entrepreneurs contributes the quantitative findings while four in-depth interviews contribute with the qualitative findings. These two kinds of data are compared and analyzed in order to reflect the availability and attractiveness of equity, using a multidimensional aspect. The findings show that all sources of equity for Business Incubator entrepreneurs are represented, meaning that there are many opportunities for finding equity financing. For this study, however, Business Angel financing is the most common. The Business Incubators attract equity investors via their personal networks and there is therefore no “one way” to finance a start-up, instead everything is dependent on the persons involved in the process and their motivations and creativeness. Even though equity financing is the least desired source of equity for entrepreneurs it is sometimes inevitable. Furthermore, the Business Incubator mediates between the entrepreneur and the equity investor and a well functioning interaction and collaboration provide advantages to all parties but also national welfare and economic growth...|$|E
