In conclusion, based on the analysis of safeguard measures in the European Community's legal system and their practice in actual cases, it apparent that the European Community is making a serious effort to comply with the standards of the WTO Safeguards Agreement. In certain respects, the European Community has a comparatively higher level of standards than the WTO. Nevertheless, there continue to be challenges to WTO-compatibility in the European Community's safeguards, especially in terms of non-parallelism, the simultaneous imposition of a provisional safeguard measure at the initiation of a safeguard investigation, the vague meaning of regional safeguards, and so on...|$|E

This study demonstrates a similar adjustment on a dynamic double log Imperfect Import substitutes model to allow for estimation of compensated and uncompensated elasticities. Elasticities from three estimators OLS, SURE and IV indicate that imported wheat, maize and rice are normal commodities in Kenya. The uncompensated elasticities are bigger in magnitude than the compensated elasticities. Focusing on wheat, these compensated elasticities are subsequently used to estimate welfare measures of import tariffs or <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanisms</b> through the manifested price changes.

Chapters 3 to 5 discuss the main issues raised in evidence to the inquiry in relation to Schedule 1 to the Bill, and the Committee’s comments and recommendations in regard to those issues. These issues were:   	Chapter 3 – Whether the Government’s proposed data set should be contained in primary legislation, as opposed to being made in regulations; and the scope of the Government’s proposed data set. 	Chapter 4 – The proposed two-year retention period; and whether service providers should be required to destroy telecommunications data retained in accordance with proposed new Division 1 of Part 5 - 1 A {{at the end of the}} retention-period. 	Chapter 5 – The range of service providers and services to which data retention obligations are proposed to apply; the implementation arrangements for the proposed data retention regime; and the cost of the proposed data retention scheme.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how suppliers {{who do not}} have bargaining power to protect relationship-specific investments (RSIs) can use <b>safeguarding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to create transaction value in the context of asymmetric international subcontracting partnerships. From a supplier perspective, two different types of bilateral <b>safeguarding</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> relationship learning and relational capital, play discrete roles in the process of creating transaction value. Drawing on a resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this study proposes that RSIs (a firm's resources), can enhance relationship learning (capabilities), which in turn, facilitates dyadic capability enhancing (joint competitive advantage). In addition, from a social capital perspective, relational capital facilitates relationship learning and strengthens the positive relationship between RSIs and relationship learning. Relationship learning plays the key role, and acts as the catalyst in transforming RSIs and relational capital into dyadic capability enhancing. The hypotheses are tested using data from a survey of 118 Taiwanese supplier-international buyer relationships in information technology industries. The study finds that relationship learning mediates the relationship between RSIs and dyadic capability enhancing, and that relational capital moderates the relationship between RSIs and relationship learning. ...|$|R

A stochastic simulation model of the world wheat market is used to investigate {{the effects of the}} special <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanism.</b> As expected, the quantity-based safeguard is found to reduce imports, raise domestic prices, and boost mean domestic production in the countries that implement it. However, rather than insulating developing countries in those regions from price volatility, the quantity-based safeguard increases domestic price volatility, largely by restricting imports when domestic output is low and prices are high. The quantity-based safeguard shrinks average wheat imports nearly 50 percent in some regions, and global wheat trade falls by 4. 7 percent. The price-based safeguard discriminates against lower price exporters and contributes to producer price instability. Copyright The Author 2010.

40|$|The key {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to highlight the interconnectedness between Chinas political and economic system and its weak enforcement of accounting and auditing standards. The institutional analysis shows that the prevailing political and economic priorities constituting Chinas socialist market economy create a framework, that basically relies on state-led enforcement with weak supplementary private <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The resulting policy-mix is characterized by a mismatch of incentives and available devices to effectively enhance enforcement. While the state bureaucracy has little incentive to effectively fight financial misreporting because of both blurred policyeconomy boundaries and the coexistence of multiple and even non-economic goals, shareholders and creditors do not have sufficient and effective private <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at hand. Findings lead to the conclusion that Chinas recent harmonization move of accounting and auditing standards urgently needs to be backed up by stronger efforts to create effective enforcement mechanisms. Sound reforms would have to center on a rigorous upgrading and restructuring of the responsible bodies supervising auditing quality and financial disclosure. Parallel to these measures, the increasing integration into the global economy may provide incentives and competitive pressure to comply with globally accepted standards. ...|$|R
