5000|$|Silicon Germanium-on-insulator (SGOI) is a {{technology}} {{analogous to the}} <b>Silicon-On-Insulator</b> (SOI) technology currently employed in computer chips. SGOI increases {{the speed of the}} transistors inside microchips by straining the crystal lattice under the MOS transistor gate, resulting in improved electron mobility and higher drive currents. SiGe MOSFETs can also provide lower junction leakage due to the lower band gap value of SiGe [...] However, a major issue with SGOI MOSFETs is the inability to form stable oxides with silicon germanium using standard silicon oxidation processing.|$|E
5000|$|The FinFET is a double-gate <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> device, one of {{a number}} of {{geometries}} being introduced to mitigate the effects of short channels and reduce drain-induced barrier lowering.

5000|$|The first {{international}} {{demonstration of the}} multigate devices family using thin Silicon film was performed with a double-gate MOSFET [...] The double-gate control of <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> (SOI) transistors was used to force the whole silicon film (interface layers and volume) in strong inversion (called “Volume-Inversion MOSFET”) or strong accumulation (called “Volume-Accumulation MOSFET”). This original method of transistor operation, at {{the origin of the}} unique electrostatic properties and scalability of multigate devices, offered excellent device performance, in particular, great increases in subthreshold slope, transconductance, and drain current. A simulation program and experiments on SIMOX structures was used to study this new type of device.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Silicon-on-insulator</b> (SOI) {{films with}} silicon {{thicknesses}} of 0.05 µm to 10 µm above a buried silicon dioxide layer are increasingly popular for semiconductor devices {{due to the}} increased dielectric isolation associated with SOI/ SOI wafers contain a thin-layer of silicon on an oxide layer and a thin-film of single-crystal silicon, which reduces the effective thermal conductivity of the material by up to 50% as compared to bulk silicon, due to phonon-interface scattering and defects and dislocations in the crystalline structure. Previous studies by Asheghi et al., show a similar trend. Other studies of thin-films show similar thermal effects [...]|$|E
50|$|Some ICs combine analog {{and digital}} MOSFET {{circuitry}} {{on a single}} mixed-signal integrated circuit, making the needed board space even smaller. This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the digital circuits on a chip level, leading {{to the use of}} isolation rings and <b>Silicon-On-Insulator</b> (SOI). Since MOSFETs require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT, fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and MOSFETs into a single device. Mixed-transistor devices are called Bi-FETs (bipolar FETs) if they contain just one BJT-FET and BiCMOS (bipolar-CMOS) if they contain complementary BJT-FETs. Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density.|$|E
50|$|Following these {{pioneering}} works, {{other research}} groups have followed on {{developing their own}} MEMS for mechanical testing. Important examples include the deBoer group at Sandia National Labs who specializes in the testing of polysilicon samples. At the Ecole Polythecnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), an electrostatically actuated device, similar to Espinosa’s original design, was developed in <b>Silicon-On-Insulator</b> technology by the Michler’s group. These devices {{have the advantage of}} a higher aspect ratio and therefore a higher sensitivity in the sensing structures. Some other researchers have developed other devices following the models outlines by Espinosa, Saif and Haque; for example Victor Bright at University of Colorado - Boulder. The technology has reached a level of maturity such that standard devices are now offered by the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) at Sandia National Labs to researchers interested in mechanical testing of nanoscale samples.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 he pioneered in {{developing}} Si photonics wires on {{silicon on insulator}} for new compact passive, active, and optical new linear device. His work in nonlinear Si photonics with his students and Jerry Dadap and Nicolae Panoiu is described in this reference. His group carried out the initial studies of linear and nonlinear Si-nanowire-photonics, including in 2001 Raman amplification (optical amplifier) in SOI technology (<b>silicon-on-insulator,</b> that is, silicon wires on an insulating underlay, with dimensions in the sub-micron range) In addition, he developed a high-speed Si thermooptical switch and demonstrated diode-pumped fourwave mixing in the waveguides. In later work, he, along with students and colleagues at IBM Watson Lab, demonstrated the first high gain optical parametric oscillator using an optically pumped Si-wire waveguide. This device operated above the two-photon absorption threshold and thus was not impaired by this nonlinear-loss mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Both {{bulk and}} surface silicon {{micromachining}} {{are used in}} the industrial production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, deep reactive-ion etching, has made it possible to combine good performance typical of bulk micromachining with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of surface micromachining. While it is common in surface micromachining to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2 µm, in HAR silicon micromachining the thickness can be from 10 to 100 µm. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon micromachining are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures. Integrated circuits are typically not combined with HAR silicon micromachining.|$|E
50|$|The {{drive to}} {{increase}} density and performance {{has led to}} the one-transistor, zero-capacitor (1T) DRAM cell being a topic of research since the late-1990s. In 1T DRAM cells, there is a transistor for controlling access to a capacitive region used to store the bit of data, but this capacitance is not provided by a separate capacitor. Instead, the parasitic body capacitor inherent in <b>silicon-on-insulator</b> (SOI) transistors is used. Subsequently, 1T DRAM cells have the greatest density, and can be easily integrated with logic since they are constructed from the same SOI process technologies used for high-performance logic. A key difference from 1T1C DRAMs is that reads in 1T DRAM are non-destructive; the stored charge causes a detectable shift in the threshold voltage of the transistor. Refresh, however, is still required. Performance-wise, access times are significantly better than capacitor-based DRAMs, but slightly worse than SRAM. Examples of such DRAMs include A-RAM and Z-RAM.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} optical link, data is first {{transferred}} from the electrical to the optical domain using an electro-optic modulator or a directly-modulated laser. An electro-optic modulator can vary the intensity and/or the phase of the optical carrier. In silicon photonics, a common technique to achieve modulation is to vary the density of free charge carriers. Variations of electron and hole densities change the real and the imaginary part of the refractive index of silicon as described by the empirical equations of Soref and Bennett. Modulators can consist of both forward-biased PIN diodes, which generally generate large phase-shifts but suffer of lower speeds, {{as well as of}} reverse-biased PN junctions. A prototype optical interconnect with microring modulators integrated with germanium detectors has been demonstrated.Non-resonant modulators, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers, have typical dimensions in the millimeter range and are usually used in telecom or datacom applications. Resonant devices, such as ring-resonators, can have dimensions of few tens of micrometers only, occupying therefore much smaller areas.In 2013 researchers demonstrated a resonant depletion modulator that can be fabricated using standard <b>Silicon-on-Insulator</b> Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (SOI CMOS) manufacturing processes. A similar device has been demonstrated as well in bulk CMOS rather than in SOI.|$|E
5000|$|Su began {{attending}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) {{in the fall}} of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering, recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major.
