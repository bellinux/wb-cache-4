5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} is also host to various student pranks. For example, {{on at least}} two different occasions the university has awoken to find <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> atop the 173-foot (52.7m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery. The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day. The clock tower also plays music.|$|E
25|$|While {{there were}} no {{external}} witnesses of the capsizing of Finn-Baltic, it was noticed by several people on the shore shortly afterwards and the rescue operation began within minutes of the accident even though the ship had not sent a distress signal. Around 12:30 the harbour bailiff of the Port of Hanko saw <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> amid the waves while standing at {{the window of his}} office. At first he thought it was just a barge being towed by a tug, but after spotting first the red bottom of the vessel and then its propeller and rudder, he realized that a ship had capsized in the storm and immediately contacted the captain of the rescue vessel Russarö, who alerted the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC) of Hanko at 12:40. At the same time a harbour worker standing on one of the easternmost quays saw something that resembled a new island {{in the middle of the}} storm. At first he, too, thought that it was just a towing, but was bothered by several strange details in the barge, such as the bow thruster, and decided to go get binoculars. When he came back to get a better view, he saw Russarö heading out. Finn-Baltic was also photographed only minutes before the combination capsized by a harbour worker, who remembered hearing a rumbling sound, like a freight train, shortly after taking the picture of the ship.|$|E

500|$|The feminists from Veteran Feminists of America (VFA) {{felt that}} they had been duped, having [...] "sensed <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> was going on" [...] before and during the {{interview}} with Borat.

500|$|After George I died on 11 June 1727, Murray {{entered and}} won a {{competition}} to write a Latin poem titled [...] "The Death of the King". His actions were seen as a show {{of support for the}} House of Hanover and the political status quo, <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> considering the strong Jacobite sympathies of his family. He probably did this because, having no private income, he wished to secure patronage to help him advance politically. Another entrant was William Pitt, who was a constant rival to Murray until Pitt's death in 1778. There is very little information about Murray's time at Oxford; it is known that he studied ancient and modern history, became fluent in French and gained a good understanding of Roman Law. He also became fluent in Latin, translating Cicero's works into English and then back into Latin. He gained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1727, and travelled to London to train as a barrister.|$|E
2500|$|Banville {{said in an}} {{interview}} with The Paris Review that he liked Vladimir Nabokov's style; however, he went on, [...] "But I always thought there was <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> about it that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Then I read {{an interview}} in which he admitted he was tone deaf." [...] He is highly influenced by Heinrich von Kleist, having written adaptations of three of his plays (including Amphitryon) and having used Amphitryon as a basis for his novel The Infinities.|$|E
60|$|The captain's eyes narrowed. He scented business. There was <b>something</b> plaguily <b>odd</b> {{about this}} young gentleman's manner. He tossed off {{the remains of}} his sack, slapped down the pot and rose.|$|R
6000|$|... “Lots of my mother’s {{people have}} been in the navy.” Lady Agatha {{perceived}} vaguely and good-naturedly that she had said <b>something</b> the <b>odd</b> Americans thought odd and that she must justify herself. Something most unnatural was happening to her standard of oddity.|$|R

2500|$|Mark Salisbury of Empire {{magazine}} {{awarded the}} film a full five stars. He said, [...] "Oozing style, wit and confidence from every sprocket, and offering a dizzyingly, fresh {{perspective on the}} Big Apple that only Besson could bring, this is, in a word, wonderful". Mark Deming at AllMovie awarded the film four stars out of five, describing it as [...] "As visually stylish as it is graphically violent", and featuring [...] "a strong performance from Jean Reno, a striking debut by Natalie Portman, and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman". Richard Schickel of Time magazine lauded the film, writing, [...] "this is a Cuisinart of a movie, mixing familiar yet disparate ingredients, making <b>something</b> <b>odd,</b> possibly distasteful, undeniably arresting out of them". He praised Oldman's performance as [...] "divinely psychotic".|$|E
2500|$|For her part, Pixie Lott cited French screen goddess Brigitte Bardot and Edie Sedgwick as her fashion icons – and Factory Girl as her {{favourite}} film – {{and defined}} her look as [...] "vintage clothes, which I mix with contemporary stuff, or I'll be indie and hippie, with accessories such as rings, chains and headbands ... I {{like to wear}} girlie things, but only if I can rock them up with biker boots or a jacket". Author and critic Bruce Dessau wrote of American-British actress and singer Juliette Lewis that [...] "there is <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> about [...] attractive boho-chic appearance in a stringy black vest, vintage beads and blue skirt that I cannot quite locate". In 2007 London Lite contrasted the [...] "gay glamour" [...] of American actress Goldie Hawn with the [...] "more relaxed, boho look" [...] of her daughter, actress Kate Hudson, noting that [...] "keeping the colours neutral, 's careful not to break any style rules, with classy knitwear and good-quality accessories".|$|E
2500|$|Silas plots to {{discredit}} Lynsey {{by making it}} seem as if she is having a breakdown. Silas plans to send Lynsey mad so that no one will listen to her. Rawle said that Silas delights in the idea that Lynsey thinks she is good enough to play him. Silas puts a webcam in Lynsey's flat in order to watch her. He sneaks into the house and plays tricks on Lynsey by turning the gas on and writing a [...] "sinister" [...] message on her mirror with lipstick. Of this, Rawle explained: [...] "Silas alters Lynsey's reality — so when she insists that one thing is happening, it appears not to be the case the next minute." [...] Silas sneaks into Lynsey's flat at night and moves her things around which Rawle said is [...] "a subtle way of sending a person barmy". Lynsey's friends do not believe her accusations and question her state of mind, so she leaves the village. Lynsey's friend, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), sees Silas watching Lynsey as she is leaving and Hassan said that [...] " [...] starts to think there's <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> about him".|$|E
6000|$|There was <b>something</b> so <b>odd</b> {{in the old}} man's sudden energy, and {{the subject}} which had called it forth, that Mr. Pickwick was {{prepared}} with no observation in reply; {{and the old man}} checking his impetuosity, and resuming the leer, which had disappeared during his previous excitement, said-- ...|$|R
5000|$|After befriending the {{neighbor}} living {{a few doors}} down, he falls into an affair that sends them both down a dark path.

6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Henrietta, [...] "there is <b>something</b> very <b>odd</b> in man's nature; {{they can}} {{like to do}} such cruel-sounding things without being cruel!

2500|$|Lynsey {{decides to}} {{temporarily}} leave the village. Hassan revealed Cheryl's brother, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), would {{become involved with}} the storyline and would begin {{to think that there}} is <b>something</b> <b>odd</b> about Silas, although Brendan does not think Silas is a murderer. The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets [...] "even worse before it gets better". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods, planning to take journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) with her. However, Nancy does not plan to turn up following Silas' intervention. Hassan explained that Lynsey is unaware Nancy is not coming until [...] "the penny drops that she's all alone in the woods with Silas, she's absolutely terrified". Lynsey goes missing, with the actress explaining that nobody knows where her character is. Hassan explained that Brendan finds a note which he believes is from Lynsey telling him to meet her in the woods and because he is already suspicious of Silas he come to rescue Lynsey. Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home.|$|E

Soon a small sketch, which is supposedly an old TV show, is shown. The clips usually seem real at first, but <b>something</b> utterly <b>odd</b> or awkward soon happens.|$|R

All {{symptoms}} of the disorder are gone, and the patient appears to be “back to normal.” However, the patient is not cured and this phase is temporary. The only sign that <b>something</b> is <b>odd</b> is the patient’s obsession with the hypnotist.|$|R
50|$|Another {{killer is}} on the loose, and the prime suspect could be an {{associate}} of the twisted magician known as the Faceless Man. A town planner goes under a tube train, and a grimoire has been stolen.

He searched his mind for what he could {{possibly}} have said the other night. Surely he had not {{asked him to do}} anything; certainly not given him their address.
