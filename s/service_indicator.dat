Soon URWERK were asked to create the Opus V for Harry Winston, beginning development in 2004. It was presented a year later. The Opus V incorporates URWERK’s signature hour display with three rotating blocks adorned with numbers on each side to indicate hours against a vertical and arced line marked 0-60 on the left-hand side of the dial to indicate minutes. The Opus V has a power reserve indicator, day/night indicator and, on the back, a <b>service</b> <b>indicator</b> to tell the owner when the timepiece needs to be serviced, in this case every five years. The Opus V’s crown protector is in a ‘gull-wing’ style. This timepiece was presented in pink gold; in platinum; in platinum with full cut diamonds; and in platinum with baguette cut diamonds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed examination of {{a quality of}} <b>service</b> <b>indicator</b> utilised by the Scottish Government to assess the opinions of passengers towards bus transport. The quality of <b>service</b> <b>indicator</b> {{takes the form of}} an 11 item opinion scale which covers an array of service aspects. Factor analysis is employed to identify latent constructs which are present within this scale. Three latent constructs associated with attitudes towards perceived quality of bus service are identified, covering convenience, cabin environment and ease of use issues. These latent constructs are further explored through an appreciation of how attitudes towards perceived quality of bus service vary across socio-economic cohorts {{and the degree to which}} these attitudes can be of use in explaining variation in perceived satisfaction with the bus service. Results of the analysis suggest that attitudes regarding quality of bus service vary significantly across passenger groups, with females having a tendency to exhibit relatively negative opinions regarding the quality of the cabin environment with a similar finding observed in the case of passengers who are looking after the home and family. In addition, perceived convenience of the bus service appears to have a significant positive explanatory power over perceived satisfaction with the bus service, suggesting that improvements to service frequency, availability, reliability and stability will likely increase perceived satisfaction amongst existing passengers. At a more general level, this paper demonstrates the level of additional knowledge which can be attained through a more detailed analysis of existing transport policy data...|$|E

40|$|The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) {{requires}} {{member states}} to manage their marine ecosystems {{with the goal of}} achieving Good Environmental Status (GES) of all European Seas by 2020. Member states assess GES according to 11 descriptors set out in the MSFD, and their associated <b>indicators.</b> An ecosystem <b>service</b> approach is increasingly being advocated to ensure sustainable use of the environment, and sets of indicators have been defined for ecosystem service assessments. We considered whether a selection of GES indicators related to biological descriptors, D 1 Biodiversity, D 2 Non-indigenous species, D 4 Food webs and D 6 Seafloor integrity, may provide information relevant to ecosystem services, potentially allowing use of collected environmental data for more than one purpose. Published lists of indicators for seven selected marine ecosystem services were compared to 296 biodiversity-related indicators included within the DEVOTOOL catalogue, established for screening marine biodiversity indicators for the MSFD. We concluded that 64 of these biodiversity indicators are directly comparable to the ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>indicators</b> under consideration. All 296 biodiversity indicators were then reassessed objectively to decide which of them could be useful as ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>indicators.</b> To carry out this step in a consistent and transparent manner, guidelines were developed among the co-authors that helped the decision making process for each individual indicator. 247 biodiversity indicators were identified as potentially useful ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>indicators.</b> By highlighting the comparability between ecosystem <b>service</b> and biodiversity <b>indicators</b> it is hoped that future monitoring effort can be used not only to ensure that GES is attained, but also that ecosystem service provision is maximised. It is recommended that these indicators should be tested across EU regional seas to see if they are useful in practice, and if ecosystem service assessments are comparable across regional seas...|$|R

Based on the results of this study, Kasih Ibu’s Hospital has a good service performance seen from the ratio of Bed Occupancy Rate, Length Of Stay, Turn Over Interval and Net Death Rate. It happens because the ratio shows result are in accordance with the national standards for quality of <b>service</b> <b>indicators</b> for years 2012 - 2014.

30|$|We {{investigate}} the resource allocation {{problem for the}} downlink of a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiple access (MIMO-OFDMA) system. The sum rate maximization itself cannot cope with fairness among users. Hence, we address this problem {{in the context of}} the utility-based resource allocation presented in earlier papers. This resource allocation method allows to enhance the efficiency and guarantee fairness among users by exploiting multiuser diversity, frequency diversity, as well as time diversity. In this paper, we treat the overall utility as the quality of <b>service</b> <b>indicator</b> and design utility functions with respect to the average transmission rate in order to simultaneously provide two services, real-time and best-effort. Since the optimal solutions are extremely computationally complex to obtain, we propose a suboptimal joint subchannel and power control algorithm that converges very fast and simplifies the MIMO resource allocation problem into a single-input single-output resource allocation problem. Simulation results indicate that using the proposed method achieves near-optimum solutions, and the available resources are distributed more fairly among users.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the indicators of customer satisfaction and service success of a newly established paediatric outreach nursing service. Referring agents and care recipients were both consumers of the paediatric outreach nursing service. Both groups of consumers were surveyed to determine their satisfaction with the service delivery. Two satisfaction survey tools were developed to measure customer satisfaction. The tools were piloted and refined prior to distributing them. Both tools had a series of closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Eight <b>service</b> <b>indicators</b> were developed. These were designed to test the effectiveness of the service provided. The <b>service</b> <b>indicators</b> were piloted over two periods of three months and then modified based on the findings of the pilot period. The Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) is a positive service model for health care delivery. The survey results indicated that stakeholders were generally satisfied with the service delivery. When measured against <b>service</b> <b>indicators</b> that were developed for POS, the service performance was above average, with some opportunity to improve practice. Underpinned by a family-centered framework, POS has the capacity to empower children and their families in the planning and implementation of a management plan for the child 2 ̆ 7 s illness. Such empowerment may lead families to practice better healthcare, develop better health-seeking practices and ultimately lead to healthier children. The results from this study has implications for nursing practice. The data obtained from this study may be useful to service providers considering commencing a paediatric outreach nursing service. Data may also be useful for existing service providers to use in order to review the aspects that consumers value against the service they currently provide.
