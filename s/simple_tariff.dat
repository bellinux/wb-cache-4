40|$|We {{characterize}} a monopolist’s optimal {{offer of}} service plans when only informed customers know {{already at the}} contracting stage whether their demand is high or low, while uninformed customers may learn their demand only after incurring some costs, if at all. While informed customers purchase <b>simpler</b> <b>tariffs,</b> those who are still uninformed purchase tariffs that subsequently allow them to more flexibly adjust their consumed quantity of the service. The presence of uninformed costumers makes it more costly for the firm, in terms of rent left to consumers, to offer the most basic package, which is purchased by informed low-demand customers. Consequently, the firm makes this package relatively unattractive, resulting in a very low quantity of the consumed service. We find that uninformed customers benefit from the presence of informed cus-tomers, even though information only helps to predict a customer’s own demand. However, welfare may be lower if there are more informed customers or if acquir-ing information already at the contracting stage becomes less costly for uninformed customers...|$|R

40|$|This paper puts {{forward a}} {{strategic}} {{view of what}} South African trade policy should be doing {{in relation to the}} future global trading environment. The future is uncertain, but if the past is prologue, South African trade policy needs to be positioned for a continuation of the commodity cycle, and to exploit markets in emerging economies, including Africa, more fully. Simultaneously, it needs policies to spur labour-intensive services and manufacturing exports, both because these will be needed if commodity markets are less robust and because of their employment-creating potential. South Africa's current strategy, however, is inflexible, heavily focused on domestic concerns and is in danger of placing South African exporters at a disadvantage in accessing the growing emerging economies. It also gives rise to an inherent tension between the interests of South Africa and the African region in trade negotiations. Having as the central tenet of trade policy a commitment to deal with tariffs on a case-by-case basis will not serve South Africa well in the global economy that is likely to emerge over the next 15 years.

In addition to presenting {{the details of the}} model structure, the paper addresses calibration issues relating to the intertemporal parameters. The model is calibrated to a 1976 data set for the Austrian economy. Finally, the paper features an application of the model to a <b>simple</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalization scenario. ...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{potential}} tension between the theoretical desirability of highly differentiated tariff structures {{and the ability of}} consumers to respond effectively to them. Evidence from studies of road pricing schemes and tolls, from other transport modes, and from other industries (notably telecommunications), is reviewed and its transferability assessed. Relevant models of human decision making (notably Prospect Theory, Risk Aversion, Ambiguity Avoidance and Bounded Rationality) are explored, and the use and efficiency of heuristics to deal with complex situations is discussed. It is concluded that people have a strong preference for <b>simple</b> <b>tariffs</b> but that they are able to respond to quite complex tariffs provided that they have a clear and logical structure. However, people's difficulties in estimating distance will severely limit the accuracy of their estimates of distance-based charges and their response to complex pricing signals will be influenced by their attitude to the fairness of the charge. These conclusions are summarised in a general model of response to complex prices. The paper, which reports and extends a study conducted for the UK Department for Transport, concludes by considering the implications for the design and performance of road pricing schemes (an inherent problem being that the theoretically optimum, first-best, pricing structure might be so complicated and dynamically variable that it would be unreasonable to expect road users to predict, let alone respond to, the prices on any given road at any given time - a simpler pricing structure might therefore yield a better overall result). ...|$|R

We show that no equilibrium exists in this situation, and the operator can not identify low-cost generators from bids. As a remedy, we propose a <b>simple</b> <b>tariff</b> on generation, proportional to the spread between market price and bid. With a tariff imposed, generators ’ Nash equilibrium bids diverge from marginal cost but contain information sufficient to identify the least-cost bidders.

More importantly this evidence favors the use of two-part tariffs and other simple pricing strategies in theoretical modeling in order to overcome the analytical difficulties of the existing general models of nonlinear pricing and thus responds to the many open questions in the area of nonlinear pricing...|$|E
