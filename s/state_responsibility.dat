25|$|Development of Broadcasting: Radio {{broadcasting}} {{was initiated}} in 1927 but became <b>state</b> <b>responsibility</b> only in 1930. In 1937 {{it was given}} the name All India Radio and since 1957 it has been called Akashvani. Limited duration of television programming began in 1959, and complete broadcasting followed in 1965. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting owned and maintained the audio-visual apparatus—including the television channel Doordarshan—in the country prior to the economic reforms of 1991. In 1997, an autonomous body {{was established in the}} name of Prasar Bharti {{to take care of the}} public service broadcasting under the Prasar Bharti Act. All India Radio and Doordarshan, which earlier were working as media units under the Ministry of I became constituents of the body.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{centralised}} {{decision-making and}} approvals {{at the state}} level, which are characteristic of the Indian civil service, affect the management of {{water supply and sanitation}} services. For example, according to the World Bank in the state of Punjab the process of approving designs is centralised with even minor technical approvals reaching the office of chief engineers. A majority of decisions are made in a very centralised manner at the headquarters. In 1993 the Indian constitution and relevant state legislations were amended in order to decentralise certain responsibilities, including water supply and sanitation, to municipalities. Since the assignment of responsibilities to municipalities is a <b>state</b> <b>responsibility,</b> different states have followed different approaches. According to a Planning Commission report of 2003 there is a trend to decentralise capital investment to engineering departments at the district level and operation and maintenance to district and gram panchayat levels.|$|E
25|$|The 'effective control' {{test for}} {{attribution}} {{established in the}} Nicaragua case is not suitable to questions of <b>State</b> <b>responsibility</b> for international crimes committed with a common purpose. The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadić case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the established jurisprudence of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to unfold in Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers {{in response to the}} massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to an admission of responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.|$|E

25|$|While the {{conservative}} Ethiopian aristocracy was generally supportive of Zewditu, {{it was less}} enthusiastic about many of her relatives. Zewditu's stepmother and the aunt of her husband, Dowager Empress Taytu Betul, had withdrawn from the capital after Menelik's death, but was still distrusted somewhat due to the evident favorism she had practiced {{during the reign of}} her late husband. In an attempt to limit her influence, the aristocracy arranged for her nephew—Zewditu's husband Ras Gugsa Welle—to be appointed to a remote governorship, removing him from court. This move, while intended as a strike against Taytu rather than against Zewditu, is believed to have upset Zewditu considerably. Zewditu also suffered guilt for taking the throne from Lij Iyasu, whom her father had wanted to succeed him – while she believed that Iyasu's overthrow was necessary, she had admired her father greatly, and was unhappy at having to disobey his wishes. Her separation from her husband and her guilt about Iyasu's overthrow combined to make Zewditu not particularly happy as Empress. Interestingly, even though he had treated her abominably, she held much personal affection for her nephew Iyasu, and is said to have wept bitterly for him when told that she was being made Empress as her nephew had been excommunicated for apostasy. Increasingly, the Empress retreated from <b>state</b> <b>responsibility</b> into a world of fasting and prayer, whilst the progressive elements that surrounded the heir, Tafari Makonnen, gained in strength and influence at court.|$|E

In 1918, a flood on the creek damaged the road for [...] {{on both sides of}} the bridge, and caused [...] "settling and cracking of the bridge itself". The bridge had needed repairs and reconstruction. In 1931, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed legislation that gave the <b>state</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the costs of road and bridge maintenance for many highways belonging to local municipalities. This took effect in 1932, relieving Plunketts Creek Township and Lycoming County of the responsibility.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{had three}} goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy {{restoration}} of the states, {{on the grounds that}} they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a <b>state</b> <b>responsibility</b> to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved [...] "plebeians". Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868, [...] a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish, attempting to secure a Democratic anti Congressional Reconstruction coalition in the South.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wording of}} the {{definition}} has been criticised by many commentators.

2500|$|While, the Australian Government has {{provided}} substantial {{funding for the}} upgrading of roads, since the 1920s, it has not regularly funded investment in railways except for its own railway, the Commonwealth Railways, which was established in 1911 to build the standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, and {{to take over the}} [...] gauge railways between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta (used by the old [...] "Ghan") and the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway. Commonwealth Railways became part of the Australian National Railways Commission in 1975, which was privatised in 1997. [...] Although the Australian Government has considered the funding of railways owned by State Government to be a <b>State</b> <b>responsibility,</b> it has made loans to the States for gauge standardisation projects from the 1920s to the 1970s.

2500|$|Opposition of the 60 {{residents}} {{who attended the}} public meeting on July 24, 1962 at Nichols Elementary School felt that the improvement of NY282 {{was going to be}} dangerous for those who lived along the stretch. The contention felt that the relocation would bring drivers closer to houses. Residents also complained that Pennsylvania drivers coming off PA187 were using NY282 as a speedway and this new project would just make things worse. The residents proposed that the state focus on the relocation of NY282 for a [...] length stretch of the road between the Pennsylvania state line and the crossing of the Wappasening Creek. The state noted that they would investigate the possibility of a relocation but that it would involve the state of Pennsylvania in construction and cause issues of multiple <b>state</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Opponents also felt that the state was only doing this project more to focus on the construction of the Southern Tier Expressway, which would have a connection with NY282. The opponents also noted that there was an unusued property east of the road that would be acquirable and used at a cheaper price than the proposed project. The state rebutted, stating that since NY282 was upgraded to a state highway in 1924, the road had never seen a reconstruction project and was a massive traffic hazard.|$|E

2500|$|Lack of {{adequate}} legislation which criminalizes domestic violence, or, alternatively legislation which prohibits consensual behaviors, may hinder the progress {{in regard to}} reducing the incidence of DV. Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: [...] "It is unbelievable that {{in the twenty-first century}} some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death." [...] According to WHO, [...] "one of the most common forms of violence against women is that performed by a husband or male partner." [...] The WHO notes that such violence is often ignored because often [...] "legal systems and cultural norms do not treat as a crime, but rather as a 'private' family matter, or a normal part of life." [...] The criminalization of adultery has been cited as inciting violence against women, as these prohibitions are often meant, in law or in practice, to control women's and not men's behavior; and are used to rationalize acts of violence against women. According to High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay: [...] "Some have argued, and continue to argue, that family violence is placed outside the conceptual framework of international human rights. However, under international laws and standards, there is a clear <b>State</b> <b>responsibility</b> to uphold women’s rights and ensure freedom from discrimination, which includes the responsibility to prevent, protect and provide redress – regardless of sex, and regardless of a person’s status in the family." ...|$|E
2500|$|As governor, {{serving a}} term from 1926 to 1930, Byrd pushed through {{constitutional}} amendments that streamlined {{the state government}} and allowed for more efficient use of tax dollars. He also made property taxes solely a county responsibility. When {{it was obvious that}} increased spending on road construction was not enough to [...] "get Virginia out of the mud," [...] he pushed through a secondary roads bill that gave the <b>state</b> <b>responsibility</b> for maintaining county roads. These measures made Byrd seem like a New South progressive at first. However, many of his measures were more to the benefit of rural areas more interested in low taxes than better services. He instituted a [...] "pay as you go" [...] approach to spending, in which no state money was spent until enough taxes and fees came in to pay for it. Highways and tourism were his primary pursuits, says his biographer. [...] "He advocated building roads to state shrines such as Jamestown and Monticello and called for historical markers along roadways, the first of which appeared in Fredericksburg. He held regional meetings to bring about closer cooperation between state and county road officials, prophesying that the road system could be completed within ten years through such cooperation... A tour of the highway system convinced him of the progress being made in extending the arterial network. Indeed, over 2,000 miles would be added to the system during Byrd's governorship, 1,787 of these miles in 1928. Road building was one way to keep the voters happy and prove the efficacy of pay-as-you-go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Reeve Baxter {{was born}} in New York city [...] and {{graduated}} from Brown University in 1942. [...] After university, Baxter joined the U.S. Army and served as an enlisted man {{until the end of}} World War Two. [...] He then entered the Harvard School of Law and rejoined the U.S. Army after graduating from the law school in 1948. In 1950 the army sent Baxter (then Captain) to work for a year with Professor Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, the Whewell Professor of International Law at Cambridge University and, at the time, the world's leading international legal scholar. Lauterpacht became a patron of Baxter's and was instrumental in Baxter leaving the Army in 1954 for a teaching position at Harvard Law School. [...] At the time of his resignation from the U.S. Army, Baxter was awarded the Legion of Merit and held the position of Chief of the International Law Branch – Office of the Judge Advocate General. Baxter was later appointed as a full professor of law and first holder of the Manley O Hudson Chair of International Law. Baxter's research at Harvard concerned the legal regime of inter oceanic canals with an emphasis on the Panama and Suez. He became the leading scholar in the area of law concerning international waterways and his advice was actively sought by the Pentagon and State Department during the Suez crisis. [...] Baxter's research was published as the monograph, The Law of International Waterways [...] and is considered the definitive work on the subject and a classic in its field. [...] In the latter part of his twenty years of teaching at Harvard Law School, he devoted {{a great deal of time}} and effort to the writing, together with Professor Louis B.
