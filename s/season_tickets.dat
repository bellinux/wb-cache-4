5|$|As the Flames sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest {{to get in the}} NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States. The fans responded by buying enough <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> in the summer of 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful. The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5million between 2001 and 2003.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders (STH) to sporting organisations, we empirically examine a scale for measuring their attitudes to the <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> product. This involved identifying through qualitative research and past literature, the various elements that are perceived to comprise the <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> package and developing items to measure STH attitudes to them. The <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> package was decomposed into six key components, closely mirroring past research. A survey of over 2, 500 STH of a professional sporting organisation was then conducted, incorporating items related to these six areas, overall satisfaction and disconfirmation of expectations. The results of Exploratory Factor Analysis on those items is presented here, with results suggesting the items are valid measures of <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holder attitudes that capture {{the breadth of the}} STH experience. <br /...|$|R

500|$|Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with {{neighbours}} Manchester United, {{against whom}} they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves [...] "supporters" [...] of only one. This practice {{continued into the}} early 1960s but as travel became easier, {{and the cost of}} entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481); not highlighted in the report was that within the City of Manchester itself, there were more City <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders (approximately 4 for every 3 United). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales to increase further.|$|R
