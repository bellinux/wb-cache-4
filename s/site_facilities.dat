25|$|Soviet rocket {{tests to}} Kamchatka {{during the late}} 1950s {{increased}} interest in Shemya Island, Alaska at the western Aleutians {{as a location for}} monitoring missile tests from the far northeastern Soviet Union. Old <b>site</b> <b>facilities</b> were rehabilitated and new ones constructed on the island, including a large detection radar (AN/FPS-17), which went into operation in 1960. Each of three antenna reflectors were similar to the initial FPS-17 at Diyarbakir but employed a different feed horn array and beam scanning method. In 1961, the AN/FPS-80 tracking radar was constructed nearby. Blue Fox refers to a modification of the AN/FPS-80 tracking radar to the AN/FPS-80(M) configuration in 1964. These radars were closed in the 1970s when the Cobra Dane phased array radar was built to monitor missile tests. Shemya was redesignated from an Air Force station to an Air Force base in 1968.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} was prepared under Contract No. S 04 - 55100 - 010. Executive Summary The Energy <b>Facility</b> <b>Site</b> Evaluation Council, EFSEC or the council, {{began the process}} of revising the state’s energy <b>facility</b> <b>siting</b> rules in 2000. What started {{as an attempt to}} clean up existing language in the rules and to clarify the energy <b>facility</b> <b>siting</b> process resulted in legislative committee study, changes to legislation, reports to and directives from the governor and the establishment of a stakeholder group to assist the council in identifying and crafting energy <b>facility</b> <b>siting</b> standards. What resulted was an exhaustive review of all of the EFSEC operating rules, hundreds of edits and revisions, the establishment of energy <b>facility</b> <b>siting</b> and operating standards and complete reorganization of all the rules. The Washington State Energy <b>Facility</b> <b>Site</b> Evaluation Council is authorized in Chapter 80. 50, RCW. The legislation authorizing the council is unique to state government in that it grants sole responsibility for <b>siting</b> certain energy <b>facilities</b> to the council. This includes the provision that EFSEC legislation preempts the authorities of both state and local entities when it comes to <b>siting</b> energy <b>facilities</b> under its jurisdiction.
