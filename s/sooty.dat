5|$|Common names include black currawong, <b>sooty</b> currawong, black bell-magpie, {{black or}} {{mountain}} magpie, black or <b>sooty</b> crow-shrike, and muttonbird. Black jay {{is a local}} name applied to the species within Tasmania. The species is often confused with the local dark-plumaged subspecies of the grey currawong (S.versicolor), known as the clinking currawong or hill magpie.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{birds have}} duller and less demarcated plumage. The head is a <b>sooty</b> black, {{sometimes}} {{with a faint}} greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or <b>sooty</b> black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} <b>Sooty</b> bear puppets used by Harry Corbett is on display on the pier. Corbett bought the original <b>Sooty</b> puppet on North Pier for his son, Matthew. When Corbett took the puppet on BBC's Talent Night programme, he marked the nose and ears with soot {{so that they would}} show up on the black and white television, giving the puppet its name.|$|E

5|$|The {{albatrosses}} comprise between 13 and 24 species (the {{number of}} species is still {{a matter of some}} debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in four genera. These genera are the great albatrosses (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific albatrosses (Phoebastria), and the <b>sooty</b> albatrosses or sooties (Phoebetria). The North Pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the <b>sooty</b> albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks.|$|E
5|$|HIV-2’s closest {{relative}} is SIVsm, {{a strain}} of SIV found in <b>sooty</b> mangabees. Since HIV-1 is derived from SIVcpz, and HIV-2 from SIVsm, the genetic sequence of HIV-2 is only partially homologous to HIV-1 and more closely resembles that of SIVsm.|$|E
5000|$|On <b>Sooty's</b> 60th {{birthday}} in 2008, {{he said that}} the bear was [...] "in, or should I say on, the right hands".|$|R
50|$|<b>Sooties</b> feed {{mainly on}} invertebrates, {{especially}} freshwater prawns, and small fish. But their diet can {{be far more}} varied when river flows and water levels fall, and then can include water weeds and falling figs and Pandanus nuts.|$|R
50|$|Also, in January 2008, {{a promotional}} DVD {{containing}} 5 early 80s episodes was distributed by The Times newspaper, for Fremantle Media. The episodes featured were: Bob a Job; Safety First; Sleep Walking; Connie Comes to Tea and <b>Sooty's</b> Christmas Panto.|$|R
5|$|S. g. nebulosa, {{found in}} southeastern New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and central Victoria, {{is very similar}} to the {{nominate}} subspecies but has a shorter bill, longer tail and larger wing. Its upperparts are <b>sooty</b> black, a little paler than the nominate subspecies, and underparts <b>sooty</b> black to slate-grey. The white patch on the primary flight feathers is also smaller. It was first defined in 1999 by ornithologists and bird taxonomists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason. There is a hybrid zone with subspecies graculina in southern and central New South Wales, from Eden north to the Illawarra region and stretching northwest to the Blue Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the <b>sooty</b> shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their <b>sooty</b> colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E
50|$|Little Cousin Scampi The {{smallest}} and {{youngest of}} the gang, and <b>Sooty's</b> little cousin too. If mischief has been aroused it is most probably this little bear who has orchestrated it. Appears in a schoolboy outfit. He is voiced by Jimmy Hibbert.|$|R
50|$|The yellow-thighed finch is a long-tailed species, 18.5 cm {{long and}} {{weighing}} 31 g. The adult is mainly dark grey, becoming black on the crown, throat, wings and tail, {{and with an}} olive tinge to the belly and breast. The bright yellow thighs contrast with the otherwise drab plumage, and give this species its English and scientific names. Young birds have duller, <b>sootier</b> plumage with a brown tone to the underparts, and olive-brown thighs.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} monotypic. Its length is 25 - 26 cm. The {{length of the}} wings of the male is 14 - 15 cm. The wing length of the female is 13 cm. Its weight is 87 - 105 g. The male is mostly black-blue. Parts of the head are deep purplish-blue. There is a patch of {{metallic}} blue in the lesser coverts. The male and female are very similar. The female is slightly browner and slightly smaller. The juvenile is <b>sootier.</b>|$|R
5|$|Terns are {{normally}} monogamous, although trios or female-female pairings {{have been observed}} {{in at least three}} species. Most terns breed annually {{and at the same time}} of year, but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or asynchronously. Most terns become sexually mature when aged three, although some small species may breed in their second year. Some large sea terns, including the <b>sooty</b> and bridled terns, are four or older when they first breed. Terns normally breed in colonies, and are site-faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable. A few species nest in small or dispersed groups, but most breed in colonies of up to a few hundred pairs, often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or skimmers. Large tern species tend to form larger colonies, which in the case of the <b>sooty</b> tern can contain up to two million pairs. Large species nest very close together and sit tightly, making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them. Smaller species are less closely packed and mob intruders. Peruvian and Damara terns have small dispersed colonies and rely on the cryptic plumage of the eggs and young for protection.|$|E
5|$|The bat {{species that}} occur in the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico are: greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus), Antillean ghost-faced bat (Mormoops blainvillii), Parnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii), <b>sooty</b> mustached bat (Pteronotus quadridens), Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), Antillean fruit bat (Brachyphylla cavernarum), buffy flower bat (Erophylla sezekorni bombifrons), Leach's single leaf bat (Monophyllus redmani), red fruit bat (Stenoderma rufum), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), velvety free-tailed bat (Molossus molossus), and Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis).|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or <b>sooty</b> in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, but they are not quite as developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|E
50|$|A. g. laingi (Tavernier, 1940) - This insular race {{is found}} on the Queen Charlotte Islands and Vancouver Island. This {{subspecies}} is slightly smaller than the goshawks {{found on the}} mainland and is linearly the smallest race on average in North America. The wing chord of males can range from 312 to 325 mm and that of females is 332 to 360 mm and is on average nearly 5% smaller than those sampled goshawks from the nearby mainland. These goshawks are characteristically darker than mainland goshawks with the black of the crown extending to the interscapulars. The underside is a <b>sootier</b> gray overall.|$|R
5|$|As for {{the other}} {{subspecies}} in contrast to T. l. ludovicianus, T. l. berlandieri is of a slightly smaller build, but possesses a larger bill, the upperparts are duller brown with deeper colored underparts, T. l. lomitensis is of a duller color (than either ludovicianus or berlandieri) with its underparts either pale or almost white, T. l. miamensis contains darker rusty chestnut upperparts and deeper colored below. T. l. burleighi is duller and <b>sootier</b> with less distinct tail markings, T. l. mesophilus has paler underparts and a whiter supercilium, and T. l. tropicalis is darker than all races, and contains heavier bars than T. l. berlandieri.|$|R
50|$|The black-capped pygmy tyrant {{is a tiny}} short-tailed bird, 6.5 cm long, and {{weighing}} 5.2 g. The crown is black, shading to dark grey on rest of the head, and contrasting with the white “spectacles”. The rest of the upperparts are olive-green. The tail and the wings are blackish with yellow edging to the feathers and two yellow wing bars. The throat and central breast are white, shading to grey on the flanks and pale yellow on the belly. The sexes are similar, but females have a duller, <b>sootier</b> crown, and young birds have a browner crown and upperparts, and their wing markings and underparts are tinged with buff.|$|R
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} may also show {{versatility}} in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on {{the eggs and}} chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration {{it has also been}} reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of <b>sooty</b> terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of this ground-nesting bird are {{vulnerable}} to predation by red foxes, pine martens, European hedgehogs, least weasels and domestic dogs, and by birds including crows, Eurasian magpies, Eurasian jays and owls. Snakes, such as common adders, may also rob the nest. Adults may be caught by birds of prey including northern goshawks, hen harriers, Eurasian sparrowhawks, common buzzards, peregrine and <b>sooty</b> falcons.|$|E
5|$|The pier is {{designated}} by English Heritage as a GradeII listed building, {{due to its}} status as the oldest surviving pier created by Eugenius Birch. As of 2015 it is still in regular use, despite having suffered damage from fires, storms and collisions with boats. Its attractions include bars, a theatre, a carousel and an arcade. One of the oldest remaining <b>Sooty</b> glove puppets is on display commemorating Harry Corbett buying the original puppet there.|$|E

5|$|Though no {{terrestrial}} {{birds are}} {{found on the}} atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, fairy tern, great frigatebird, bristle-thighed curlew, masked booby and red-footed booby. A number of gull species, including the <b>sooty</b> tern, blue noddy, brown noddy, lesser noddy and white tern, have been recorded, as have {{several members of the}} Procellariidae family: Kermadec petrel, Trindade petrel, Murphy's petrel and Christmas shearwater.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black <b>sooty</b> moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the <b>sooty</b> tern.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2011, the Sarnia Observer noted [...] "Sarnia had by far {{the highest}} levels of fine {{particulate}} matter recorded at any of the province's 40 monitoring stations, with significantly <b>sootier</b> air than Windsor, Hamilton, Kingston and Chatham...". [...] In September 2011, the WHO reported --"While Canada ranks third in the world when it comes to air quality, Sarnia was ranked the worst city in the country, with the most particulate matter per cubic metre of air." [...] Pamela Calvert's 2006 documentary on the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, The Beloved Community, details the startling revelation that the Aamjiwmnaang birth rate of males to females is 1 to 2, the lowest live male birth rate in Canada. In addition to the detrimental effect on birth rates among the First Nation peoples of the area, there is also correlation between Sarnia and cancer rates among men—34% higher overall cancer rate than the provincial average, a lung-cancer rate that is 50% higher, a mesothelioma rate five times higher and an asbestosis rate nine times higher.|$|R
40|$|This article interrogates recent {{developments}} in early childhood education and care policy in Britain, taking care to include the experiences in Wales and Scotland alongside those in England. It focuses on the apparently paradoxical aspiration to “universal childcare ” in the state usually identified as the most liberal (residu-alist) in Europe. It finds evidence of greater policy innovation in Wales than in Scotland, despite the weaker formal powers and flim-sier child care policy legacy in the former. England displays a sec-ond paradox: policy expansion (from a very low base) against an apparently unfavorable background {{despite a lack of}} strategic pol-icy coherence. On the basis of this record, the article goes on to a reappraisal of welfare regime theory. It argues that we should expect a degree of incoherence and inconsistency in social policies. As a result, regimes are better understood as abstract concepts than as precise descriptions of particular welfare states, which are better understood as welfare settlements. Historically, child care was the <b>sootiest</b> of British “Cinderella” services, holding a marginal place in both the theory and practice of the UK welfare state. But today, Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) policy is pivotal to the approach of New Labour i...|$|R
5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (35–30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the split between the <b>sooties</b> and mollymawks at 10 mya.|$|R
