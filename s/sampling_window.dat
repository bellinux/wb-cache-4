40|$|The star {{centroid}} estimation is {{the most}} important operation, which directly affects the precision of attitude determination for star sensors. This paper presents a theoretical study of the systematic error introduced by the star centroid estimation algorithm. The systematic error is analyzed through a frequency domain approach and numerical simulations. It is shown that the systematic error consists of the approximation error and truncation error which resulted from the discretization approximation and <b>sampling</b> <b>window</b> limitations, respectively. A criterion for choosing the size of the <b>sampling</b> <b>window</b> to reduce the truncation error is given in this paper. The systematic error can be evaluated {{as a function of the}} actual star centroid positions under different Gaussian widths of star intensity distribution. In order to eliminate the systematic error, a novel compensation algorithm based on the least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is proposed. Simulation results show that when the compensation algorithm is applied to the 5 -pixel star <b>sampling</b> <b>window,</b> the accuracy of star centroid estimation is improved from 0. 06 to 6 × 10 − 5 pixels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{hybrid of}} {{correlation}} and vector averaging is introduced to capitalise on {{the advantages of}} each process. An extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted to investigate hybrid averaging and evaluate it against both vector and correlation averaging. The simula-tions show that hybrid averaging improves the measurement accuracy over both correlation and vector averaging {{over a wide range}} of imaging conditions. The simulations are validated by applying hybrid averaging to experimental micro- and macro-flows. In pulsatile conditions, correlation averaging yields an averaged correlation function that is multi-modal, which can result in unpredictable measure-ments. A Monte Carlo simulation shows the benefits of hybrid averaging over correlation averaging in such conditions. This has been experimentally validated on the unsteady wake behind a shedding circular cylinder at Re = 98.
