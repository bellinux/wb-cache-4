I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E
60|$|JUNO. It's quite {{plain to}} anyone but an imbecile. If you tell me I've done {{something}} wrong you insult me. But if you say that <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> is wrong you simply raise a question of morals. I tell you flatly if you say I did anything wrong {{you will have to}} fight me. In fact I think we ought to fight anyhow. I don't particularly want to; but I feel that England expects us to.|$|E
60|$|He leapt {{high into}} the air as my whip cut him again. He swung round, his face twisted with pain, his flabby cheeks white with fear, and his eyes wild with anger, for as yet the full force of the {{situation}} had not been borne in upon him. Then, seeing me there, and catching something of the awful passion that must have been stamped upon my face, he dropped on his knees and cried out <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand for I was past understanding much just then.|$|E

60|$|RAINA. Who then? (Suddenly {{guessing}} the truth.) Ah, Louka! my maid, my servant! You {{were with}} her this morning {{all that time}} after---after---Oh, what sort of god is this I have been worshipping! (He meets her gaze with sardonic enjoyment of her disenchantment. Angered all the more, she goes closer to him, and says, in a lower, intenser tone) Do you know that I looked {{out of the window}} as I went upstairs, to have another sight of my hero; and I saw <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand then. I know now that you were making love to her.|$|E
60|$|We {{were making}} such a noise that I noticed nothing of a tumult outside, until some one, who I think {{was one of the}} two Swine Men I had seen, thrust his head over the little pink sloth-creature and shouted {{something}} excitedly, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not catch. Incontinently those {{at the opening of the}} hut vanished; my Ape-man rushed out; the thing that had sat in the dark followed him (I only observed that it was big and clumsy, and covered with silvery hair), and I was left alone. Then before I reached the aperture I heard the yelp of a staghound.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{then the}} clock strikes twelve, {{and the old}} guy laughs loud. 'You win, Deering,' says he. 'And let me explain to all,' he goes on. 'Some time ago Mr. Deering asked me for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to give}} him.' (I looks at the girl, and she turns as red as a pickled beet.) 'I told him,' says the old guy, 'if he would earn his own living for three months without being {{discharged}} for incompetence, I would give him what he wanted. It seems that the time was up at twelve o'clock to-night. I came near fetching you, though, Deering, on that soup question,' says the old boy, standing up and grabbing Sir Percival's hand.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>something</b> here <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} at all. And in like case, it seemed, was Fra Gervasio, for {{he passed a}} hand over his brow, as if to clear thence some veils that clogged his understanding.|$|R

6000|$|And {{there was}} Tom McChesney. All day long I watched him, and thanked God that Polly Ann {{could not see}} him thus. And yet, how the pride would have leaped within her! Humor came not easily to him, but charity and courage and unselfishness he had in abundance. What he {{suffered}} none knew; but through those awful hours he was always among the stragglers, helping the weak and despairing when his strength might have taken him far ahead toward comfort and safety. [...] "I'm all right, Davy," [...] he would say, in answer to my look as he passed me. But on his face was written <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand.|$|E
60|$|Haldane held a door open, saying <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not catch; {{but young}} Cotton, whose bronzed color deepened for a moment, made a courtly bow, {{and the big}} grizzled {{sergeant}} smiled at me across the table as he took his place beside a laughing girl, while I presently found myself drawing a chair back for Beatrice Haldane, who showed genuine pleasure as she greeted me. Her beauty had increased during the long interval. The clustering dark hair and the dark eyes were those I remembered well, and if her face was a trifle colorless and cold I did not notice it. She had grown a little more full in outline and more stately in bearing, but the quiet graciousness which had so impressed me still remained.|$|E

3000|$|Before {{reporting}} data {{addressing the}} research questions guiding the study, we first discuss how respondents had differing notions of what activities constituted “studying.” For some, it meant any exposure to course material such as attending a class, whereas for others, studying implied completing assigned tasks. In yet other cases studying referred to activities that were not assigned and took place outside of class. As one student said, “I see studying more as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> separate from any assigned material.” In addition to these task-oriented conceptions, some reported “folk” theories of the learning or ideas about phenomena that are not necessarily grounded in evidence. For example, one student stated, “Studying to me means stressing out your brain so that it realizes that the information is significant.” [...]...|$|R

5000|$|Chambers records {{his last}} sightings: Some time in 1937 or 1938, Hideo Noda... flitted through New York again. Before Noda had been alert, {{somewhat}} as birds are, {{as if in}} him mental and physical brightness were one. Now he seemed a little faded and tired. Our brief meeting was stiff. Perhaps he still considered me a [...] "diversionist mad dog" [...] and was disappointed to find that I had not, after his denunciation of me to the Party, been purged. But I suspect that Noda was so silent because, had he begun to speak, the words that came out would have been: [...] "Oh, horror, horror, horror!" [...] I stood and watched Ned as he walked away, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not often do. I never saw him again.|$|E

Why should I be ashamed of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not give rise to? I was subjected to brutality, I was subjected to torture, and I was subjected to rape, and I am fighting and I will fight." [...] At {{the time of her}} death, three of the five men accused of raping Jordan inside a moving car had been arrested and were on trial, although they denied the charges. The remaining two, including the main suspect, had not been arrested. The names of the accused are main accused Mohommad Ali and Kadir Khan who are absconding, and Nasir Khan, Ruman Khan (Nishat Alam alias Ruman Khan alias Tussi) and Sumit Bajaj who are in custody.|$|E

[...] He shot a keen glance at his lordship, whose face had {{suddenly}} gone blank. Mr. Caryll smiled quietly. [...] "There is in this <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand," [...] he resumed. [...] "It does not satisfy me to suppose, as at first might seem, that you are acting out of sheer malice against me. You have scarcely cause to do that, my lord; and you, my lady, have none. That fool Green--patience--he conceives that he has suffered at my hands. But without your assistance Mr. Green would be powerless to hurt me. What, then, is it that is moving you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, {{designer}} Peter Burley {{said that}} the design of Kamisado dated back to a chance observation in a men’s room in the 1970s. [...] "I noticed that the floor had an interesting pattern of small colored tiles," [...] he says. [...] "I mentally made a note that this could possibly {{be used as a}} basis for a board game - this is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> quite a lot, whenever I see something a bit different. It must have made a deep impression on this occasion, however, because <b>that</b> night <b>I</b> had a vivid dream involving this tile pattern, and somehow the notion of ‘whatever colour you land on, your opponent must move a piece <b>that</b> matches this.’ <b>I</b> guess my subconscious mind had been working on this and sorted it out while I was asleep." ...|$|R

5000|$|Ivy Queen told Efe {{that the}} {{composition}} process started {{while she was}} heartbroken at home. Her emotions then burst out in the recording studio.

She says the two years away from the media has helped her, not just emotionally but mentally as well. [...] "I like it, I think it {{is the best way to}} separate Ivelisse and Ivy Queen". She indicated that the album is [...] "very mature and complete," [...] because even though [...] "her style is urban and the most predominant themes of reggaeton it also features fusions of rhythms and instruments that make their own style." [...] "I did not want to lock in to the reggaeton genre or singing just one genre. I had to address more than just one 'target' or a musical style as such. I love music in general and this, when the album was born of my loins; I let the muse flow and there came my ten issues." ...|$|E

[...] "Peligro De Extinción" [...] was composed by Queen herself with the help of Víctor Delgado and one half of the Dominican reggaetón production duo Luny Tunes, Francisco Saldaña, known as Luny. The song blends reggaetón with the sounds of cumbia and vallenato. The song is composed in major key tonality and features simple harmonic progressions, an acoustic guitar, accordion (or bandoneon) playing, prominent percussion and romantic lyrics according to the Music Genome Project.|$|E
60|$|I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} to make {{mention of the}} Gulf Stream, in which we found ourselves previous to crossing the Banks. The fact, of our being in it was proved by the captain in person, who superintended the drawing of a bucket of salt water, in which he dipped his thermometer. In {{the absence of the}} Gulf-weed, this is the general test; for the temperature of this current is eight degrees higher than that of the ocean, and the temperature of the ocean is twenty degrees higher than that of the Grand Banks. And it is to this remarkable difference of temperature, for which there can be no equilibrium, that many seamen impute the fogs on the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland; but why there should always be such ugly weather in the Gulf, is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know has ever been accounted for.|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} body {{of scholarship}} on Kant’s Critique of Judgment {{is rife with}} disagreement. At the centre of much of this disagreement {{is the issue of}} precisely what Kant understands to be taking place in a harmonization of the cognitive faculties. Is aesthetic reflective judgment to be identified with, or separated from, this harmonious state of the faculties of imagination and understanding? If aesthetic judgment is identified with this state, as is argued herein, then upon what is a judgment of beauty to be based? These questions are addressed by focussing on two closely related aspects of Kant’s theory of reflective judgment; the role Kant assigns to the power of desire (i. e., to the will) and to the causal structure implicated in reflective judgment. In brief, we argue that a judgment of beauty is not, strictly speaking, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> but is better described <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> happens of itsel...|$|R
