5|$|Joseph Mendenhall, {{a senior}} Vietnam adviser in the US State Department, {{advocated}} {{the removal of}} Diệm in a military coup and his replacement with Thơ. Thơ was privately {{aware that he was}} the choice of the generals to run the government after the planned overthrow of Diệm. By this time, Diệm and Nhu realized a plot was afoot against them, but did not know that General Tôn Thất Đính, a palace favourite was involved. Nhu ordered Đính and Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the ARVN <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>commander,</b> to plan a fake coup against the Ngô family.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> <b>commander</b> had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.|$|E

This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the president that he had told his men to stand down, but Tung failed to convince the president to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute Tung as he still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for the <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> <b>commander</b> as he had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals were well aware of the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed and agreed on his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against Tung's special forces. At nightfall Tung was taken with Major Lé Quang Trieu, his brother and deputy, hands tied, into a jeep and driven to edge of the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E

500|$|Early in his presidency, Obama {{moved to}} bolster U.S. troop {{strength}} in Afghanistan. He announced {{an increase in}} U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to [...] "stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan", an area he said had not received the [...] "strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires". He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>commander</b> Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article. In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.|$|E
500|$|Back in Lang Vei, the North Vietnamese {{continued}} to harass the small force of soldiers still {{trapped in the}} command bunker with hand grenades, explosives and bursts of gunfire down the stairwell that led into the bunker. Shortly after 06:00am, the North Vietnamese threw several fragmentation grenades and tear gas grenades down the stairwell, causing panic amongst the defenders. Then, a voice called down the stairwell in Vietnamese, demanding the American-led forces give up at once. Following a quick discussion with his CIDG soldiers, the South Vietnamese <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> <b>commander</b> led his troops up the stairwell to surrender but were killed by North Vietnamese soldiers, [...] leaving behind their American counterparts. After the South Vietnamese had gone up, there was another short verbal exchange between the Americans in the bunker and the North Vietnamese in English, which was followed by another fire-fight when the Americans refused surrender. At 06:30am, the North Vietnamese successfully blasted a hole on the northern wall, gaining direct access into the command bunker. However, instead of launching a direct attack on the last American stronghold, the North Vietnamese {{continued to}} throw grenades through the wall.|$|E

Mardawi told CNN from prison in Israel, that after learning the IDF was going to use troops, and not planes, [...] "It was like hunting … like being given a prize. … The Israelis knew that any soldier who went into the camp like that was going to get killed. … I've been waiting for a moment like that for years".|$|E

[...] During a Fox News interview with Glen Beck, Beck asked Rhyner [...] "... there are only — what is it? — 192 people who have ever received the Air Force Cross ... How do you put that together in your head? I mean, you are in a very elite group." [...] Rhyner simply replied with [...] "Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process that we go through to become a combat controller." [...] Future Air Force Cross recipient, and fellow Combat Controller, Robert Gutierrez was also present at the Battle of Shok Valley with Rhyner, albeit with a different Special Forces team, and regarding Rhyner's actions he said reportedly, [...] "If it wasn't for Zach, I wouldn't be here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} poster war, all Rifaat al-Assad's proteges {{were removed from}} {{positions}} of power. This decree nearly sparked a clash between the Defense Companies and the Republican Guard on 27 February 1984, but conflict was avoided by Rifaat al-Assad's appointment as one of three Vice Presidents on 11 March. He acquired this post by surrendering his position as Commander of Defense Companies to an Assad supporter. Rifaat al-Assad was succeeded as Defense Companies head by his son-in-law. During the night of 30 March, he ordered Defense Company loyalists to seal Damascus off and advance to the city. The Republican Guard was put on alert in Damascus, and 3rd Armored Division commander Shafiq Fayyad ordered troops outside Damascus to encircle the Defense Companies blocking the roads into the city. Rifaat al-Assad's plan might have succeeded if <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>commander</b> Ali Haydar [...] supported him, but Haydar sided with the president. Assad punished Rifaat al-Assad with exile, allowing him to return in later years without a political role. The Defense Companies were reduced by 30,000–35,000 people, and their role was assumed by the Republican Guard. Makhluf, the Republican Guard commander, was promoted to major general, and Bassel al-Assad (Assad's son, an army major) became influential in the guard.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, U.S. <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>commanders</b> at Fort Bragg started {{experimenting with}} blood doping, {{also known as}} blood loading. <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> {{operators}} would provide two units of whole blood, from which red blood cells would be extracted, concentrated, and stored under cold temperatures. 24 hours before a mission or battle, {{a small amount of}} red blood cells would be infused back into the soldier.

50|$|Beckwith's memoir, Delta <b>Force,</b> {{reports that}} <b>commanders</b> of the 5th <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Group were asked by top brass of the Pentagon to quickly {{organize}} a Green Beret counter-terrorist unit {{to fill in}} until Delta Force was fully operational; Beckwith estimated it would take two years. Blue Light and Delta had a somewhat adversarial relationship for those two years. The traditional <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> leadership felt that they could handle counter-terrorist duties within the <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> community (with Blue Light). Delta existed outside of that bureaucracy, with a direct line to top US Department of Defense (DOD) brass and the President. Delta therefore represented a political threat {{in the minds of}} some <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>commanders.</b> Nevertheless, Delta went on to complete its initial certification exercise in July 1978, and Blue Light was deactivated shortly thereafter. Allegedly, no Blue Light member applied to Delta nor was asked by Delta to do so. Blue Light S-2, Capt. Tim Casey, was later one of the intelligence officers assigned to JTF 1-79 which commanded the ill-fated Eagle Claw.|$|R

Bazzi and Abu Taam however were criticized for violating military regulations by being at the same place during a battle.
