5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a <b>systemic</b> <b>crisis</b> in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that diversification at financial institutions benefits {{the stability of the}} financial system. This paper shows that it also entails a cost: even though diversification reduces each institution's individual probability of failure, it makes <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> more likely. When <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> induce additional costs (over and above individual failures), full diversification is no longer desirable as a result and the optimal degree of diversification may be arbitrarily low. We show that the analysis can be extended beyond diversification, such as to interbank insurance and financial integration. ...|$|R

Given {{that all of the}} earlier crises predate the creation of deposit insurance in 1933, and that three of the four crises predate the establishment of a central bank in the United States, one could well quibble about the claim that the relevant institutions are more comparable across centuries in the United States than across advanced countries over the last thirty years. Be that as it may, the comparison across <b>systemic</b> US financial <b>crises</b> does not: (i) support the view that the US recoveries from pre-WWII <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> were any swifter than the general cross-country pattern and (ii) that the US has fared worse this time around than in previous <b>systemic</b> <b>crises.</b> ...|$|R

The goal of the present study is to build a bridge among these recent studies and other approaches, older or newer, on the role of central bank in ensuring financial stability. More concrete, the goal of our scientific approach is to determine, based on empirical analysis, if there is a relationship of dependency between the costs of <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> and central bank independence, an issue, otherwise, little explored in literature. In other words, we will try to answer the question: Do central banks with higher degree of independence manage <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> more effectively than with lower level of independence? At first glance, the answer would be that central banks with higher degree of independence are able to manage more efficiently <b>systemic</b> <b>crises.</b> The results of the empirical analysis based on a sample of 40 <b>systemic</b> <b>crises,</b> however, led us to another conclusion, namely those central banks with higher degree of independence showed a poor performance in reducing the costs and duration of the crisis, but managed to maintain lower inflation rates during these periods. systemic crisis; duration / depth of the crisis; central bank independence index; regression model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Systemic</b> <b>crises</b> {{can have}} grave {{consequences}} for investors in international equity markets, because it causes the risk-return trade-off to deteriorate severely {{for a longer}} period. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel approach to include the possibility of <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> in asset allocation decisions. By combining regime switching models with Merton (1969) -style portfolio construction, our approach captures persistence of crises much better than existing models. Our analysis shows that incorporating <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> has a large impact on asset allocation decisions, while the costs of ignoring such crises are substantial. For an expected utility maximizing US investor, who can invest globally these costs range from 1. 13 % per year of his initial wealth when he has no prior information on the likelihood of a crisis, to over 3 % per month if a crisis occurs with almost certainty. If a crisis is taken into account, the investor allocates less to risky assets, and particularly less to emerging markets, being most prone to a crisis.

The model incorporates financial constraints and state-contingent contracts, and captures the spillovers associated with asset fire sales during periods of stress. If a sufficiently severe shock occurs during a credit expansion, these spillovers can potentially generate a <b>systemic</b> financial <b>crisis</b> that may be self-fulfilling.

When depositors are unable to commit to long-term lending arrangements, they optimally finance the bank using short-term debt. With multiple banks, lack of depositors commitment leads depositors to invest via short-term debt in a financial system in which all banks make loans with cor-related, volatile returns. The optimal financial system features occasional, costly <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> in which all banks are subject to ex post inefficient liquidations.

40|$|Insurance {{contracts}} {{contingent on}} macroeconomic shocks or on average bank capital {{could be a}} way of insuring against <b>systemic</b> <b>crises.</b> With insurance, banks are recapitalized when negative events would otherwise cause a write down of capital or even bank insolvency. In a simple model we illustrate the working of these contracts and how insurance could be achieved. We identify the main pitfalls of this approach: the insurance capacity of an economy may be too limited, insurance must be mandatory, insurance does not curb excessive risk taking (unobservable or observable), the insurers may go bankrupt in crises, and managerial restrictions on a rising bank equity capital limit insurance. Finally we discuss some complementary regulatory measures to foster the effectiveness of crisis insurance. In particular, we suggest mandatory purchase of insurance contracts against <b>systemic</b> <b>crises</b> by managers of large banks. automatic recapitalization; banking crises; banking regulation; financial intermediation; insurance contracts...|$|R
