For the important issues of security service of rail vehicles, the online quantitative security assessment method of the service status of rail vehicles and the key equipments is urgently needed, so the method based on safety region was proposed in the paper. At first, the formal description and definition of the safety region were given for railway engi-neering practice.

40|$|This paper explores {{determinants}} of church attendance {{and the formation}} of 'religious human capital' in Germany within a Becker-style allocation-of-time framework. The analysis is based on data derived from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). Taking advantage of the longitudinal structure of the data, we are able to control for unobservable heterogeneity by applying a random-effects ordered probit model to estimate separate attendance equations as well as 'faith intensity' equations for males and females. The results suggest support for previous findings based on British and North American data that age is a strong predictor for church attendance. Economic variables only weakly account for some of the variation inasmuch as high non-labour income releases time that can be devoted to religious activities. Results for differences in partnership <b>status</b> <b>point</b> to the complementary character of religious experience, whereas the findings for spouses with different religions are more ambiguous. Having at hand a presumably unique situation in the regional structure of religious traditions, we find, not too surprisingly, that strength of belief is much lower in the formerly atheistic East Germany. It is however not clear-cut that North-South or Protestant-Catholic divides exist in religious participation. Religious behaviour, allocation of time, random-effects ordered probit model...|$|E

L. ] 91 - 190, 42 United States Code [U. S. C. ] § § 4321 - 4370 f); the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulations [C. F. R. ] Parts 1500 - 1508); and Department of Navy Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Implementation Guidance (NBIG). The purpose and need for the proposed federal action is to dispose of surplus federal property at NMCRC Tacoma for subsequent reuse. NMCRC Tacoma was designated for closure under the authority of the 2005 Amendment to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (DBCRA) of 1990 (10 U. S. C. § 2687 note) that directed the Department of Defense (DoD) to reduce and realign United States military operations. The Navy considered the stated purpose and need of the Local Redevelopment Authority’s (LRA’s) Redevelopment Plan in developing reasonable reuse alternatives for this EA. The LRA concluded in its Redevelopment Plan that the highest and best use of the property was inclusion in the Port at Tacoma’s current plan to expand its maritime facilities. This Environmental Assessment (EA) analyzes two reuse alternatives: the Proposed Action (LRA’s Redevelopment Plan) and Alternative 1.

40|$|Tresna Dam Reservoir plays {{a special}} {{role in the}} cascade, acting {{as a kind of}} {{protection}} of successive water reservoirs on the river Soła. Its trophic condition affects the formation of quality of water in other reservoirs. The aim of the study was the analysis of long-term dynamics of Tresna Dam Reservoir trophic status and the attempt to determine the priority factors of eutrophication. The research is based on water monitoring data carried out during 2000 - 2015 by Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Katowice. Assessment of the trophic status is based on ITS indicator (Index of Trophical State), and the results of assessment were verified by Carlson’s indexes TSI (Trophic State Index) and using the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment on the assessment of eutrophication. Convergence of results obtained on the basis of ITS and TSI with the results of evaluations obtained by other authors with different methods allowed to accept the ITS to be reliable indicator of water trophic state, as well as easy and quick method. On the basis of ITS the water of Tresna Dam Reservoir and of feeding the Soła river were assessed as eutrophic. On the basis of the correlation analysis carried out {{in order to determine the}} priority factors of eutrophication of the examined water body, it was found that the trophic state is mostly determined by the BZT 5 value, oxygen conditions and the concentration of total phosphorus. The results of the assessement of high trophic <b>status</b> <b>point</b> to the need to protect the reservoir and take steps to avoid eutrophication in both the reservoir and its catchment area, taking into account the priority factors of eutrophication and the role of Tresna in the reservoirs cascade...|$|E

The objective of the research is to determine the strengths or the weaknesses of each hadith in the Na’i al-‘Ibd scripture, together on how it has impacted and influenced the weak (a’f) and fabricated (Maw’) Hadith among the Islamic community in Sumatera, Indonesia. The methodology that has been used, is to analyze the content of document base on the volume of hadith, whether, it is matan or sanad, together with the interrogation methodology.
