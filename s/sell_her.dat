5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to <b>sell</b> <b>her</b> to a childless couple in Kabul, an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E

Her military campaigns then continue to the walls of Paris, though she does not receive her requested reinforcements, and the siege is a failure.

5|$|Yet Brooks did {{not always}} ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to <b>sell</b> <b>her</b> paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an interior designer whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E

There she carried out experiments {{in the production of}} soy milk, subsequently founding the Letchworth-based Garden City Pure Food Company to <b>sell</b> <b>her</b> products and publishing The Soya Bean: An Appeal to Humanitarians in 1925.
