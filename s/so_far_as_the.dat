5|$|The {{first four}} decades of the 10th century are an obscure period <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides are concerned. It is {{possible}} that Ragnall ua Ímair, who probably ruled Mann during this period may have had some influence. However, Amlaíb Cuarán is the next King of the Isles on record. After the death of Amlaíb mac Gofraid in 941, Amlaíb Cuarán became King of Northumbria and probably succeeded his cousin Amlaíb as King of Mann. The former is recorded as being the Rex plurimarum insularum, suggesting {{he may have been}} the first King of both Mann and the Western Isles of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the feather, the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. It certainly is a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> feather had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E

25|$|Ocean {{currents}} greatly affect Earth's climate by transferring {{heat from}} the tropics to the polar regions. Transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation. It {{plays an important role}} in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on Earth's energy budget. In <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E

25|$|While {{obligatory}} to the Orthodox as {{a matter}} of religious observance, observance of the rules of Shmita is voluntary <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> civil government is concerned in the contemporary State of Israel. Civil courts do not enforce the rules. A debt would be transferred to a religious court for a document of prosbul only if both parties voluntarily agreed to do so. Many non-religious Israeli Jews do not observe these rules, although some non-religious farmers participate in the symbolic sale of land to non-Jews to permit their produce to be considered kosher and sellable to Orthodox Jews who permit the leniency. Despite this, during Shmita, crop yields in Israel fall short of requirements so importation is employed from abroad.|$|E

25|$|Other body casts {{which were}} used in decades past to protect an injured spine {{or as part of}} the {{treatment}} for a spinal deformity (see scoliosis) which are rarely seen today include the Minerva cast and Risser cast. The Minerva cast includes the trunk of the body (sometimes extending down only <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rib cage) as well as the patient's head, with openings provided for the patient's face, ears, and usually {{the top of the head}} and hair. The Risser cast was similar, extending from the patient's hips to the neck and sometimes including part of the head. Both of these casts could, with care and the doctor's permission, be walked in during convalescence. However, in some cases the Risser cast would extend into one or more pantaloons, in which case mobility was far more restricted.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{regularise}} the financial position of the company, but it was unable to escape from its difficulty and went into receivership {{for a second time}} in 1889. By then it had become obvious that continuing inaction was impossible, and discussion had taken place with the Great Western Railway with a view to the larger company buying the Wye Valley concern. The unsatisfactory situation dragged on, and finally in December 1904 the sale was agreed. The GWR was to pay 2.5% of face value on ordinary shares, and 12.5% on preference shares. Ordinary shareholders had thus lost nearly all their money. The sale took formal effect on 1 July 1905. As the GWR had been working the line from the beginning, there was no obvious outward change <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> travelling public were concerned.|$|E
