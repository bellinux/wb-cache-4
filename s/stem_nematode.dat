50|$|Ditylenchus dipsaci is an plant {{pathogenic}} nematode that primarily infects {{onion and}} garlic. It is {{commonly known as}} the <b>stem</b> <b>nematode,</b> the stem and bulb eelworm, or onion bloat (in the United Kingdom). Symptoms of infection include stunted growth, discoloration of bulbs, and swollen stems. D. dipsaci is a migratory endoparasite that has a five-stage lifecycle and the ability to enter into a dormancy stage. D. dipsaci enters through stomata or plant wounds and creates galls or malformations in plant growth. This allows for the entrance of secondary pathogens such as fungi and bacteria. Management of disease is maintained through seed sanitation, heat treatment, crop rotation, and fumigation of fields. D. dipsaci is economically detrimental because infected crops are unmarketable.|$|E

40|$|Field {{observations}} indicated that infestation by <b>stem</b> <b>nematodes</b> in rye {{and other crops}} depended on the type and condition of the soil. In laboratory experiments the mobility of these nematodes was greater in loams than in sands and much greater above a soil's moisture equivalent than at lower moisture contents. Great mobility could occur at both small and large pore volumes and average pore diameters. The mobility of <b>stem</b> <b>nematodes</b> in soil decreased as temperature increased and was often much greater in partially sterilized than in natural soil. A heat-labile water- soluble substance that reduced nematode activity could be extracted from certain soils in which nematode activity was small.

40|$|Research is in {{progress}} to use biotechnological tools to aid development of new forms of diagnostics and resistance to nematodes in wheat.

50|$|<b>Stem</b> and bulb <b>nematodes</b> are migratory endoparasites. Their {{lifecycle}} {{occurs in}} five stages {{with the first}} molt occurring in the egg and {{the second and third}} molt occurring in the soil. By the fourth stage, juveniles have entered the plant through young tissue and/or seedlings. The fourth molt then occurs inside the plant. The adult female must mate with a male to reproduce and lay eggs. A complete reproductive lifecycle of the <b>stem</b> and bulb <b>nematode</b> is 19-25 days (egg to egg). Reproduction takes place in succulent, rapidly growing tissues or in storage organs and continues throughout. A female can lay 200-500 eggs in her lifespan. However, if conditions are unfavorable, the nematodes can halt their lifecycle. The lifespan of <b>stem</b> and bulb <b>nematodes</b> is about 70 days. Most generations are passed inside bulbs, stems and leaves. Eggs and larvae overwinter in dried infected host material. They are also found in weed hosts and seeds of composite. <b>Stem</b> and bulb <b>nematodes</b> can survive up to two years in freezing or extremely dry environments in the soil. D. dipsaci can survive on or in plant tissue by entering cryptobiosis and survive for 3-5 years in this stage. During dormancy, D. dipsaci shows no sign of life and the metabolic activity is almost at a standstill.|$|R
40|$|Alfalfa is a {{critical}} cash/rotation crop in the western region of the United States, where {{it is common to}} find crops affected by the alfalfa <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> (Ditylenchus dipsaci). Understanding the spread dynamics associated with this pest would allow end-users to design better management programs and farming practices. This is of particular importance given that there are no nematicides available against alfalfa <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> and control strategies largely rely on crop rotation to non-host crops or by planting resistant varieties. I present a basic host-parasite model that describes the spread of the alfalfa <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> on alfalfa crops. With this discrete time model I am able to portray a relationship between the length of crop rotation periods and the time at which the density of nematode-infested plants becomes larger than that of healthy ones in the post-rotation alfalfa.

40|$|The {{presence}} of stem nematodes (Ditylenchus spp.) is a principle reason for rejecting faba bean seed for further cultivation and processing for human consumption. In the UK, annual faba bean yield losses {{due to the}} stem nematodes are estimated at between £ 400 k and £ 4 m per annum. A further estimated £ 6. 25 m is lost to the industry over 5 years due to the withdrawal of infested land from faba bean cultivation. Since chemical nematicides are not available and crop rotation is impractical due to the polyphagy of stem nematodes, only plant resistance offers a cost-effective and environmentally benign means of control. The present study investigates the species status of stem nematodes on faba bean in the UK in order to evaluate the level of resistance in both commercial cultivars and previously identified resistant sources of faba bean. For {{the first time this}} study has shown that D. gigas n. sp. is the predominant <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> species in the UK faba bean. Development of various screening methodologies has led to the efficient selection for <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> resistance in faba bean germplasm. Increased susceptibility was observed in spring sown genotypes, as shown by high reproduction of <b>stem</b> <b>nematode,</b> greater stem swellings and lesions. It has been demonstrated that virulence of D. gigas n. sp. increased with repeated reproduction on the susceptible genotype. Conclusively environmental conditions are shown to influence stem nematodes incidence in faba bean seeds. Increased <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> infestation within seeds was more pronounced in cool and humid years. This work established the differences in gene structure of endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanases in D. gigas n. sp. and D. dipsaci sensu stricto, which are known to be a cell-wall degrading genes. Complex host-pathogen interactions have been shown by increased relative expression of dg-eng gene in planta of susceptible and resistant genotype. In continuation from this project the selected faba bean genotypes are being used in developing new cultivars with resistance to D. gigas n. sp. Understanding of the <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> parasitism process in relation to the development of novel approaches for control of stem nematodes is discussed.

40|$|Alfalfa <b>stem</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{have become}} a more serious pest {{since the advent of}} non -dormant alfalfa. Their {{distribution}} has increased and their period of feeding activity has been prolonged. A state survey has been conducted to determine the presence of the nematode in the principal alfalfa- growing areas of the state. The population dynamics were followed during the 1985 - 86 growing season. Alfalfa samples, including stems and crowns, were taken from selected fields in each geographic area and the nematodes were extracted. Populations from the samples determined the fields infested and the periods of feeding and reproduction. More than one -half of the fields sampled in the Salt River Valley were infested with the nematode and new infestations were found in Yuma County. Warm weather from October through the winter permitted nematode activity, causing serious stand decline.

40|$|Plant {{nematodes}} {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} invertebrates known as round worms, They derive their name from the Greek word 2 ̆ 2 nema, 2 ̆ 2 meaning thread. In literature some authors refer to nematodes as nemas. In England and many parts of the United States, plant-parasitic nematodes are called eelworms. While some damage to plants results from mechanical injury, salivary secretions injected by the nematode into the plant are usually the major cause of damage. Experiments conducted {{in the first part of}} the present century have demonstrated large differences in plant growth in soil infested with nematodes and soil freed of nematodes by chemicals. Any plant subjected to nematode attack is reduced in growth. The most important nematode which attacks and retards the growth of alfalfa in Utah is the <b>stem</b> <b>nematode.</b> This parasite has been reported in most of the major alfalfa-producing counties of the state. In certain areas the nematode is prevalent to such a degree that only resistant varieties can be grown if the crop is to remain for more than two or three years.

In many additional areas it is not known if the <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> is present, since a complete survey of the state has never been made.

40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes {{associated with}} potato feed on roots and/or tubers. About 70 species, representing 24 genera, {{have been reported}} from potato. Since nematodes attack underground plant parts, there are no reliable foliar symptoms to show that nematodes may be the major cause of poor growth and reduced tuber yields. Potato roots damaged by nematodes may show lesions, abnormal proliferation of lateral roots, emerging white females and brown cysts. Nematode attacks may render plants vulnerable to other pathogens, so disease caused by microorganisms may have nematodes as an etiological component. Therefore, nematode damage may often {{have been attributed to}} other factors. In Scandinavia, potato cyst nematodes (Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida) are by far the most important nematodes on potato. In Norway, the cost of compensations schemes due to imposed statutory regulations of potato cyst nematodes may some years exceed the compensation for any other pests or diseases organism in agriculture. Other important nematodes include root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.), stubby root nematodes (Trichodorus spp. and Paratrichodorus spp.), and potato rot and <b>stem</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Ditylenchus spp.). Root knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla is considered less important. Meloidogyne chitwoodi and Meloidogyne fallax are not known to be present in Nordic countries.

40|$|The plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} important pests around the world. Many species of the plant-parasitic nematodes cause high losses of crop yield and many of them have a quarantine status. The stem and bulb nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci (Kühn 1857) Filipjev 1836 is a migratory endoparasite nematode of over five hundred vas-cular plant species. The <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> D. dipsaci is prevalent {{in a wide range of}} climatic condi-tions, where moisture regimes enable nematode infection, multiplication and dispersal. The main method of D. dipsaci control is crop rotation, but the presence of morphologically indistinguishable host races with different host preferences makes rotation difficult (Wendt et al. 1993). The biologi-cal races exhibit different degrees of reproductive isolation, such as partial or complete reproduc-tive incompatibility (Erikson 1974). Each biologi-cal race is able to complete its life cycle only on a specific plant host. Among the most important plant hosts of D. dipsaci in Central Europe are bulb vegetables (onion, garlic and leek), carrot, alfalfa, clover, sugar beet, chicory, potatoes, strawberry, ornamental bulb plants (Narcissus spp.), and also many common weeds. Symptoms on host plants are not always specific as for appearance. Early infested plants and low infested seeds show no symptoms. Nematodes cause swellings and distor-tion of aerial plant parts and necrosis or rotting of stem bases, bulbs, tubers and rhizomes.

This thesis investigate the possibility of eliminating nematodes by using explant cultures and creating healthy plants for future mother plants of Phlox paniculata. For this experiment was chosen 10 varieties, 'Aňa Gaganova', 'Blue Paradise', 'Errötense Mädchen', 'Molodost', Igor Talkov', 'Jubilee', 'Laura', 'Mies Copijn', 'Sekret' and 'Winsdor'. These plants were also researched for regeneration of calluses and growing ratio of shoots according to their varietes. Plants were tested for presence of nematodes Ditylenchus dipsaci by using modified Baermann Technique. All varietes of Phlox paniculata were grown in greenhouse {{and all of them}} were tested. For experiment were chosen leaf segments measuring 0, 5 - 1 cm 2 and the cultivation took place on MS medium (Murashige and Skoog 1962) + 30 g sucrose, pyridoxine 0, 5 mg. l- 1, thiamine 0, 5 mg. l- 1, glycine 2 mg. l- 1, nicotinic acid 0, 05 mg. l- 1. Leaf segments were placed to MS medium enriched by 1, 5 mg. l- 1 TDZ (Thidiazuron) and 0, 5 mg. l- 1 IAA (Indole- 3 -acetic acid). Callus regeneration at the level of plant growth regulators was almost fully vertified during this experiment. Best results were obtained from follow varieties 'Aňa Gaganova', 'Blue Paradise', 'Errötense Mädchen' and 'Molodost'. These results were also obtained from repeated experiment. Positive influence of controlled conditions to growing shoots and callus regeneration was also proved. Explants which were grown in controlled conditions reached higher efficiency on average 0, 33 shoots per callus.

Results indicated that (i) confining seedlings together with the nematodes in small vials offered no advantage over growing plants in large flats, (ii) a very fine sandy-loam soil was superior to a fine sand for stem-nematode penetration, (iii) nematodes penetrated seedlings more readily if the soil was not watered immediately after planting and inoculation, (iv) germinating seeds with a radicle length of 0. 6 - 1. 3 cm had the highest nematode penetration, and (v) highest penetration occurred when the nematodes were placed directly upon germinating seeds. The optimum inoculum level was 50 nematodes per seedling...|$|E
40|$|Plant endoparasitic cyst {{nematode}} Heterodera schachtii Schmidt, gallic nematode Meloidogyne incognita and <b>stem</b> <b>nematode</b> Ditylenchus destructor damage various agricultural crops. The application of ecologically safe natural biostimulants with bioprotective properties is a newer approach for increasing plant resistance to parasitic nematodes. The molecular-genetic analysis of biostimulants action on plant genome {{is necessary for}} creation of new effective bioregulators for plant protection against phytopathogenic organisms. In our field and greenhouse experiments, we investigated the influence of new natural biostimulants Avercom and its derivatives on plant protection against nematodes Meloidogyne incognita and Ditylenchus destructor. Considerable increase of resistance to nematodes and productivity of cucumber and potato were observed for plants treated by biostimulant Avercom and its derivatives. Impact of biostimulants Radostim-super and Avercom on increase of resistance of sugar beet and cucumber sprouts to nematodes Heterodera schachtii and Meloidogyne incognita was studied in the laboratory conditions. Comparative analysis of morpho-physiological signs of control an...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stem</b> and bulb <b>nematodes</b> are migratory endoparasites and can {{be spread}} through {{irrigation}} water, tools and animals. [...] When the plants are covered in a film of moisture, D. dipsaci can move upwards to new leaves and stems. They enter through stomata or wounds. D. dipsaci feeds on the parenchymatous cells of the cortex once inside the plant. They release an enzyme, pectinase, that dissolves the cell walls. Once D. dipsaci begins to feed on the plant, cells near {{the head of the}} nematode lose all or a portion of their contents. The cells surrounding these begin to divide and enlarge. This develops into a gall or malformation of the seedling. This opening allows secondary pathogens to enter such as bacteria and fungi. Favorable entry of young seedlings in the soil occurs through the root cap or from inside the seed. The plant cells become enlarged due to the disappearance of chloroplasts and an increase of intracellular spaces in parenchyma tissue. Once the bulbs enlarge, D. dipsaci migrates down the stem. This causes the stem to become puffy and soft due to cavities, which can lead to collapse. D. dipsaci only enters the soil again if conditions become unfavorable.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Europe, the <b>stem</b> and bulb <b>nematode</b> Ditylenchus dipsaci {{has been}} {{listed as a}} {{quarantine}} pest by EPPO: without any control, it may cause complete failure of alfalfa crops. Movement of nematodes associated with seeds {{is considered to be}} the highest-risk pathway for the spread of this pest. Since the 2010 official withdrawal of methyl bromide in Europe, {{and in the absence of}} any alternative chemical, fumigation of contaminated seed batches is no longer possible, which makes the production of nematode-free alfalfa seeds difficult to achieve and leads to unmarketable seed batches. Thermotherapy is being considered as a realistic alternative strategy, but its efficiency still remains to be validated. The combination of the currently available methods (i. e. use of resistant cultivars, seed production according to a certification scheme, mechanical sieving, seed batch inspection) could significantly reduce the likelihood of seed contamination. However, it does not guarantee a total eradication of the nematode. Although it is already widely distributed all over Europe, reclassification of D. dipsaci as a regulated non-quarantine pest to reduce the possibility of further introductions and the rate of spread of this pest appears to be a risky strategy because of the lack of up-to-date documented data to evaluate damage thresholds and determine acceptable tolerance levels...|$|R
40|$|Parasitic filarial {{nematodes}} {{that belong}} to the Onchocercidae family live in mutualism with Wolbachia endosymbionts. We developed whole-mount techniques to follow the segregation patterns of Wolbachia through the somatic and germline lineages of four filarial species. These studies reveal multiple evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that are required for Wolbachia localization to the germline. During the initial embryonic divisions, Wolbachia segregate asymmetrically such that they concentrate in the posteriorly localized P(2) blastomere, a precursor to the adult germline and hypodermal lineages. Surprisingly, in the next division they are excluded from the germline precursor lineage. Rather, they preferentially segregate to the C blastomere, a source of posterior hypodermal cells. Localization to the germline is accomplished by a distinct mechanism in which Wolbachia invade first the somatic gonadal cells close to the ovarian distal tip cell, the <b>nematode</b> <b>stem</b> cell niche, from the hypodermis. This tropism {{is associated with a}} cortical F-actin disruption, suggesting an active engulfment. Significantly, germline invasion occurs only in females, explaining the lack of Wolbachia in the male germline. Once in the syncytial environment of the ovaries, Wolbachia rely on the rachis to multiply and disperse into the germ cells. The utilization of cell-to-cell invasion for germline colonization may indicate an ancestral mode of horizontal transfer that preceded the acquisition of the mutualism...|$|R
