5|$|Ancestors of {{contemporary}} salamanders were likely able to disperse and migrate into habitats of the Rocky Mountains and surrounding areas by the Eocene. Mesic forests {{were established in}} western North America by the mid Eocene and attained their contemporary range distributions by the early Pliocene. The temperate forest valleys and montane environments of these time periods (Paleogene to Neogene) would have provided the physiographic and ecological features supporting analogs {{of contemporary}} Ambystoma macrodactylum habitats. The Cascade Range rose during the mid Pliocene and created a rain <b>shadow</b> <b>effect</b> causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin and also altered ranges of temperate mesic ecosystems at higher elevations. The rise of the Cascades causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin is a major biogeographic feature of western North America that divided many species, including A.macrodactylum, into coastal and inland lineages.|$|E
5|$|The Andes play {{a crucial}} role in {{determining}} the climate of Patagonia because their north–south orientation creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since the predominant wind is from the west and most air masses come from the Pacific Ocean, the Andes cause these air masses to ascend, cooling adiabatically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, resulting in abundant precipitation, while in much of the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically and becomes drier as it descends. As a result, the Andes create an extensive rain-shadow in much of Argentine Patagonia, causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52oS, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain <b>shadow</b> <b>effect</b> in Tierra del Fuego Province, allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast.|$|E

As a result, the lower portion of the lesion is not quantified correctly.

The presence of significant posterior shadowing of a lesion in ultrasound images suggests malignance. The light <b>shadowing</b> <b>effect</b> due to optical contrast is characterized using a simple measure and validated by the Monte Carlo photon-tracking method and phantom experiments. Clinical examples of large malignant and benign lesions are presented to demonstrate the <b>shadowing</b> <b>effect</b> and the utility of the measure.

40|$|Thermal {{infrared}} data {{become more}} popular in remote sensing investigation, for {{it could be}} acquired both in day and night. The change of temperature has special characteristic in natural environment, so the thermal infrared images {{could be used in}} monitoring volcanic landform, the urban development, and disaster prevention. Heat shadow is formed by reflecting radiating capacity which followed the objects. Because of poor spatial resolution of thermal infrared images in satellite sensor, <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> were usually ignored. This research focus on discussing the <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> of various features, which include metals and nonmetallic materials. An area-based thermal sensor, FLIR-T 360 was selected to acquire thermal images. Various features with different emissivity were chosen as reflective surface to obtain thermal shadow in normal atmospheric temperature. Experiments found that the <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> depend on the distance between sensors and features, depression angle, object temperature and emissivity of reflective surface. The causes of <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> have been altered in the experiment for analyzing the variance in thermal infrared images. The result shows that there were quite different impacts by <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> between metals and nonmetallic materials. The further research would be produced a math model to describe the <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> of different features in the future work...|$|R
5|$|The northwestern {{slope of}} Kohala has few stream valleys cut into it, {{the result of}} the rain <b>shadow</b> <b>effect,</b> as the {{dominant}} trade winds bring most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of the volcano. The seven windward valleys of Kohala are, from southeast to northwest, Waipio, Waimanu, Honopue, Honokea, Honokane Iki, Honokane Nui, and Pololu. The size of the valleys reflects the amount of drainage {{they have been able to}} capture; Waipio, the largest, at some point drained Waimanu Valley as well, and the former headwaters of Waimanu are now one of its branches. Waimanu valley, cut off from its headwaters to the summit and left with Wai'ilikahi as its main tributary, still had managed to form a substantial floodplain, although less than half the size of Waipio. Honokane Nui, the third largest valley, has its drainage almost exclusively from the north side of the summit, and as a result is a deep, long, narrow bottomed valley with little habitable floodplain.|$|E
5|$|The north–south {{orientation}} of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean, forming an extensive rain shadow and causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52°S, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain <b>shadow</b> <b>effect</b> in Tierra del Fuego Province and allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast. Patagonia is located between the subtropical high pressure belt and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it is exposed to westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40°S there is little land to block these winds. Because Patagonia is located between the semi-permanent anticyclones of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean at around 30°S, and the Subpolar Low at around 60°S, {{the movement of the}} high and low pressure systems along with ocean currents determine the precipitation pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain <b>shadow</b> <b>effect</b> which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} study is conducted {{to investigate the}} stress <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> (stress reorientation and change) during hydraulic fracturing in a transverse multiple fracture system. A numerical model {{is used for the}} numerical study. It is a 3 D model and can simulate the fracture operation from injection begin to full closure (fracture contact). Therefore, {{there is no need to}} assume the fracture geometry for the investigation of the stress <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> (unlike previous studies). In the numerical study, the first and second operations in a fictive transverse multiple fracture system are simulated, meanwhile the stress <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> and their influences on the propagation and proppant placement of the second fracture are investigated. According to the results, the following conclusions are discerned: (1) most proppants are located in the lower part of the reservoir, even below the perforation; (2) the stress <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> are time-dependent and proppant dominated; (3) the stress <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> affect the fracture propagation and the proppant placement of the second fracture, and also the fracture conductivity of the first fracture; (4) the time-dependent stress <b>shadow</b> <b>effects</b> can be divided into four phases, fracture enlargement, closure without proppant contact, closure with proppant contact and full closure; and (5) the superposition effect of the stress shadow in a transverse multiple fracture system exists.
