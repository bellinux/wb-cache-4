5|$|Skipper Thomas Crisp VC, DSC, RNR (28 April 1876 – 15 August 1917) was an English posthumous {{recipient}} of the Victoria Cross. Crisp, in civilian life a commercial fisherman operating from Lowestoft in Suffolk, earned his award after being killed during the defence of his vessel, the armed naval <b>smack</b> His Majesty's <b>Smack</b> Nelson, in the North Sea against an attack from a German submarine in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Following {{her success}} with <b>Smack</b> the Pony, Channel 4 gave Pile a fairly free hand with her next project. Their only {{requirement}} {{was that it}} should have enough of a narrative thread to make it more of a sitcom than a sketch show.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by {{the summer}} of 1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve, {{arranging}} for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed <b>Smack</b> I'll Try, armed with a 3–pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, I'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the <b>smack</b> and her companion the larger Boy Alfred. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post–war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean–going Q–ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a stew of tripe,' {{said the}} {{landlord}} <b>smacking</b> his lips, 'and cow-heel,' <b>smacking</b> them again, 'and bacon,' <b>smacking</b> them once more, 'and steak,' <b>smacking</b> {{them for the}} fourth time, 'and peas, cauliflowers, new potatoes, and sparrow-grass, all working up together in one delicious gravy.' Having come to the climax, he <b>smacked</b> his lips a great many times, and taking a long hearty sniff of the fragrance that was hovering about, put on the cover again with the air of one whose toils on earth were over.|$|R
60|$|A {{wholesome}} gust {{of moral}} impatience stirred him. He <b>smacked</b> {{the back of}} the seat hard, as though he <b>smacked</b> himself.|$|R
50|$|Some old <b>smacks</b> {{have been}} re-rigged into ketches {{and are now}} used as {{training}} boats for young sailors. Other <b>smacks</b> are preserved in museums or used as floating museums.|$|R
5|$|Green Wing is {{an award-winning}} British sitcom {{set in the}} fictional East Hampton Hospital. It {{was created by the}} same team behind the sketch show <b>Smack</b> the Pony - Channel 4 {{commissioner}} Caroline Leddy and producer Victoria Pile, - and stars Tamsin Greig, Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt.|$|E
5|$|Inverlyon was {{a fishing}} <b>smack</b> of 59 tons burthen {{that was a}} part of the fishing fleet at Lowestoft on the Suffolk coast. The wooden boat had a flush deck, two masts, and no engine. Inverlyons sails were fore-and-aft rigged and may have been red ochre in colour, the {{traditional}} sail colour for British smacks.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March, UB-16, {{now under}} the command of Oblt. Rudolf Stier, was {{responsible}} for sinking the 895-ton steamer Lisette near the Shipwash Lightship. One month later, on 13 April, the fishing <b>smack</b> Ruth was boarded and sunk by UB-16; Ruth was the final ship sunk by UB-16.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1870s, these <b>smacks</b> {{traveled}} from London to Iceland in summer, and returned via North Sea ports, including Holland. From the 1870s, those converted to dry ketches {{were used in}} fleeting in the North Sea, especially in the Silver Pits. From 1900 to 1920, the last welled <b>smacks</b> were sold to the Faroe Islands. The last welled <b>smacks</b> sank in the Faroes in about 1920.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, {{advertising}} {{campaigns for}} the cereal featured Dig'em attempting {{to have a}} bowl of <b>Smacks</b> while trying to outsmart his nemesis, Kitty. By 1997, these commercials were discontinued. Dig'em's voice was provided by Len Dresslar and for present the character is voiced in commercials by Frank Welker. While ads for Honey <b>Smacks</b> no longer air in the US, more recent ads in other countries depict Dig'em as a character who's crazily addicted to <b>Smacks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Tommy {{said this}} in a most businesslike tone, but could not help <b>smacking</b> his lips. He <b>smacked</b> them again {{when he had to}} write: [...] "Have no fear, little woman; I am by your side." [...] Or, [...] "What a sweet child you are!" ...|$|R
5|$|Booker T and Sharmell fought Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks in a Mixed Tag Team match. The {{encounter}} lasted {{ten minutes}} and forty-seven seconds. Sharmell {{ended up getting}} the pinfall on Brooks with a roll up pin. After the contest, Roode blamed Brooks for the lost, which resulted in Brooks slapping Roode and Roode grabbing her by the hair. Sharmell then came to Brooks' defense, causing Roode to accidentally <b>smack</b> her in the face, knocking her out in storyline.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, while {{searching for}} a U-boat {{in the area of}} Conigbeg Rock, the {{destroyer}} received word that the Conigbeg Lightship had rescued survivors from a fishing vessel. Wainwright rendezvoused with the craft to interview the four seamen of the <b>smack</b> Our Bairns. They revealed that the U-boat—which turned out to be —was of the latest type Germany had in action. The destroyer relieved the lighthouse vessel of the four fishermen and continued the search until dusk, when she headed back to Queenstown to land the rescued men.|$|E

5000|$|Introduced in 1953, {{the cereal}} has {{undergone}} several name changes. It {{started out as}} Sugar <b>Smacks.</b> In the 1980s, it was renamed Honey <b>Smacks.</b> In the early 1990s, perhaps because the product mascot, Dig'em Frog, had customarily been portrayed as calling the cereal [...] "Smacks", the word [...] "Honey" [...] was dropped from the name and the product was then simply called <b>Smacks.</b> That name is still used in Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, where a box was featured in the film Alphaville. However, in the US the name reverted to Honey <b>Smacks</b> in 2004. In the UK in 1957, a similar product called Sugar Puffs debuted; it was formerly produced by the Quaker Oats Company and now by Big Bear trading as Honey Monster Foods.|$|R

5|$|With such a heavy {{disparity}} in armament between the smack's 3pounder and the submarine's 88mm deck gun the engagement was short lived, the submarine firing eight shots before the Nelson could get {{within range of}} her opponent. The fourth shot fired by the U-boat holed the <b>smack,</b> and the seventh tore off both of Crisp's legs from underneath him. Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard, Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat's four carrier pigeons: like many small ships of the era, the Nelson did not possess a radio set.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{promoted}} to Temporary Flying Officer, Brooks began {{working for the}} Missing Research and Enquiry Service (MRES), which was an initiative to locate individuals from the Commonwealth of Nations who were missing or killed in action during World War II over hostile territory. He worked with the service for nearly two years, from November 1945 through July 1947, as a Search Officer in Denmark, Norway, and as a Section Leader in the American Zone of Germany. Brooks and a colleague sailed a fishing <b>smack</b> around Cape Nordkinn in the Arctic Circle, the most northerly coastal point of the mainland of Europe, {{in the search for}} missing airmen. It was during his tenure with MRES that he met his wife Birthe. He also played ice hockey during his downtime in Scandinavia with the U.S. Army Allstars, and was selected {{to be a member of}} Canada's national delegation to the 1948 Winter Olympics. This squad, known as the Ottawa RCAF Flyers, consisted entirely of members of the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In Fort Myers, {{property}} damage was slight, limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing shacks along the waterfront. Nearly all cigar factories in Tampa were closed after {{wind and rain}} drove too much moisture into the buildings. Offshore, the fishing <b>smack</b> Wallace A. McDonnell was beached near Piney Point, though all of the crew survived. Additionally, the Cuban schooner Isabel Alvado sank offshore Boca Grande. The crew, who were immigrants, were rescued by the Coast Guard and later deported. In Martin County, a bridge connecting Stuart and Palm City was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result. A temporary ferry service across the St. Lucie River was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete {{in the summer of}} 1929. In Fort Pierce, most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas. A warehouse, fish houses, docks, and a bridge across the Indian River were destroyed, while several other buildings were unroofed. Damage in the city totaled about $150,000.|$|E

5|$|The sinking <b>smack</b> was {{abandoned}} by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered {{that he should be}} thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later. It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him. The Ethel & Millie had just arrived on the scene as the Nelson sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelson's lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.|$|E
5|$|Following a hiatus {{due to the}} , Maryse {{returned}} to WWE television on the June 27 episode of Raw, where she helped Miz to retain his championship against Kane after she faked an ankle injury. After being drafted to Smackdown {{as part of the}} 2016 WWE draft which took place on July 19, Ouellet made her first appearance for the brand on July 26, where she co-hosted a Miz TV segment along her husband before being interrupted by Randy Orton, who challenged Miz to a non-title match, in which he was subsequently defeated. At Backlash, Maryse successfully helped Miz to retain the Intercontinental Championship by spraying something at Dolph Ziggler whilst Miz distracted the referee. The following week, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan announced a rematch for the championship due Maryse's interference at Backlash. On September 20, Miz retained the championship over Ziggler. On October 9, at No Mercy Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ziggler in a title vs career match when Maryse was banned from the ringside along with The Spirit Squad (Kenny and Mikey), who was contracted by her to help Miz, ending Miz's reign at 188 days. On November 8 episode of SmackDown, Maryse went on to speak in Miz's name due Miz refuse to speak with Daniel Bryan. At that night, Maryse accepted Bryan's offer to Miz face Ziggler the following week for the Intercontinental Championship in the 900th episode of SmackDown. Later that night, Bryan would state on Talking <b>Smack</b> that if Ziggler successfully retains his championship, The Miz and Maryse would be traded to Raw for someone else. On November 15 at the 900th episode of SmackDown, Maryse helped Miz to win the championship for the sixth time and also retain it at Survivor Series against Sami Zayn.|$|E
