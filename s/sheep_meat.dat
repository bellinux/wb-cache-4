5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less <b>sheep</b> <b>meat</b> is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E

25|$|The largest part of {{traditional}} Faroese food consists of meat. Because of the rugged, rocky Faroese terrain, grain and vegetables do not grow very well, as only about 2% of the 1,393km2 is arable land and none is {{set aside for}} permanent crops. Globally, less than 3% of the earth's surface is suitable for crop production (for food and clothing purposes). During the winter months, the Faroe Islanders’ only option was to eat mostly salted or dried food (this includes <b>sheep</b> <b>meat,</b> pilot whale meat, seabirds, and fish). This means that over the centuries, the pilot whale {{has been an important}} source of nutrition for the isolated population on the North Atlantic archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Parres el Guarda {{was founded}} {{in the middle of}} the 19th century as a rail town, when the line {{connecting}} Mexico City and Cuernavaca was built. Parres was an important stop for both passengers and freight along this line. The community was founded on lands that belonged to the Juan de las Fuentes Parres Hacienda, giving the town its name. Today, one can still see the ruins of the old hacienda main house. Its economy currently is based on the cultivation of animal feed and is an important producer of this product. It is also known for the <b>sheep</b> <b>meat</b> which is most often used in the preparation of barbacoa in the Mexico City area. Its patron saint is the Virgin of Guadalupe, celebrated on 12 December traditionally with the Chinelos dance, fireworks, cockfights and more.|$|E
25|$|Sheep farming {{introduced}} in the late 19th century has been a principal economic activity. After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the Pampa (to the North). Chubut (mainly Merino) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still there is little investment in new abbatoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew and Rio Gallegos), and often there are phytosanitary restrictions to the export of <b>sheep</b> <b>meat.</b> Extensive valleys in the Cordilleran range have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 {{the first}} Faroese patient with {{systemic}} primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) was diagnosed. Later other patients were found, {{but nothing was}} done {{to find out if}} the illness was common or if something should be done about it. Not until 2008 when a young woman died just a few days after being diagnosed with SPCD (in the Faroes, the illness is named CTD), actions were finally taken by the Faroese health authorities. The young woman had not been treated, and this caused a big discussion about how to prevent this from happening again. Shortly after, all Faroese people in the Faroes were invited to take a blood sample for a small cost and get it screened for SPCD. Several persons with the illness were found and got treatment immediately. It is now known that several Faroese people have died a sudden death at a young age because of this illness. Around one third of the Faroese population has been screened for SPCD (with a blood sample), and scientists think that at least one of every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes have the illness. There have also been found elderly people who have survived the illness without treatment. The treatment is to give the patients carnitine supplement. The German physician and scientist Ulrike Steurwald, who has done research in the Faroe Islands for several years, has argued that the Faroese diet of red meat, like <b>sheep</b> <b>meat</b> and whale meat which contain high amounts of carnitine, may have protected many Faroese people from a sudden death at a young age from SPCD. The whale meat contains nutritions like carnitine, taurine and selenium. The concentration of selenium in raw fresh cod fillet and raw fresh pilot whale meat is 28µg/100g and 185µg/100g. The whale's blubber is rich in vitamin D, which around half of the elderly population and many amongst the younger generations in the Faroe Islands are lacking. Reasons for this can be changes from traditional food to pizza, chicken, etc. The fat of sea mammals provide excellent sources of vitamins A, D and E.|$|E
500|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>meat</b> {{and milk}} {{were one of}} the {{earliest}} staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture. [...] <b>Sheep</b> <b>meat</b> prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb. [...] "Mutton" [...] is derived from the Old French moton, which was the word for sheep used by the Anglo-Norman rulers of much of the British Isles in the Middle Ages.

500|$|In the 21st century, {{the nations}} {{with the highest}} {{consumption}} of <b>sheep</b> <b>meat</b> are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland.

This often reflects a history of sheep production. In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional.

Perhaps the most unusual dish of <b>sheep</b> <b>meat</b> is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach. [...] In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5kg), with Americans eating 50pounds (22kg) of pork and 65pounds (29kg) of beef. In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly lamb chops and leg of lamb.|$|E

And there was a fish with lungs. When the water dries up it can live in the mud. Most curious of all was a parrot that kills sheep. On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand sheep in a whole year. He doesn't want the whole sheep, but only the kidney-fat. This restricted taste makes him an expensive bird to support. To get the fat he drives his beak in and rips it out; the wound is mortal. This parrot furnishes a notable example of evolution brought about by changed conditions. When the sheep culture was introduced, it presently brought famine to the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub which had always thitherto been the parrot's diet. The miseries of hunger made the bird willing to eat raw flesh, since it could get no other food, and it began to pick remnants of meat from sheep skins hung out on the fences to dry. It soon came to prefer <b>sheep</b> <b>meat</b> to any other food, and by and by it came to prefer the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep. The parrot's bill was not well shaped for digging out the fat, but Nature fixed that matter; she altered the bill's shape, and now the parrot can dig out kidney-fat better than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, or anybody else, for that matter--even an Admiral.|$|E

Blood samples were collected via the jugular vein at d 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 to determine the neuroendocrine hormone levels. The fasting weight of the sheep was measured during the experimental period, and feed offered and refusals were recorded daily.
