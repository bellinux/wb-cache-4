5000|$|Pandanus tectorius is {{a species}} of Pandanus (<b>screwpine)</b> that is native to Malesia, eastern Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It grows in the coastal {{lowlands}} typically {{near the edge of}} the ocean. Common names in English include Tahitian <b>screwpine,</b> [...] thatch <b>screwpine.,</b> hala tree; pandanus, and pu hala in Hawaiian. The fruit is sometimes known as hala fruit.|$|E
50|$|These are {{starches}} such as rice, {{which is}} eaten boiled or ground into flour, or tubers such as taro (ala), sweet potato (kattala), and cassava (dandialuvi), {{as well as}} fruits like breadfruit (bambukeyo) or <b>screwpine</b> (kashikeyo). Tubers and breadfruit are eaten boiled. The <b>screwpine</b> fruit is mostly eaten raw after having been cut into thin slices.|$|E
50|$|L. williamsis {{tropical}} forest habitat is also shrinking and fragmenting. Neither of the Catchment Forest Reserves where it occurs is well-protected. The forest is seriously threatened by pet collectors, clearing for farmland, illegal logging, increasingly frequent fires, mining of rubies, tourmaline, rhodolite, gold and dolomite and limestone from outcrops {{on which the}} <b>screwpines</b> grow. Invasive trees such as Cedrela are also a threat. There is little forest left unaffected.|$|R
50|$|The {{island of}} Landaa Giraavaru {{is covered with}} dense {{tropical}} vegetation, including in particular takamakas, coconut palm trees and <b>screwpines.</b> This vegetation shelters many animal species such as geckos, frigate birds, crabs, hermit crabs, dragon lizards, butterflies and dragonflies. It is also inhabited by a big ground bird, the white-breasted waterhen (Amaurornis phoenicurus), {{as well as by}} numerous giant Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus). All these animals are perfectly harmless.|$|R
50|$|P. utilis is dioecious, {{with the}} female and male {{reproducing}} structures occurring on different plants. Individual plants are either male producing microspores or female producing megaspores. This plant being unisexual allows it to cross-fertilize with other <b>screwpines.</b> The male plants produce fragrant colorful flowers in long spikes. These long spikes are with 8-12 stamens inserted pseudo-umbellately on slender columns 10 to 15 mm long. The female plants produce fruits resembling pineapples or oversized pine cones changing from green to yellow/orange when ripe. The female structure has a 3-8 celled ovary crowned by a sessile stigma.|$|R

50|$|Some {{trees in}} the heart of the forest grow to 10-11 m, but most are just 6-8 m high. The {{understory}} is largely absent here, formed only by scattered Celtis paniculata, Ficus opposita and Pipturus argenteus with a height of 2-4 m; some Celtis also grow higher and emerge through the Pisonia canopy. Patches of shrubs - mainly Abutilon albescens, with Melanthera biflora (probably var. canescens), and the introduced wild poinsettia (Euphorbia cyathophora) - are found here and there. Herbaceous plants are scarce here, mainly consisting of the grass Stenotaphrum micranthum. The more open forest is composed of much the same plants, but the Pisonia does not predominate as much. A few Pandanus tectorius <b>screwpines</b> are also found here, and the understory is far more prominent.|$|R
5000|$|Monocots have a {{distinctive}} arrangement of vascular tissue {{known as an}} atactostele in which the vascular tissue is scattered rather than arranged in concentric rings. Collenchyma is absent in monocot stems, roots and leaves. Many monocots are herbaceous {{and do not have}} the ability to increase the width of a stem (secondary growth) via the same kind of vascular cambium found in non-monocot woody plants. However, some monocots do have secondary growth, and because it does not arise from a single vascular cambium producing xylem inwards and phloem outwards, it is termed [...] "anomalous secondary growth". Examples of large monocots which either exhibit secondary growth, or can reach large sizes without it, are palms (Arecaceae), <b>screwpines</b> (Pandanaceae), bananas (Musaceae), Yucca, Aloe, Dracaena, and Cordyline.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} Laie begins long before first contact. The name Laie {{is said to}} derive from two Hawaiian words: lau meaning [...] "leaf", and ie {{referring}} to the ieie (red-spiked climbing <b>screwpine,</b> Freycinetia arborea), which wreaths forest trees of the uplands or mauka regions of the mountains of the Koʻolau Range behind the community of Laie. In Hawaiian mythology, this red-spiked climbing <b>screwpine</b> is sacred to Kane, god of the earth, god of life, and god of the forests, {{as well as to}} Laka, the patron goddess of the hula.|$|E

50|$|Collectors {{commonly}} {{cut down}} <b>screwpine</b> trees {{to reach the}} geckos living in the leaf crest, destroying the geckos habitat. Many geckos are thought to die while being shipped to market. The pet trade is likely a worse threat than habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|Pandanus elatus is a {{dioecious}} {{tropical plant}} in the <b>screwpine</b> genus. It is endemic to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the north-eastern Indian Ocean. Its specific epithet comes from the Latin elatus (tall), in reference to its growth habit.|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the word Panducot did not {{came from the}} Filipino word pandúkot (something you use to grab; dúkot, grab). Instead, the name came from the {{contraction}} of the words pandán (pandan, a variety of <b>screwpine</b> common in the Philippines and used in Filipino cuisine as flavouring) and dúkot. This {{is due to the}} fact that the barangay is mainly agricultural.|$|E

50|$|In the wild, {{turquoise}} {{day geckos}} live {{exclusively on the}} (redlisted endemic) <b>screwpine,</b> Pandanus rabaiensis, mostly in the leaf crown. They only live on large trees, those with leaves more than 1 m long. A single leaf crown will typically contain a single individual, or an adult male, and adult female, and juveniles. They eat small insects and drink water from leaves. They are also fond of nectar.|$|E
50|$|The wetland {{areas of}} Fuvahmulah are mostly {{made up of}} dense {{vegetation}} ranging from ferns to reeds to taro fields. There is an abundance of water spinach and plant varieties such as Syzygium cumini (jambul), pond-apple, mango, pineapple, <b>screwpine,</b> tropical almond, cheese fruit, ambarella, banana and many more. Fuvahmulah {{is also home to}} farmland where locals grow crops such as cucumber, tomato, carrot, cabbage, pepper, capsicum, eggplant and ladies' fingers.|$|E
50|$|The island {{specialized}} in producing a few varieties of short-term crops, including watermelon, scotch bonnet pepper, green chili, papaya, taro, and pumpkin. From {{the beginning of}} the 19th century, they were the largest producer of finger millets in the country, which helped them to stave off starvation during World War II. Finger millet (Binbi) and <b>screwpine</b> (Kashi-keyo) fruits were largely traded between Raa atoll people in exchange of goods or money.|$|E

''''''Krokdang a’mori'''''' - is a {{very unusual}} and {{distinct}} variant of the idioglot clarinet which is known as Krokdang a’mori as the tube is made of the leave of <b>Screwpine</b> (Pandanus), locally known as Krokdang. The long leaf, first shorn of the spines, is boiled and sun-dried to make it soft and flexible so that the leaf-tube (resonator), coiled around the mouthpiece, may be gradually enlarged and elongated to form a large rim for maximum sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} making putu mayam (also known as string hoppers in English) {{consists}} of mixing rice flour or idiyappam flour with water and/or coconut milk, and pressing the dough through a sieve to make vermicelli-like noodles.

The noodles are served with grated coconut and jaggery, or, preferably, gur (date palm sugar). In some areas, gula melaka (coconut palm sugar) is the favourite sweetener.|$|E
50|$|The rice {{cooked in}} coconut milk is {{actually}} common in Southeast Asia. This {{is the same}} process used to make similar rice dishes from their neighbouring country Indonesia, which are nasi uduk from Jakarta, nasi gurih from Aceh and Javanese nasi liwet. However, {{there are differences in}} taste because knotted leaves of Pandan <b>screwpine</b> are steamed with the rice to impart flavour and fragrance. Less often other spices such as ginger and occasionally herbs like lemon grass may be added for additional fragrance.|$|E
