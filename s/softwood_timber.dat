2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used <b>softwood</b> <b>timber</b> sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E

40|$|Heat {{treatment}} of wood {{is an effective}} method to improve the dimensional stability and durability against biodegradation. Optimisation of a two-stage heat treatment process at relatively mild conditions (< 200 °C) {{and its effect on}} the anatomical structure of softwoods were investigated by means of a light and scanning electron microscopic analysis. Heat treatment did {{have an effect on the}} anatomical structure of wood, although this depends on the wood species considered and on the process method and conditions used. Softwood species with narrow annual rings and/or an abrupt transition from earlywood into latewood were sensitive to tangential cracks in the latewood section. Radial cracks occurred mainly in impermeable wood species such as Norway spruce, caused by large stresses in the wood structure during treatment. Sapwood of treated pine species revealed some damage to parenchyma cells in the rays and epithelial cells around resin canals, whereas this phenomenon has not been noticed in the heartwood section. Treated radiata pine resulted in a very open and permeable wood structure limiting the applications of this species. Broken cell walls perpendicular to the fibre direction resulting in transverse ruptures have been noticed in treated softwood species. This contributes to abrupt fractures of treated wood as observed in bending tests which can lead to considerably different failure behavior after impact or mechanical stress. In some treated softwood species maceration (small cracks between tracheids) was noticed after heat treatment. Heat treatment did not cause damage to the ray parenchyma pit membranes, bordered pits and large window pit membranes; the margo fibrils appeared without damage.

One of the best options to increase the recycling rate of mixed PSW is to convert them into products suitable for construction. However, a comprehensive understanding on the mechanical behaviour of mixed PSW under different loading conditions is important for their widespread use as a construction material. This study focuses on investigating the mechanical behaviour of recycled mixed PSW containing HDPE, LDPE and PP using coupon and full-scale specimens.

40|$|Xylophagous borers and {{termites}} {{that damage}} "timber-in-service" cause {{millions of dollars}} loss annually throughout mainland Australia. I developed field-based feeding assays with practical relevance to preventative action and remedial treatment of infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment. Essential to this work is facilitating a high termite risk by maintaining an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites. Feeding assays conducted in low termite risk areas are unduly prolonged, with inherently erratic termite feeding responses. I successfully developed feeding assays with a high termite risk. To establish whether a physical barrier, retrofitted as a sleeve, could prevent termites from damaging wooden poles, eighty poles were established within Beerburrum State Forest, south-east Queensland, Australia. Poles within sets were interconnected with buried timber to facilitate a high risk to Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Mesh sleeves {{to a depth of}} 1. 5 m did not prevent termite damage to the poles. Hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D. Don dowels ("dip-sticks") were useful termite monitoring devices on the poles. The depth of foraging by termites has implications for the effectiveness of retrofitted physical and chemical barriers in general. Timber quantity and quality has a pivotal influence on the aggregation of large numbers of feeding termites necessary for baiting work and for producing efficacy data of relevance to the protection of timber-in-service from termites. Seasonal variation in termite foraging was examined. Both C. acinaciformis and Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) were more active feeding in summer than in autumn. In general, mass loss followed mean ambient temperature. Suppression of C. acinaciformis feeding responses relative to C. lacteus during summer, particularly during January, is thought to be due to excessive temperatures in the containers attached to infested trees. Termite foraging behaviour and responses to both varying masses of <b>softwood</b> <b>timbers</b> and varying exposure times were investigated. The rate of mass loss was independent of the number of test specimens and appeared linear. Colonies regulate the number of foragers directly according to the mass of susceptible timber available. This phenomenon was exploited throughout the remainder of the thesis. Of particular significance was the considerable intra- and inter-specific variation in susceptibility of softwoods to C. acinaciformis and Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt. The sapwoods tested were susceptible, but the heartwoods were generally resistant to damage by termites. These data confirm that termites are discriminating feeders, and some more so than others. A novel methodology, developed to maintain an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites during field-testing, is presented. Consistency in timber acceptance and susceptibility to termites is considered to be important in determining the frequency of inspection and the success of bait systems. I evaluate the termiticidal activity of the bait toxicants hexaflumuron and chlorfluazuron for the management of the subterranean termite C. acinaciformis in the field. The Sentricon Colony Elimination System with Baitube-devices containing 0. 1 % and 1 % mass/mass (m/m) hexaflumuron bait toxicant in dry wood flour (Recruit) was successful in eliminating field colonies of C. acinaciformis. Similarly, the Exterra Termite Interception and Baiting System with cellulose-acetate powder containing either 0. 05 % m/m or 0. 25 % m/m chlorfluazuron (Requiem) eliminated C. acinaciformis. Indicators (including "dip-sticks") used to monitor colony health were reliable. By using C. acinaciformis, which builds mounds (epigeous nests) in northern Australia, I was able to avoid the use of multiple mark-release schemes to verify the effects of the bait toxicant on the termite colonies. Problems with multiple mark-release schemes, used elsewhere in the world, are discussed. I continued the focus on bait quality and placement by evaluating termite responses to two aspects of treated stakes, their attractiveness and their susceptibility. Three experiments were undertaken near Townsville and at Beerburrum, with Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes. Whilst {{there were no significant differences}} in the rate of location and foraging, with respect to treatments, differences in foraging, with respect to C. acinaciformis and Schedorhinotermes seclusus (Hill) were significant. Coptotermes acinaciformis displayed greater foraging site tenacity than S. seclusus at Beerburrum. Increased consumption of bait, due to the addition of a phagostimulant, needs to be observed in the field before an increase in the efficacy of baits in a termite management program can be claimed. In Australia, <b>softwood</b> <b>timbers</b> are extensively used in building construction and are generally highly susceptible to damage by termites. I focussed on field feeding assays to test efficacy of borate-treated softwoods against termites and to define "adequate" protection thresholds. Laboratory and field data reported in the literature were confusing with regard to what constitutes "adequate" protection thresholds. The confusion was compounded by differences in termite species, timber species used and test methodology. Laboratory data indicated a borate loading of 0. 5 % m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE) would cause > 90 % termite mortality and restrict mass loss in test specimens to 5 %. Field data generally suggested that borate loadings in excess of 0. 5 % m/m BAE were required. The main contribution of the work to increasing our understanding of management options for termites in the built environment was in resolving the confusion between laboratory and field data for borate wood-preservatives. These apparently conflicting results were explained by the presence or absence of untreated feeder material in the test environment. In the absence of untreated feeder material, retention of 0. 5 % BAE provides adequate protection from Coptotermes sp., whereas in the presence of untreated feeder material, increased retentions are required. Furthermore, the retentions required increase with increased amounts of susceptible material. Some termites, Nasutitermes sp. and M. darwiniensis, for example, are borate-tolerant and borate wood-preservatives are not a viable management option. The lack of uniform standards for termite-test methodology and assessment criteria for efficacy across the world is recognized as a difficulty with research into the performance of wood preservatives with termites. The many variables in laboratory and field assays make "prescriptive" standards difficult to recommend. The use of "performance" standards to define efficacy criteria ("adequate" protection) is discussed. Whilst the majority of the work involves subterranean termites ("termites"), I examine the question of how to define a hardwood timber species as "not susceptible" to lyctine beetle damage. Aspects of the biology, behaviour and management of Lyctus brunneus (Stephens) are reviewed and a novel field sampling and testing protocol to establish lyctine susceptibility of timber species is presented. A sound understanding of the biology and behaviour of xylophagous insects in the field is essential to ensure that management options implemented in the built environment have a strong ecological basis. The success of this study in achieving stated aims, the need for further work and the implications for test methodologies in the field with practical relevance to infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment are discussed...|$|R

A research method of longitudinal study is adopted, concentrating on the monitoring and assessment of its structural performance and conditions in which it might deteriorate.

40|$|Timber groynes {{have been}} used for centuries to retain and control beaches. They are found {{throughout}} Europe but little information is available about the design or detailing of the structures. During recent years alternatives such as beach renourishment, detached breakwaters and rock groynes {{have been used}} increasingly, however timber groynes can still offer advantages in terms of sustainability, cost and appearance. These include the relative ease with which the level and profile of the groyne may be adapted (by adding or removing planks) or maintained. Their appearance and small footprint are particularly advantageous on amenity beaches. Beaches constantly change as they respond to natural processes including waves, currents and the wind. These processes can result in material being transported from the beach, which if not replaced by material from adjacent areas, will result in erosion. Groynes are constructed more or less perpendicular to the shoreline to restrict the movement of sediment along the shore. They usually work in two ways, by providing a physical barrier to the movement of the beach material, which enables the beach to re-orientate approximately perpendicular to the incident wave direction, and by diverting longshore currents (which may be caused by tides or waves) away from the beach. In the past, groyne design was often limited to the slightly improved replacement of existing structures. As most local authorities in the United Kingdom are responsible for their own coastal protection, groyne design differs largely along the coastline. The performance and durability of timber groynes is highly dependent on the design and detailing of the structure. By comparing several schemes, various advantages and disadvantages of groyne design have been identified. Keeping a structure and its connections as simple as possible will benefit the ease of construction and maintenance. Design details such as attaching <b>softwood</b> or recycled <b>timber</b> rubbing pieces to the piles at critical levels, thus protecting them from abrasion, can considerably increase the lifetime of a groyne. In order to assure the sustainable use of timber, certified timber should be specified. Additionally, reuse and recycling of timber can substantially reduce the need for new timber, and should be incorporated in the design and maintenance of structures.
