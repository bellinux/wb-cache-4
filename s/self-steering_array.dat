40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} decade of the 20 th century, the {{emerging}} ultrawide-band (UWB) impulse technology has found numerous applications in the commercial as well as the military sectors. The rapid technological advances have made it possible to implement (cost-effective, short-range) impulse radar and impulse-radio communication and localization systems. Array beamforming and space–time processing techniques promise further advancement in the operational capabilities of impulse radar and impulse-radio communications to achieve long-range coverage, high capacity, and interference-free quality of reception. In this paper, we introduce a realistic signal model for UWB impulse waveforms and develop the principles of space–time array processing based on the signal model. A space–time resolution function (STRF), a space-frequency distribution function (SFDF), and a monopulse-tracking signal are derived for impulse waveforms received by a <b>self-steering</b> <b>array</b> beamforming system. The directivity peak-power pattern and energy pattern of the beamformer are also derived. Computer plots of the STRF, SFDF, and the beam patterns are obtained too. The directivity beam patterns of impulse waveforms are sidelobe-free and, therefore, there is no need for sidelobe suppression via amplitude weighting of the array elements. Also, the resolution angle for the beam patterns is derived as a decreasing function of array size and frequency bandwidth. Electronic beamsteering based on slope processing of monopulse waveforms is described too.

The principle of operation {{and methods of}} characterization of these so-called retrodirective arrays is reviewed, and examples developed by our group are presented.

40|$|Multi-channel <b>self-steering</b> {{microphone}} <b>arrays</b> for {{hearing aid}} applications enable the hearing impaired user to follow conversations coming from other directions than the front direction. Binaural connections between {{left and right}} hearing aids allow for (i) the estimation of the direction of arrival (DOA) and thus for automatic beam-steering, (ii) a higher noise reduction due to {{a greater number of}} sensors, and (iii) the preservation or reconstruction of binaural cues that can be used by the hearing impaired listener for object segregation. Since the microphones are placed near the human head, diffraction and shadowing effects have to be incorporated into the beamformer design as well as into the DOA estimator. In this contribution a combined system of DOA estimation and a head-worn 6 -channel binaural noise reduction scheme is presented and evaluated using perceptual measures that are based on auditory models. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to provide novel {{solutions}} for robust radio communication for longer range microwave RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), systems {{through the use of}} retrodirective arrays (RDA). The retrodirective <b>Array</b> is a <b>self-steering</b> antenna <b>array</b> which automatically transmits a radio signal back in the direction of signal arrival without the requirement of complex signal processing. Analogue implementation of retrodirective arrays allows real time, multi functional and signal tracking operations at low physical complexity and power consumption. To date the majority of the research undertaken on retrodirective array technology, focuses heavily on passive implementation such as transponder and retroreflector for radar application. The work presented in this thesis places largely emphasis on the integration of active retrodirective array as a basestation technology in RFID situations, where high quality performance and multifunctional operations are required. The systems presented in this thesis exploit various features of retrodirective array such as automatic beam forming, multipath signal recombination and multiple beams forming. Theoretical analysis of retrodirective arrays and implementation techniques for various applications are discussed. By deploying different retrodirective array architecture such as Van Atta and phase conjugating at the RFID interrogator and transponder, the self-steering action of retrodirective anays is shown to relax antenna alignment requirements and lead through to range extension for RFID systems. The retrodirective signal recombination/focusing effect in multipath rich environments improves signal strength at the target position. Therefore, instead of transmitting a high EIRP line-of-sight signal to the interrogator, the same power density can occur by utilizing the presence of multipath.
