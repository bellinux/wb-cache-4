On {{the basis}} of the {{analysis}} of winding drive system’s technological requirements of multi-wire cutting system and the characteristics of torque motor, the article proposes a scheme of wrap wheel with torque motor control to overcome the deficiency of the general control motor driven wrap wheel. In determination process of winding system parameter, it provides the <b>selective</b> <b>calculation</b> methods and the control strategy of the torque motor. According to processing materials, we get tension values, and then calculate the output torque, and choose a suitable torque motor and determine the control strategy.

40|$|Die Modellierung des Produktsystems erfolgt bisher in Abhängigkeit von den Komponenten des gesamten Produktes in einer Baumstruktur. Eine unabhängige Modellierung von Sachbilanzmodulen für einzelne Komponenten ist aufgrund der dadurch ausgelösten Wechselwirkungen in der vernetzten Baumstruktur des Produktsystems nicht möglich. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Entwicklung einer Methodik für austauschbare Sachbilanzmodule auf Basis von Komponenten. Für Modifizierungen komplexer Produkte sollen die neuen Komponenten unabhängig von den bereits bestehenden Sachbilanzmodulen des Produktsystems modelliert werden. Die entwickelte Methodik beruht auf einer logischen Entkopplung der Baumstruktur des Produktsystems in Systemebenen entsprechend der Strukturhierarchie des Produktes (Produktmodell). Die Ableitung der Methodik für ein modifizierbares Produktsystem erfolgt über zwei Bedingungen. Die erste Bedingung für die Modellierung der Schnittstellen ist, dass die Sachbilanzergebnisse von Systemebene I, die alle Prozesse des Produktlebensweges integriert, identisch sind mit den Sachbilanzergebnissen der Baumstruktur. Die zweite Bedingung für die Modellierung der Schnittstellen ist die eindeutige Bestimmbarkeit der Mengenmultiplikatoren. Beide Bedingungen werden durch die entwickelte Methodik erfüllt. Die Komponenten eines Produktes bestimmen die möglichen Entsorgungswege. Durch Einführung des Systemzustandes wird untersucht, ob sich infolge der Substitution von Komponenten die Prozessketten der Entsorgung für bereits bestehende Sachbilanzmodule ändern. Mit dem Systemzustand wird die Kopplung der Bauteile und Baugruppen untereinander sowie die Materialarten dieser Komponenten analysiert. Die Produktstruktur von Produktvarianten wird zum einen mit Hilfe von Matrizen untersucht. Zum anderen wird die Menge der Materialarten für die Produktvarianten bestimmt. Die Untersuchung des Systemzustandes ermöglicht so den fehlerfreien Austausch von Sachbilanzmodulen des Produktsystems, die sich hinsichtlich der Prozessketten unterscheiden. Die entwickelte Methodik wird durch die Anwendung am Beispiel von Laugenpumpen von Waschmaschinen validiert. Das modifizierbare Produktsystem und der Systemzustand integrieren die Produkteigenschaften, die sich auf Änderungen der Masse von Bauteilen, Art verwendeter Materialien und der eingesetzten Verbindungselemente beziehen. Wenn ein bestehendes Produkt modifiziert wird, wird durch die in dieser Arbeit entwickelten Methodik das Minimum der Prozesse im vor- und nachkonsumtiven Bereich bestimmt, die für die jeweiligen Komponenten neu zu modellieren sind. Durch das Bestimmen der auszutauschenden Prozesse wird die Neumodellierung von zahlreichen Prozessen eingespart. Die Methodik liefert somit einen Beitrag zur erheblichen Zeitersparnis in der Modellentwicklung im Rahmen der Sachbilanz/ Ökobilanz. Bei Veränderungen in einem bestehenden Produkt erlaubt die Methodik, bereits in der Produktentwicklung gezielt den Einfluss einzelner Änderungen auf die potenziellen Umweltwirkungen zu berechnen, um so schnelle, objektive Entscheidungen zu treffen. Goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{development}} of a method for exchangeable life cycle inventory modules based on product components (hereafter: components). It should thus be possible to model changes in the characteristics of complex products independently from the already existing, modelled life cycle inventory modules. Typically, the product system is modelled in a tree structure in relation to characteristics of the entire product. Using this method, an independent modelling of life cycle inventory modules based on components is not possible due to the interdependent and interlaced tree structure of the products. The methodology developed in the framework of this thesis is based on a logical uncoupling of the tree structure of the product system in different levels. The system levels relate to the hierarchy of the product (product model). The derivation of the methodology takes place by complying with two conditions for the modelling of the interfaces of the life cycle inventory modules between the system levels. The first condition for the modelling of the interfaces is that the life cycle inventory results of the system level I – which integrates all processes of the life cycle – are identical with the life cycle inventory results of the tree structure. The second condition for the modelling of the interfaces is the unique determinability of the scaling factors. Both conditions are fulfilled by the developed methodology. The interdependencies between the components of a product, which determine the specific disposal processes, are analysed through the determination of the system state of the product. The state of the system determines the coupling of the components and assemblies to each other as well as the materials types of these coupled components. This takes place on one hand via a matrix representation, which provides an overview {{of the structure of the}} original as well as the enhanced product. On the other hand, the quantity of the material types is determined for the product alternatives. The system state analysis allows for the exchange of process chains (a group of interlinked processes) from the product system that differ in their material type. Since the components of a product affect each other regarding their disposal processes, the state of the system determines whether the insertion of a modified life cycle inventory module affects the disposal process chains for an already existing life cycle inventory module. The developed methodology is validated considering its implementation on the example of lye pumps of washing machines. The modifiable product system and the system state integrate the product properties, which refer to changes of the component mass, the materials used, and the types of joinings used. The methodology for exchangeable life cycle inventory modules developed in this thesis determines the minimum of processes that must be remodelled for the respective components. The methodology can therefore provide a substantial time saving in the model development in the framework of the life cycle inventory/ Life Cycle Assessment. This methodology allows decisions to be made during product development based on the <b>selective</b> <b>calculation</b> of the influence of individual changes of the product system...|$|E

40|$|The Mott {{transition}} in a multi-orbital Hubbard model involving subbands of different widths is studied within the dynamical mean field theory. Using the iterated perturbation theory for the quantum impurity problem it is shown that at low temperatures inter-orbital Coulomb interactions {{give rise to}} a single first-order transition rather than a sequence of orbital <b>selective</b> transitions. Impurity <b>calculations</b> based on the Quantum Monte Carlo method confirm this qualitative behavior. Nevertheless, at finite temperatures, the degree of metallic or insulating behavior of the subbands differs greatly. Thus, on the metallic side of the transition, the narrow band can exhibit quasi-insulating features, whereas on the insulating side the wide band exhibits pronounced bad-metal behavior. This complexity might partly explain contradictory results between several previous works. Comment: 8 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper investigates whether boys receive {{preferential}} prenatal {{treatment in}} a setting where son preference is present. Using micro health data from India, we highlight sex-selective prena-tal investments as a new channel via which parents can practice discriminatory behavior. We find that mothers visit antenatal clinics and receive tetanus shots more frequently when pregnant with a boy. Pref-erential prenatal treatment of males is greater in regions known to have strong son preference and among women whose previous children are female. We successfully rule out other mechanisms such as selective recall, medical complications that might cause male babies to receive greater prenatal care in general, son preference-based fertility stopping rules and reverse causality due to sex <b>selective</b> abortions. Our <b>calculations</b> suggest that sex-selective prenatal care in tetanus use explains between 4 - 10. 5 % of excess female neonatal mortality in India. We find similar results using data from other countries like China, Bangladesh and Pakistan; thus, we show the extent of sex selective prenatal care in large parts of Sout...|$|R

Method: We investigated numeracy skills in 76 participants— 40 healthy controls and 36 patients with neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer dementia, frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, progressive aphasia) and with focal brain lesions affecting parietal, frontal, and temporal areas as in herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). All patients were tested with the same comprehensive battery of paper-and-pencil and computerized tasks assessing numerical abilities and calculation. Degenerative and HSE patients also performed nonnumerical semantic tasks.

The preparation of mono- and bidentate PYE ligands was achieved from reactions between pyridinium salts and primary amines {{in the presence of a}} base. A variety of PYE ligands including chiral and bulky examples were fully characterised by a number of techniques, including single crystal X-ray diffraction. 	A range of transition metal precursors were tested with PYE ligands and the resulting metal complexes including Rh(I), Pd(II), Ni(II) and Ru(II) were characterised by methods including single-crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy to examine metal-ligand bonding and ligand dynamics. Data comparison of the solid-state structures, NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations with respect to neutral ligands, protonated salts and metal complexes indicates that charge redistribution occurs within the PYE heterocyclic ring to give a contribution from a pyridinium-amido-type resonance structure.

40|$|Tattoo removal {{has long}} been a vexing problem. Although many methods have been involved, most of them are {{destructive}} and frequently cause scarring. However Q-switched ruby lasers have been successfully used to remove blue and black tattoos without the usual risks of textural change or scarring (Reid et al 1983). The major difference between this method and the others is that radiation from this laser induces preferential injury to cells containing tattoo pigment only. A major disadvantage of this method is the very high cost of the equipment, and in additional the red tattoos do not respond to red ruby light. This thesis investigates using a high power density xenon flashlamp for the removal of tattoos. The proposed method is based on the same principle as the Q-switched ruby laser, but has potential to remove various coloured tattoos, and to cost rather less than one tenth of the cost of a Q-switched ruby laser. In this thesis the spectral match between absorption of tattoo dyes and radiation of xenon flashlamp has been analysed. I suggest suitable treatment parameters for removal of tattoo using <b>selective</b> photothermolysis after <b>calculation</b> base on some histological studies. The theory of the xenon flashlamp system was analysed in order to design a flashlamp system, and some experimental trials on different pulse durations and brightness were carried out.

The overall findings given by our preliminary experiments confirm that a xenon flashlamp with an appropriate energy density and pulse duration can selectively induce responses in a tattooed area by the mechanism of selective photothermolysis.
