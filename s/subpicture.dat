In order to allow unequal protection of a video bit-stream, codewords have to be categorized according to their importance to visual quality. The proposed <b>subpicture</b> coding method allows partitioning images to regions of interest and helps to maintain a good image quality in the chosen regions. As an example, the <b>subpicture</b> coding scheme is applied to multicast Internet streaming.

Even if large images {{are taken into account}} (2, 000 × 1, 200 pixels), the size of the subimages (250 × 150) is too small. On the other hand, to obtain correct results, pixel dependencies have to be considered for smoothing on all three coordinates and also when calculating the derivatives. Solving these dependencies requires introducing additional pixels, usually known as border pixels. If many <b>subpictures</b> are used, the number of border pixels (ghost or halo pixels) increases and the overhead costs of this algorithm would become unacceptable.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{solution}} based on networks of picture processors {{to the problem}} of picture pattern matching. The network solving the problem can be informally described as follows: it consists of two subnetworks, one of them extracts simultaneously all <b>subpictures</b> of the same size from the input picture and sends them to the second subnetwork. The second subnetwork checks whether any of the received pictures is identical to the pattern. We present an efficient solution based on networks with evolutionary processors only, for patterns with at most three rows or columns. Afterwards, we present a solution based on networks containing both evolutionary and hiding processors running in O(n+m+kl+k) computational (processing and communication) steps, where the input picture and the pattern are of size (n,m) and (k,l), respectively...|$|R

We also define local, locally testable, and locally threshold testable picture languages and summarize known inclusion results for these classes. The classes of piecewise testable, locally testable, and locally threshold testable picture languages can, as in the word case, be characterized by certain (fragments of) first-order logics. 1 Introduction In [GRST 96,GR 96], the authors investigated the class of recognizable picture language (as a straightforward generalization of recognizable word languages to two dimensions), and compared it to variants of classes of regular picture languages, defined by "regular express [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Conditional {{replenishment}} is an interframe {{video compression}} method that uses correlation {{in time to}} reduce video transmission rates. This method works by detecting and sending only the changing portions of the image and by having the receiver use the video data from the previous frame for the non-changing portion. The amount of compression {{that can be achieved}} through this technique depends to a large extent on the rate of change within the image, and can vary from 10 to 1 to less than 2 to 1. An additional 3 to 1 reduction in rate is obtained by the intraframe coding of data blocks using a 2 -dimensional variable rate Hadamard transform coder. A further additional 2 to 1 rate reduction is achieved by using motion prediction. Motion prediction works by measuring the relative displacements of a <b>subpicture</b> from one frame to the next. The <b>subpicture</b> can then be transmitted by sending only the value of the 2 -dimensional displacement. Computer simulations have demonstrated that data rates of 2 to 4 Mega-bits/second can be achieved while still retaining good fidelity in the image...|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-tape-based digital video recorders also known as personal video recorders (PVR), consumers can expect alternative navigation methods to the well-known trick-play modes found on analog and digital tape-based systems. In this paper, we explore the system requirements and aspects of a visual table of contents (VTOC). A primary advantage of implementing a VTOC search mode is that it provides a much higher visual performance at high search speeds (50 times or higher) than the conventional search techniques. We present a solution for generating a video signal for visual search {{that is based on}} reusing MPEG- 2 compressed video data. The video search signal is composed of a set of MPEG- 2 compressed <b>subpictures,</b> resulting in a mosaic screen. An efficient strategy is introduced, that allows either full or partial reuse of the compressed sub-pictures via motion compensation of earlier reference sub-pictures to allow the generation of a new mosaic screen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} tiling with dominoes pictures of the plane, in theoretical and algorithmic aspects. For generalities and other tiling problems, see for example Refs. Beauquier et al. (1995), Conway and Lagarias (1990), Kannan and Soroker (1992), Kenyon (1992), and Beauquier (1991). The pictures which are considered here may have holes, but uniquely balanced holes, that is every hole, if chessboard-like coloured, has {{an equal number of}} black squares and of white ones. We give an algorithmic characterization of tilable pictures and a canonical decomposition into ‘strongly’ tilable <b>subpictures.</b> The given algorithm is linear as far the considered pictures have a finite number of (balanced) holes. In the same hypothesis there is a good parallel algorithm (in class NC). Graphical extension of the used method (heights' method) is applied to a class of bipartite planar graphs. The particular case of without holes pictures is developed in Fournier (1996). As far as I know, the results in this paper are new, except the notions and the theorem in Section 2, which are substantially present in Thurston (1990) ...|$|R

The set of pictures associated with the words in a regular (context-free) string language is called a regular (context-free) picture language or chain code picture language. In this paper we discuss the decidability status of the following problems for regular and context-free picture languages: &#x 02022;Is some picture a <b>subpicture</b> of all pictures of the language?&#x 02022;Does the language contain a picture with a given property?&#x 02022;Have all pictures of the language a given property...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} {{two-dimensional}} languages as a generalization of formal string languages {{was motivated by}} problems arising from image processing and pattern recognition and also concerns models of parallel computing. Here we investigate power series on pictures and assign weights to different devices, ranging from tiling systems to picture automata. We will prove that, for commutative semirings, the behaviours of weighted picture automata are precisely alphabetic projections of series {{defined in terms of}} rational operations and also coincide with the families of series characterized by weighted tiling or weighted domino systems. Thus we obtain a robust definition of recognizable picture series. The theory of two-dimensional languages is obtained when restricting to the boolean semiring. These new equivalent weighted picture devices can be used to model several interesting application-examples, e. g. the intensity of light of a picture (interpreting the alphabet as different levels of gray) or the maximal amplitude of a monochrome <b>subpicture</b> of a colored picture. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} an objective means for assessing local characteristics of television subpictures in a Hadamard transform multicoder scheme is stated and discussed. Detailed investigations of transform domain coefficient statistical characteristics for different test images have been conducted. Both monochrome and colour signals were used, {{as well as}} different transform sizes and shapes. " Directing Indexes " are proposed which, depending on the inter-relationships among transform coefficients and groups of coefficients, direct each <b>subpicture</b> to the appropriate coder. Three indexes {{in the case of}} monochrome signals are proposed, each with its own computational procedures and application requirements. Necessary modifications and changes for application of some indexes on colour signals are also discussed. The proposed technique of indexing eliminates the necessity of equal distribution of subpictures among 'activity classes', a major disadvantage encountered in present activity index. Coders to be used with each directing index are devised and tested, subject to an arbitrary bit rate of 2 bits per pixel, with satisfactory performance compared with some published results for other techniques...|$|E
