Bristol's bus <b>service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticised as unreliable and expensive, and in 2005 FirstGroup was fined for delays and safety violations.|$|E

5|$|Several long-standing {{services}} from Victoria ended during the British Rail era. The Brighton Belle's final service was on 30 April 1972, {{followed by the}} last Golden Arrow on 30 September. The Night Ferry lasted until 31 October 1980, though the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, a luxury Pullman <b>service,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> running intermittently since 1982.|$|E
5|$|Many {{artefacts}} {{are displayed}} at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa-chō. This is a successor to a local museum funded by the town of Suō-Ōshima which opened in July 1970. To {{make room for a}} new road, this museum was moved in April 1994 to a new building. Since 1963, a memorial <b>service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> held here every year on 8 June in honour of the crew. A very large portion of the bow was located at Suo-Oshima until at least 2012, but it may have been moved or lost.|$|E

5|$|Restoring {{the stream}} {{has made the}} area, a two-hour drive from Phoenix, highly popular. As {{recreational}} use of Fossil Creek increased after 2008, accumulations of trash and human waste as well as damage to forests and stream banks became problematic. The Forest Service at times closes parts of Forest Road 708 (Fossil Creek Road) to limit danger from traffic jams. Campfires are prohibited between the Fossil Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake, and other restrictions apply. Since 2009, the Forest <b>Service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> working on a comprehensive management plan for Fossil Creek.|$|E

Cloud {{storage is}} {{available}} to save music, films, games and saved content, and developers are able to use Live servers (along with the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform) to offer dynamic in-game content and other functionality. Users can have up to 1,000 friends. The December 2016 software update added the new social networking feature Clubs, which allows users to join groups focused on specific interests or games, and Looking for group (LFG), a system to help users locate players to join their party for multiplayer play.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern day}} {{territorial}} government has matured in Yellowknife {{to become effective}} and responsible. The government in Yellowknife had largely gained back its powers on par with the pre-1905 government that was dissolved during creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The civil <b>service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> effectively consolidated into the city of Yellowknife; and has gained control over administering its own elections from Elections Canada. Education is now {{under the jurisdiction of}} the territorial government and the territory has most powers afforded to the rest of the provinces. There has even talk by the Federal government of the territories gaining provincial status in the future.|$|E

5|$|The {{service was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it proved more popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was too expensive to operate. The <b>service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. Around 1,900 to 2,100 riders use the service every weekday depending on the season.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the RAAF has {{implemented}} several {{measures to}} keep the Hornets in service. These include a structural refurbishment program, increased monitoring of fatigue-related issues as well as repainting the aircraft and frequently washing them to reduce the risks posed by corrosion. In 2015 the Defence Science and Technology Group conducted new statistical analysis of the Hornets' structural condition which found that the airframes were less fatigued than previously believed, and so able to remain in service {{for a longer period}} than planned if necessary. This finding was accepted by the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness – Australian Defence Force. As of September 2017, none of the RAAF Hornets were subject to flying restrictions due to airframe fatigue. However, the cost of maintaining the ageing aircraft in <b>service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> increasing.|$|E

5|$|The American {{black duck}} is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife <b>Service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|There are two express {{tracks on}} the {{northern}} part of the route and one on the southern, with express stations distributed along the line. However, express service has only operated once on the line from 1968 to 1987. Restoration of express <b>service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> thwarted by budget shortages, passenger opposition, and a serious signal fire at Bergen Street in 1999. The issue came to a head in June 2007, when a petition for express service reached 2,600 signatures and gained media attention. The Culver Line underwent repairs from 2009 until early 2013, during which the express tracks were replaced and rehabilitated which may facilitate future express service.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the last}} century {{military}} <b>service</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars {{during the second half of}} the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity.|$|E
