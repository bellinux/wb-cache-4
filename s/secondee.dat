60|$|When the 'Queen of Shades' arose, and {{it became}} {{too dark to see}} the world, we halted at the Sensyéré village, and found good sleeping-quarters in the guest-house of the headman, Bato. Fortunately we had brought mattresses. The {{standing}} four-poster of the country offers only cross-planks covered with the thinnest matting. As the ancient joke of many a lugubrious African traveller says, it combines bed and board. Next morning, despite the chilly damp and the 'old-woman-cannot-see,' as the Scotch mist is here called, our men were ready within reasonable limits. After two hours' hammock we found ourselves at Atábo, capital of eastern Apollonia, about to pay our promised return-visit to good King Blay. It is useless to describe the settlement, which in no way differs from those passed on the path. The country-people related its origin as follows:--A Fanti man from the country between <b>Secondee</b> (Sekondi), or Fort Orange, and Shamah (Chamah), {{at the mouth of the}} Bosom Prah, when driven out by war, first founded 'Kabeku,' near the present place of that name. His sons built Béin, or Behin, [Footnote: The aspirate is hardly audible. Captain Brackenbury, generally so careful, manages to confound Béin and Benin.] meaning a 'strong man,' and Atábo, in Fanti atába, the name of a tree with a reddish-yellow fruit. The latter was paramount till late years, when turbulent and unruly Béin was allowed to set up for herself an independent king; and the sooner things return to the status quo ante the better for peace.|$|E

40|$|Attrition from {{traditional}} pre-registration nursing programmes in the United Kingdom {{continues to be}} substantial and, once qualified, new staff nurses experience a number of challenges in adapting to their new role. A possible solution, strongly favoured by the current government, is to second existing healthcare assistants onto pre-registration programmes. The premise is that, because of their previous caring experience and exposure {{to work in the}} National Health Service, <b>secondees</b> will be more committed to complete training and will undergo role transition more effectively. This paper presents an in-depth, qualitative study concerning the role transition of newly qualified staff nurses who had previously been employed as healthcare assistants. Uptake of the scheme had been substantially lower than anticipated, with {{only a small number of}} <b>secondees</b> eventually returning to their original wards. <b>Secondees,</b> their ward managers, percerptors and clinical practice facilitators were interviewed and the data were analysed employing the sequence for qualitative data analysis described by Miles and Huberman (1994). Findings suggest that healthcare-assistant secondment may not offer a ready solution to increasing the qualified nursing workforce. Contributory factors include: the length of time required for each newly qualified practitioner to qualify via the secondment route; the degree of commitment required on the part of <b>secondees</b> and university staff; the apparently limited benefits of previous healthcare-assistant experience; and personal costs to the <b>secondees.</b> <b>Secondees</b> described how they had been afraid of not completing the course successfully because of the public nature of failure if they were obliged to return to their original workplaces in the same role as before. This additional pressure has not been anticipated by proponents of secondment schemes and may help to explain why so few eligible candidates applied for secondment...|$|R
40|$|Background - Experiential {{approaches}} to skills development using secondment models are shown to benefit healthcare organisations more generally, but {{little is known}} about the potential of this approach to develop capacity for knowledge translation (KT). Aim - To evaluate the success of KT capacity development secondments from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. Methods - A pluralistic evaluation design was used. Data were collected during 2011 - 12 using focus group and individual interviews with 14 clinical and academic <b>secondees,</b> and five managers from host and seconding organisations to gain insight into participants’ perceptions of the success of secondments and the criteria by which they judged success. Six After Action Reviews were undertaken with KT project teams to explore participants’ perceptions of the contribution <b>secondees</b> made to KT projects. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with three healthcare managers on completion of projects to explore the impact of secondments on the organisation, staff and patients. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify criteria for success. The criteria provided a framework through which the overall success of secondments could be judged. Results - Six criteria for judging the success of the secondments at individual, team and organisation level were identified: KT skills development, effective workload management, team working, achieving KT objectives, enhanced care delivery, enhanced education delivery. Benefits to the individual, KT team, seconding and host organisations were identified. Implications for practice - Hosting teams should provide mentorship support to <b>secondees,</b> and be flexible to accommodate secondees’ needs as team members. On-going support of managers from seconding organisations is needed to maximise the benefits to individual <b>secondees</b> and the organisation. Conclusions - Experiential {{approaches to}} KT capacity development using secondments can benefit individual <b>secondees,</b> project teams, seconding and host organisations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Does the European Commission (Commission) {{manage to}} {{transform}} and re-direct the roles played by Commission civil servants? To test the old neo-functionalist claim on loyalty transfer among civil servants, {{this article provides}} fresh survey and interview data on seconded national experts in the Commission. The transformative powers of the Commission are tested by assessing {{the extent to which}} seconded national experts adopt supranational role perceptions. Theoretically, the emergence of supranational role perceptions is accounted for by considering (i) processes of pre-socialisation outside the Commission, (ii) processes of resocialisation inside the Commission, and (iii) organisational incompatibility between the Commission and domestic ministries and agencies from which the <b>secondees</b> originate. The empirical analysis shows that <b>secondees</b> evoke multiple loyalties, notably towards own profession, own DG and Unit and towards the EU and the Commission as wholes. Crucially, the data reported demonstrate that the Commission indeed instils supranational role perceptions into <b>secondees.</b> This observation reflects processes of re-socialisation inside the Commission, the organisational composition of the Commission as well as organizational incompatibilities between the Commission and domestic ministries and agencies. The data does not report robust evidence of pre-socialisation outside the Commission. Hence, the Commission is indeed a ‘hothouse for supranationalism’...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} account of an attempt by an {{educational}} developer to support and strengthen an emergent community of practice (CoP) (Wenger 1998 a). This community consists of members of staff associated in different capacities with the Centre for Interprofessional e-Learning (CIPeL), a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), based at Coventry University and Sheffield Hallam University. The support is specifically targeting CIPeL <b>Secondees</b> who are recruited to CIPeL on a part-time basis, {{for the purpose of}} creating interprofessional Learning Objects (LOs). While <b>secondees</b> receive individual support, there is little formal contact between <b>secondees.</b> An online CIPeL Community site was created, in order to provide a space where CIPeL members could meet virtually and share problems and experiences relating to the construction of LOs. Initially, the key question appeared to be how online participation by members of the community could be encouraged. Using Wenger's (1998 a) CoP theory of learning, and after exploring how the Community site was being used, the focus of attention shifts to an exploration of reified objects and the role they play in guiding practice, which in this case relates to the creation and use of interprofessional LOs. This in turn leads to the difficult question of how relevant reified objects may be identified and built, and it is advocated that existing CIPeL LOs should be exploited as reified objects for the purpose of guiding the construction of new LOs. It is felt that invoking constructs from Wenger's (1998 a) CoP theory of learning has resulted in a more detailed picture {{of the nature of the}} challenges involved in moving from an emergent CoP to more established practice. The approach has simultaneously helped clarify how support for an emergent CoP might be more effectively focused. As a final point, it is suggested that it may be fruitful to explore parallels between CIPeL as an emergent CoP and interprofessional practice (IPP) itself, based on the view that IPP is also an emergent practice...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally in the United Kingdom, {{reliance}} {{has been}} placed on unqualified support workers, such as student nurses, to deliver a high proportion of patient care. However, the move of nurse education into higher education and the accompanying supernumerary status of student nurses in the 1980 s resulted in a shortfall of staff to deliver that care. The government has made a number of suggestions for increasing recruitment. One possible solution regarded as very promising is to encourage health care assistants (HCAs) with at least 12 months' experience in the National Health Service to enrol on existing pre-registration programmes, providing them with financial incentives to do so. Very little literature directly concerned with training opportunities for HCAs could be traced, but it was evident that financial constraints and family commitments had, in the past, operated as disincentives to training, although some HCAs would otherwise be keen to register. In 1999 one of the workforce development confederations in London responded to government policy by seconding HCAs onto a pre-registration programme operated by the local university. Plans for evaluation were made at the outset. Interviews were conducted with two consecutive intakes of <b>secondees</b> at three time intervals: after three months; after 12 months and during the final placement of the 36 -month course. Interviews with other stakeholders were conducted just before the course ended. A qualitative approach was taken and the data were analysed employing the sequence recommended by Miles and Huberman (1994). Evaluation highlighted important features of the secondment process contributing to its success and indicated pitfalls attached to introducing such schemes. It is recommended that evaluation should be extended to explore how the new staff nurses prepared by this novel scheme continue to develop their career trajectories. Given the emphasis now being placed on the 'skills escalator' model of staff development in the NHS, such approaches will assume even greater importance in future, and more extensive evaluations will be needed...|$|R
