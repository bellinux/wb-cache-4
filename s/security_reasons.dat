5|$|For <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> filming and {{photography}} {{were not allowed}} near or inside the United States Bullion Depository. All sets for the interiors of the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios. The filmmakers had no {{clue as to what}} the interior of the depository looked like, so Ken Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rounds}} before the final, the venue of each match is {{determined}} when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is named {{the home team}} and chooses the venue for the match, usually its own home ground. The venue may be switched {{to that of the}} away team or changed to a neutral venue for <b>security</b> <b>reasons</b> such as being unable to host a club with a large travelling fan base or the venue being unavailable.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b> However, {{the troops were}} not briefed on the {{operation}} until {{a few hours before}} it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete.|$|E

5|$|The {{nuclear waste}} was {{planned to be}} shipped to the site by rail and/or truck in robust {{containers}} known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada would have been public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport would have been secret for <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b> State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel entered their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, Roane-Anderson was {{divesting}} {{itself of}} many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and Southern Bell the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E

5|$|For <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> GCHQ {{moved its}} own {{computers}} and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut, which caused {{the cost of}} its move to increase from £41m to £450m over two years. The moves of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost {{more than three times}} their original estimates due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid £216m toward a newly agreed budget of £308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, by 1795, {{the army}} had already made itself odious, by both rumor and action, {{throughout}} France through its dependence upon the countryside of material support and its general lawlessness and undisciplined behavior. After April 1796, the military was paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, a campaign that would take the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both budgetary and internal <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E

5|$|In early 2013, a Mexican drug {{trafficking}} organization issued fliers offering a reward of $600,000 pesos (US$46,000) for anyone {{that could give}} out information to locate the administrator of Valor por Tamaulipas or any of his family members. The administrator, however, openly defied the criminal organization's threat through Facebook. His wife and children reportedly fled to the United States after the threats for <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> but the citizen journalist stated on the Facebook page that {{he had decided to}} stay in Mexico and continue updating at Valor por Tamaulipas. In December 2014, however, the administrator announced his retirement from social media.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had time to prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians to leave the city, during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b> The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8807, {{creating}} the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as its director personally responsible to the president. The new organisation subsumed the NDRC, now chaired by James B. Conant. The Uranium Committee became the Uranium Section of the OSRD, which was soon renamed the S-1 Section for <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b> To the S-1 Section, Bush added Samuel K. Allison, Breit, Edward U. Condon, Lloyd P. Smith and Henry D. Smyth; Gunn was dropped {{in line with}} an NDRC policy not to have Army or Navy personnel in the sections. Briggs remained the chairman, with Pegram as the vice chairman.|$|E
50|$|The Indian Mountaineering Foundation {{describes}} trekking peaks {{closer to}} the true definition of trekking, where peaks have a defined route that requires less technical mountaineering skill. There peaks are open for climbing, where climbers {{are not required to}} book permits with or pay royalties to the Indian Mountaineering Foundation. Although some peaks are located in inner line, meaning close to border thus due to <b>security</b> <b>reason,</b> permissions and permits may be required from local civil or army authorities. Also, some peaks may be out of reach from foreign climbers.|$|R

50|$|The {{priority}} of the mission was that the displacements were carried out with maximum <b>security,</b> <b>reason</b> why it became necessary to coordinate the operation with the American forces. The {{first phase of the}} withdrawal materialized on April, 26. The last 150 Spanish soldiers from Al Andalus Base in Najaf headed to Spain Base in Diwaniyah, US soldiers occupying positions at the base of Najaf to avoid occupation by militias of the Imam Muqtada al-Sadr Muqtada al Sader. The last 260 Spanish soldiers of the II Plus Ultra Brigade arrived in Kuwait on the afternoon of April 27th, thus completing the exit from Iraq of all units.|$|R
5|$|The {{relief of}} the {{garrison}} and replacement with fresh troops were finally agreed. The first stage saw the 1st Polish Carpathian Brigade replace the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade. Next came the 6th Infantry Division's 16th Infantry Brigade, during late September, with {{elements of the}} 32nd Army Tank Brigade, {{in lieu of the}} 24th Australian Infantry Brigade. On 10October, for <b>security</b> <b>reasons</b> and in an attempt to confuse Axis intelligence as to when the division was fully redeployed, the 6th Infantry Division was renamed the 70th Infantry Division. Major-General Ronald Scobie was given command.|$|E
5|$|When Boyle {{returned}} {{to work on the}} ceremony in the spring of 2011 he asked Rick Smith of Underworld, with whom he had worked on several film projects as well as his theatrical production of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, to be the musical director. At the same time the team moved to the Three Mills studio complex in east London, where a 4x4 metre scale model of the stadium was built. For <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> a single CGI-assisted version of the ceremony was kept on editor Sascha Dhillon's laptop; anyone needing it had to come to the studio.|$|E
5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b> Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} break-in, Nixon's team (chiefly Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean) asked Helms in effect to assert a phony {{national}} <b>security</b> <b>reason</b> for the break-in and, under that rationale, {{to interfere with}} the ongoing FBI investigation of the Watergate burglaries. Such a course would also involve the CIA in posting bail for the arrested suspects. Initially Helms made some superficial accommodation that stalled for several weeks the FBI's progress. At several meetings attended by Helms and Walters, Nixon's team referred to the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco, using it as if a talisman of dark secrets, as an implied threat against the integrity of CIA. Immediately, sharply, Helms turned aside this gambit.|$|R
40|$|In {{alternative}} disentanglement based quantum cryptosystem, classical channel {{cannot be}} used when the system is protected by no-cloning principle. But for the similar security criterion, it is discussed that classical channel {{can be used in}} alternative entanglement based quantum cryptosystem.

We conclude that entanglement based cryptosystem is superior to disentanglement based system. 1 Apart from <b>security</b> <b>reason,</b> study on quantum cryptography [1 - 3] is always important.

40|$|Incentive {{mechanism}} {{tells how}} to encourage nodes in a peer-to-peer system to contribute their resources. A peer avoids contributing {{resources to the}} p 2 p system because of the factors like: cost of bandwidth, <b>security</b> <b>reason</b> as it has to open several ports {{in order to allow}} others to take out its resources and slowing down of self downloading process.
