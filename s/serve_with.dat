5|$|Rotheram {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a difficult officer to <b>serve</b> <b>with,</b> and he rapidly alienated his fellow officers and the sailors who served under him. Ultimately this character trait resulted in his removal from service and overlooking for promotion in 1808 after being court martialled for inappropriate behaviour towards junior officers. The rest of his life was spent requesting the Admiralty, often in an aggressive manner, for both further service and the rewards he felt were his due.|$|E

The story is nothing. He that looks into the book only for incident, will probably lay it down with disgust. But the feelings are of the truest and most exquisite class; every circumstance is adorned with that species of imagination, which enlists itself under the banners of delicacy and sentiment.|$|E

This dominance is nothing new, as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African-Americans <b>serve,</b> <b>with</b> women averaging around 30% of the seats and African-Americans around 20%.|$|E

Bennett carried the picture in his jacket pocket while serving overseas and it later saved his life on the Western Front, deflecting a German bullet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the Crimean War with the Russian Empire, which left a {{domestic}} security void in its provinces due to {{the large number of}} provincial troops deployed to Crimea. To restore security in the Galilee, Aqil was reassigned to his powerful post in the region in 1855. On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders to <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> the Ottoman Army in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from Karak.|$|E

5|$|Blakeley was {{launched}} 19 September 1918 by William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company in Philadelphia and {{sponsored by the}} wife of Charles Adams Blakeley. The ship was commissioned 8 May 1919, {{under the command of}} Commander W. Brown, Jr.. She immediately joined the Atlantic Fleet. Blakely patrolled along the East Coast of the United States until she was decommissioned on 29 June 1922, and returned to Philadelphia. She was recommissioned from 1932 to 1937 to <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> the Scouting Fleet, and then was again decommissioned in Philadelphia. Low military budgets were the cause of these periods of inactivity, as the Navy did not have the funds or manpower to maintain a number of ships, including Blakeley.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued to <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> passenger airlines for over 30 {{years after the}} crash of Flight 191. In the end, it was newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E

5|$|Fatally, the Aulic Council {{decided to}} make Northern Italy the main theater of {{operations}} for the Habsburgs. Archduke Charles was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the Adige River with Mantua, Peschiera, and Milan as the initial objectives. The Austrians based an army of 72,000 men on Ulm. Nominally commanded by Archduke Ferdinand, the army's real authority was Mack. Austrian strategy required that Archduke John with 23,000 troops secure the Tyrol and provide the link between his brother Charles's army and his cousin Ferdinand's army. The Austrians also detached individual corps to <b>serve</b> <b>with</b> the Swedish in Pomerania and the British in Naples, though these were designed to confuse the French and divert their resources.|$|E
