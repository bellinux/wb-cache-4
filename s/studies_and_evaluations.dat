[...] FUSRAP was established in 1974 to clean up radioactive wastes resulting from early nuclear activity of the US Atomic Energy Commission. FUSRAP uses independent government scientists to conduct site <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations.</b> After thorough evaluations are conducted, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) determines how to manage the radioactive waste. Fiscally responsible parties are not able to legally challenge this decision. FUSRAP currently controls two on-going remediation projects within the greater St. Louis metropolitan area, the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS) and the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), both of which contain the same composition of radioactive waste as the West Lake Landfill.|$|E

40|$|We analyse {{the reply}} by Suárez et al. (2003) to our {{previous}} paper (Martínez et al., 2003), concluding that both {{reached the same}} general conclusion. The low quality of <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> of environmental impact assessment on birds is mostly {{due to a lack}} of interest and political will for using the information available and for detecting and solving relevant gaps in our knowledge. For this reason, the regulation of the Environmental Impact Assessment of projects is not applied efficiently in Spain. We also conclude that the disagreements between both papers refer mostly to details on (1) the relevance of gaps in basic information, (2) methods for using such information and (3) proposals to improve the quality of <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations.</b> There are gaps in basic information, but a proper use of available sources which are seldom used would improve significantly <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> in the short term. Such sources are scientific papers on the biology of bird species and reports on the results of monitoring programs of the efficiency of correction measures of previous impacts. Increasing the scientific skills of technicians would improve the efficient use of these sources of information. Finally, the development of a variety of methods for the control of the quality of <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations,</b> as well as of some regulations seldom used such as Territory Planning and Strategic Environmental Assessment, would further contribute to solve its general low quality.

I also specify limitations in ASPs that can impede {{the success of the}} youth who participate in these programs.
