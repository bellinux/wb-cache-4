An example of the former kind of country in Argentina, and the prime example of the letter in the United States. Section III considers the other kind of country, namely, those with central banks that have maintained fairly rigid exchange rates.

40|$|Many {{gender studies}} {{are based on}} the concept of patriarchy which {{stresses}} the dichotomous distinction between women and men and which focuses on men's domination over women. But, in reality, women cannot be understood by the single category of "women" which is implicitly presupposed in the theory of patriarchy. They consist of multiple and differentiated layers. And the mechanisms through which femininity and domesticity are produced and reproduced should be reconsidered from the point of both feminine culture and the pratique or strategic actions of women. In this paper, the data from the survey of the women undergraduate students (for details, <b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>I)</b> are analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. In Section II, quantitative data are analyzed from the viewpoints of feminine socialization and housework practices (chapter A), feminine culture of consumption, domesticity and object-favoritism (chapter B), relationships between marital and professional perspectives (chapter C) and "conservatization" by two types of feminine strategic actions (chapter D). In Section III, the qualitative data (free description) are analyzed concerning the future expectation (chapter A), advantageous and disadvantageous experiences of being women (chapter B), and transformation of notions about males and marriage (chapter C). The perspective of "differentiation and ambivalence of femininity" is effective to analyze the (post-) modern gender relations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Max-product “belief {{propagation}} ” (BP) is an iterative, message-passing algorithm {{for finding}} the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of a discrete probability distribution specified by a graphical model. Despite the spectacular {{success of the}} algorithm in many application areas such as iterative decoding and combinatorial optimization, which involve graphs with many cycles, theoretical results about both the correctness and convergence of the algorithm are known {{in only a few}} cases (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>I</b> for references). In this paper, we will prove the correctness and convergence of max-product for finding the maximum weight matching (MWM) in bipartite graphs. Even though the underlying graph of the MWM problem has many cycles, somewhat surprisingly we show that the max-product algorithm converges to the correct MWM as long as the MWM is unique. We provide a bound on the number of iterations required and show that for a graph of size n, the computational cost of the algorithm scales as O(n 3), which {{is the same as the}} computational cost of the best known algorithms for finding the MWM. We also provide an interesting relation between the dynamics of the max-product algorithm and the auction algorithm, which is a well-known distributed algorithm for solving the MWM problem.

5000|$|Charles Larmore, W. Duncan MacMillan Family Professor in the Humanities at Brown University, was {{critical}} of A Secular Age in its approach, especially with it having too many references to Catholic theologians and a noticeable absence of Protestant figures (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>I</b> paragraph 7 within the cited article). Larmore also sees A Secular Age offering nothing new and is simply an extension of Max Weber's work on secularization theory (Section II, paragraph 1) with Weber and Taylor having differences that may be attributable to Weber being [...] "a lapsed Protestant" [...] and Taylor being [...] "an ardent Catholic" [...] (section II, paragraph 2). Larmore feels Taylor, in his book, may have [...] "an adequate basis for jumping to metaphysical or religious conclusions" [...] concerning the understanding of a secular view of the world, {{but to do so}} is [...] "precisely what we ought not to do" [...] (Section II, paragraph 5). Larmore disagrees with Taylor's insistence that people, having adequate information, should take a stance on God's presence throughout the world (Section II, paragraph 7). In Larmore's opinion, Taylor is wrong in not recognizing that [...] "We have never been, and we will never be, at one with ourselves" [...] and, therefore, should not jump to conclusions that are based on faith - which Larmore believes Taylor did in his book (Section II, paragraph 12).|$|R

The editors solicited contributions from many leading figures {{in a broad}} array of scientific and philosophical disciplines, with emphasis on phenomenological approaches to philosophy (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>I).</b> The motivating force was the conviction that if we could find a viable bridge for the gap between the 'two cultures' 1 of science and philosophy, fundamental problems in each camp could be addressed more fruitfully than ever before and a new kind of science be born. We believe the unprecedented cross-fertilization of ideas from this initiative may furnish seeds from which that new, better integrated, and more effective approach to science may arise. This Special Issue consists of forty papers. For each one, multiple reviewers were solicited, with at least one reviewer from each 'culture' (a scientist and a philosopher). In many cases, several rounds of revision were carried out. Needless to say, this required great patience and dedication of all participants.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we prove an {{orthogonality}} relation on Selmer groups of an abelian variety under p-adic height pairing. One subgroup is a generalization of one defined by Greenbreg using Iwasawa theory. The other comes naturally as essentially the kernel of localization. Let A be an abelian variety defined {{over a number}} field K, and let p be a prime number different from 2. Pick a F-extension L/K, and let •, •p be a p-adic height pairing affiliated with L/K (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>I</b> for details on notation and terminology). Moreover, we assume that A has ordinary reduction at every place of K ramifying in L. Let • be the dual abelJan variety to A. Choose a set of primes •: of K dividing p and containing the primes which ramify in L. We consider natural subgroups (depending on E•:) of the pro-finite Selmer groups of A and • respectively and show that one is the annihilator of the other under •, •p. If •, •p is non-degenerate, then each subgroup is the annihilator of the other. Although •, •p is naturally a pairing on the Selmer groups of A and one can use a non-zero isogeny A- • • to induce a self pairing on the Selmer group of A. The main theorem then implies the corresponding results for the Selmer group of A, and these results do {{not depend on the}} choice of isogeny. If, IIIK, the Tate-Shafarevich group of A is finite, then the subgroups in question lie in A(K) ©?/•p and •(K) © Zp respectively. In that case, th...|$|R
