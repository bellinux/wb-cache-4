2500|$|Taylor's wicket keeping {{abilities}} {{have been}} oft praised. In his citation for Cricketer of the Year for 1977, Wisden noted that [...] "artistry – {{there is no}} other word for it – behind the stumps has long illumined even the darkest hours of Derbyshire cricket." [...] He was known both for his acrobatic fielding behind the stumps, and his diligence and stamina, [...] "he has been without peer in the world for some years and would clearly have graced the England team but for Alan Knott." [...] He was noted for standing up to the stumps on nearly all occasions, stating that [...] "Any decent slip catcher could do it standing back." [...] By keeping his weight forwards and planted on his left foot, he was a skilled leg side <b>stumper</b> – considered a difficult skill in wicket keeping.|$|E

Of course I {{have known}} for some time that I should be going out to Russia; but I did not think the {{governor}} would have sent me until after I had gone through the school.

The rules were later changed to have the bonus round played after a team won two games, and if the teams could not solve a Super <b>Stumper</b> a new one was played. The teams chose spaces one at a time, starting with the team that won the previous jump-in, and did so until one solved the Super <b>Stumper.</b>|$|E
