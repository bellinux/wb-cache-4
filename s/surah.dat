He is also {{regarded as one of the}} leading scholars of the Maliki school of law. This article deals with the life and scholarly personality of Ibn al-Zubayr and his approach to the arrangement and composition of the Quran <b>surahs.</b> There are three different approaches to the process of the Quran becoming a book and the arrangement of the <b>surahs.</b> What makes Ibn al-Zubayr different in this regard is his view that these three approaches can be combined. He mentioned his views and the relations that constitute evidence on this issue in his “al-Burhan” that he wrote about the relations between verses and <b>Surahs.</b> The author’s this work, in addition to revealing the relationship between <b>surahs,</b> also shows that the arrangement of the <b>surahs</b> are not just a product of ijtihad...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the verses}} of the Quran {{relating}} to permissibility {{of domestic violence}} is <b>Surah</b> 4:34.

25|$|Shi'ahs {{offer this}} as a one rakat salah {{at the end of}} salatul layl (the night prayer), which is an {{optional}} prayer according to some shi'ah scholars, and a wajib (obligatory) prayer according to others. This is to be prayed any time after Isha, up until fajr. The best time to pray it is the last third of the night (the night being divided into three, between maghrib and fajr of that night). It is considered highly meritorious by all shi'ah Muslims, and is said to bring numerous benefits to the believer, mainly gaining proximity to Allah. There are various methods of salatul-layl's performance, including shorter and longer versions, in the longer version the believer must perform 8 nawafil salah, in sets of 2 rakats each, then they must pray a 2 rakats salah called 'salatul shafa'ah' this is to include <b>surah</b> nas after <b>surah</b> fatihah in the first rakat and <b>surah</b> falaq after <b>surah</b> fatihah in the secound rakat, and unusually no qunut (a du'ah recited before going into ruku' of the second rakat of most prayers performed by shi'ahs) It is after this that the believer performs salatul witr, it's long method being - Starting with takbiratul ehram, then <b>surah</b> fatihah, then <b>surah</b> ikhlas, then <b>surah</b> falaq, then <b>surah</b> nas, then the hands are raised to recite qunut, upon which the believer can recite any du'a, however there are many recommended du'as for this purpose. Within qunut, the believer must pray for the forgiveness of 40 believers, then further prayers are read where the believer asks for forgiveness for himself a certain number of times using specified phrases and amounts of times to repeat those phrases. The believer then completes the salah in the usual way, by completing his qunut, reciting takbir whilst rasing his hands, going into ruku' and reciting the usual phrase for that, then returning up right and reciting takbir whilst doing so and upon being upright recites 'sami allahu liman hamida' (verily Allah has heard the one who has praised him) thereupon the believer recites takbir whilst raising his hands and goes into sajda. He recites the proscribed phrase in sajda rises, recites takbir whilst rising and then again whilst returnin to sajdah, then rises with takbir again and recites tashahud and salam, thus ending this prayer. It is then optional to recite certain other du'as and dhikr (remembrance of Allah through certain phrases and some of his names being repeated) It is then recommended to perform and sajdah ash-shukr (prostration of thanks) and to then recite ayatul kursi (verse of the throne) and then perform another sajdah ash-shukr.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} of <b>surahs</b> into 'Meccan' and 'Medinan' {{is primarily a}} consequence of stylistic and thematic considerations.
