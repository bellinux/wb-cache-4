40|$|Printed {{circuit boards}} {{are a major}} {{component}} of most modern electronic devices. There are currently two major processes by which circuit boards are imaged; dry film and screen printing. This study investigated the <b>screen</b> printed <b>circuit</b> board. The resolution and registration limits are primary concerns of the <b>screen</b> <b>circuit</b> printer. These two factors are greatly influenced by two screen components; fabric and stencil system. The effects that two fabrics and two stencil systems had on the resolution and registration capabilities of a <b>screen</b> <b>circuit</b> printing system were determined. A test target was printed on a circuit substrate by a screen printing press under production conditions. Data on registration variation and line resolution was collected and analyzed statistically to determine if fabric, stencil or an interaction of both had a significant effect. A strong interaction effect of fabric and stencil upon resolution was found to occur when stainless steel mesh was used with the two stencil systems. Stainless steel combined with indirect stencil yielded the best resolution, while steel with capillary direct stencil yielded the worst resolution. A combination of polyester monofilament fabric and either indirect or capillary direct stencil yielded resolution between the two values found with the steel fabric. Registration variability was found to be significantly affected by the factor FABRIC. Steel mesh produced less registration variability than polyester mesh. However, this registration variability of fabrics seems to be significantly related to the condition of the fabric – new or used. Conclusions of the study were that for best resolution and least registration variability, stainless steel fabric combined with indirect stencils should be used. The second choice would be dyed monofilament polyester combined with either indirect or capillary direct stencil systems. The combination of stainless steel and capillary direct stencil should be avoided. It should be noted that run length is a major consideration when choosing fabric/stencil combinations for circuit imaging. Further investigations of registration variability in stainless steel and polyester monofilament fabrics over numerous runs would also yield valuable information for the <b>screen</b> <b>circuit</b> printer...|$|R

Data encoding scheme is used to reduce the power dissipation by the means of reducing the switching activity which involves comparison of two bits at a time.

40|$|Accurate {{crushing}} {{and screening}} models {{are essential for}} the meaningful simulation of ore dressing plants such as the iron ore beneficiation plant studies in this work. Crushing and screening models were studies, developed and enhanced. The basic simulator used was Microsim, which was subsequently expanded to incorporate these new models. The models were then evaluated individually. The Whiten crushing model was modified for haematite, as this is a particularly hard ore. A new model was developed for the gyradisc crushing of haematite, with two interparticle breakage mechanisms {{taking place in the}} crushing chamber. The gyradisc model has only the crusher closed side setting as parameter. Both models showed good agreement with experimental data. The Karra screen model was enhanced to include the use of ‘poly’ decks and non-square screen apertures, as used on the plant. The Rose efficiency model was developed to use efficiencies from plant data or experiments. The Rose model showed a better relative accuracy than the entirely empirical enhanced Karra model. The screen models developed can be used for different ores but the crushing models are not transferable. Thereafter simulation was done for the quaternary sub-plant manufacturing two or three products respectively. The product ratios obtained by simulation were accurate in both cases. The optimization routine was then used to calculate an improved fine to lumpy ore ratio. It was found that only a small improvement could be achieved in the quaternary plant. Simulation of the preliminary comminution plant, however, failed to give accurate results. This plant does not operate in steady state, therefore the error could be ascribed to this. The accuracy of the Nordberg gyratory crushing model used in this sub-plant could not be established. The washing and screening plant was successfully simulated with the new screening models. The choice of size classes was found to be very important in the simulation of crushing and <b>screening</b> <b>circuits.</b> The maximum number must be used and should coincide with screen apertures.
