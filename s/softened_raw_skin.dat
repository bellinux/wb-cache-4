40|$|What {{the present}} paper deals with, of chiefly the researching-results {{concerning}} the properties of shark-skin put under the tanning process. ""I. Effect of liming on the fish-skin. The amount of the nitrogenous compounds dissolved out into the lime-water from the shark-skin in the liming, increased in parallel with the time of liming, with no relation with the volume of lime-water. The amount of ammonia-N and amide-N dissolved out from the shark-skin was about two {{times as much as}} that from the cattle hide. The contents of amide-N and diamino-N in the limed shark-skin were less than those of <b>raw</b> <b>skin,</b> while the contents of mono amino-Nshowed increasing tendency. ""The detection of almost every kind of amino acid was possible in the lime-water used for liming. In general, the amino acids in the shark-skin dissolved out faster than those in the cattle-hide. Glycine, aspartic acid and alanine were apt to become free from the skin. The release existence of proline and hydroxyproline suggesting the decomposition of collagen was obserbed revealed in case of the shark-skin on the 7 th and 10 th day in the liming, while in case of the cattle-hide it was marked on the 17 th day weakly. The contents of hydroxyproline and arginine in the shark-skin decreased and those in the lime-water increased gradually, after the 7 th day. Accordingly, it was clarified that the liming of shark-skin should be kept in the peried from 7 to 10 days at about 23 °C. Before the occurrence of rapid decrease in the contents of hydroxyproline in the limed skin collagen, no change the hydrothermal shrinking temperature (Ts) could be observed. Ts. of limed skin and that of delimed skin were observed to be not so high as that of <b>raw</b> <b>skin,</b> but Ts. of leather was always considerably higher than that of <b>raw</b> <b>skin.</b> From the above mentioned resalts it was presumed that the liming process should haveconsiderable effects on the skin, namely, the removal of unavilable protein; the swell and exposure of collagen; the increase of reactivity of skin to tan agent and the elevation of Ts. of leather. In addition, it was confirmed that the day sneeded for the liming of shark-skin were far shorter than those for cattle hide. ""II. Changes of lipid in fish-skin. The changes in the contents of lipid in the skin under the tanning process, especially the pickling process, were studied, mainly, with blue-fin-tuna-skin having much lipid.

30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a new method for creating self-adaptive seeds for spatial-based skin segmentation.

Our extensive experimental study demonstrated that the DSPF domain is less sensitive to the method’s parameters and outperforms all of the investigated methods both for the ECU and HGR data sets, except for our earlier face-based adaptation [11]. The raw probability domain is much more sensitive, which {{makes it difficult to}} tune; however, in some cases (for the ECU set), it delivered better results than the DSPF and also it is much less time consuming.

The effects of different levels of reused salt and added biocide on some physical characteristics of sheep leather were evaluated. Thirty six pieces of <b>raw</b> sheep <b>skins</b> were obtained from Alkadero slaughterhouse. According to the type of salt, level of added biocide and method of preservation used, the pieces of raw sheepskins were allocated into 9 groups. Three groups received dry salting without biocide viz, 30 % (control), 25 % dry salting and 30 % dry reused salt. Six groups were wet salted in brine of 30 % and 25 % reused salt viz and 3 level of biocide (0. 2 %, 0. 4 % and 0. 6 %). All skins were cured, chrome tanned and the finished leathers were tested for the physical properties. The results showed that the leathers preserved by 25 % brine of reused salt with 0. 2 % biocide gave the best results for thickness (1. 4 mm), elongation (39. 45 %), tear strength (71. 72 kg/cm) and grain crack strength (9. 66 kg) compared to other treatments.
