2500|$|UB has two student-run periodicals: The Spectrum and Generation magazine. Both {{publications}} {{are distributed}} on campus. [...] The Spectrum {{is the only}} independent publication. Generation is funded by advertising and through <b>Sub-Board</b> I, the student services corporation. UB also has a student radio station, WRUB. WRUB broadcasts all UB home football games and select road games, {{as well as most}} UB men's and women's home basketball games.|$|E
2500|$|Programmable {{earth fault}} relays are {{available}} to allow co-ordinated installations to minimise outage. For example a power distribution system might have a 300mA, 300msec [...] device at the service entry of a building, feeding several 100mA S type at each <b>sub-board,</b> and 30mA G type for each final circuit. In this way, a failure of a device to detect the fault will eventually be cleared by a higher-level device, {{at the cost of}} interrupting more circuits.|$|E

5000|$|The chess board {{itself was}} also varicolored, and {{divided into four}} <b>sub-boards</b> in which each {{of one of the}} four {{elemental}} colors predominated. [...] The rules of the game were partially derived from shatranj and other historical forms of chess; the queen is played like a fers, with a two square diagonal leaping move. [...] The four players would form pairs of two, with each player having a partner. MacGregor Mathers, who finalised the game's rules, was known to play with an invisible partner he claimed was a spirit. Joseph Hone, biographer of William Butler Yeats, claimed, [...] "Mathers would shade his eyes with his hands and gaze at the empty chair at the opposite corner of the board before moving his partner's piece." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Technical Assessment" [...] is an {{examination}} for self-trained architects {{with more than}} 10 years of experience gained in the Republic of Ireland prior to the enforcement of architects’ registration. AAoI claims that the fees are inappropriate (€6,500 in 2009, lowered to €4,500 in 2011), and that the RIAI is manipulating the procedure by setting up academic and administrative standards that {{do not reflect the}} practice of architecture before the implementation of registration. The RIAI claims that the examinations are based on internationally recognised standards and that 80% of candidates to date have been successful. The AAoI claims that the 80% success rate to the technical assessment is false and that the percentage is nearer to 50%. AAoI declared that less of a dozen of practitioners (out of hundreds of potential applicants) have applied for the Technical Assessment. The RIAI claims that the majority of those on the registration board are not architects and that they are not affiliated to the RIAI. AAoI stated that the <b>sub-boards</b> assessing applicants are made of 3 RIAI affiliated architects only, {{and that it would be}} difficult for any member of the assessment board not affiliated to the RIAI, to challenge the opinion and position of RIAI members on architectural subjects. AAoI members claim that the assessment is set up by their competitors. The RIAI states that the fees for registration are now approved by the government.|$|R

50|$|The game {{is played}} on a 6×6 board divided into four 3×3 sub-boards (or quadrants). Taking turns, the two players place a marble of their color (either black or white) onto an unoccupied space on the board, and then rotate one of the sub-boards by 90 degrees either {{clockwise}} or anti-clockwise. This is optional {{in the beginning of}} the game, up until every <b>sub-board</b> no longer has rotational symmetry, at which point it becomes mandatory (this is because until then, a player could rotate an empty <b>sub-board</b> or one with just a marble in the middle, either of which has no real effect). A player wins by getting five of their marbles in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row (either before or after the <b>sub-board</b> rotation in their move). If all 36 spaces on the board are occupied without a row of five being formed then the game is a draw.|$|E
50|$|Programmable Earth fault Relays are {{available}} to allow tiered installations to minimise outage, e.g. 300mA, 300msec at origin, feeding several 100mA S type at each <b>sub-board,</b> and 30mA G type for each final circuit.|$|E
5000|$|All in all, TBBS and its option modules {{were far}} beyond the {{performance}} and reliability of what other BBS authors could dream of. The Program actually had power not even anticipated by the author. For example, in 1988 the University of Southern California installed TBBS for their 16 line BBS system administered by Susan Biddlecomb, who was Director of Computer Support of the USC Health Care system. [...] The actual computer was housed in the Computer Facility, some distance from her office, necessitating {{her to go to}} the computer facility to make the most minor change. Her solution was to completely dispense with the internal menu and interface system, devise a standard menu layout, and build menus “on the fly” using the add-on TDBS module. She would upload any changes or additions to the menus as entries in the database, and remotely recompile the menus. Upon a daily reboot, the changes would automatically take effect without the necessity for a trip to the computer room. A side benefit was that, upon registration or login, the user could enter or change any information, such as personal information, preferences, or <b>sub-boards</b> of interest, this information was entered into the database, and this would then dynamically customize the menu system presented to the user, and no two users were necessarily presented with the same information. This meant that the entire interface seen by the users was in actuality an add-on running under TDBS with the main program functioning merely as a multitasker. Years later, a similar concept is widely used on the World Wide Web as database driven content, one of its most powerful features. It {{is interesting to note that}} E-Soft did not publicize this method of constructing the menu system and left it to the users to discover the power this advanced implementation.|$|R
40|$|Analysing Player Discussions in Qualitative Game Research My project {{concerns}} {{the appropriation of}} religious content in games by players. Or: how do players – individually, in groups and by forming mediated player cultures – identify with, interpret and negotiate religious content in commercial video games? These aspects of gamer culture take place in large part outside of games, on discussion boards. This becomes an important avenue of study, specifically, {{in the case of}} single-player games or those multi-player games where groups are brief, transient and not necessarily social – which we might contrast to the plethora of established research on the social dimensions of MMOs. More so, when dealing with peer discussions of players about their game-play and the meanings they attribute to their experiences, discussion boards become an important site for data-collection. As the research is currently in an early stage, the methodological concerns discussed below are on-going and, as such, provide both a useful source of discussion as well as a productive avenue for reflection. At the current stage of research, a number of methodological concerns arise which are of broader relevance to fellow researchers dealing with community discussion of game content; the informed selection of case studies; and the study of player appropriation (of worldviews or rhetorics presented by games). The methodological concerns I wish to discuss arise out of two aspects of research design. First, the choice of case studies based on discussions in player communities; and, second, the need to develop an adequate method for assessing and analysing the content of players’ discussions which takes into account the communicative platforms on which these discussions take place. Selecting the games relevant to research can be done in various ways, depending on research design. In my case, rather than quantitatively select games based on sales figures and popularity (hours played by amounts of people) or qualitatively based on content analysis or researchers’ intuition, an analysis of player community discourse allows player communities themselves to dictate the choice of case studies. This methodological choice takes into account the negotiated process of interpretation that player communities perform within a participatory culture, while also taking into account that these discussions are firmly interwoven with the ways in which these games are played: i. e., how they are understood differently by players, with whom they are played, and by whom (by relating play experience to personal stories). My second methodological concern is both a consequence of the former, as well as an open avenue for discussion: how to account for the platform on which these discussions take place? Discussion has, in recent years, increasingly moved from ‘forum’-style discussion boards to the online bulletin board ‘Reddit’. How can we adjust or replace previous methods of forum content analysis (e. g., Bourgonjon et al. 2015) based on this change of platform? This is a challenging question, given the fact that Reddit shapes discussions differently (from chronological forum threads to a dynamic ‘upvote/downvote’-system); is numerously divided into various <b>sub-boards</b> and is nonetheless undeniably an important site for player discussion. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|While high infant {{mortality}} rates were {{recognized by the}} British medical community at least {{as early as the}} 1860s, modern neonatal intensive care is a relatively recent advance. In 1898 Dr. Joseph DeLee established the first premature infant incubator station in Chicago, Illinois. The first American textbook on prematurity was published in 1922. In 1952 Dr. Virginia Apgar described the Apgar score scoring system as a means of evaluating a newborn's condition. It was not until 1965 that the first American newborn intensive care unit (NICU) was opened in New Haven, Connecticut and in 1975 the American Board of Pediatrics established <b>sub-board</b> certification for neonatology.|$|E

5000|$|The {{specialty}} of pediatric gastroenterology requires {{four years of}} undergraduate courses at a college or university {{in order to obtain}} a BS, BA, or other bachelor's degree. During these four years a student studying pediatric gastroenterology can also take a pre-med course. Afterwards, the student needs four years of medical school in order to obtain an MD or DO degree and become a general doctor. Afterwards the student needs to take a specialty in pediatrics consisting in three more years of education called residency. Afterwards pediatrics sub-specialize in a more specific area such as pediatric gastroenterology. The time to sub-specialize is called post-residency training also known as a fellowship. It can take from one to three or more years consisting in a total of fourteen years or more. In the United States, the committees to certify pediatric gastroenterologist were created in the 1980s. This gave rise to sub-specialty boards in pediatric gastroenterology in 1990 under the leadership of American board of Pediatrics and its Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition subspecialty <b>sub-board,</b> led by Bill Kish. A formal training program was created later in 1997 by the sub-specialty advisory committee for pediatric gastroenterology of the royal college of pediatrics and child health in Great Britain.|$|E
40|$|Following {{the recent}} {{adoption}} of a national code of corporate governance (CG) in a developing economy (Mauritius), the authors assessed the level of CG adoption by locally-listed companies using annual report disclosures. Whilst a satisfactory level of adoption is observed for a numberof CG requirements/mechanisms, a number of disclosure aspects (or the lack thereof) - involving the status/role of independent non-executive directors, directors’ remuneration/related interests, and the actual operation of <b>sub-board</b> meetings – is suggestive of a selective adoption and behaviour towards the CG code. In addition, {{a significant number of}} compliance statements were found to be unrelated or even inconsistent with the actual level of adoption. The authors contended that some of the companies appeared to project an appearance of CG adoption which was at odds with the reality - possibly in bid to maintain or enhance organizational legitimacy. A selected number of directors from these companies were also interviewed to assess their attitudes, perceptions and motivations vis-à-vis the CG implementation/disclosure process. Overall, organizational legitimacy, rather than a strict efficiency-led rationale, does emerge as a theoretical explanation but companies/directors’ conceptualisation of organizational legitimacy differ, thereby explaining the varying levels of CG adoption at company level...|$|E
30|$|Internet forums provide {{users with}} a {{platform}} for communication and interaction that transcends time and geographical region. Within the same message board of a forum, investors are able to interact with other investors worldwide. Forums on stocks and shares are generally categorized into separate message boards for different stocks; therefore, investors can have discussions and exchanges on those message boards corresponding to the stocks of their interest. On forum sites, the general approach is to automatically place that the newest posts and posts on a message board that are being discussed most intensely on the home pages. In addition, message board managers evaluate the content quality of posts and bump the good ones to the top or pin these as recommended posts, thereby making them easily found within the <b>sub-board</b> that contains all the pinned or sticky posts. This means that investors can quickly obtain the latest, relatively important, and high-quality information on the stocks that {{they are interested in}} by checking the relevant message boards. However, pinned posts are screened and selected by message board managers, indicating that a certain degree of subjectivity might be involved. Moreover, since individuals are unable to customize the various message boards to focus on information related to a particular topic, it might be inefficient to obtain information from stock message boards given investors’ limited attention. In addition, the timeliness of interactions on the boards is poor.|$|E
40|$|Whilst online {{message boards}} offer an {{effective}} way to communicate issues such as aggression between individuals can still exist. Bullying for example is not confined to face to face (FtF) interactions and is increasingly common online (Bond & Carter, 2012; 2013). Additionally there are specific online behaviours such as trolling and flaming. These behaviours can be found in many online communities though some are more infamous for online hostility. One such community is 4 chan. org, an asynchronous multi-board site originally developed for discussion of Japanese anime but has expanded to cover a range of topics (Knuttila, 2011). Theories regarding such aggressive online behaviours focus on similar factors to FtF behaviour such as anonymity. The SIDE model is often utilised (Lea & Spears, 1991). Communities like 4 chan with their high message turnover and ranges of anonymity available to users provide a ready resource to investigate the suitability of such theory for online interactions. The ease of access also makes them a tempting focus of undergraduate dissertations. However despite these benefits there are both ethical and practical issues attached. This presentation focuses on some preliminary work carried out during an undergraduate project as a case study, and discusses some matters arising. To investigate the possible effects of anonymity on online aggression a student observed and recorded 30 minutes activity on a 4 chan <b>sub-board</b> (Social) every day for a week. The contents of the collected posts were then categorised by user’s anonymity level (moderate, heightened, complete) and the level of any expressed hostility/aggression. Of 3662 posts 998 contained some form of aggression. Though this appeared to be a reasonable sample size 99. 8...|$|E
