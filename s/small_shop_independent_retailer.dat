40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>shops</b> are {{a curious}} paradox. When <b>small</b> <b>shops</b> are mentioned, the <b>independent</b> <b>retailer</b> is often brought to mind.

Whilst Scotland may be no different in this regard to other parts of the UK and the world, its geography and new Parliament might suggest new solutions. This paper examines the roles and problems of the <b>independent</b> <b>small</b> <b>shop</b> before examining some of the solutions adopted in particular rural areas. A plea for a better understanding of such retail facilities is made...|$|R
