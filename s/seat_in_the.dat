Gore did not complete law school, deciding abruptly, in 1976, to run for a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. House of Representatives when he found out that his father's former <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House was about to be vacated.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of their land, local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised.

5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, {{was in his}} seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A Republican in the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E

This was helped by a high-profile anti-Conservative campaign by musician Billy Bragg. The seat was gained from Labour by Drax for the Conservatives at the 2010 General Election.|$|E

5|$|Fletcher {{graduated}} from the University of Kentucky and joined the United States Air Force to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut.

Deteriorating eyesight eventually ended those hopes, and he entered private practice as a physician and conducted services as a Baptist lay minister. He became active in politics and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1994. Two years later he ran for a <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to incumbent Scotty Baesler.
