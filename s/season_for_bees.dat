50|$|After {{retiring}} from the Grand Prix series, Hamill concentrated on his league racing in Britain, Sweden and Poland. He rode one more <b>season</b> <b>for</b> the Coventry <b>Bees</b> {{before moving on to}} the Oxford Cheetahs and then on to Cradley Heath's bitter rivals the Wolverhampton Wolves in 2006 and 2007.|$|R
50|$|On 27 January 2014, Yennaris joined League One side Brentford for an {{undisclosed}} fee on a two-and-a-half-year contract. He made his debut in a 1-1 draw at Shrewsbury Town on 1 February, but was replaced by Adam Forshaw after suffering a dead leg on 50 minutes. After returning to fitness, he made sporadic appearances {{through to the end}} of a successful <b>season</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Bees,</b> securing automatic promotion to the Championship after a 1-0 victory over Preston North End on 18 April. Though he made only eight appearances during the second half of the 2013-14 season, Yennaris received a League One runners-up medal after the final game of the season against Stevenage.|$|R
50|$|Dean {{began the}} 2013-14 season as an ever-present in league matches {{and made his}} 100th Brentford {{appearance}} in a 5-0 thrashing of Crewe Alexandra on 16 November 2013. Dean suffered the first injury of his Bees career in the Christmas period, picking up a knock which saw him miss four games in January. A broken metatarsal and an abdominal strain saw Dean miss three games in March, which allowed new centre back signing James Tarkowski {{to break into the}} team. A suspension for Tarkowski mid-March saw Dean back in the team, but his season ended early on 28 April, when he underwent an operation to fix his abdominal injury. He made 33 appearances during a successful <b>season</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Bees,</b> which saw the club automatically promoted to the Championship with a runners-up finish.|$|R
50|$|Omigie had to {{wait until}} 2 November 1996 to make his first {{appearance}} of the 1996-97 <b>season</b> <b>for</b> the table-topping <b>Bees,</b> replacing Carl Asaba after 62 minutes of a 2-0 defeat to Watford. He scored his first goal for the club in a resounding 4-1 away victory over Plymouth Argyle. Omigie made semi-regular appearances through {{to the end of the}} season, but failed to appear in the Bees' unsuccessful playoff campaign. He finished the 1996-97 season having made 15 appearances and scored one goal.|$|R
50|$|A centre forward who {{remained}} an amateur {{for the first}} part of his career, Gibbons played for Athenian League sides Uxbridge and Hayes and Isthmian League side Kingstonian before joining Football League Second Division club Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 1937. He scored on his debut, netting in a 3-0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday on 16 September 1937. Gibbons made 36 appearances and scored 18 goals during the 1937-38 season, with 12 of his strikes coming in the form of four hattricks in consecutive games in December 1937 and January 1938. He joined First Division side Brentford in the summer of 1938, making 11 appearances and scoring one goal during a poor 1938-39 <b>season</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Bees.</b> Gibbons re-joined Tottenham Hotspur in 1939, but failed to make an appearance in his second spell with the White Hart Lane club.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{he started}} the 2004-05 <b>season</b> <b>for</b> Pertemps <b>Bees,</b> during {{the latter half of}} the season Mark moved to Bristol where he signed {{professional}} terms. After being a key player at the Bees he was unable to become a first team regular at Bristol in a period where he also played for Italian outfit Napoli and he left to join Nottingham <b>for</b> the 2005-06 <b>season</b> but was no more than a squad player at the Midlands side. Mark made it four clubs in just three <b>seasons</b> <b>for</b> the 2006-07 <b>season</b> when he moved up north to play for Doncaster Knights. It was fourth time lucky as Mark became a regular at Castle Park, helping the Yorkshire side to 3rd place in a competitive division as well as winning the 2007 Yorkshire Cup, scoring over 200 points in league and cup games. [...] His good season was rewarded with a call up to the England Counties XV for their tour of Russia. [...] He stayed a further <b>season</b> with Doncaster <b>for</b> the 2007-08 <b>season</b> as the side finished 4th in the league and he scored 266 points in all competitions. [...] He was also an unused substitute during the 2008 Yorkshire Cup final which saw Doncaster retain the trophy.|$|R
50|$|McCormack's first {{appearance}} of 2014-15 {{came on the}} opening day against former club Charlton Athletic, playing right-back in a 1-1 draw. After starting {{in each of the}} Bees' first seven league matches, McCormack signed a new two-year contract, with the option of a third year, to keep him at Griffin Park until June 2016. McCormack celebrated the signing by scoring his first goal of the season with the Bees' second in a 2-0 win over Leeds United on 27 September. McCormack's status as an ever-present in league matches came to an end after suffering an ankle ligament injury after 70 minutes of a 3-1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on 25 October. He returned to light training in January 2015 and made his first team return as a 74th-minute substitute for Toumani Diagouraga during a 3-1 victory over Bournemouth on 21 February. Having lost his right-back berth to Moses Odubajo, he made just three further appearances in a successful <b>season</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Bees,</b> which finished in defeat to Middlesbrough in the play-off semi-finals. McCormack made 18 appearances and scored one goal during the 2014-15 season.|$|R
50|$|A move {{followed}} for the 2003/04 term, {{this time to}} the Bracknell Bees, a team now playing in the transitional BNL following {{the collapse of the}} ISL. Murphy played just 8 regular <b>season</b> games <b>for</b> the <b>Bees</b> due to a shoulder injury which kept him off the ice {{for the remainder of the}} season. He moved into European hockey <b>for</b> the 2004/05 <b>season.</b> He found regular games with Swedish Division 1 team Bräcke IK. Murphy proved to be an excellent signing for Bräcke and became known for his speed and agility. After 3 months, Murphy was poached by the higher level Allsvenskan team IF Björklöven to play out the remainder of the <b>season</b> <b>for</b> them. Murphy adapted to the change in standard well, and completed the season as a Björklöven player. They failed to make the post-season however and so Murphy returned to Scotland to play in three post-season games for the Stars.|$|R
50|$|The flight <b>season</b> <b>for</b> this <b>bee</b> {{ranges from}} the later months of winter to early spring. The bee is {{univoltine}} - it produces only one brood per breeding season. After remaining dormant {{until the following}} winter, the brood which had been laid the previous year emerges and begins the flight season and mating process. The males of the species will emerge from the nests before their female counterparts. Additionally, the minor males, with head widths less than 6.3 mm, tended to emerge before the major males, with head widths greater than 6.3 mm, {{over the course of}} the entire breeding season. Even within the span of single days in the emergence period, minor males tended to surface earlier in the day than major males. This may be due to an evolutionary pressure which forces smaller males to emerge earlier than their larger counterparts to avoid competition for mating with larger individuals. Male emergence is also prolonged, and can last several weeks into the flight season. This results in a large amount of emergence overlap between males and females of the species. This might be due to the increased fitness of late-emerging males to mate with females later in the season, given that the early-emerging competition would already have died.|$|R
