In the twenty-second century, however, {{the growth of the}} city storey above storey, and the coalescence of buildings, had led to a different arrangement. The prosperous people lived in a vast series of sumptuous hotels in the upper storeys and halls of the city fabric; the industrial population dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground-floor and basement, so to speak, of the place.|$|R

A regime of a hay cut followed by cattle grazing, {{without the use of}} artificial fertilisers, has resulted in a diverse grassland habitat now rare in England. Herbs include meadow buttercup, lesser knapweed and devil's bit scabious. Ditches and the riverbank provide a permanently wet habitat, encouraging wading birds such as snipe and curlew.

40|$|AbstractThe {{detrimental}} consequences of swelling soils are most apparent in arid and semi-arid regions. Sedimentary clays are mixtures of illite, kaolinite and some montmorillonite. There are various <b>soil</b> types <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> swell such as shale, mudstone, siltstone and marl {{due to the}} presence of Smectite group in these soils. Large volume changes of these types of soils can cause extensive damages to civil engineering infrastructures; roads, airport pavements, pipelines and shallow foundations. A number of localities in Egypt are well-known by the presence of swelling soils. Sohag â€“ Safaga highway in the Eastern Desert of Egypt is considered to be an investable transportation road {{and one of the most}} important lateral connections between Upper Egypt and the Red Sea area. The study area is located in a buffer zone of 25 km from both sides of the highway. This area is believed to be more influenced by the road and could be fully utilized to share in developing areas in the road vicinity. The research objectives are to use recent ASTER satellite imageries with the aid of field samples to map different swelling clay minerals and compare between the different sensors accuracy in locating them within the buffer zone. Certain engineering measures should be considered to enable construction over these types of swelling soils. The results confirmed the presence of montmorillonite in this buffer zone and in the 5 km buffer around the road which represents a hazard especially for the future planned projects within this area...|$|R
40|$|In this {{overview}} {{of the effects of}} cadmium pollution on agricultural soils in the European Community, both the cadmium loads on agricultural land and the soil sensitivity to cadmium accumulation have been estimated. Cadmium loads have been estimated separately for arable land and grassland. The effects that the spatial variation of the cadmium loads have on soils differing geographically in binding capacity for cadmium are mapped. Effects are expressed either as calculated cadmium concentration of the soil solution compared with a target value for groundwater or as an accumulation rate of cadmium in the topsoil compared with the present-day cadmium content. The cadmium in the <b>soil</b> solution is <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> leaching from the topsoil. Whether or not this eluting cadmium threatens the groundwater depends on many factors, like net precipitation and characteristics of the soil layers below the topsoil. Calculations show that for about 15 % of the agricultural land the cadmium concentration in the soil solution of the topsoil are around or above the Dutch target value, and that for 36 - 47 % of the land calculated accumulation rates are more than 10 % in 100 years, compared with the current cadmium content. ...|$|R
6000|$|Protecting Wells.--The {{following}} {{extract from}} Bishop Heber, though hardly {{within the scope}} of the 'Art of Travel,' is very suggestive. [...] "The wells of this country (Bhurtpoor, India), some of which are very deep, are made in a singular manner. They build a tower of masonry of the diameter required, and 20 or 30 feet high {{from the surface of the}} ground. This they allow to stand a year or more, till its masonry is rendered firm and compact by time; then they gradually undermine it, and promote its sinking into the sandy soil, which it does without difficulty, and altogether. When level with the surface, they raise its walls higher; and so go on, throwing out the sand and raising the wall, till they have reached the water. If they adopted our method, the soil is so light that it would fall on them before they could possibly raise the wall from the bottom; nor, without the wall, could they sink to any considerable depth." [...] A stout square frame of wood scantling, boarded like a sentry-box, and of about the same size and shape, but without top or bottom, is used in making wells in America. The sides of a well in sandy <b>soil</b> are so <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> fall in, that travellers often sink a cask or some equivalent into the water, when they are encamped for any length of time in its vicinity.|$|R

30|$|The {{result of}} the present study on the fate of wild sorghum seed after 18 and 24 Â months of burial was in {{agreement}} with the results of Jacques et al. (1974) who did similar study in Kansas. They found that only few seeds of cultivated sorghum remained viable after four months of burial regardless of the burial depth, but some shatter cane seeds were able to survive for three years mostly from deeper burial depths (30 Â cm to 38 Â cm). The result was also intermediate between the results of Burnside et al. (1996) and Teo-Sherrell and Mortensen (2000). Burnside et al. (1996) found little viability in weedy sorghum seed after five years of burial, but they also observed 1 % germinated after 17 Â years of burial in eastern Nebraska. Teo-Sherrell and Mortensen (2000) reported more than 80 % mortality in weedy sorghum seed within three months after burial (between November and March) in Nebraska because of winter cold. However, such kind of winter environment of the temperate regions does not exist in most sorghum growing regions of Sub-Sahara Africa including Ethiopia. The observation that an increase in depth of burial increases longevity was in agreement with the previous reports in sorghum (Jacques et al. 1974), crimson and red clovers (Rampton and Ching 1970), in jointed goat grass (Donald and Zimdahl 1987), in wild oat (Miller and Nalewaja 1990), and in Amaranthus retroflexus seeds (Omami et al. 1999), to mention a few. This may be due mainly to the unavailability of suitable conditions for germination such as a decrease in oxygen content with increase in depth. In addition, seeds near the surface of the <b>soil</b> are more <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> natural predators and greater fluctuation in environmental conditions, which may contribute to faster rate of decay (Chantre et al. 2008).|$|R
