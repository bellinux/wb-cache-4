5|$|The {{imperial}} pheasant {{is a rare}} bird found in the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Rasmussen and her co-workers used morphology, hybridisation experiments, and DNA analysis to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> pheasant, previously thought critically endangered, is actually a naturally occurring hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant Lophura hatinhensis and the subspecies annamensis of the silver pheasant L. nycthemera.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear.

Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E

40|$|Stochastic {{resonance}} {{occurs when}} noise improves how a nonlinear system performs. This paper presents two general stochastic-resonance theorems for threshold neurons that process noisy Bernoulli input sequences. The performance measure is Shannon mutual information. The theorems <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{small amounts of}} independent additive noise can increase the mutual information of threshold neurons if the neurons detect subthreshold signals. The first theorem <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> stochastic-resonance effect holds for all finite-variance noise probability density functions that obey a simple mean constraint that the user can control. A corollary <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> stochastic-resonance effect occurs for the important family of (right-sided) gamma noise. The second theorem <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> effect holds for all infinite-variance noise types in the broad family of stable distributions. Stable bell curves can model extremely impulsive noise environments. So the second theorem <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> stochastic-resonance effect is robust against violent fluctuations in the additive noise process...|$|R

25|$|Another {{edition of}} the map was made for the King Afonso V of Portugal. This edition was {{produced}} by Fra Mauro and his assistant Andrea Bianco, a sailor-cartographer. It was completed on 24 April 1459. The map was then sent to Lisbon in Portugal.

As a highly endangered member of an ancient evolutionary family, the species is accorded a high ranking on the EDGE list of mammals, sitting fourth.|$|E

25|$|To {{encourage}} {{investment in}} wind power, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity {{within their own}} or an adjoining municipality.

By 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country. Opinion polls <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines, with some 86% of Danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources.|$|E
