40|$|The {{fracture}} {{phenomena of}} {{rocks in the}} <b>solid</b> <b>mediums</b> was studied. A large quantity of residual stress was observed just after the major fracture. The ratio of stress drop to initial stress was large for the weak mediums and small for the strong mediums. The effect of existence of free surface {{on the strength of}} specimen, the stress drop ratio at the moment of fracture, and the stress relaxa-tion after the major fracture was also quite remarkable. The three features of the earthquake occurrence was mentioned. (1) After-shock sequences occur in accordance with Omori's formula. (2) Earthquakes occur generally in groups. (3) The earthquake group changes its type with focal depth from aftershock type to earthquake-cluster type, and finally to iso-latedshock type.

40|$|Nowadays, 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) {{is widely}} used as {{non-toxic}} herbicide, as insecticide, and also as plant growth enhancer in agricultural application. However, their use is limited by high production cost via the route of chemical synthesis. Agricultural waste, which serves as inexpensive <b>solid</b> support <b>medium,</b> {{can be used to}} produce ALA through solid-state fermentation (SSF). In this study, production of ALA using empty fruit bunch (EFB) as <b>solid</b> support <b>medium</b> inoculated with Rhodopseudomonas palustris (R. palustris) NRRL-B 4276 was conducted through SSF. Several environmental factors for the SSF process including the initial pH (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), initial moisture content (40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 %) of the <b>solid</b> support <b>medium,</b> and incubation period (1 - 5 days) were investigated to study their effects for the production of ALA in SSF.

The Nd-YAG laser emits infrared light at 1.064 micrometres and is the most popular solid-state laser (i.e. laser based on a <b>solid</b> <b>medium).</b> The reason for using NdCl3 rather than metallic neodymium or its oxide, in fabrication of fibers is easy decomposition of NdCl3 during the chemical vapor deposition; the latter process is widely used for the fiber grows.|$|E
2500|$|Nutritional {{stress can}} change {{bacterial}} morphology. [...] A common shape alteration is filamentation {{which can be}} triggered by a limited availability {{of one or more}} substrates, nutrients or electron acceptors. Since the filament can increase a cell’s uptake–surface area without significantly changing its volume appreciably. [...] Moreover, the filamentation benefits bacterial cells attaching to a surface because it increases specific surface area in direct contact with the <b>solid</b> <b>medium.</b> In addition, the filamentation may allows bacterial cells to access nutrients by enhancing the possibility that part of the filament will contact a nutrient-rich zone and pass compounds {{to the rest of the}} cell’s biomass. For example, Actinomyces israelii grows as filamentous rods or branched in the absence of phosphate, cysteine, or glutathione. However, it returns to a regular rod-like morphology when adding back these nutrients.|$|E

The landside and share are arranged to give a ‘'lead” towards the unploughed land, thus helping to maintain the correct furrow width. The landside is usually made of <b>solid</b> <b>medium</b> carbon steel, and is very short except on the rear bottom of the plow. The heel or rear end of the rear landside may be subject to excessive wear if the rear wheel is out of adjustment, therefore, a chilled iron heel piece is frequently used.

For by its congruity it easily conforms it self, and adheres to the Glass, and constitutes as it were one containing body with it, and therefore should thrust the contained Air on that side it touches it, into a spherical Figure, as BHC, but the motion of Gravity depressing a little the Corners B and C, reduces it into the aforesaid Figure CKB.

For the same water, which in a Glass or wooden Vessel will have a concave surface upwards, and will rise higher in a smaller then a greater Pipe, the same water, I say, in the same Pipes greased over or oyled, will produce quite contrary effects; for it will have a protuberant and convex surface upwards, and will not rise so high in small, as in bigger Pipes: Nay, in the very same solid Vessel, you may make the very same two contiguous Liquids to alter their Surfaces; for taking a small Wine-glass, or such like Vessel, and pouring water gently into it, you shall perceive {{the surface of the water}} all the way concave, till it rise even with the top, when you shall find it (if you gently and carefully pour in more) to grow very protuberant and convex; the reason of which is plain, for that the solid sides of the containing body are no longer extended, to which the water does more readily adhere then the air; but it is henceforth to be included with air, which would reduce it into a hemisphere, but by reason of its gravity, it is flatted into an Oval. Quicksilver also which to Glass is more incongruous then Air (and thereby being put into a Glass-pipe, will not adhere to it, but by the more congruous air will be forced to have a very protuberant surface, and to rise higher in a greater then a lesser Pipe) this Quicksilver to clean Metal, especially to Gold, Silver, Tin, Lead, &c. Iron excepted, is more congruous then Air, and will not only stick to it, but have a concave Surface like water, and rise higher in a less, then in a greater Pipe.|$|E

On the basis of experimental researches results of vortex chamber superchargers the diagram comparison of achievable injector factors direct-flow jet devices and vortex chamber superchargers is plotted. Findings. It is received that the injector factor on a solid of vortex chamber supercharger surpasses four times achievable (theoretical) injector factor on a solid of the direct-flow jet device. Consequently, necessary pressure of an active flow considerably decreases, and the necessary (consumed) power brought to the device for supply of the set injector factor on a solid decreases.
