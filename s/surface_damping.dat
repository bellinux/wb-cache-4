40|$|The damping of hot giant dipole {{resonances}} is investigated. The {{contribution of}} surface scattering is {{compared with the}} contribution from interparticle collisions. A unified response function is presented which includes <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> as well as collisional damping. The <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> enters the response via the Lyapunov exponent and the collisional damping via the relaxation time. The former is calculated for different shape deformations of quadrupole and octupole type. The surface {{as well as the}} collisional contribution each reproduce almost the experimental value, therefore we propose a proper weighting between both contributions related to their relative occurrence due to collision frequencies between particles and of particles with the surface. We find that for low and high temperatures the collisional contribution dominates whereas the <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> is dominant around the temperatures √(3) / 2 π of the centroid energy.

It is of common conception that traditional potential theory overpredicts the gap elevation around resonance due to neglect of viscous effects. In this study we consider empirical formulas for skin friction, eddy damping and bilge keel damping, and include the effects by a free <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> model.

40|$|The Gilbert damping of {{ferromagnetic}} {{materials is}} arguably the most important but least understood phenomenological parameter that dictates real-time magnetization dynamics. Understanding the physical origin of the Gilbert damping is highly relevant to developing future fast switching spintronics devices such as magnetic sensors and magnetic random access memory. Here, we report an experimental study of temperature-dependent Gilbert damping in permalloy (Py) thin films of varying thicknesses by ferromagnetic resonance. From the thickness dependence, two independent contributions to the Gilbert damping are identified, namely bulk damping and <b>surface</b> <b>damping.</b> Of particular interest, bulk damping decreases monotonically as the temperature decreases, while <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> shows an enhancement peak at the temperature of ~ 50 K. These results provide an important insight to the physical origin of the Gilbert damping in ultrathin magnetic films. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure, Scientific Reports (In Press...|$|E

In the first part, floor, luggage, firewall and rear wheel panels {{of a car}} body-in-white are replaced with panels made of sandwich materials {{in order to reduce}} the weight. Final sandwich material configurations are obtained through a trial and error based optimization approach where weights of the panels are minimized while keeping bending stiffness performances of the panels same. In the second part, the use of sandwich materials in laminated steel form as light weight alternatives to free layer <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> treatments attached to floor panels is investigated. Free layer damping treatments are applied to body panels to decrease primarily the structure-borne noise inside the cabin. This effect is achieved by increasing structural damping in the panel structures. It has been demonstrated that, same level of vibration damping increase in a floor panel can be achieved using a sandwich material in laminated steel form with a lesser amount of weight addition to the original sheet metal floor panel compared to a free layer <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> treatment...|$|E

40|$|While sound {{absorption}} is an acoustic related property reasonably {{well known and}} currently used to characterize low noise <b>surfaces,</b> <b>damping</b> is a property commonly used in other domains to define the energy dissipation of a material but rarely used to characterize this important mechanism in road pavements.

Two of which are innovative and therefore expected to be low noise since they have high voids content, incorporate fine grading aggregates and expanded clay. Other two incorporate rubber and waste high-density polyethylene giving them an elastic and stiff behaviour respectively. The fifth is a conventional material, asphalt concrete, used for control.

40|$|International audienceThe {{modulation}} of air-sea heat fluxes by geostrophic eddies {{due to the}} stirring {{of temperature}} at the sea surface is discussed and quantified. It is argued that the damping of eddy temperature variance by such air-sea fluxes enhances the dissipation of surface temperature fields. Depending on the time scale of damping relative {{to that of the}} eddying motions, surface eddy diffusivities can be significantly enhanced over interior values. The issues are explored and quantified in a controlled setting by driving a tracer field, a proxy for sea surface temperature, with surface altimetric observations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) of the Southern Ocean. A new, tracer-based diagnostic of eddy diffusivity is introduced, which is related to the Nakamura effective diffusivity.

40|$|An {{electromechanical}} <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> (EMSD) {{technique is}} proposed. This technique combines two <b>surface</b> <b>damping</b> methods, the shunted piezoelectric-ceramic damping with the viscoelastic constrained layer damping (CLD). The damping {{contribution of the}} shunted piezoelectric intends to enhance the effective frequency range of the CLD. Piezoelectric ceramics provide similar damping characteristics to viscoelastic material when they are shunted with resonant electrical networks. A resonant shunting circuit provides the opportunity of tuning (shifting) the effective damping range of the piezoelectric into an arbitrary frequency, enhancing the damping at the vicinity of such frequency. Also, the EMSD technique proposes {{the use of a}} multiple resonant network to shunt the piezoelectric ceramic. This concept enhances simultaneously the effective damping range at the vicinity of multiple and selected frequencies. This thesis assesses the dynamic behavior of a simple structure under EMSD treatment and it studies the effectiveness of multiple tuning also. A cantilever beam-like structure is adopted as a case study and a typical oscillator with two resonant networks has been selected to shunt the piezoelectric-ceramic. A viscoelastic material is attached on the structure and constrained by the piezoelectric ceramic. The EMSD is tuned to two natural frequencies of the main structure and its effectiveness in suppressing two vibration peaks simultaneously is evaluated. This study provides insight into the use of shunting networks of higher order. The constitutive equations of the EMSD differential element are developed and a finite element solution is obtained.

40|$|AbstractA simple spring-mass {{model can}} {{provide insight into}} human running {{mechanics}} and help determine coping mechanisms for changes in running velocity, surface stiffness and surface height. However, previous research assumed that no energy was lost in each step even though most sports surfaces return {{only a fraction of}} the energy stored during the first half of impact according to their damping characteristics. When hopping on <b>damped</b> <b>surfaces,</b> humans were found to be more flexed during landing and more extended at take-off compared to undamped surfaces. This study investigated the use of this strategy during running. A spring-mass running model was developed in Matlab and analysed on a surface of fixed stiffness but variable damping. Using a range of running velocities (2 – 6 más- 1), leg spring stiffness’ (5 – 50 kNám- 1) and retraction angle (50 – 80 ¼), stable regions for a <b>surface</b> without <b>damping</b> were obtained. Damping was then introduced and the new stable regions and energy losses recorded. Leg spring lengths (and hence centre-of-mass heights) at touchdown were then modified and the extent to which this strategy compensated for the energy losses associated with damping was assessed. These results have provided a theoretical insight into the energetic costs of running on <b>damped</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In future work, these results will be compared to human running to determine how accurately the model reflects human coping strategies...|$|R
