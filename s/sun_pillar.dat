5000|$|It is {{hypothesized}} by New York University Egyptologist Patricia Blackwell Gary and Astronomy {{senior editor}} Richard Talcott that {{the shapes of}} the ancient Egyptian pyramid and obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god Ra being the Egyptians' greatest deity). [...] The pyramid and obelisk might have been inspired by previously overlooked astronomical phenomena connected with sunrise and sunset: the zodiacal light and <b>sun</b> <b>pillars</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|The Thirteen Towers of Chankillo (chanquillo) run {{north to}} south along a low ridge within a fourth-century BCE {{architectural}} complex in the Casmas valley in north coastal Peru. From hypothesized observing positions within nearby buildings {{to the west and}} east, the towers form an artificial, toothed horizon that roughly spans the annual rising and setting arcs of the Sun. The Chankillo towers are interpreted as marking positions of the apparent annual solar movement along the horizon, and as evidencing Sun cults, preceding the <b>Sun</b> <b>pillars</b> of Cusco by almost two millennia.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe are {{reporting}} a new simple optical element to generate halos. We have observed interesting patterns of light scattering in Plateau borders in foams. In analogy to the atmospheric phenomena known as parhelic circle, sun dogs, and <b>sun</b> <b>pillars,</b> we have named {{the features of}} the patterns observed as parlaseric circle, laser dogs, and laser pillars. The triangular symmetry of the Plateau borders is analogous to the hexagonal symmetry of ice crystals which produce these atmospheric phenomena. Working with one Plateau border at a time, we have observed wave optics phenomena that are not perceived in the atmospheric phenomena, such as diffraction and interference...|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: A [...] "false sunrise" [...] (in {{the form}} of a fragmentary upper <b>Sun</b> <b>pillar)</b> as seen near Bologna, Italy in October 2008. Note the [...] "lake-reflection" [...] effect which is not real because there is no water in between.|$|E
50|$|A light pillar, or <b>sun</b> <b>pillar,</b> {{appears as}} a {{vertical}} pillar or column of light rising from the sun near sunset or sunrise, though it can appear below the sun, particularly if the observer is at a high elevation or altitude. Hexagonal plate- and column-shaped ice crystals cause the phenomenon. Plate crystals generally cause pillars only {{when the sun is}} within 6 degrees of the horizon, or below it; column crystals can cause a pillar when the sun is as high as 20 degrees above the horizon. The crystals tend to orient themselves near-horizontally as they fall or float through the air, and the width and visibility of a <b>sun</b> <b>pillar</b> depend on crystal alignment.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{atmospheric}} conditions which may cause the effect, most commonly {{a type of}} halo, caused by the reflection and refraction of sunlight by small ice crystals in the atmosphere, often {{in the form of}} cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. Depending on which variety of [...] "false sunset" [...] is meant, the halo has to appear either above the sun (which itself is hidden below the horizon) or below it (in which case the real sun is obstructed from view, e.g. by clouds or other objects), making the upper and lower tangent arc, upper and lower <b>sun</b> <b>pillars</b> and the subsun the most likely candidates.|$|R

5000|$|The new Mustang GT {{was painted}} bright green with chrome {{on the front}} end. The {{interior}} featured seventeen monitors between the <b>pillars,</b> <b>sun</b> visors, dashboard, and head rests. In the trunk were three additional monitors, including a 20-inch monitor that could pop out, tilt, and spin around. This is a PMR record for most monitors installed (20 total).|$|R
5000|$|A type of ice crystal halo, such as {{an upper}} tangent arc or, more commonly, an upper <b>sun</b> <b>pillar</b> (similar to a subsun, but {{extending}} above the sun instead of below it). Like all halos, these phenomena are caused by the reflection and/or refraction of sunlight by ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere, often {{in the form of}} cirrus or cirrostratus clouds. The temperature on the ground is irrelevant to their occurrence, meaning that halos can be seen throughout the year and in all climates.|$|E
50|$|A {{light pillar}} is an {{atmospheric}} optical {{phenomenon in the}} form of a vertical band of light which appears to extend above and/or below a light source. The effect is created by the reflection of light from numerous tiny ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere or clouds. The light can come from the Sun (usually when it is near or even below the horizon) in which case the phenomenon is called a <b>sun</b> <b>pillar</b> or solar pillar. It can also come from the Moon or from terrestrial sources such as streetlights.|$|E
5000|$|The ice {{crystals}} {{responsible for a}} subsun are typically {{in the shape of}} flat hexagonal plates. As they fall through the air, their aerodynamic properties cause them to orient themselves horizontally, i.e., with their hexagonal surfaces parallel to the Earth's surface. When they are disturbed by turbulence, however, the plates start to [...] "wobble", causing their surfaces to deviate some degrees from the ideal horizontal orientation, and causing the reflection (i.e., the subsun) to become elongated vertically. When the deviation is sufficiently large, the subsun is stretched into a vertical column known as a lower <b>sun</b> <b>pillar.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{variants}} {{of the new}} Saga are fitted with all-round power windows and central locking. Additionally, the steering wheel is tilt-adjustable, while the driver's seat can be adjusted for height. The interior of the new Saga is all-black {{with the exception of}} the roof padding, <b>sun</b> visors and <b>pillar</b> covers. There are ten storage compartments, two cup holders and four bottle holders in total.|$|R
50|$|Diamond dust {{is often}} {{associated}} with halos, such as <b>sun</b> dogs, light <b>pillars,</b> etc. Like the ice crystals in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, diamond dust crystals form directly as simple hexagonal ice crystals — as opposed to freezing drops — and generally form slowly. This combination results in crystals with well defined shapes - usually either hexagonal plates or columns - which, like a prism, can reflect and/or refract light in specific directions.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had gone}} two or three miles, the Berbers, stating that they would bring the chief, left two of their party and {{vanished}} with the loaded camels among the stones. Kit rather thought the two who stopped were meant for guards. They carried long guns and {{refused to talk to}} the interpreter. After waiting for some time, Kit began to get disturbed. Since he had left some men on board the launch, his party was not large and carried no weapons but their long Spanish knives. Moreover the yellow haze round the <b>sun</b> and the <b>pillars</b> of sand that span about the wady indicated a dust storm not far off. If the wind freshened much, the launch could not ride in the surf. Kit resolved he would not stop long, and lighting a cigarette began to ponder.|$|R
50|$|This vine is a {{flowering}} plant that can {{grow up to}} 30 ft at a relatively fast rate. In {{the early stages of}} its development, the vines of Aristolochia macrophylla are very stiff and rigid, but as the plant develops, the vines become much more flexible and stable. This is because the plant is composed of sclerenchymatous cortical tissue, which has an outer cylinder, or layer, as well as an inner cylinder. Years of research showed that it is the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder that gives the stems of this plant its mechanical stability. This species flowers between the months of June and August in the U.S. with its seeds ripening in September and October. The large heart-shaped leaves can range between 6 - 12 in. These dark green leaves can overlap and cover an arbor or trellis. Plants {{can also be used to}} provide extensive covers for <b>pillars,</b> <b>sun</b> porches, fences, walls as well as other things.|$|R
50|$|Brahmanda Purana {{one of the}} {{eighteen}} sacred {{texts of}} Hinduism and written by Veda Vyasa contains a chapter called Navathirupathi Mahatmeeyam. The {{first part of the}} chapter refers to Srivaikuntam. Vaikunta Mahatmeeyam is another work in Sanskrit that glorifies the temple and is a part of Tamraparani Sthalapurana available only in palm manuscripts.The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th-9th century Vaishnava canon, by Nammazhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple is also classified as a Navatirupathi, the nine temples revered by Nammazhwar located in the banks of Tamiraparani river. The temple is next only to Alwarthirunagari Temple in terms of importance among the nine Navatirupathi temple. Nammazhwar makes a reference about the temple in his works in Thirvaimozhi. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar, Vaikuntha Pillai Tamil, Vaikuntanatha Thalattu, Vaikuntanatha Tiruppanimalai and Srivakiuntam Ammanai. Srivaikuntam temple is also called Kailasapuram and has a Nataraja shrine with eight artistically carved <b>pillars.</b> <b>Sun</b> rays fall directly on the image on two days of the year - once during uttarayana (April) and another during Dakshiyana (October), believed to be a token of worship. The roof over the sanctum is called Chandra vimana, where a stupa of gold is installed on the top. The temple also forms a series of Navagraha temples where each of the nine planetary deities of one of the temples of Navatirupathi. The temple is associated with the planet Surya, the Sun god.|$|R
60|$|From {{that day}} forth, whether I came or went, I {{was sure to}} find the Senora seated in the <b>sun</b> against a <b>pillar,</b> or {{stretched}} on a rug before the fire; only at times she would shift her station to the top round of the stone staircase, where she lay with the same nonchalance right across my path. In all these days, I never knew her to display the least spark of energy beyond what she expended in brushing and re-brushing her copious copper-coloured hair, or in lisping out, in the rich and broken hoarseness of her voice, her customary idle salutations to myself. These, I think, were her two chief pleasures, beyond that of mere quiescence. She seemed always proud of her remarks, {{as though they had}} been witticisms: and, indeed, though they were empty enough, like the conversation of many respectable persons, and turned on a very narrow range of subjects, they were never meaningless or incoherent; nay, they had a certain beauty of their own, breathing, as they did, of her entire contentment. Now she would speak of the warmth, in which (like her son) she greatly delighted; now of the flowers of the pomegranate trees, and now of the white doves and long-winged swallows that fanned the air of the court. The birds excited her. As they raked the eaves in their swift flight, or skimmed sidelong past her with a rush of wind, she would sometimes stir, and sit a little up, and seem to awaken from her doze of satisfaction. But {{for the rest of her}} days she lay luxuriously folded on herself and sunk in sloth and pleasure. Her invincible content at first annoyed me, but I came gradually to find repose in the spectacle, until at last it grew to be my habit to sit down beside her four times in the day, both coming and going, and to talk with her sleepily, I scarce knew of what. I had come to like her dull, almost animal neighbourhood; her beauty and her stupidity soothed and amused me. I began to find a kind of transcendental good sense in her remarks, and her unfathomable good nature moved me to admiration and envy. The liking was returned; she enjoyed my presence half-unconsciously, as a man in deep meditation may enjoy the babbling of a brook. I can scarce say she brightened when I came, for satisfaction was written on her face eternally, as on some foolish statue's; but I was made conscious of her pleasure by some more intimate communication than the sight. And one day, as I set within reach of her on the marble step, she suddenly shot forth one of her hands and patted mine. The thing was done, and she was back in her accustomed attitude, before my mind had received intelligence of the caress; and when I turned to look her in the face I could perceive no answerable sentiment. It was plain she attached no moment to the act, and I blamed myself for my own more uneasy consciousness.|$|R
