50|$|Receivers usually {{feature a}} <b>squelch</b> <b>circuit</b> {{to cut off}} the audio output from the {{receiver}} when there is no transmission to listen to. This is in contrast to broadcast receivers, which often dispense with this.|$|E
50|$|The SCR-300 was an 18-tube battery {{operated}} radio transceiver. It used an FM transmitter section and a double superheterodyne receiver. It incorporated a <b>squelch</b> <b>circuit,</b> an {{automatic frequency control}} circuit, and a crystal controlled calibration circuit.|$|E
50|$|If the inaudible radio {{frequency}} (RF) transmitter signal is inadvertently coupled into the receiver's audio signal path, it can trigger the AGC or <b>squelch</b> <b>circuit</b> {{to reduce the}} gain. Then, after a delay time set by the circuit's time constant, the circuit increases the gain again until the amplitude of the radio signal triggers another gain reduction. This repetitive cycle is heard as motorboating.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{equipment}} {{associated with}} radio transmitters, particularly transceivers in two way radios, such as Citizens band, FRS, which have {{automatic gain control}} (AGC) or squelch noise control. Malfunctions in the AGC or <b>squelch</b> <b>circuits,</b> which have long time constants, can cause low frequency oscillation. Another possible cause, sometimes {{in combination with the}} first, is leakage of the strong radio frequency (RF) signal from the transmitter into the receiver audio sections, which can cause quenching oscillations. This is a RFI problem, caused by inadequate shielding or filtering to keep the RF out.|$|R
50|$|In {{equipment}} that includes radio transmitters, motorboating {{can be caused}} by radio frequency interference (RFI), the strong radio signal from the transmitter getting into audio or receiver circuits. Receiver audio circuits with automatic gain control (AGC) have a long time constant feedback loop which adjusts the gain of the audio stage to compensate for differences in audio level from causes like different speaking voices. <b>Squelch</b> <b>circuits</b> used in two-way radios to cut out noise similarly have a feedback loop which turns off the audio when high frequency noise is detected.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, <b>squelch</b> is a <b>circuit</b> {{function}} that acts {{to suppress the}} audio (or video) output of a receiver {{in the absence of}} a sufficiently strong desired input signal. Squelch is widely used in two-way radios and radio scanners to suppress the sound of channel noise when the radio is not receiving a transmission. Squelch can be 'opened', which allows all signals entering the receiver to be heard. This can be useful when trying to hear distant, or otherwise weak signals (also known as DXing).|$|R
5000|$|For a receiver, the attack-time {{delay is}} defined as the time {{interval}} from the instant a step radio-frequency (RF) signal, at a level equal to the receiver's threshold of sensitivity, is applied to the receiver input, to the instant when the receiver's output amplitude reaches 90% of its steady-state value. If a <b>squelch</b> <b>circuit</b> is operating, the receiver attack-time delay includes the time for the receiver to break squelch.|$|E
5000|$|A typical FM {{two-way radio}} carrier <b>squelch</b> <b>circuit</b> is noise operated. It {{takes out the}} voice {{components}} of the receive audio by passing the detected audio through a high-pass filter. A typical filter might pass frequencies over 4,000 Hz (4 kHz). The squelch control adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of noise {{coming out of the}} filter. The audio output of the filter and amplifier is rectified and produces a DC voltage when noise is present. The presence of continuous noise on an idle channel creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage goes away and the receiver audio is unmuted. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio muting control voltage as a [...] "signal present" [...] indication, for example in a repeater the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter.|$|E
40|$|We {{fabricated}} {{and tested}} a <b>squelch</b> <b>circuit</b> {{consisting of a}} copper powder filter with an embedded Josephson junction connected to ground. For small signals (squelch ON), the small junction inductance attenuates strongly from dc to at least 1 GHz, while for higher frequencies dissipation in the copper powder increases the attenuation exponentially with frequency. For large signals (squelch OFF), the circuit behaves as a regular metal powder filter. The measured ON/OFF ratio is larger than 50 dB up to 50 MHz. This squelch can be applied in low temperature measurement and control circuitry for quantum nanostructures, such as superconducting qubits and quantum dots.
