5|$|Despite <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> success, the {{expedition}} of Boleslaw to Kiev in 1018 failed to establish Svyatopolk Vladimirovich (Boleslaw's son-in-law), Prince of Turov, on the Kievan throne. The Polish ruler did at least gain the Red Ruthenia (Czerwien Grody) very briefly, {{though that was}} recovered for the Ruthenians by Grand Prince Yaroslav and Mstislav Vladimirovich, Prince of Chernigov, in 1031.|$|E
5|$|In 597 {{the mission}} landed in Kent, and it quickly {{achieved}} <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> success: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury, where {{they used the}} church of St. Martin's for services, and this church became {{the seat of the}} bishopric. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597.|$|E

5|$|Mardonius also {{initiated}} hit-and-run cavalry {{attacks against}} the Greek lines, possibly trying to lure the Greeks down to the plain in pursuit. Although having <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> success, this strategy backfired when the Persian cavalry commander Masistius was killed; with his death, the cavalry retreated.|$|E
5|$|After <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for}} {{the repeal of the}} law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1960s, the carrier {{provided}} <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> aviation support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire topographic maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager. Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by , when the carrier ordered a second -320C.|$|E

5|$|As it tracked northward, {{the storm}} failed to {{organize}} at first, {{due to the}} influence of an upper-level low to its south. The circulation became broad and elongated, as well as removed from the deepest convection. However, after moving away from the low, the convection became better organized and more associated with the convection. After <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> slow organization continued, an area of deep convection developed over the center midday on September 20. An eye developed within the convection, and late on September 20 Jeanne re-attained hurricane status about 350mi (570km) east-northeast of the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run. There was <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> support to name it after Roy Chapin, the late president of the Hudson Motor Car Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. On April 23, 1946, the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford and president of the Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rebel}} forces {{advanced}} towards his enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed cause <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> confusion, but Bryennios (or, {{according to the}} Alexiad, his brother John, who commanded the right wing) rallied his men and led forth the second line. This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, they fell upon the Immortals, who also panicked and fled, abandoning their posts. Although they suffered some casualties from Bryennios's pursuing men, most managed to escape well {{to the rear of}} Alexios's army.|$|E

5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to {{ask him if he}} would consider coaching.|$|E
5|$|Berzelius made <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> characterisations {{of the new}} {{metal and}} its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{the capital}} of a chatellany (an {{administrative}} district) during the Middle Ages, serving as the administrative centre for an area comprising about fifty towns and villages. It {{was the site of}} a second battle that took place on 23 August 1328 involving Philip VI of France and a rebel force led by Nicolaas Zannekin. The rebels had driven the ruling Count Louis I out of Flanders and sought to press their advantage by occupying Cassel and attacking the French royal army nearby. Although they achieved <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> successes, the rebels were decisively defeated when William I, Count of Hainaut lent his support to the French side.|$|E
50|$|Folios 22-196 {{contain the}} Latin psalms {{written in a}} {{northern}} French script. A third illuminator painted the initial letters of each psalm. <b>Some</b> <b>initials</b> take up the entire side of a leaf, and are drawn with gold lettering on a purple background. They show influence from Italian and Islamic art, possibly suggesting that the artist was trained in Muslim-influenced southern Italy.|$|R

60|$|It was a small, olive-green book, delicately bound, {{and printed}} upon rough paper. It {{had been given}} to my mother, evidently, for her Christian name was inside, written in a fine, dashing hand, and {{underneath}} were <b>some</b> <b>initials</b> which had become indistinct. Then, having satisfied myself of this, and handled it for a few moments, I turned over the pages rapidly and began to read.|$|R
5|$|In 1560 {{the diplomat}} Nicholas Throckmorton {{advocated}} vehemently against Dudley marrying the Queen, but Dudley won him over in 1562. Throckmorton henceforth became his political advisor and intimate. After Throckmorton's death in 1571 there quickly evolved a political {{alliance between the}} Earl of Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham, soon to be Secretary of State. Together they worked for a militant Protestant foreign policy. There also existed a family relationship between them after Walsingham's daughter had married Philip Sidney, Leicester's favourite nephew. Leicester, after <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> jealousy, also became {{a good friend of}} Sir Christopher Hatton, himself one of Elizabeth's favourites.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 had {{a mostly}} {{positive}} reception, {{although it was}} criticized for problems with its controls. The game received <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> complaints of racism, but {{an investigation by the}} British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were unsubstantiated. Resident Evil 5 was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. As of June 2017 it has sold over 7.2 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling game and the best-selling game of the Resident Evil franchise. A special edition of the game, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, has sold an additional 2.3 million units. A sequel, Resident Evil 6, was released in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The 6th century {{marked the}} rebirth of Roman naval power. In 508, as {{antagonism}} with the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Theodoric flared up, the Emperor Anastasius I (491–518) {{is reported to have}} sent a fleet of 100 warships to raid the coasts of Italy. In 513, the general Vitalian revolted against Anastasius. The rebels assembled a fleet of 200 ships which, despite <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> successes, were destroyed by admiral Marinus, who employed a sulphur-based incendiary substance to defeat them.|$|E

Because she was an impediment to the work of extension of the military harbour (which was now a full military complex with anti-atomic bunkers), Bretagne ultimately was salvaged from 1952 to 1954. The hull was cut into big parts, which were raised and scrapped ashore.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, {{there were so many}} aircraft piling up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area Gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} an early {{reputation as a}} prolific schoolboy batsman, Jardine played cricket for Winchester College, attended the University of Oxford, playing for its cricket team, and played for Surrey County Cricket Club as an amateur. He developed a defensive method of batting which was unusual for an amateur, receiving occasional criticism for negative batting. Despite this, Jardine was selected in Test matches {{for the first time}} in 1928, and went on to play with some success in the Test series in Australia in 1928–29. Following this tour, his business commitments prevented him from playing as much cricket. However, in 1931, he was asked to captain England in a Test against New Zealand. Although there were <b>some</b> <b>initial</b> misgivings about his captaincy, Jardine led England in the next three cricket seasons and on two overseas tours, one of which was the Australian tour of 1932–33. Of his 15 Tests as captain, he won nine, lost one and drew five. He retired from all first-class cricket in 1934 following a tour to India.|$|E

Li addressed some of the criticisms of Karlgren's system, revising <b>some</b> <b>initials</b> and distinguishing finals that Karlgren had combined. Although Karlgren's view of Middle Chinese as a single spoken variety is no longer widely held, his transcription, as revised by Li, is still widely used as a notation for the Qieyun categories.|$|R
