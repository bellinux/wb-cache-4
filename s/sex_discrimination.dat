40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{two major}} {{purposes}} of this study were: (1) to test the assumption that the IT Scale for Children (standard-ITSC) {{can be used as a}} measure of both appropriate <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> and <b>sex</b> role preference with preschool aged children, and (2) to extend previous studies in these areas by analyzing the relationship between <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> and preference, and a variety of variables shown to be important in understanding sex role development in, young children. These variables included such characteristics as sex, age, IQ,' preschool program involvement and sibling status. In attempting to test the assumption regarding the adequacy of the standard-ITSC as a measure of both appropriate <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> and <b>sex</b> role perference, all subjects were administered the ITSC three times; once using the standard-ITSC with the sex of the IT figure not designated, once using a modified-ITSC with the IT figure replaced by a clear drawing of a little boy, and once using a modified- ITSC with the IT figure replaced by a clear drawing of a little girl. The subjects of the present study were 38 children attending two preschool programs established by the Department of Family Life at Oregon State University. Essentially, subjects in these two preschool programs represented matched pairs based on the variables of age, sex, ordinal position, age of parents, length of parents' marriage, number of children in the family, religion and socioeconomic status of the family. The instruments used to collect the data for the present study included the standard-ITSC and a modified-ITSC which was specifically designed for this study. The standard -'ITSC was used as a measure of sex role preference, while the modified-ITSC was used as a measure of <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination.</b> The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was used to estimate the subjects' IQ scores. The analysis of variance approach was used to test three null hypotheses concerning the subjects' own <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination,</b> opposite <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> and <b>sex</b> role preference scores. The paired-difference test was used to test two additional null hypotheses related to comparisons of the subjects' <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> and <b>sex</b> role preference scores. The test of Hypothesis I, dealing with own <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> scores, revealed. a significant interaction effect for sex X preschool program, and indicated that subjects with same-sex teachers were slightly better than subjects with opposite-sex teachers, in their ability to make own <b>sex</b> role <b>discriminations.</b> The findings associated with the tests of opposite <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> scores indicated that: (1) whether the subjects were grouped by sex or sex x age, girls were significantly better than boys in their ability to make opposite <b>sex</b> role <b>discriminations,</b> (2) while older girls were better than younger girls in their opposite <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> scores, the reverse was true for boys, and (3) older and younger girls differed in their ability to make opposite <b>sex</b> role <b>discriminations</b> to a greater degree than did older and younger boys. The test of Hypothesis III, dealing with sex role preference scores, was perhaps the most productive of those in this group, in that three of the four main effects yielded significance, as did three of the sex interaction effects. Tests of the main effects indicated that boys, older subjects, and subjects with male teachers had significantly more appropriate sex role preference scores than did their opposite in these groupings. In addition, the significant interaction terms suggest the following: (1) whether the subjects were grouped by sex X age, IQ or preschool program, boys tended to have more appropriate sex role preference scores than girls, (2) while older boys tended to have more appropriate sex role preference scores than younger boys, this was not noticeable for girls, (3) while average girls tended to have more appropriate sex role preference scores than rapid girls, there was only a minor difference between rapid and average boys, and (4) while boys with same-sex teachers had more appropriate sex role preference scores than boys with opposite-sex teachers, girls with same- or opposite-sex teachers did not differ appreciably from each other. Results of the paired-difference test as applied to the two additional hypotheses in this study indicated that whether the subjects were grouped by sex, age, IQ, preschool program or sibling status: (1) replacing the IT figure with a clear drawing of a boy in testing, resulted in significantly higher, more masculine mean scores, and (2) replacing the IT figure with a clear drawing of a girl in testing, resulted in significantly lower, more feminine mean scores. It was concluded that collectively these findings did little to resolve the controversy concerning the use of the standard-ITSC as a measure of both <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> and preference with preschool aged children. It appears that the findings could be used with equal facility to support and to question this assumption. Attempts were made to relate all specific findings to both theoretical positions and existing research findings in the area of <b>sex</b> role <b>discrimination</b> and preference in preschool aged children. Because of the complexity of the data and the analysis, definitive conclusions regarding the implications of the findings were not possible. In general, however, the results support the multi-dimensional nature of sex role development in young children and strongly document the need for future researchers to include additional child and environmental variables in their studies. Possible interpretations of the findings and trends in the data were discussed, and sections dealing with limitations of the study and suggestions for future research were presented...|$|R

5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize same-sex marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After a Maryland House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage to voters and invalidated same-sex marriages performed in another state or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine same-sex couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning specialist at Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. The plaintiffs had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the state's statutory ban on same-sex marriage violated constitutional protections of due process, equality, and prohibitions against <b>sex</b> <b>discrimination</b> in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s Cornish mines faced {{competition}} from cheap metal imports, and legislation {{introduced in the}} 1870s limited the use of child labour. The Cornish mining system went into terminal decline, leading to a collapse of the local economy and mass emigration both overseas and {{to other parts of}} the United Kingdom. In 1891 the number of bal maidens had fallen to half its peak, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few remained in employment. In 1921 Dolcoath mine, the last employer of bal maidens, ceased operations, bringing the tradition to an end. Other than women recruited for ore processing at Geevor as a result of labour shortages during the Second World War, and a very limited number of female workers after the <b>Sex</b> <b>Discrimination</b> Act 1975 banned the practice of recruiting only male mineworkers, women never again performed manual labour in Cornish mines. The last surviving bal maiden died in 1968, and with the closure of South Crofty tin mine in 1998, Cornish metals mining came to an end.|$|E

If there is any ambiguity other sensory cues are used to resolve it, suggesting there may exist sex-detectors that are stimulus independent...|$|R

5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the <b>Sex</b> <b>Discrimination</b> Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E

In Drosophila melanogaster, contact pheromones differ between male and female in their content and in their effects on male courtship, both inhibitory and stimulatory. To investigate the genetic basis of <b>sex</b> pheromone <b>discrimination,</b> we experimentally selected males showing either a higher or lower ability to discriminate sex pheromones over 20 generations. This experimental selection was carried out in parallel on two different genetic backgrounds: wild-type and desat 1 mutant, in which parental males showed high and low <b>sex</b> pheromone <b>discrimination</b> ability respectively. Male perception of male and female pheromones was separately affected during the process of selection. A comparison of transcriptomic activity between high and low discrimination lines revealed genes not only that varied according to the starting genetic background, but varied reciprocally. Mutants in two of these genes, Shaker and quick-to-court, were capable of producing similar effects on discrimination on their own, in some instances mimicking the selected lines, in others not. This suggests that <b>discrimination</b> of <b>sex</b> pheromones depends on genes whose activity is sensitive to genetic context and provides a rare, genetically defined example of the phenomenon known as "allele flips," in which interactions have reciprocal effects on different genetic backgrounds...|$|R
