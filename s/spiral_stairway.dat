5|$|The {{tower is}} {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a Doric column. It is divided into four stories with a <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway,</b> and topped by a gallery carrying the lantern. The keeper's cottages are three one story cottages, sharing a roof. Other structures which still stand at the location are a circa 1930 privy and workshop built in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower is}} a massive {{cylindrical}} structure, of 19m high—including the lantern—by a 2.5m inside diameter. It terminates in rectangular bracket-supporters for the cement circular gallery and cast-iron balustrade that encloses the cast-iron, copper, and glass 3rd order lantern. A cast-iron <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway</b> also led to the lantern that had vertical bars.|$|E
25|$|The main {{structure}} consists of thirteen transverse buttress-walls, pierced by three superimposed brick arches, which create twelve compartments, each 9–13 m wide. The two lengthwise walls are not parallel, but steadily move apart {{as they go}} north. The eastern wall features a pair of superposed corridors on its upper two levels, built inside the wall's body and lit by loopholes in the wall's façades. The basement-level compartments have no windows, but the upper levels are lit through small openings in the western wall. A <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway</b> tower connects the {{main structure}} with the two towers.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the centuries}} a massive {{honeycomb}} of caverns and passageways {{has been created}} beneath Naples and its environs. In World War II many of the quarry shafts were enlarged and <b>spiraling</b> <b>stairways</b> were added, opening up the caverns for use as air raid shelters.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the tower is divided by iron floors and <b>spiral</b> <b>stairways</b> into four stories. The ground floor was originally used for oil store, and it now houses the light equipment, including a generator. Access to the tower was originally through the ramped stone steps on the north, entering the first floor. This entrance was since sealed, and a steel door on the ground level is now used.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} triumphal columns in the {{imperial}} cities of Rome and Constantinople, other types of buildings such as temples, thermae, basilicas and tombs were also fitted with <b>spiral</b> <b>stairways.</b> Their notable absence in the towers of the Aurelian Wall indicates that although used in medieval castles, they did not yet figure prominently in Roman military engineering. By late antiquity, separate stair towers were constructed adjacent to the main buildings, as in the Basilica of San Vitale.|$|R

A unique {{part of this}} palace is an {{exclusive}} bath room of the Rajas, which is an octagonal stone structure that adjoins the Phool Bagh Palace. The structure is [...] in height built with stones and has a <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway</b> {{which leads to the}} water tank at the top that is fed by pumping water from a nearby well.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "the City of Spires", Copenhagen {{is known for its}} horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway</b> that visitors can climb to the top. Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the [...] "dragon spire" [...] of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.|$|E
500|$|When finished, the {{monument}} complete with its statue {{rose to a}} height of [...] The four sides of the pedestal were engraved with the names and dates of Nelson's greatest victories. A <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway</b> of 168 steps ascended the hollow interior of the column, to a viewing platform immediately beneath the statue. According to the committee's [...] published report, [...] of black limestone [...] and [...] of granite {{had been used to}} build the column and its pedestal. The Pillar opened to the public on 21 October 1809, on the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar; for ten pre-decimal pence, visitors could climb to a viewing platform just below the statue, and enjoy what an early report describes as [...] "a superb panoramic view of the city, the country and the fine bay".|$|E

500|$|St Helen's Church has {{a maximum}} length of [...] and is aligned at 25° north of east. The {{majority}} of English churches have an alignment {{within a few}} degrees of east, {{so this is an}} exceptionally large deviation from the norm. The sandstone church has a large, mainly 15th-century west tower supported by corner buttresses and topped with battlements and pinnacles. The tower has a four-light window and west doorway, and contains a <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway</b> to the bell and clock chambers and the roof. The chancel is adjoined by the former north chapel (now the vestry) {{on one side and the}} Hastings Chapel, set transept-wise on the other; it has three sedilia and a piscina on its northern wall. The nave is significantly wider than it is long, and has four bays with medieval inner north and south aisles and 19th-century outer aisles. The Hastings Chapel, chancel and clerestory are embattled, and the former north chapel is English Perpendicular, with a window of the same style. The piers in the nave were remodelled in the 15th century, and have incised panels, as do some of the arches. This feature is of an unusual style and is also seen at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset and at St Peter and St Paul, Syston, Leicestershire.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] high {{ruins of}} a 3-storey castle that stands {{on the eastern side}} of the island was built in the late 1500s by the Hamilton Family to protect the island from King Philip II of Spain. The island was used as a prison during the 18th and 19th centuries. The castle has two vaulted storeys and an oven is located in a cellar with {{evidence}} of a <b>spiral</b> <b>stairway</b> that once ran to the top of the tower. Three cinquefoils arranged in a 'V' shape are carved on the tower and indicate that the Hamiltons were linked with the structure. There are indications of an adjoining building that ran to the north.|$|E

The Bottle stood 64 feet (19.5 m) tall, and measured forty-nine feet (14.94 m) in diameter at the base, and 16 feet (4.88 m) at the cap. The ground floor was a grocery store and service station, and {{the second and third}} floors were living quarters and storage. The neck of the Bottle had windows so as to be used as an observation tower. The [...] "bottle cap" [...] was the roof.

In his Spiral Gallery in Jiading New Town, completed in 2011, “pure round is inserted by a spiral, brings into a primal space with a spiral interior flowing from the public to the private; most importantly, it gives a way to enter the building from the landscape: you can enter the annular interior space directly, or walk along the <b>spiral</b> external <b>stairway</b> to first get onto the higher place of the rooftop, and then go downstairs to the central courtyard to enter the building. The plot, angle and height of the view are continuously transformed, the spatial height is changed, and the introverted and open spaces are being mutually altered by the walking direction as well. A cruise joy is provided, which also {{can be seen as}} an abstract way of the Chinese garden. Here, the way to view is also the way to enter the building”.|$|R
50|$|By the 19th {{century the}} Greek Catholic Church {{established}} {{a strong and}} stable position in the Habsburg Monarchy. The only thing that shattered its unity was the rising of nationalism. Hungarian speaking Greek Catholics still couldn't use their mother tongue in their holy services, so they started to raise their voice for the Hungarian liturgy. This movement was started by Hungarian translations of religious texts, sermons and songs; and later peaked with the so-called Hajdúdorog Movement. In 1821 the town council of Hajdúdorog abolished the Romanian parish and its services, {{because the majority of}} the town spoke Hungarian. Thus the only Greek Catholic parish that remained, served in Church Slavonic language. The lieutenant of Hajdúdorog, that time the leader of the town, named Lajos Farkas started a nationwide movement for the papal acknowledgement of the Hungarian language in Greek Catholic liturgy. Farkas' initiative spread quickly in the country among the Hungarian speaking Greek Catholics. The case got influential supporters from the upper house of the parliament and from the government too, though their purpose was more political than religious. Erecting a Hungarian Greek Catholic diocese was handy for the central government's Magyarization efforts. A Greek Catholic synod was held in the church of Hajdúdorog on 16 April 1868 that marked the start of the Movement of Hajdúdorog. Due to the decisions of the synod Emperor Franz Joseph erected the Vicariate Forane of Hajdúdorog {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Eparchy of Munkács.To commemorate and to celebrate the success of the synod, the town decided to renovate and extend the church. The constructions started in the summer of 1868. The Northern and Southern walls of the original church were opened with large arches, and two naves were attached to the baroque building on both sides. These side naves, or aisles, were constructed to hold a gallery accessible by <b>spiral</b> <b>stairways</b> from outside of the church. A gallery was created on the Western side too allowing access from the bell tower of the church. The church received its present form by the end of the renovation works in 1876. The simple Greek Catholic church was transformed to a three naves basilica. The outside appearance of the building went through major changes too. The church lost its original baroque ornaments, it was replaced by eclectic elements, and the bell tower got larger windows.|$|R
