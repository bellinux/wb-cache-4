50|$|Important {{investment}} {{plans were}} developed by the AOMC in 1995. One plan involved {{the construction of a}} large maintenance workshop and <b>stockholding</b> facility.

Space is also available on the site for expansion in the future should this be required. In 2006 the TPC commenced a programme of building works at Aigle in collaboration with the CFF/SBB/FFS. This was to bring together all three of the metre gauge lines at new platforms adjacent to those of the main line company. Work was completed in early 2007 when the services were brought together; the AOCM making use of the two platforms nearest the main line.

5000|$|Browne {{travelled}} to South Australia {{as assistant}} surgeon {{in the ship}} Buckinghamshire, arriving on 5 December 1835. Although registered to practise medicine in South Australia, he turned to agricultural pursuits on land he purchased at Pewsey Vale with Joseph Gilbert. His brother Joseph Gilbert Browne and sister Anna (1812-1873) arrived in 1840 and together they ran a leasehold property at Lyndoch, then Booboorowie, steadily increasing their <b>stockholding.</b> Apart from huge tracts of land they leased or squatted on, they purchased significant properties: Buckland Park in 1856, [...] "Moorak" [...] at Mount Gambier in 1862 and Booboorowie in 1863. The partnership was dissolved around 1865. At one stage they were South Australia's largest producers of wool. As a pastoralist he did valuable work in experimenting with grasses and fodder plants, and with fine wools from crossbred Lincoln and Merino sheep. Among station properties which Dr. Browne held were Mikkira, Booboorowie, Spring Vale (or Springvale) Station near Katherine, managed by Alfred Giles and Delamere. A. T. Woods was his agent who managed the forward party in 1879, then in 1880 Giles and his brother Arthur, with H. Pinder, Hart, Needham, Martin, C. Lees, T. Pearce and others, drove 6000 head of cattle, 300 horses and 14,000 sheep from Adelaide, when, despite their undoubted expertise, 6000 of the sheep perished.

40|$|Public <b>stockholding</b> {{for food}} {{security}} purposes refers to state acquisition of foodstocks {{in support of}} food security objectives. Public <b>stockholding</b> for food security purposes in developing countries returned to WTO agenda {{in the wake of}} the 2007 / 2008 and 2010 / 2011 food crises. During the WTO Ministerial Meeting at Bali in 2014, a group of developing countries (known as the G- 33) proposed that disciplines on <b>stockholding</b> be relaxed to allow them to acquire large foodstocks in anticipation of future crises. They contended that <b>stockholding</b> was necessary because exporting countries often restrict food exports in times of crisis, which consequently affect importing countries’ food security. Food exporting countries, on the other hand, opposed the policy arguing that it could lead to increased subsidies to producers of importing countries and, consequently distort trade. Due to the absence of consensus, a Pease Clause was introduced to temporarily restrain member countries from challenging <b>stockholding</b> activities until a permanent solution is reached. This thesis assessed three issues relating to WTO trade policy, food security and public <b>stockholding</b> in developing countries. The first paper, presented in Chapter 2, assesses the need for public <b>stockholding</b> in developing countries. In this paper, the research estimates the speed at which markets respond to restore consumption distortions in developing countries. This speed is referred to as market response to consumption shocks. Low responses implies that food security cannot be guaranteed by relying on the international market. Hence, <b>stockholding</b> to support consumption can be legitimate food security policy in these countries. The research is applied to wheat, corn and rice due to their importance in the food security of developing countries. The results shows that markets generally fail to restore close to 60 percent of the consumption distortions, following a shock, in developing countries. This poses a risk to food security without public <b>stockholding.</b> Hence, the study concludes that <b>stockholding</b> will be a legitimate policy to consider in these countries. The second paper, presented in Chapter 3, also assesses the need for public <b>stockholding</b> for food security purposes in developing countries. However, the research investigates whether or not the current de minimis WTO rules on public <b>stockholding</b> constitute a restriction to food security in developing countries. The research posits that the proposal to relax <b>stockholding</b> policy will be justified if current regulations constitute a restriction to achieving food security. The research is applied to wheat, corn and rice. To analyse this question, optimal public stocks required to achieving food security are compared with WTO allowable public stocks. The policy is restrictive if optimal public stocks is more than stock levels permitted under the WTO. The results found the de minimis policy to be substantially restrictive across some developing countries especially those which demonstrate a high food security risk. Hence, expanding <b>stockholding</b> policy for these category of countries should be considered. The third paper, presented in Chapter 4, examines the potential impact of <b>stockholding</b> on trade. <b>Stockholding</b> has two important activities that can affect trade: stock acquisition and stock disposal. While stock acquisition can increase trade, the disposal of accumulated stocks from <b>stockholding</b> programs in importing countries could lead to significant trade losses for exporting countries. Food exporting countries are particularly against <b>stockholding</b> programs policy due to these potential negative impacts on their markets. In this paper, a potential public storage policy aimed at meeting 6 -months of domestic consumption is applied to rice, corn and wheat in order to gain insights into the impact of the proposed <b>stockholding</b> policies on trade. The research seeks to estimate the maximum impact on trade that can arise as a result of stock disposal and stock acquisition. The results suggest that stock disposal could significantly decrease trade by more than 35 percent. Where stock acquisition does lead to increased trade, the overall negative impact of the policies will be relatively low. Moreover, the impacts on trade are relatively small when the policy is considered for small consumption countries. Thus, <b>stockholding</b> policy can be considered for small countries faced with considerable food security risk without generating significant trade impacts. In conclusion, the study suggests that <b>stockholding</b> policies can be legitimate for small countries faced with considerable food security risk. Large consumption countries seeking to implement <b>stockholding</b> policies must establish appropriate compensation schemes to minimise their policies impact on affected countries...|$|E
