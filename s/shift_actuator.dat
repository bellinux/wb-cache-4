This article presents the design, analysis, and control of a two-speed automatic mechanical transmission for pure electric vehicles. The <b>shift</b> <b>actuator</b> {{is based on a}} motor-controlled camshaft where a special geometric groove is machined, and the camshaft realizes the axial positions of the synchronizer sleeve for gear engaging, disengaging, and speed control of the drive motor. Based on the force analysis of shift process, the parameters of <b>shift</b> <b>actuator</b> and shift motor are designed. The drive motor’s torque control strategy before shifting, speed governing control strategy before engaging, shift actuator’s control strategy during gear engaging, and drive motor’s torque recovery strategy after shift process are proposed and implemented with a prototype. To validate the performance of the two-speed gearbox, a test bed was developed based on dSPACE that emulates various operation conditions. The experimental results indicate that the shift process with the proposed <b>shift</b> <b>actuator</b> and control strategy could be accomplished within 1 [*]s under various operation conditions, with shift smoothness up to passenger car standard...|$|E

40|$|Accurate, {{fast and}} high {{precision}} tool guidance {{is an important}} capability for certain field operations such as mechanical weed control close to crop plants. This paper presents mathematical modelling and instrumentation suggestions for actuator driven tine control for close to crop mechanical weed control. An electro side <b>shifting</b> <b>actuator</b> for tool attachment was designed in AutoCAD and validated by modelling in MatLab/Simulink. Variations to load force, forward speed, plant spacing and voltage level similar to real conditions were used to verify the modelling of the side shifting system. The simulation verified that the selected permanent magnet tubular linear synchronous motor (PMTLSM) could side shift attached tools without interaction with the desired untreated zone around individual crop plants under field comparable conditions. This paper also presents a direct thrust force control (DTFC) approach for controlling the PMTLSM. The tool guidance design, selected PMTLSM and control strategy showed the potential for further construction into a novel implement for high accurate and fast intra-row mechanical and/or physical weed control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT), in theory, has an unlimited {{number of gear ratios}} between the highest and lowest settings. But most CVTs are complex, expensive, have poor efficiencies, and aren't scalable. A new type of CVT, CONTINUOSLY VARIABLE PLANETARY TRANSMISSION(CVPT),combines toroidaltraction CVT with the versatility of the planetary gear arrangement to create a low-cost, highly efficient drive for human-powered and motorized vehicles. While the CVPT uses rolling traction to distribute torque like toroidal CVTs, it distributes the transmitted torque over several spheres in an inherently stable configuration. The rotating balls between the input and output section of the CVT tilt to vary transmission speed. As the balls tilt, they change their contact diameters to vary the speed ratio. This lowers contact pressures and improves durability, stability, and torque density. And since it uses a planetary arrangement, torque can be summed or divided. In the present work, a CVPT has been mounted to a bicycle for conducting the experiments. Normally tilting of spheres for changing gear ratios is done manually, however in our case, this has been obtained automatically. For automated shifting, a <b>shift</b> <b>actuator,</b> a controller and a battery to power this circuit is used. Also, results have been obtained with speed variations of a bicycle with and without CVPT. Graphs are plotted using the obtained results and analysed...|$|E
50|$|The car used {{a custom}} {{designed}} electronic <b>shifting</b> <b>actuator</b> {{made from a}} standard RC car motor and a planetary gear box from a power drill. While the actuator was very powerful, the system required an electronic controller because the motor could not be turned {{on for more than}} a quarter second without damaging the brushes or windings. The overall actuator weight was around 1.2 lbs. There were positive and negative results of the system. With new brushes in the motor and proper tweaking it was capable of very fast shifts (~15 ms), and was able to perform very well for automatic up-shifting during acceleration runs. However, the brushed motor was unreliable in this implementation (very low rev, turning only a few turns at a time, commonly stalled), which meant that the motor required constant tinkering. Further problems included the use of 1st gear on this car which led to frequent neutral-out conditions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The novel {{concept of}} Trans-abdominal Active Magnetic Linkage for laparoendoscopic single site surgery has the {{potential}} to enable the deployment of a bimanual robotic platform trough a single laparoscopic incision. The main advantage of this approach consists in <b>shifting</b> the <b>actuators</b> outside the body of the patient, while transmitting a controlled robotic motion by magnetic field across the abdomen without the need for dedicated incisions. An actuation mechanism based on this approach can be comprised of multiple anchoring and actuation units, mixed depending upon the specific needs. A static model providing anchoring and actuation forces and torques available at the internal side of the magnetic link was developed to provide a tool to navigate among the many possibilities of such an open ended design approach. The model was assessed through bench top experiments, showing a maximum relative error of 4 % on force predictions. An example of a single degree of freedom manipulator actuated with the proposed concept and compatible with a 12 -mm access port is able to provide an anchoring force of 3. 82 N and an actuation force of 2. 95 N.

40|$|Heavy duty powertrains {{are complex}} systems with {{components}} from various domains, different response times during transient operations and different efficient operating ranges. To ensure efficient transient {{operation of a}} powertrain, e. g. with low fuel consumption or short transient duration, {{it is important to}} come up with proper control strategies. In this dissertation, optimal control theory is used to calculate and analyze efficient heavy duty powertrain controls during transient operations in different applications. This is enabled by first developing control ready models, usable for multi-phase optimal control problem formulations, and then using numerical optimal control methods to calculate the optimal transients. Optimal control analysis of a wheel loader operating in a repetitive loading cycle is the first studied application. Increasing fuel efficiency or reducing the operation time in such repetitive loading cycles sums up to large savings over longer periods of time. Load lifting and vehicle traction consume almost all of the power produced by a diesel engine during wheel loader operation. Physical models are developed for these subsystems where the dynamics are described by differential equations. The model parameters are tuned and fuel consumption estimation is validated against measured values from real wheel loader operation. The sensitivity of wheel loader trajectory with respect to constrains such as the angle at which the wheel loader reaches the unloading position is also analyzed. A time and fuel optimal trajectory map is calculated for various unloading positions. Moreover, the importance of simultaneous optimization of wheel loader trajectory and the component transients is shown via a side to side comparison between measured fuel consumption and trajectories versus optimal control results. In another application, optimal control is used to calculate efficient gear shift controls for a heavy duty Automatic Transmission system. A modeling and optimal control framework is developed for a nine speed automatic transmission. Solving optimal control problems using the developed model, time and jerk efficient transient for simultaneous disengagement of off-going and engagement of in-coming <b>shift</b> <b>actuators</b> are obtained and the results are analyzed. Optimal controls of a diesel-electric powertrain during a gear shift in an Automated Manual Transmission system are calculated and analyzed in another application of optimal control. The powertrain model is extended by including driveline backlash angle as an extra state in the system. This is enabled by implementation of smoothing techniques in order to describe backlash dynamics as a single continuous function during all gear shift phases. Optimal controls are also calculated for a diesel-electric powertrain corresponding to a hybrid bus during a tip-in maneuver. It is shown that for optimal control analysis of complex powertrain systems, minimizing only one property such as time pushes the system transients into extreme operating conditions far from what is achievable in real applications. Multi-objective optimal control problem formulations are suggested in order to obtain a compromise between various objectives when analyzing such complex powertrain systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{piezoelectric}} actuator is {{a voltage}} spring system that behaves in similar characteristic to mechanical mass spring system. It converts electrical signal to physical displacement. The displacements {{profile of the}} piezoelectric <b>actuator</b> <b>shifts</b> due to hysteresis and creep during actuation. Numerous equations were used to describe model of actuator in the past.

A high resolution microscope together with the image processing technique was used to obtain the system characteristics. Simulation using Matlab Simulink was use to validate the experiment.

A mass screening of women for breast cancer is essential, as the early diagnosis of the tumour allows best treatment outcomes. A mm-wave UWB radar could be an innovative solution to achieve the high imaging resolution required without risks for the patient. The 20 – 40 [*]GHz frequency band used in the system proposed in this work guarantees high cross/range resolution performances. The developed preliminary architecture employs two monomodal truncated double-ridge waveguides that act as antennas; these radiators are <b>shifted</b> by microstep <b>actuators</b> to form a synthetic linear aperture. The minimum antenna-to-antenna distance achievable, {{the width of the}} synthetic aperture, and the minimum frequency step determine the performance of the 2 D imaging system. Measures are performed with a mm-wave vector network analyzer driven by an automatic routine, which controls also the antennas shifts. The scattering matrix is then calibrated and the delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS) algorithm is applied to elaborate a high-resolution 2 D image of the targets. Experimental results show that 3 [*]mm cross and 8 [*]mm range resolutions were achieved, which is in line with theoretical expectations and promising for future developments...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to design and test a new piezoelectric device {{that can be used for}} viscoelasticity measurement with time as a Point of Care (POC) test. Slow turnaround times (TAT) of current methods to monitor blood viscoelastic changes in patients have led to excessive bleeding and the need for blood transfusions in many situations (Despotis et al, 1997).

40|$|ABSTRACT: High-field {{theoretical}} and experimental analysis of piezoelectric and magneto-strictive actuators is presented. First, {{the analysis of}} a piezoelectric stack actuator (PiezoSystems Jena PAHL 120 / 20) is described. A theoretical model based on the linear theory of piezoelectricity is developed. Extensive experiments were conducted, aimed at low-frequency dynamic electro-mechanical behavior characterization. Curve fitting procedures are used to adjust the model coefficients for various load levels. Through comparison with experimental data, the model is adjusted to include nonlinear terms related to higher losses on the unloading cycle. Second, the impedance analysis of a magnetostrictive actuator (Etrema AA 140 J 025) is described. Linear piezomagnetism is assumed, as an approximation to nonlinear magnetostrictive behavior about a bias point. Low-field and high-field impedance measurements were performed, revealing left <b>shifting</b> of the <b>actuator</b> resonance as the power is increased. Model tuning of the impedance model on the experimental data showed material parameters trends similar with those reported in the literature. Although the numerical values developed during this phenomenological study are particular for the actuators under consideration, the characterization approach can be extended to analysis of other actuators of this type.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a submillimeter-wave 500 – 550 -GHz MEMS-reconfigurable phase shifter, {{which is based}} on loading a micromachined rectangular waveguide with 9 E-plane stubs. The phase shifter uses MEMS-reconfigurable surfaces to individually block/unblock the E-plane stubs from the micromachined waveguide. Each MEMS-reconfigurable surface is designed so that in the nonblocking state, it allows the electromagnetic wave to pass freely through it into the stub, while in the blocking state, it serves as the roof of the main waveguide and blocks the wave propagation into the stub. The phase-shifter design comprises three micromachined chips that are mounted in the H-plane cuts of the rectangular waveguide. Experimental results of the first device prototypes show that the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) -reconfigurable phase shifter has a linear phase shift of 20 ° in ten discrete steps (3. 3 bits). The measured insertion loss is better than 3  dB, of which only 0. 5 – 1. 5  dB is attributed to the MEMS surfaces and switched stubs, and the measured return loss is better than 15  dB in the design frequency band of 500 – 550  GHz. It is also shown that the major part of the insertion loss is attributed to misalignment and assembly uncertainties of the micromachined chips and the waveguide flanges, shown by simulations and reproducibility measurements. The MEMS-reconfigurable phase shifter is also operated in an analog tuning mode for high phase resolution. Furthermore, a detailed study has been carried out identifying the reason for the discrepancy between the simulated (90 °) and the measured (20 °) phase <b>shift.</b> Comb-drive <b>actuators</b> with spring constant variations between 2. 13 and 8. 71  N/m are used in the phase shifter design.

40|$|Active {{control of}} a {{turbulent}} boundary layer has been experimentally investigated {{with a view to}} reducing the skin-friction drag and gaining some insight into the mechanism that leads to drag reduction. A spanwise-aligned array of piezo-ceramic actuators was employed to generate a transverse traveling wave along the wall surface, with a specified phase <b>shift</b> between adjacent <b>actuators.</b> Local skin-friction drag exhibits a strong dependence on control parameters, including the wavelength, amplitude and frequency of the oscillation. A maximum drag reduction of 50 % has been achieved at 17 wall units downstream of the actuators. The near-wall flow structure under control, measured using smoke–wire flow visualization, hot-wire and particle image velocimetry techniques, is compared with that without control. The data have been carefully analysed using techniques such as streak detection, power spectra and conditional averaging based on the variable-interval time-average detection. All the results point to a pronounced change in the organization of the perturbed boundary layer. It is proposed that the actuation-induced wave generates a layer of highly regularized streamwise vortices, which acts as a barrier between the large-scale coherent structures and the wall, thus interfering with the turbulence production cycle and contributing partially to the drag reduction. Associated with the generation of regularized vortices is a significant increase, in the near-wall region, of the mean energy dissipation rate, as inferred from a substantial decrease in the Taylor microscale. This increase also contributes to the drag reduction. The scaling of the drag reduction is also examined empirically, providing valuable insight into the active control of drag reduction...|$|R
