5|$|In Super Bowl XLVIII, Manning's Broncos {{lost to the}} Seattle Seahawks by a {{score of}} 43–8. Manning was up against the Seahawks' young {{starting}} quarterback Russell Wilson, who idolized Manning and attended one of Manning's passing camps as a teenager, and later met Manning at a Broncos pre-draft interview. The Seahawks' number one ranked defense proved {{too much for the}} Broncos' number one ranked offense to overcome, while the Broncos' defense also struggled due to injuries. The Broncos' first play from scrimmage {{set the tone for the}} game. While Manning was <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> to call an audible, center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball too early and it flew past Manning's head into the end zone, where running back Knowshon Moreno downed it for a safety. Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions (broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLIX), but the record-setting offense did not record a first down until the second quarter, and did not score any points until the final seconds of the third quarter. While Manning threw one touchdown pass and one successful two-point conversion, he also threw two costly interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|The bounce pass is {{executed}} by getting {{low to the}} ground, holding the ball {{with one or two}} hands at hip height, and <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> while releasing the ball. The ball should be aimed low at the ground and released {{with a great deal of}} force. The purpose of the bounce pass is to move the ball around an opponent. It is used when a player is in a confined space, with limited passing options.|$|E

5000|$|In Pakistan, a {{variation}} that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die values {{can be used}} independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. For example, if the roll gives 1 and 4, the player can move a single piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> and then 1 step backwards, or 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> and 4 <b>steps</b> backwards, or 1 then 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards, and another piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards.|$|R

Soon after, the officer was killed and Seel found himself alone and decided to surrender to the Soviet troops and started to follow them west. Somewhere in Poland, however, he found himself arrested and threatened to be shot {{as a part of}} a reprisal execution after the murder of an officer. He saved his life by <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> in front of the firing squad and starting to sing the Internationale.|$|E
25|$|Observant Jews {{have the}} custom to take three steps {{back and then}} three steps forward {{both before and after}} reciting the Amidah. The steps {{backward}} at the beginning represent withdrawing one's attention from the material world, and then <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> to symbolically approach the King of Kings. The Mekhilta notes that the significance of the three steps is based on the three barriers that Moses had to pass through at Sinai before entering God's realm. The Mishnah Berurah wrote that only the steps forward are necessary, while the backward steps beforehand are a prevalent custom.|$|E

25|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} primary campaign, Romney called Arizona’s approach to illegal immigration “a {{model for the}} nation.” He vowed that {{on his first day}} in office as president, he would {{bring an end to the}} lawsuits the Obama Administration’s Justice Department had brought challenging Arizona’s immigration policy. He also praised the anti-illegal immigration efforts of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a law professor who had drafted much of Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law and similar measures around the country. Campaigning with Kobach in January 2012, Romney said, “We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing to stand up for the rule of law. With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> to address this problem.” When the Supreme Court struck down parts of Arizona's SB 1070 in June 2012, a Romney campaign spokesman said that Romney supports the rights of states to make their own immigration laws when the federal government has failed to address illegal immigration.|$|E

She told Lamo she had recognized that the messages came from an NSA database, and that seeing them had made her feel comfortable about <b>stepping</b> <b>forward.</b> Lamo asked what kind of material Manning was dealing with; Manning replied: [...] "uhm... crazy, almost criminal political backdealings... the non-PR-versions of world events and crises..." [...] Although she said she dealt with Assange directly, Manning also said Assange had adopted a deliberate policy of knowing very little about her, telling Manning: [...] "lie to me." ...|$|E

500|$|His first {{commission}} {{seems to}} have been for extensions to Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, for Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun had been built only 20 years before by Sir William Bruce, and Adam was retained to rebuild the south-east wing. These works, completed in 1725, aimed to give the east front a bold new facade, <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> at the ends with curved sections. According to John Fleming, [...] "nothing so ambitious or imaginative had ever before been attempted in Scotland". Over the following years, Adam would return to Hopetoun, building the south colonnade from 1726, the north wing from 1728, and finally the pavilions from 1736. These were not finished until 1742, the year of the Earl's death, and the completed scheme was finished by Adam's sons after his own death. Adam also laid out the gardens, possibly to designs by Bruce, whose axial style they follow.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} {{is located}} {{in the middle of a}} triangular park, bounded by P Street (south) and 22nd Street (east and west) NW, across the street from the Church of the Pilgrims and one block from Rock Creek Park. [...] It consists of a bronze statue on a Vermont granite base next to a Vermont granite wall with relief. [...] The statue is approximately [...] tall, [...] wide, and [...] long while the base is approximately [...] tall. [...] The statue, which faces south, depicts Shevchenko wearing a long suit coat and <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> as his left hand holds his jacket lapel. [...] His slightly opened right hand is pointed downwards and hangs by his side. [...] Shevchenko is also depicted as a young-to-middle age adult with short wavy hair and a moustache. [...] The relief depicts the martyred Greek god Prometheus. [...] The statue and wall are on a four-stepped platform surrounded by a stone plaza.|$|E
500|$|The Archangel Michael, the {{embodiment}} and conduit of divine justice, is positioned directly below Christ, the only figure to reach both Heaven and Earth. He wears a dispassionate expression as {{he holds a}} set of scales to weigh souls. Unusually for Christian art, the damned outweigh the blessed; Michael's scales have only one soul in each pan, yet the left pan tips below the right. Michael is given unusual prominence in a [...] "Last Judgement" [...] for the period, and his powerful presence emphasises the work's function in a hospice and its preoccupation with the liturgy of death. His feet are positioned {{as if he is}} <b>stepping</b> <b>forward,</b> almost about {{to move out of the}} canvas and he looks directly at the viewer, giving the illusion of judging not only the souls in the painting but also the viewers. Michael, like Sebastian and Anthony, was a plague saint and would have been visible to inmates through the openings of the pierced screen as they lay in their beds. Michael is painted with iconographic elements associated with paintings of the Last Judgement, and is by far the most beautifully and colourfully painted figure; he is dressed in a red cope with woven golden fabrics over a shining white alb, which dominates the lower panels, [...] "hypnotically attracting the viewer's glance" [...] according to Lane. He is surrounded by four cherubs, playing trumpets to call the dead to their final destination. Michael's role in the Last Judgement is emphasised through van der Weyden's use of colour: Michael's gleaming white alb contrasts with the cherub's red vestments, set against a blue sky directly below heaven's golden clouds.|$|E

According to victim advocates, the {{reporting}} of these incidents was a positive development, demonstrating that sexual assault victims were comfortable <b>stepping</b> <b>forward.</b> In recent years, the University of Connecticut has invested in awareness and prevention of sexual assault by forming a special victims unit, establishing a victim support service, and creating a revised training program to teach how to deal with cases of sexual misconduct. As a result, a study conducted by the Higher Education Data Sharing Consortium showed that rates of sexual violence at the University of Connecticut are lower than the national average.|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} likely developed {{because in}} addition to not having the physique commonly associated with power hitters, Ott used an unusual batting technique. The [...] outfielder preceded his swings by dropping his hands, lifting his front leg and <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> on it as the pitch came. Since that defied accepted baseball wisdom about how to hit the long ball, {{it was assumed that}} Ott was focusing on the short right field fence, and sportswriters often kidded him about this. Ott, who worked on his technique extensively, would usually respond by pointing out that if it was so easy, other batters in the league {{should have been able to}} hit even more of those home runs when visiting the Giants. It has also been pointed out that Ott's best-known home run, which won his team the 1933 World Series from the Washington Senators, was hit in Griffith Stadium, not the Polo Grounds, and over a longer fence.|$|E
2500|$|In magical rituals {{involving}} the invocation of deities, a vocal technique called vibration is commonly used.

According to Crowley in [...] "Liber O", success in this technique is signaled by physical exhaustion and [...] "though only by the student himself is it perceived, when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if by the concourse of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if that Great Voice proceeded from the Universe, and not from himself." ...|$|E
