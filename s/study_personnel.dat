We examine the experience of principal investigators (PIs) and <b>study</b> <b>personnel</b> who faced this complex ethical issue in the first biomedical HIV prevention study that allowed minors to self-consent for enrollment. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with PIs and <b>study</b> <b>personnel</b> from 13 medical trial sites in cities across the United States. Data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis. Results: Participants experienced moral conflict as they struggled to fulfill conflicting duties in this trial involving minor adolescents with multiple vulnerabilities. Our participants experienced conflict between the two types of duties—protective and scientific—previously identified by Merritt. Protective duties were owed to the child, the parents, and the institution, and participants expressed tension between the actions that would protect these subgroups and the actions necessary to fulfill their scientific duties. Conclusions: Moral conflict was resolved in a variety of ways, including reflecting on the protocol's alignment with federal regulations, modifying consent language, considering each individual for enrollment carefully, and accepting institutional review board (IRB) decisions. Potential solutions for future studies are discussed, and include flexible protocol consent procedures and centralized IRB reviews...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Increased drug resistance, and itsassociated infections {{has been}} gained {{attention}} by most researchers. Wedesigned this cross-sectional study to evaluate MRSA and VRSAfrequency in the Shohadai Ashayer hospital of Khorram Abad, Iran. Material and Methods: Samples {{were obtained by}} sterile swabmoistened with normal saline from interior nares of 300 personnel andimmediately cultured on a Mannitol Salt Agar. Suspected colonies wereconfirmed by biochemical methods. Methicillin and Vancomycinresistance of isolated strains {{was carried out by}} agar dilution accordingto recommendations of National Clinical Laboratory Institute. Results: Sixty-four (21. 33 %) of 300 <b>studied</b> <b>personnel</b> were nasalcarriers of S. aureus. 16 (5. 33 %) and 4 (1. 33 %) of the carriers wereMethicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin resistantS. aureus (VRSA), respectively. One (0. 33 %) of the personnel wasconcurrently the carrier of both MRSA and VRSA. No correlation wasfound between carriage and factors such as sex, age, ward of hospitaland length of occupation, and predisposing diseases. Kind ofoccupation and level of education were significantly related with carrierstate. (P< 0. 05) Conclusion: Percentage of S. aureus carriers in hospital personnel wasconsistent with other published reliable documents.

40|$|To {{review the}} impact of case {{management}} programs on health care resource use; their impact on patient satisfaction, quality of life, and functional status (patient-centered outcomes); and their cost-effectiveness, we reviewed the English language literature utilizing the following MEDLINE and HealthSTAR headings: case management, patient care planning, patient-centered care, disease management, care management, and managed care programs. Bibliographies of relevant articles were also reviewed. Only randomized controlled trials were included. Data were extracted manually from relevant publications and are presented descriptively because formal, quantitative methods were not applicable. Nine studies met our inclusion criteria. Of the seven studies examining case management's impact on health resource use, only two found a positive effect. Both successful programs targeted patients with specified disease conditions and care was supervised by a medical subspecialist. None of the programs targeting general disease conditions or supervised by generalists reported a positive effect. All six studies examining patient-centered outcomes reported a positive impact. These effects were unrelated to the patient's conditions or the <b>study</b> <b>personnel.</b> Both studies examining clinical parameters found a positive impact. Only three studies examined costs; all reported nonsignificant cost savings. While case management programs offer theoretical benefits, few examples of successful programs were found. Positive effect was related to disease condition and specialty training of <b>study</b> <b>personnel.</b> Patient-centered outcomes were often improved upon but at unknown cost.

We find that an individual is more likely to become an entrepreneur if his or her coworkers have been entrepreneurs before. Peer influences also appear to be substitutes for other sources of entrepreneurial influence: we find that peer influences are strongest for those who have less exposure to entrepreneurship in other aspects of their lives. entrepreneurship, peers, organizational <b>studies,</b> <b>personnel...</b>|$|R
