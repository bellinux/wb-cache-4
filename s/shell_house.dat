500|$|Concerned that COSAG would {{undermine}} the election, particularly {{in the wake of}} the conflict in Bophuthatswana and the <b>Shell</b> <b>House</b> Massacre—incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively—Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system. With de Klerk, he also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession. As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory for Mandela. The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking another. [...] Mandela voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his election as President, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.|$|E
500|$|Mandela {{was given}} {{an office in the}} newly {{purchased}} ANC headquarters at <b>Shell</b> <b>House,</b> Johannesburg, and moved into Winnie's large Soweto home. Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with Dali Mpofu, but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. He gained funding for her defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton. Mandela's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in [...] "black-on-black" [...] violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in thousands of deaths. Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. Mandela argued that there was a [...] "third force" [...] within the state intelligence services fuelling the [...] "slaughter of the people" [...] and openly blamed de Klerk—whom he increasingly distrusted—for the Sebokeng massacre. In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.|$|E

500|$|To the {{southeast}} of the hall is the stable block which partly surrounds a courtyard. [...] It has a south front of nine bays, the middle three of which project forwards and have a pediment carried on four large Doric pilasters. [...] The block originally had a cupola, but this has been removed. [...] A formal garden has been built between the east wing and the stable block. [...] Standing in this garden is a lead statue of a reclining, naked male figure, said to be Father Tiber, the river god. [...] This formerly stood in the Wilderness garden. [...] On {{the wall behind the}} statue are two carved unicorn heads, the emblem of the Legh family. [...] These formerly stood on pillars at the eastern entrance to the grounds. [...] The statues have been designated as a GradeII listed building. [...] A GradeII building is one that is [...] "nationally important and of special interest". [...] To the south of the formal garden is a stone statue of Napoleon carved by George Turner and dated 1837. [...] To the west of the hall is a ha-ha in rubble sandstone dating from the 18thcentury. It was built to act as a barrier between {{the west side of the}} garden and the deer park beyond it, and is listed GradeII. [...] Immediately to the south of the hall is a circular lawn, in the centre of which is a sundial that probably dates from about 1825. [...] Constructed in ashlar buff sandstone and standing on a pair of circular steps, it consists of an octagonal base with a partly fluted baluster supporting an octagonal moulded capstone. The capstone carries a copper plate inscribed with Roman numerals and the initials [...] "TL", and has a simple triangular gnomon. [...] The sundial is also listed GradeII. [...] Leading south from the lawn is a walk known as the Lime Avenue, which is entered through gates dated 1688. [...] The gates are in wrought iron and the piers in ashlar buff gritstone; these are again listed GradeII. [...] The avenue leads to another GradeII listed building, a structure known as the <b>Shell</b> <b>House,</b> so-called because its interior is decorated with shells and coloured mirrors. [...] It is a single-storey cottage constructed in red brick with buff sandstone dressings. [...] The roof is in stone-slate and the chimney is brick. [...] The wall is in brick with a stone coping. [...] In front of Shell Cottage another sundial, also listed GradeII. [...] This was probably built in the early 18thcentury for John Legh, and moved to its present position in the middle of that century. [...] It is thought that the pillar on which it stands was originally a Saxon cross base. [...] The octagonal copper plate is inscribed with Roman numerals, the longitude of Adlington, and John Legh's initials. [...] To the front of the <b>Shell</b> <b>House</b> is another walk, known as the Yew Walk. [...] At the back and side of the house is a rockery. [...] To the south and west of the <b>Shell</b> <b>House</b> is a wooded area known as the Wilderness, through which runs the River Dean (or Dene). [...] Many of the winding paths created by Charles Legh in the Wilderness are now overgrown, and some of the buildings are in a poor condition, or have collapsed into ruin. [...] One building still in good condition is the Tig House, a small square pavilion overlooking the river, an early example of a building in the Chinoiserie style. [...] It is constructed in red brick and partly clad in black and white timber framing. [...] It has a stone-slate pyramidal roof with a wooden finial, and is listed GradeII. [...] Near to this is the a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge crossing the river, but the summerhouse which once stood on the bridge is no longer present. [...] Another structure in the Wilderness is the Temple of Diana. [...] This is a circular temple with a dome constructed in ashlar buff sandstone. [...] It stands on a stylobate which supports six Doric columns and an entablature. [...] The structure is listed GradeII. [...] This appears to be in good condition, but in the early 2000s was said to be suffering from damp. [...] Other buildings known as the Rathouse and the Hermitage, have been damaged by falling trees. [...] At the north entrance to the grounds is a pair of gate piers that are listed GradeII. [...] The piers are in rusticated ashlar sandstone and are surmounted by ball finials. The gates are iron and are similar to those at the end of the lime avenue. [...] At the other end of the grounds, at the site of the former south approach, is a pair of sandstone gate piers dating from the middle of the 18th century. [...] They originally carried the carved unicorn heads that are now in the formal garden, and were left isolated when the route of the turnpike road was moved. [...] They are listed GradeII.|$|E

6000|$|The triple town of Anstruther Wester, Anstruther Easter, and Cellardyke, {{all three}} Royal Burghs - or two Royal Burghs and a less {{distinguished}} suburb, I forget which - lies continuously along the seaside, and boasts of either {{two or three}} separate parish churches, and either two or three separate harbours. These ambiguities are painful; {{but the fact is}} (although it argue me uncultured), I am but poorly posted upon Cellardyke. My business lay in the two Anstruthers. A tricklet of a stream divides them, spanned by a bridge; and over the bridge at the time of my knowledge, the celebrated <b>Shell</b> <b>House</b> stood outpost on the west. [...] This had been the residence of an agreeable eccentric; during his fond tenancy, he had illustrated the outer walls, as high (if I remember rightly) as the roof, with elaborate patterns and pictures, and snatches of verse in the vein of EXEGI MONUMENTUM; shells and pebbles, artfully contrasted and conjoined, had been his medium; and I like to think of him standing back upon the bridge, when all was finished, drinking in the general effect and (like Gibbon) already lamenting his employment.|$|E
