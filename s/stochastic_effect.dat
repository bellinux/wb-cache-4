50|$|The {{significance}} of <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> began {{to influence the}} commission’s policy and {{a new set of}} recommendations was published as Publication 9 in 1966. However, during development its editors became concerned about the many different opinions on the risk of <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects.</b> The Commission therefore asked a working group to consider these, and their report, Publication 8 (1966), for the first time for the ICRP summarised the current knowledge about radiation risks, both somatic and genetic. Publication 9 then followed, and substantially changed radiation protection emphasis by moving from deterministic to <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

50|$|Cancer is a <b>stochastic</b> <b>effect</b> of radiation, {{meaning that}} the {{probability}} of occurrence increases with effective radiation dose, but {{the severity of the}} cancer is independent of dose. The speed at which cancer advances, the prognosis, the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not functions of the radiation dose to which the person is exposed. This contrasts with the deterministic effects of acute radiation syndrome which increase in severity with dose above a threshold. Cancer starts with a single cell whose operation is disrupted. Normal cell operation is controlled by the chemical structure of DNA molecules, also called chromosomes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{absorbed dose}} {{required}} to produce a certain biological effect varies between different types of radiation, such as photons, neutrons or alpha particles.

Equivalent dose is designed for estimation of stochastic risks from radiation exposures. <b>Stochastic</b> <b>effect</b> is defined for radiation dose assessment as the probability of cancer induction and genetic damage.|$|E
5000|$|Cancer is a <b>stochastic</b> <b>effect</b> of radiation, {{meaning that}} it only has a {{probability}} of occurrence, as opposed to deterministic effects which always happen over a certain dose threshold. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is {{that the incidence of}} cancers due to ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert. Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this. [...] This model is widely accepted for external radiation, but its application to internal contamination is disputed. For example, the model fails to account for the low rates of cancer in early workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory who were exposed to plutonium dust, and the high rates of thyroid cancer in children following the Chernobyl accident, both of which were internal exposure events. The European Committee on Radiation Risk calls the ICRP model [...] "fatally flawed" [...] when it comes to internal exposure.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a multi-nutrient and single {{microorganism}} chemostat model with <b>stochastic</b> <b>effect</b> and impulsive toxicant input. Firstly, {{for the system}} neglecting <b>stochastic</b> <b>effect,</b> we investigate the global dynamics including the existence and global asymptotic stability of ‘microorganism-extinction’ periodic solution, {{as well as the}} permanence of the system. Then, for the stochastic differential system with impulsive effect, we discuss the persistence and extinction of microorganisms with <b>stochastic</b> <b>effect</b> in a polluted environment. Our results indicate that the stochastic disturbance can lead to microbial extinction. Moreover, the concentration of toxicant will also affect the survival of microorganisms. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate our theoretical results.|$|E
30|$|In {{the real}} world, {{a system is}} usually {{affected}} by unknown disturbances, which may be regarded as <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects.</b> Consequently, it is of significant importance to study <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> for the NNs. In recent years, the dynamic behaviors of stochastic RDNNs, especially the stability of stochastic RDNNs, have become a hot study topic. For example, the authors in [15 – 17] have obtained some criteria to guarantee the almost sure exponential stability, and mean square exponential stability for RDNNs with continuously distributed delays and stochastic influence.|$|R
50|$|This {{compromise}} is well illustrated in radiology. The application of radiation can aid the patient by providing doctors {{and other health}} care professionals with a medical diagnosis, but the exposure should be reasonably low enough to keep the statistical probability of cancers or sarcomas (<b>stochastic</b> <b>effects)</b> below an acceptable level, and to eliminate deterministic effects (e.g. skin reddening or cataracts). An acceptable level of incidence of <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> is considered to be equal for a worker to the risk in another work generally considered to be safe.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stochastic</b> <b>effect</b> in {{cellular}} {{systems has}} been an important topic in systems biology. Stochastic modeling and simulation methods are important tools to study <b>stochastic</b> <b>effect.</b> Given the low efficiency of stochastic simulation algorithms, the hybrid method, which combines an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system with a stochastic chemically reacting system, shows its unique advantages in the modeling and simulation of biochemical systems. The efficiency of hybrid method is usually limited by reactions in the stochastic subsystem, which are modeled and simulated using Gillespie's framework and frequently interrupt the integration of the ODE subsystem. In this paper we develop an efficient implementation approach for the hybrid method coupled with traditional ODE solvers. We also compare the efficiency of hybrid methods with three widely used ODE solvers RADAU 5, DASSL, and DLSODAR. Numerical experiments with three biochemical models are presented. A detailed discussion is presented for the performances of three ODE solvers...|$|E

Thus, it makes it possible to compare various procedures involving ionizing radiation for radiation protection purposes. The effective dose is primarily intended as an important parameter for the planning and optimization of radiation protection and not as a quantity for individual risk estimates, as patient-specific parameters may vary significantly from the assumptions made in the risk models [1]. Moreover, the effective dose cannot be applied for therapy with radiopharmaceuticals as it only considers the <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, it is {{noteworthy}} that the state of electronic networks is often subjected to some phenomenon or other sudden noises.

Therefore, it is necessary to take both <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> and impulsive perturbations into account on dynamical behaviors of delayed neural networks. In recent years, the dynamic analysis of neural networks with impulsive and <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> has been an attractive topic for many researchers, and a large number of stability criteria of these systems have been reported; see [3, 4, 10 – 12, 16, 17].|$|R

If an outbreak is sufficiently large, <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> are negligible and we modify the standard ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to accommodate age-of-infection effects. We avoid the use of partial differential equations which typically appear in related models. We introduce a “memoryless” ODE system which approximates the true solutions.

30|$|Keeping the {{parameters}} of the deterministic system constant, by adding white noise disturbance, we can get R^*_ 2 < 1 < R_ 2, which indicates that the persistent microorganism of a deterministic system may go to extinction under the white noise stochastic disturbance. Thus the simulation is consistent with the theoretical results of Theorem  3.2 and Theorem  4.1.

40|$|Holland's {{schema theorem}} has been criticised in (Fogel and Ghozeil 1997, Fogel and Ghozeil 1998, Fogel and Ghozeil 1999) {{for not being}} able to {{estimate}} correctly the expected proportion of a schema in the population when fitness proportionate selection is used in the presence of noise or other <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects.</b> This is incorrect for two reasons. Firstly, the theorem in its original form is not applicable to this case. As clarified in the paper, if the quantities involved in schema theorems are random variables, the theorems must be interpreted as conditional statements. Secondly, the conditional versions of Holland and other researchers' schema theorems are indeed very useful to model the sampling of schemata in the presence of stochasticity. In the paper I show how one can calculate the correct expected proportion of a schema in the presence of <b>stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> when selection only is present, using a conditional interpretation of Holland's schema theorem. In addition, I generalise this result (again using schema theorems) to the case in which crossover, mutation, and selection with replacement are used.
