These characteristics are related mainly to photoperiod and light intensity. The effect of shading, by means of <b>shading</b> <b>nets,</b> on quality characteristics of compact gardenia potted plants was investigated during summer in a polyethylene covered greenhouse located near Volos, on the coastal area of Central Greece. <b>Shading</b> <b>nets</b> with 70 % (30 % shading) and 40 % (60 % shading) light transmission coefficient were used inside the greenhouse that was already shaded by white paint and had a total light transmission coefficient of 30 %. Gardenia plants were grown under the above <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> and under ambient greenhouse conditions from April to July 2010. Measurements of plant growth and development characteristics were carried out along with microclimate measurements. The results showed that plants placed under 30 and 60 % <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> were 10 and 13 % shorter than the plants grown under ambient greenhouse conditions, respectively. Furthermore, shaded plants grown under the 30 and 60 % <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> had 23 and 45 % lower leaf area and fresh weight than the plants grown under ambient greenhouse conditions, respectively.

The experiment consisted of three shading intensities viz., 35, 50 and 75 per cent and six different <b>shade</b> <b>net</b> colours viz., black, red, green + white, green, blue and white. The micrometeorological studies indicated that, micrometeorological parameters viz., absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and light use efficiency were significantly increased fewer than 35 per cent shading intensity which resulted into higher photosynthetic rate and ultimately the yield of capsicum, suggesting suitability of 35 per cent shading intensity for capsicum cultivation under protected cultivation. The micro-meteorological parameters viz., APAR, light use efficiency, photosynthetic rate and yield of capsicum were significantly improved under green + white and green <b>shade</b> <b>net</b> colours than other <b>shade</b> <b>net</b> colours during both the years.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> on growth, oil yield and compound composition of fever tea (Lippia javaica). The treatments were nine <b>shade</b> <b>nets</b> of different light intensities (100 % bird net, 40 % green, 10, 12 and 18 % white and 30, 40, 55 and 70 % black). The layout used was a completely randomized design. The parameters measured were shoot width, fresh shoot mass, the number of plants flowered, plant height and photosynthetically active radiation. <b>Shade</b> <b>netting</b> did not have any effect on the shoot width of L. javanica. Eighteen percent white net was best suited to produce fresh shoot mass, whereas 55 % black net, 40 % black net and 10 % white net produced lower fresh shoot mass. More plants that flowered were obtained under 70 % black net than those grown under 30 % black net. The number of plants that flowered increased from 22 to 35 with an increase in shading density. The height of plants was not affected by <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> at 49 DAT. However, at 59 and 67 DAT, the height of the plants was greater under low light intensities (40, 55, and 70 % black nets) than that of high light intensity (30 % black). Twelve percent white net had the greatest plant height at 102 DAT. <b>Shade</b> <b>netting</b> significantly affected the adsorption and utilization of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) above, across and below the plants at 102 DAT. Hundred percent bird net had the greatest amount of light intercepted above, across and below the plants. The amount of light intercepted above, below and across the plants was lower for lower shading intensity (30 % black) than that of higher shading intensities (40 %, 55 % and 70 % black). To determine shade-netting effect on oil yield and compound composition, fresh leaves (± 200 g) of L. javanica were sampled from each <b>shade</b> <b>net</b> for essential oil extraction by hydrodistillation. The oil yield ranged from 0. 29 % to 0. 41 %. The oil had a clear to yellowish brown colour. No significant differences were detected for oil yield amongst the <b>shade</b> <b>nets.</b> The chemical compound analysis was carried out by GC/MS. The chemical compounds identified in the essential oil were a -pinene, sebinen, myrcene, 1. 8 myrcene, ipsenone, ipsedienone, b -caryophyllen and germacrene-D. L. javanica plants grown under 10 % white net, resulted in significantly higher myrcene content (15. 7 %) as compared to plants grown in other <b>shade</b> <b>nets.</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>netting</b> did not have any effect on the composition of á-pinene, sebinene, 1. 8 myrcene, ipsenone, ipsedienone, b -caryophyllen and germacrene-D. For commercial usage of myrcene, white net (10 %) would be best suited for L. javanica production. To obtain information about indigenous knowledge of L. javanica, a survey was carried out among street traders, traditional healers, hawkers and farmers in Gauteng. The age group was between 20 and 73. The majority of respondents, who were self employed, were traditional healers followed by farmers. Most (98 %) of the respondents indicated that they collected L. javanica from the veld by cutting the plant, whereas other respondents uprooted the whole plant when harvesting. Amongst the different uses of L. javanica mentioned, treatment of colds and coughs through steaming was stated by most (47 %) of the respondents. Most (88 %) of the respondents felt that it was important to conserve the plant for future generations and also to prevent the plant from becoming extinct. Traditional healers knew the uses and other important aspects of L. javanica than the farmers. Dissertation (M Inst Agrar (Agronomy)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

The objectives of the study were: 1. To evaluate the effect {{of different types of}} <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> on tomato production 2. To develop a vertical hydroponic system for lettuce production which would be suitable for use by small-scale farmers. In the tomato trial the highest number of fruit per plant (47) was produced under 12 % white shade and 40 % black <b>shade</b> <b>nets,</b> and the lowest fruit number (35) was produced under 30 % black net. The highest yield of 6. 2 kg per plant was obtained under the 18 % white net while 30 % black net produced the lowest yield of 3. 9 kg per plant. The test yield of lettuce grown in plastic tubes with eight vertically arranged plant positions were obtained with a continuous high flow rate of the nutrient solution.

Experiments were carried out during summer of 2003 in Nea Agchialos, Central Greece. The seedlings of tomato were transplanted into the soil and the following parameters were recorded regularly: solar radiation, air temperature and humidity and crop temperature. In parallel, parameters relative to crop growth and development were also measured. The reduction of solar radiation above the crop was proportional to the shading intensity of the net. Similar values of air temperature and air vapour pressure deficit were observed under the <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> and outside.

Of these, six were in the open air; six were covered with black <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> of 30 % light interception; six with black <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> 50 %; and six with black <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> 80 %, providing 6 m 2 of shade per stall. Temperature-humidity index (THI) and respiratory frequency (RF) were assessed twice weekly and behavior was evaluated fortnightly during 12 h, between 06 : 00 h and 18. 00 h. Feeding behavior, rumination, rest, and social activities such as body care and playful and abnormal activities were observed. A significant increase was found in THI and RF as the shading levels decreased, while a significant difference was recorded in rest and in other activities, water intake, and play behavior. Rest time and playful behavior increased significantly, and other activities and water intake decreased with the increase in shading levels.

Seedlings of pepper plants were transplanted during May in three screenhouses and in open field. The three screenhouses were covered with the following nets: (a) an anti-thrip insect proof white <b>net</b> with <b>shading</b> intensity of about 13 %, (b) an anti-thrip insect proof white <b>net</b> with <b>shading</b> intensity of about 34 % and (c) a green <b>shading</b> <b>net</b> with <b>shading</b> intensity of about 36 %. <b>Shading</b> <b>nets</b> (a) and (b) had same porosity but different shading intensity while <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> (b) and (c) had similar shading intensity but different porosity. The following parameters were recorded regularly {{inside and outside the}} screenhouses: global solar radiation, air temperature and humidity and crop temperature and transpiration rate. In addition, wind speed and direction were also measured outside the screenhouses. The results showed that the reduction of solar radiation above the crop was proportional to the shading intensity of the net. It was found that the air temperature values measured under the screenhouses were similar to those measured in the open field. However, the canopy to air temperature difference was higher in the open field than under screenhouse conditions, with the lowest values observed under the screenhouse covered by the anti-thrip insect proof white <b>net</b> with <b>shading</b> intensity of 35 %.

The aim of the survey was to record and document indigenous knowledge held by the traditional healers on wild ginger and eight other popular plants used by them. The healing properties of wild ginger as perceived by traditional healers, ranged from healing coughs, colds, flu, hysteria, malaria and menstrual disorder, to protection against lightning. Majority (77 %) {{said that there was}} no difference in medicinal value between cultivated and those grown in the wild. The majority of the traditional healers (72 %) said they would appreciate proper training on how to domesticate these plants. Traditional healers do not have professional knowledge and skills to produce theses medicinal plants. Therefore training is crucial to impart these skills. The income category of traditional healers ranged from less than R 200 to a maximum of R 3000. Traditional healers received as few as 1 to 5 patients per day. The consultation cost ranged from R 20 to more than R 95. People who gathered plants for traditional healers ranged from 1 to 10 depending on the popularity of the traditional healer and the size of his/ her surgery.

The treatments were four in number, namely; two growing structures (tunnel and <b>shade</b> <b>net)</b> and two harvesting periods. On the effect of harvesting periods on yield, although there was no significant differences in the number of enlarged roots harvested between the first harvesting period and the second harvesting period, the number of roots tended to be higher during the first harvesting period compared to the second harvesting period. There was a significant difference in the number of rhizomes between the first and the second harvesting periods. On the effect of growth structure on yield of wild ginger, the number of enlarged roots was significantly higher from plants grown in a tunnel compared with those grown in a <b>shade</b> <b>net.</b> There was a significant difference in rhizome circumference between plants grown in a plastic tunnel and those grown in a <b>shade</b> <b>net.</b> There were interactions between the harvesting date and growth structure for fresh enlarged root mass. Fresh mass of enlarged roots of wild ginger was greater during the first harvesting date than during the second harvesting date for plants grown in a plastic tunnel. For small scale or resource poor farmers, herbalists and traditional healers who wish to grow wild ginger under protection, it is better to grow wild ginger in a plastic tunnel than under a <b>shade</b> <b>net,</b> probably because wild ginger performs well in warm conditions. The plastic tunnels have a tendency of maintaining warm temperatures during winter months. Early harvesting of wild ginger at the end of June 28 / 06 than harvesting in September.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different shaded environments with black <b>shade</b> <b>nets</b> [0 (full sun), 35 and 50 %, and overlap 35 + 50 % shading nets] on flowering, yield and quality of inflorescences of Heliconia psittacorum (cv.

The yield and quality of inflorescences of plants grown under full-sun conditions (0 % shading) were impaired.

The objective was to study the growth responses, survival and photosynthetic response during the acclimatization of plants maintained on three different substrates (Plantmax forestry(r), sand and 1 : 1 Plantmax forestry(r) and sand) under three shading conditions (50 % red and blue <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> and control without <b>shading</b> <b>nets).</b> The highest leaf and shoot numbers per plant and survival rate were observed in treatments with the Plantmax forestry(r) type substrate {{in the absence of}} shading. In vitro culture plants behaved similarly or better than rhizome propagated control plants with regard to the net photosynthesis rate, carboxylation efficiency, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate. In general, for both conditions, in vitro and control plants had similar efficiency of biochemical functions and of photosystem II.

40|$|The {{influence}} of three screenhouse nets differing in colour, shading intensity (SI) and porosity on photosynthesis, transpiration rate and light acclimation of sweet pepper plants was investigated at Velestino (central Greece) from May to October 2011. The screenhouse nets {{consisted of two}} insect-proof white nets (W 13 and W 34, SI= 13 and 34 %, respectively), and a green <b>shading</b> <b>net</b> (G 36, SI= 36 %). Climate variables were recorded continuously in the different treatments. Leaf photosynthesis and transpiration rate were measured fortnightly over different canopy layers.

The spectral changes provided by colored <b>shade</b> <b>nets</b> did not caused any noticeable change in leaf anatomy of M. officinalis. However, the use of blue net resulted in increments of 116 % in plant height, 168 % in leaf area, 42 % in chlorophyll content and 30 % in yield of essential oil in lemon balm plants.

Although it develops better under protected environment, the cultivation in tropical countries is practiced in open field due greenhouse structure higher costs. Unfortunately, such practice has compromised the crop to reach either best yield or fruit quality. Since production and cost are the most important criteria for agricultural production, we aimed to evaluate reflective aluminized polypropylene <b>shading</b> <b>net</b> influence on sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) growth and production as intermediary alternative for low/middle income producers from Brazilian tropical regions.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} facing agriculture {{today is to}} sustain the productivity of agricultural systems with the reduction of weed invasion. The Swartland region in the Western Cape (South Africa) is intensively cropped, producing wheat (Triticum aestivum) as the major crop. As {{a result of the}} weedy ryegrass invasion the wheat yield is reduced. In addition, ryegrass has developed resistance to grass herbicides (graminicides). This situation has increased the need to use alternative practices for controlling the invasion of ryegrass in wheat fields. In this regard, crop rotation and tillage systems were proposed as techniques to suppress the ryegrass invasion. This could thus maintain a sustainable long-term wheat production system with less application of herbicides, decreased input costs and increased total grain yield. Against this background, the effects of crop rotation and tillage were determined on ryegrass seedling emergence in a field and <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> experiment, while seed dormancy was determined in the laboratory. The objectives were to compare the wheat production of two crop rotations with mono-cropped wheat and assess the impact on the ryegrass population in no-till and minimum tillage systems. Analyses of variance on data sets of ryegrass seeds from 2009, 2010 and 2011 were used to determine germination and dormancy percentages in laboratory experiments. The performance of laboratory treatments was evaluated on the basis of germination percentage of seeds. In the field and <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> experiments, analyses of variance for data from 2007, 2011 and 2012 were used to determine crop rotation x tillage system response. Field and <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> performance were evaluated on the basis of ryegrass population inhibition and stimulation respectively. Ryegrass seeds from 2009 and 2010 showed higher germination percentages (80 per cent and 73 per cent) than 2011 (42 per cent). Primary dormancy prevented high germination of newly harvested seeds as dormancy release increase with age of the seed. Results of field and <b>shade</b> <b>netting</b> experiments showed stimulation of the ryegrass weed population in wheat monoculture under minimum tillage. However, when wheat was rotated with leguminous crops under both tillage systems (minimum-till and no-till) ryegrass was significantly inhibited. It was concluded that the critical period for weed competition is the first six weeks after planting. Results from this study provide a basis for producers of cereals to make good decisions with regards to timing weed control measures. It is essential to use competitive crop sequences which will inhibit weeds. The challenge is getting this practice adopted and implemented by producers as it will promote conservation agriculture within the region. This study promotes long-term sustainable wheat production systems with an efficient weed management programme that is environmentally friendly using less herbicides within the Swartland region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo cover {{agricultural}} structures for protecting plants from high solar radiation in hot and sunny regions {{different types of}} <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> are used. In summer, the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmitted through these nets usually fulfils plant growth requirements. However, their applicability in winter is still unknown. So far, the choice of nets has mostly been empirical, because technical data such as the radiometric properties {{that are used to}} characterize the different types of nets are not available. This paper presents a simple method for measuring the radiometric properties related to global and diffuse PAR of seven types of <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> including nets with colours and shading rates that are commonly used in hot regions. A shading system was developed to simulate the diffuse PAR under cloudy conditions. The results show that under clear sunny and cloudy conditions the radiometric properties depended on both net porosity and colour. Net reflectance strongly depended on net colour. Net transmittance and absorptance depended primarily on colour and secondarily on porosity. The radiometric properties of nets under global and diffuse PAR conditions tended to be similar to those of translucent materials so that a plastic net can be considered as translucent material when investigating the equivalent optical parameters (refractive index and absorption coefficient). This can help to predict the radiometric properties of the net without the need of measurements. Under the sunny conditions of winter seasons, the structures covered with the tested nets are suitable for growing crops that can grow at PAR less than 150 Wm− 2. However, under cloudy conditions very few plants will grow that can grow at PAR less than 30 Wm− 2...|$|R
40|$|In this {{experiment}} we evaluated the growth, partition of assimilates and yield of melons type hybrid Charenthais 'Fleuron' under different <b>shading</b> <b>nets.</b> The experiment {{was conducted at}} Federal University of Viçosa, from November 24, 2003 to March 11, 2004. The treatments consisted of four growth environmental conditions, as follows: control (full sun), and under Aluminet® 30 %-O, Cromatinet® 30 %-O, Sombrite® 30 %, with reduction of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of 30. 85 %, 35. 9 % and 32. 0 %, respectively. The experiment was arranged in a complete random design with four replicates. For the periodically evaluated characteristics we used a sub divided parcel 4 x 7 with the growing conditions in the parcel and the evaluations on the sub parcel (0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84 days after transplantation). Among the <b>shading</b> <b>nets,</b> overall growth was superior under Aluminet® 30 %-O, with similar plant height, length and number of internodes, number of leaves per plant, leaf dry weight, total and commercial yield of fruits and greater leaf area per plant compared to control at full sun. The low number of daily radiation (4. 47 hours) and the good growth and yield of the melon when shaded by 30. 85 % with Aluminet® 30 %-O, are indicatives that this culture does not require elevated levels of radiation as mentioned before. The growth of melon under partial restriction of light is promising, opening opportunities to production in new environments as agroforestry systems and associated cultivations...|$|R

The screenhouse nets were two insect-proof white nets (W 13 and W 34, SI = 13 % and 34 %, respectively) and a green <b>shading</b> <b>net</b> (G 36, SI = 36 %). Leaf net CO 2 assimilation (A(n)), transpiration rate (E), and stomatal conductance (g(S)) were measured {{by means of a}} portable {{gas exchange}} device on leaves located in three canopy layers. The differences in light regime within the canopy induced by the three <b>shading</b> <b>nets</b> had only a slight effect on A(n), thereby resulting in substantially higher light-use efficiency under shading than in the open field. The observed tendency toward higher gs in shaded plants was counterweighted by a lower intercellular-to-ambient CO 2 concentration gradient, leading to similar A(n) in leaves of shaded and non-shaded plants. Ontogenic effects (leaf aging) appeared to be the main factor determining the decreasing seasonal trend of leaf photosynthetic attributes.

40|$|Between January and February 2007, diel {{variability}} in carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water vapour (H 2 O) exchange with leaf temperature on four potted 5 -year-old navel orange trees [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] on an open-air laboratory {{on the roof}} of the Physics Department (University of Zimbabwe) was measured. Two of the four trees were of the Baianinha variety while the other two were Navelina. An automated dynamic chamber (cuvette) was installed sequentially on each of the four trees with flux measurements on a selected branch of each tree typically taking ten days. Out of the ten days on each tree, three days consisted of measurements under full solar radiation, three days under a single layer plastic mesh <b>shade</b> <b>net</b> whose transmittivity was found to be 24 % of full solar radiation, and the remainder of the ten day period under a double layer net (7 % transmittivity). Leaf temperature was measured as well as branch and stem sap flow rates. Results showed that photosynthesis was highest when leaf temperatures were between 25 and 30 Â°C while transpiration was also increased at such temperatures. There was less than ten percent difference between the two varieties of navel orange trees in terms of net exchange of fluxes. Although the <b>shade</b> <b>nets</b> were able to effectively lower leaf temperature, they also significantly lowered the levels of photosynthetic flux density to levels much less than the level at which photosynthesis saturates in citrus trees (600 - 700 Âµmol m- 2 s- 1). Photosynthetic water productivity was found to be highest under the unshaded conditions. A model was run in April 2007 on two trees to predict stem sap flow rates under different shading conditions using leaf water potential, branch sap flow and soil water potential as inputs. Data for the model was collected over two days for each tree: first under full solar radiation conditions then with a single layer <b>shade</b> <b>net.</b> The results showed that the model was, to a large extent, able to predict the stem sap flow.
