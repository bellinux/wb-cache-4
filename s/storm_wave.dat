5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a <b>storm</b> <b>wave</b> impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E
25|$|A contourite is a {{sedimentary}} deposit commonly formed on continental rise to lower slope settings, {{although they may}} occur anywhere that is below <b>storm</b> <b>wave</b> base. Countourites are produced by thermohaline-induced deepwater bottom currents and {{may be influenced by}} wind or tidal forces. The geomorphology of contourite deposits is mainly influenced by the deepwater bottom-current velocity, sediment supply, and seafloor topography.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is most often}} observed in saturated, loose (low density or uncompacted), sandy soils. This is because a loose sand {{has a tendency to}} compress when a load is applied; dense sands by contrast tend to expand in volume or 'dilate'. If the soil is saturated by water, a condition that often exists when the soil is below the ground water table or sea level, then water fills the gaps between soil grains ('pore spaces'). In response to the soil compressing, this water increases in pressure and attempts to flow out from the soil to zones of low pressure (usually upward towards the ground surface). However, if the loading is rapidly applied and large enough, or is repeated many times (e.g. earthquake shaking, <b>storm</b> <b>wave</b> loading) such that it does not flow out in time before the next cycle of load is applied, the water pressures may build to an extent where they exceed the contact stresses between the grains of soil that keep them in contact with each other. These contacts between grains are the means by which the weight from buildings and overlying soil layers are transferred from the ground surface to layers of soil or rock at greater depths. This loss of soil structure causes it to lose all of its strength (the ability to transfer shear stress) and it may be observed to flow like a liquid (hence 'liquefaction').|$|E

If the boulders were distributed at distances beyond the inundation area of the estimated <b>storm</b> <b>waves,</b> or if the estimated flow velocities required to initiate movement of the boulders were much larger {{than those of the}} <b>storm</b> <b>waves,</b> it would have been plausible that these boulders were moved by tsunamis. The estimation of flow velocity and inundation depth from numerical simulations of <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> based on accurate topographic surveys would be a useful tool for identifying whether tsunamis or storms transported the numerous boulders onshore.|$|R

40|$|In {{the winter}} East Sea (ES), <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> due to winter storms (e. g. extratropical cyclones) under {{the context of}} the cold and dry East Asian winter monsoon are {{frequently}} reported causing extensive coastal damages along the coasts of Korea and Japan. In February 2008, abnormal <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> due to a moving low propagating from the west off Hokkaido, Japan, to the south and southwest caused severe coastal damages along the Toyama Bay coast. In this study, we perform numerical experiments on wave overtopping and run-up in the Fushiki Port, Toyama Bay, where the long North-Breakwater was heavily damaged by the <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> in February 2008. The experiments are conducted using an open-source Gerris flow solver (Gfs) based on modified non-linear shallow-water equation with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method and wet-dry scheme for the potential extreme <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> of 6. 78 m and 18. 28 sec obtained from statistical analysis and wind wave modeling. The refined mesh efficiently resolves the complicated coastline and coastal structures in the Fushiki Port. The results show that the Fushiki Port would be overtopped and flooded by extreme <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> if the North-Breakwater does not function properly after being damaged. Also the <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> would overtop seawalls and sidewalls of the Manyou Pier behind the North-Breakwater.

The facility recently conducted a trial application of a Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA) to evaluate lessons learned from the 2004 Sumatra tsunami as part of PG&E's Long-Term Seismic Plan (LTSP). This study shows that the hazard for tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (approximately 10 ft) is dominated by distant earthquakes around the circum-Pacific region, and is consistent with the historic record. The tsunami wave heights observed in San Luis Obispo County from the March 2011 Japanese tsunami were consistent with these results.|$|E

30|$|If the {{evidence}} regarding tsunamis in folklore or historical documents is reliable, {{it appears that}} the boulders in this region were moved by past tsunamis. However, we have no data to suggest that the boulders on Lanyu Island were transported by tsunamis. Thus, we conclude that the boulders were moved by <b>storm</b> <b>waves,</b> particularly those associated with typhoons. Based on the numerical simulation, the boulders could not have been moved by the tsunamis, but instead could have been moved by <b>storm</b> <b>waves.</b> This suggests that the boulders moved by tsunamis would be relocated by <b>storm</b> <b>waves,</b> if the runup heights of the tsunamis were less than 10 to 15  m, which is almost equal to that of the computed tsunamis.|$|R

What seems to be important {{for the preservation of}} radiolarian oozes is that they are deposited well below the <b>storm</b> <b>wave</b> base and below the jets of erosive surface currents. Radiolarites without any carbonates have most likely been sedimented below the calcite compensation depth (CCD). One has to bear in mind that the CCD has not been stationary in the geological past and that it is also a function of latitude. At present, the CCD reaches a maximum depth of about 5000 meters near the equator.|$|E
5000|$|... ==History== The {{field was}} {{discovered}} in 1981 through the Mittelplate 1 well, which confirmed that the reservoir contained 75 million tonnes of crude oil. As early as the 1950s, geologists suspected the presence of oil off the German coast. Preliminary test borings in the 1960s did indeed turn up indications of oil, though not in economically profitable quantities. The oil crisis of 1973 and 1979 raised awareness of indigenous oil sources. In 1980 and 1981, test borings in the Mittelplate vicinity found oil in several sandstone layers. Due {{to the location of}} the field in an ecologically sensitive area, hydrographic, hydrodynamic and meteorological studies modelling <b>storm,</b> <b>wave</b> and ice-flow conditions were done, with the result that an artificial island holding a drilling and production facility was built in 1985.|$|E
5000|$|The Much Wenlock Limestone Formation is {{a series}} of Silurian {{limestone}} beds that date back to the Homerian age, {{the early part of the}} Wenlock epoch. [...] The formation comprises nodular to thinly bedded limestones, with variable development of reef bodies that can be found exposed at Wenlock Edge and in a small area near Dudley. The formation is made up of three different members which have been classified as the Lower Quarried Limestone Member, the Nodular Beds Member and the Upper Quarried Limestone Member. [...] Many of the members can be subdivided into separate [...] that would have been deposited under different environmental conditions. However the overall environment of deposition for the formation is in a shallow, tropical marine setting that is located between the <b>storm</b> <b>wave</b> base and the fair weather wave base.|$|E
30|$|Based on this evidence, it is {{unlikely}} that the event layers were formed by <b>storm</b> <b>waves.</b> The 2011 Tohoku-oki and 1896 Meiji Sanriku tsunamis inundated far beyond the possible maximum limit of <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> and fully covered the distribution area of the event layers (Fig.  3 b). Therefore, while the event layers do not show the laminations or shell fragments that are apparent in the 2011 tsunami deposits, we infer that the event layers were probably formed by tsunami waves.|$|R

30|$|Plots {{of boulder}} volume and a-axis length versus {{distance}} from the shore exhibit weak and moderate correlation (r[*]=[*] 0.21 and 0.48), respectively. The exponential landward-fining trend of boulder size distribution is found in Kudaka Island, Ryukyu (Goto et al. 2009). The weights of largest size boulders and average-size boulders have correlation (R 2 [*]=[*] 0.6962 and R 2 [*]=[*] 0.702) with {{distance from the}} reef edge on Kudaka Island. These patterns are controlled by <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> because the height of <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> decreases exponentially towards the reef flat (Egashira et al. 1985). On the other hand, a bimodal distribution of boulders is found on Ishigaki Island, Ryukyu, which suggests that large tsunamis affected the boulders {{in addition to the}} storms (Goto et al. 2010 b). One distribution is near the reef edge, and the other is far from the reef edge (approximately > 700  m). The former is caused by the <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> and the latter by the tsunamis. If we apply the mechanism of distribution of boulders on Ryukyu to that on Lanyu Island, the landward-fining boulder size and lack of large boulders far from the shore suggest that the boulders would have been transported by <b>storm</b> <b>waves</b> on Lanyu Island.|$|R
