40|$|Bleeding <b>stress</b> <b>ulcus</b> is a mucosal stress induced lesion {{which appears}} {{as a result of}} mucosal damage in {{severely}} injured and critically ill persons. Prophylaxis treatment has dramatically reduced the incidence of bleeding in Intensive care units. We conducted a prospective study for the five years period. Of 954 patients (196 with acute necrotizing pancreatitis and 758 with severe injuries), 84 (8. 5 %) has clinically important bleeding. About 80 % of these patients had more than one independent risk for acute bleeding from gastrointestinal tract. Prophylaxis treatment reduced bleeding in 90 % risk patients (according Zinner score). Despite of prophylaxis, 13 patients required surgery. Overall mortality was 29 (34 %) of 84 patients, including seven of 13 who required surgery. Sepsis and respiratory failure were identified as strong risk factors for bleeding in our group. The choice of the best prophylactic agens still remains the question...|$|E
40|$|Lack of cadaveric organs for {{transplantation}} {{resulted in}} {{increased number of}} living related kidney donors examinations and consequent transplantations in our Department. Donor procedure, selection, drop-outs and final results for living related donors (LRD) were retrospectively analyzed in this paper. Between 1987 and 1994 202 potential LRD were examined. Most of them were females (59 %) and about 30 % were older than 60 years. The family relation between LRD and recipients were: parents (95 %), siblings (3 %), grandmother grandfather (1. 5 %) and uncle (0. 5 %). Potential LRD were informed on risks advantages and procedure of living donor transplantation. After primary information 26 % of potential LRD gave up further examinations. Following immunological and clinical evaluations 48 % of LRD actually donated a kidney. The other 26 % were excluded during the selection procedure. High immunological risks including ABO incompatibility, HLA mismatches and positive cross match test were the reasons for drop outs of 35 potential LRD (17 %). Five more donors were excluded for medical reasons: one because of low creatinine clearance and four because of neoplasms, discovered during examination (kidney, laryngeal, lung). Fourteen transplantation were not realized due to different recipient reasons: 5 of them had clinical contraindications, two died and in 7 cadaveric kidney transplantations were performed. Mild hypertension, coronary disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 were presented in 5 LRD accepted for transplantation. Five more had to be operated before donation (abdominal or urological operation). Early complications after donor nephrectomy were acute renal failure, <b>stress</b> <b>ulcus,</b> pleuropneumonia in three and thromboflebitis in two donors. In conclusion, although kidney transplantation from LRD is highly successful careful examination during selection procedure is indispensable...|$|E
40|$|In {{infectious}} diseases we can discern a {{cause and effect}} chain, which in particular offers the practicable perspectives of prophylaxis and treatment. However, to date {{we have not been}} able to control them. Apart from new epidemics, such as those caused by HIV and SARS, long-forgotten scourges like TB are enjoying a comeback. Furthermore, the advances made in clinical medicine mean that induced immunosuppression, for instance as a result of major surgery or organ transplantation, has become a serious problem in intensive care units. The bodyâ€™s natural barriers are breached through medical interventions while, on the other hand, immunocompromising therapeutic agents such as cytostacis and glucocorticoids ensure that invading microorganisms will be able to multiply. Drugs administered as <b>stress</b> <b>ulcus</b> prophylaxis give rise to a shift in the bacterial flora of the throat, thus laying the foundation for a lower respiratory tract infection. With regard to bacterial resistance, antibiotic therapy, especially when used as prophylaxis, results in the bacteria becoming less sensitive to the drugs, while reinforcing selective pressures. The hands of personnel as well as the therapeutic devices ranging from the respirator to the catheter are the chief sources of infection in intensive care units. Disinfection, antibiotic therapy and, possibly, extracorporeal elimination methods can be contemplated to selectively prevent the establishment and multiplication of microorganisms. However, only disinfectants are able to unleash their full destructive might against microbes, especially when used for medical devices that are not amenable to sterilization, even if their subsequent removal and, possibly, the issue of staff hand protection, can be a problem. While it is not easy to furnish proof of a direct link between efficient control and prevention methods and the incidence of infection, there is by now a consensus on the role of hand hygiene and of disinfection of the human body and of surfaces. In an age when medicine, in particular intensive care medicine, is at risk of becoming impaled on its own sword, disinfection could serve as a bulwark against rising infection rates...|$|E
