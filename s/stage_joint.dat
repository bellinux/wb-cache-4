These arrangements stipulate the buyout provisions for the members to dissolve or preserve the partnership at different development stages. This paper develops a theory of ownership {{based on the idea that}} ownership and buyout provisions are structured to prevent premature and inefficient dissolution of the partnership. The paper models a multi <b>stage</b> <b>joint</b> production partnership as a dynamic mechanism that provides for the efficient exchange of services among privately informed members. The mechanism is incentive compatible, expost efficient, budget balancing and interim individually rational. The mechanism is implemented by allocating property rights to minimize the value of the members’ buyout rights. As a result of this, members who demand excessive concessions to remain in the partnership are penalized with minimal buyout provisions. Applications of our analysis are provided to explain buyout options, property right allocations and investment programs that are observed in practice...|$|E

30|$|Asset specificity, {{resource}} sharing, {{and joint}} knowledge creation are necessary issues in collaboration. According to Heide [65], asset specificity is a transaction-specific investment involving physical or human assets, {{dedicated to a}} particular relationship and which cannot be redeployed easily. According to Cao and Zhang [42], resource sharing refers {{to the process of}} leveraging capabilities and assets and investing in capabilities and assets with supply chain partners. Essentially, these concepts drive entities to collaborate, when underlying resources are difficult to redeploy. Moreover, Cao and Zhang [42] and Malhotra et al. [66] explained joint knowledge creation as the extent to which supply chain partners develop a better understanding of and response to the market and competitive environment by working together. Examining these issues together, asset specificity and resource sharing are least related to partner behaviors but an investment. As such, it is inappropriate to represent partner behaviors in the perspective of investment. Concerning joint knowledge, while partner behaviors are dominant in operational <b>stage,</b> <b>joint</b> knowledge creation focuses more on strategic stage. Equally, it is inappropriate to qualify joint knowledge creation under behavioral perspective.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} factors {{influencing}} the internationalization of small family firms. Based {{on interviews with}} six family firms in Singapore, we highlight the importance of (1) family harmony, (2) trust in external relationships, (3) social and business networks, and (4) organizational resources and capabilities in the internationalization process. We show how the socioemotional wealth factors of trust and harmony affect networking and resources, which in turn affect internationalization. We find that initial internationalization through exports is enabled through trust in family networks, but the typical family characteristics {{of a desire to}} maintain family harmony and distrust of outsiders {{have a negative impact on}} network creation and resource development, which constrains the extent to which the firm internationalizes beyond exporting. In order to move from the first stage (exports/similar markets) to the second <b>stage</b> (<b>joint</b> ventures/different markets) of internationalization, less emphasis on trust and family harmony accompanied by more emphasis on building external networks and resources may be necessary.

30|$|We {{proposed}} a robust joint precoder-decoder design scheme for the PNC-based MIMO two-way relaying system when the perfect CSI is not available. In this design, minimizing weighted MSE problems are considered at both MA and BC stages. In the MA stage, PNC mapping is considered at the relay node. During the BC <b>stage,</b> <b>joint</b> design {{was needed to}} assist the decoding of the sum of two symbols at source nodes. The joint design problems became non-convex, and we divided those into sub-problems and solved them iteratively. Numerical results are presented by considering the BER performance, MSEwith different weight matrices, relay location, {{and the number of}} antennas. Our research demonstrated that the joint precoder-decoder design performs better than the other schemes. The weight matrix can be used to provide QoS requirements of multiple data streams in MIMO two-way channels. The midpoint is seen to be the best location for the relay node to assist two-way communication. The {{proposed a}}lgorithm converges in a fewer iterations, and the number of iterations increases slowly with the number of antennas. These findings can help to have less complex PNC operation, improve the error performances, and mitigate the half-duplex issue of cooperative relays.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a fast {{feed-forward}} blind equalizer with a two-stage generalized multilevel modulus algorithm (GMMA) and soft decision-directed (SDD) scheme {{was developed for}} high-order QAM cable receivers on broadcasting downstream wired cable channels. The proposed fast blind equalization algorithm uses a two-stage convergence strategy, and the modified SDD part applies an adaptively selected decision region. At the first convergence <b>stage,</b> <b>joint</b> GMMA and modified SDD equalization was applied for fast convergence. When the convergence process reached the steady state, the convergence detector changed the first equalization stage to the second stage. At the second stage, the modified SDD scheme reduced the mean square error (MSE) further. To prove the convergence, MSE analyses of two-stage GMMA+SDD/SDD blind equalization in the steady state were conducted. On the wired cable channel at 64, 256, and 1024 QAM modes, the proposed blind algorithm had a faster convergence speed than previous blind methods. The proposed algorithm also achieved a smaller MSE than the other methods at the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} new {{two-stage}} framework for joint analysis of head gesture and speech prosody patterns of a speaker towards automatic realistic synthesis of head gestures from speech prosody. In {{the first stage}} analysis, we perform Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based unsupervised temporal segmentation of head gesture and speech prosody features separately to determine elementary head gesture and speech prosody patterns, respectively, for a particular speaker. In the second <b>stage,</b> <b>joint</b> analysis of correlations between these elementary head gesture and prosody patterns is performed using Multi-Stream HMMs to determine an audio-visual mapping model. The resulting audio-visual mapping model is then employed to synthesize natural head gestures from arbitrary input test speech given a head model for the speaker.

However, for most patients with osteoarthritis, surgical treatment never becomes necessary, and their symptoms can be dealt with satisfactorily by self management, by non-pharmacological treatment or by pharmacological treatment. Osteoarthritis is not one single disease, but should rather be seen as a common final <b>stage,</b> <b>joint</b> failure, where the initial stages of the disease process can be triggered by many different causes. The main symptoms are joint pain, stiffness and limited mobility, which may lead to impairment and handicap. When the disease is far advanced an X-ray examination will show signs in the form of reduced joint space and osteophytes. These changes to the structure of the joint are caused by the destruction of the articular cartilage and the growth of bone deposits at the margins of the joints. Today there is no treatment which can stop the progress of the arthritic disease and joint destruction in osteoarthritis, but there is a series of treatments which can reduce the pain and help to maintain or improve function...|$|E

40|$|Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is {{a chronic}} auto-immune disease {{characterized}} by painful {{inflammation of the}} joints and surrounding tissues, leading to long term disability. Rheumatoid arthritis can begin at any age but has its peak between 35 to 55 years of age. RA shows hereditary linkage. Women and smokers are most often affected. The patient doesn’t feel any symptoms during inactive state of the disease. RA progresses in a symmetrical pattern involving both {{the sides of the}} body. Once rheumatoid arthritis is confirmed by diagnosis, treatment should start as early as possible. The treatment for rheumatoid arthritis focuses initially on reducing the joint inflammation and pain with the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents. In the next <b>stage,</b> <b>joint</b> function is restored by administering Disease Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) thus preventing joint deformity. Treatment is generally based on the degree of severity of RA.

Slow acting drugs like (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, lelflunomide etc., and Body’s reaction modifiers (BRMs) such as rituximab, anankinra, infliximab etc., are reserved for patients suffering from moderate to severe RA.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the life-history of an institutional complex, namely the emergence, functioning and breakdown of joint central regulation in Sweden. Institutionalisation {{is divided into}} four stages and comparisons are made with Denmark, Norway and Britain at each stage. The first stage was {{the formation of the}} labour movement between l 880 and l 898. Union organisation developed from a local craft unionism to a class-wide federation. The class-wide character of this federation is explained in terms of the influence of socialism and the movement away from craft unionism, which are in turn related to Sweden's industrialisation and democratisation. The second stage was the employer counter-attack during {{the first decade of the}} twentieth century. An escalatory pattern of conflict developed in the engineering industry and then at federal level, the existence of a class-wide union federation stimulating the class-wide organisation of the employers. Out of this conflict came an embryonic joint central regulation, though the defeat of the 1909 general strike led to a reversion to decentralised industrial relations. The third stage saw the establishment of joint central regulation with the negotiation of the 1938 Basic Agreement. While inherited organisational structures were a necessary condition, Social Democrat government precipitated the 1938 compromise but only after attempts to further develop state regulation had failed. Although an organised opposition had developed within labour, the main resistance to joint central regulation came from a group of employers. In the fourth, postwar, <b>stage</b> <b>joint</b> central regulation culminated in the institutionalising of central wage negotiations. The expansion of the public sector, economic growth and intensified political conflict then undermined joint central regulation, though it also had certain self-undermining features. In the 1970 's industrial conflict and legislative regulation increased, as the corporatist integration of industrial relations broke down...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHip {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) {{is characterized}} by cartilage degradation, subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophyte formation. Nowadays, OA is thought to develop via different etiologies that all lead to a similar form of end <b>stage</b> <b>joint</b> degradation. One of these subtypes is related to an abnormal shaped hip joint, like acetabular dysplasia and a cam deformity. These bony abnormalities are highly predictive for development of hip OA, but {{they are likely to}} already be present from childhood. This suggests that these deformations induce OA changes in the hip, well before extensive hip degradation becomes present three to four decades later. Accurate detection and successful characterization of these early OA events might lead to better treatment options for hip OA besides nowadays available invasive joint replacement surgery. However, current diagnostic imaging techniques like radiographs or plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are not sensitive enough to detect these subtle early OA changes. Nor are they able to disentangle intertwined and overlapping cascades from different OA subtypes, and neither can they predict OA progression. New and more sensitive imaging techniques might enable us to detect first OA changes on a cellular level, providing us with new opportunities for early intervention. In this respect, shape analysis using radiography, MRI, computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) /CT, and positron emission tomography (PET) might prove promising techniques and be more suited to detect early pathological changes in the hip joint. A broad application of these techniques might give us more understanding what can be considered physiological adaptation of the hip, or when early OA really starts. With a more clear definition of early OA, more homogenous patient populations can be selected and help with the development of new disease modifying OA interventions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the status quo of {{communication}} evaluation and measurement practices in communication departments of companies, non-profits, and other organizations across Europe. Design/methodology/approach: The study argues that the challenge to conduct reliable measurement is threefold: first, communication professionals have to understand and develop skills how to conduct evaluation; second, they have to evaluate whether communication activities have reached those goals in practice; and finally, they have to use those insights to advance and manage their future activities. These aspects are elaborated in the literature review. A quantitative survey of 1, 601 professionals from 40 European countries was conducted to research prerequisites, implementation and benefits of communication measurement and compare practices across types of organizations. Findings: Although robust knowledge of empirical research methods and their application for measuring communication effects is indispensable, many practitioners lack the necessary expertise to conduct reliable evaluation and measurement. Communication departments seldom measure communication effects on stakeholders and organizational goals. Many remain focused on media and channels. Last but not least, organizations do not fully exploit the potential of measurement data for strategically planning future communication activities. Practical implicatio: The findings highlight the need to reconsider current education and training in communication research methods and their application in corporate practice. Knowledge about conducting applied research is as important as asking meaningful questions and using insights for management decisions in a corporate environment. Evaluation methods are often discussed, but individual skills and the organizational use of insights are important as well. This might be tackled through additional training in social science research techniques, sophisticated valuation methods, and decision making. Originality/value: The large-scale study shows that communication measurement practices are still in a nascent <b>stage.</b> <b>Joint</b> efforts of academics and professional associations have not really changed the situation until now. The three dimensions used in this research (skills, practices, and utilization) can be used to assess the measurement readiness of individual organizations, to conduct further research in other regions, and to identify future challenges for advancing the field...|$|E
