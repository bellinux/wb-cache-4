5000|$|The <b>Spits</b> of the Sea of Azov are narrow {{strips of}} land in the Sea of Azov which can be as long as 112 km (Arabat <b>Spit,</b> the world's longest <b>spits),</b> 45 km (Fedotov <b>Spit),</b> 31 km (Achuevsk <b>Spit),</b> 30 km (Obitochna <b>Spit)</b> and 23 km (Berdyansk <b>Spit).</b> Their total length exceeds 300 km which is larger than the width of the sea (about 180 km).|$|R
50|$|North of the Arabat <b>Spit</b> is the Molochna Liman {{with the}} {{associated}} Fedotov <b>Spit</b> (45 km long) which are formed by the Molochna River. Farther north, between the Fedotov <b>Spit</b> and Obytochna <b>Spit</b> (30 km long), lies Obytochny Bay. Further north, between Obytochna <b>Spit</b> and Berdyansk <b>Spit</b> (23 km long), is Berdyansk Bay with two cities, Berdyansk (population 112,000) and Primorsk (population 13,900). Further north again lies Belosaraysk Bay with Belosaraysk <b>Spit,</b> formed by the river Kalmius. The major city in the area is Mariupol (population 491,600). Then, approaching the Taganrog Bay and very close to Taganrog, are the Mius Liman and Krivaya <b>Spit</b> formed by the Mius River.|$|R

5|$|This {{species is}} {{sometimes}} found in captivity, and wild-caught individuals are generally nervous {{and prone to}} <b>spitting.</b> Captive-bred animals tend {{to be much more}} docile and calm when compared to their wild-caught counterparts.|$|E
50|$|Wave {{refraction}} {{can occur}} {{at the end of}} a <b>spit,</b> carrying sediment around the end to form a hook or recurved <b>spit.</b> Refraction in multiple directions may create a complex <b>spit.</b> Waves that arrive in a direction other than obliquely along the <b>spit</b> will halt the growth of the <b>spit,</b> shorten it, or eventually destroy it entirely.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} islands and two sand <b>spits</b> which are {{contained}} within Mukim Serasa, they are; Pulau Pelong-Pelongan or Pelong Rocks (in English), Tanjong Pelumpong or Pelumpong <b>Spit</b> (also called the Muara <b>Spit)</b> {{which is a}} <b>spit</b> that has been cut {{and turned into a}} [...] "man-made" [...] island, the man-made Serasa <b>Spit</b> and the large Pulau Muara Besar.|$|R
50|$|Many rivers {{flowing into}} the Sea of Azov form bays, lagoons and limans. The sand, silt and shells they bring are {{deposited}} {{in the areas of}} reduced flow, that is the sides of the bays, forming narrow sandbanks called <b>spits.</b> Typical maximum depth in the bays and limans is a few metres. Because of shallow waters and abundant rivers, the <b>spits</b> are remarkably long and numerous in the sea - the Arabat <b>Spit</b> stretches over 112 km {{and is one of the}} world's longest spits; three other <b>spits,</b> Fedotov <b>Spit,</b> Achuevsk <b>Spit</b> and Obitochna <b>Spit,</b> are longer than 30 km. Most <b>spits</b> stretch from north to south and their shape can significantly change over just several years.|$|R
5|$|Growling: Often {{accompanied}} by hissing and <b>spitting,</b> the cheetah growls {{to show its}} annoyance, or when faced with danger. A study showed that growls consist of numerous short pulses with a combined duration of up to five seconds.|$|E
5|$|Giorgio Locatelli {{allegedly}} caused {{criminal damage}} to the restaurant later in 1999 by <b>spitting</b> at the wallpaper, resulting in an estimated £1,300 worth of damage, however the case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.

5|$|Her habits were parodied by the satirical 1980s {{television}} programme <b>Spitting</b> Image. She was portrayed by Juliet Aubrey in Bertie and Elizabeth, Sylvia Syms in The Queen, Natalie Dormer in W.E., Olivia Colman in Hyde Park on Hudson, Victoria Hamilton in The Crown, and in The King's Speech by Helena Bonham Carter, who {{was nominated for}} an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>spits</b> have {{triangular}} {{base and}} numerous lagoons on their west side. The ends of some <b>spits</b> are widened and bent westwards. Their shape rapidly varies with time. For example, the Arabat <b>Spit</b> (the {{largest and most}} stable <b>spit</b> on the Azov Sea) was formed only around 1100-1200 AD, and some <b>spits</b> were partly or entirely washed away by water currents. Many <b>spits</b> are used as resting ground by migrating birds (mostly ducks, geese, swans, sandpipers, great cormorants and seagulls, see e.g. [...] and [...] pictures) and therefore some are declared national nature reserves. Examples are Beglitsk,Belosaraysk, Krivaya and Berdyansk <b>Spits.</b> In addition to bird colonies, Belosaraysk and Berdyansk <b>Spits</b> also host more than 200 vegetation species each. Berdyansk <b>Spits</b> is remarkable by {{having one of the}} oldest lighthouses on the Azov Sea (160 years old). Petrushin <b>Spit</b> is historical in that in 1697, Peter I built a major fortress at its base. In July 1711, a Turkish landing operation was defeated there.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the controls upon {{the shape of}} freely extending <b>spits</b> using a one-contour-line model of shoreline evolution. In contrast to existing frameworks that suggest that <b>spits</b> are oriented {{in the direction of}} alongshore sediment transport and that wave refraction around the <b>spit</b> end is the primary cause of recurving, our results suggest that <b>spit</b> shoreline shapes are perhaps best understood as graded features arising from a complex interplay between distinct morphodynamic elements: the headland updrift of the <b>spit,</b> the erosive "neck" (which may be overwashing), and the depositional "hook". Between the neck and the hook lies a downdrift-migrating "fulcrum point" which tends towards a steady-state trajectory set by the angle of maximum alongshore sediment transport. Model results demonstrate that wave climate characteristics affect <b>spit</b> growth; however, we find that the rate of headland retreat exerts a dominant control on <b>spit</b> shape, orientation, and progradation rate. Interestingly, as a <b>spit</b> forms off of a headland, the rate of sediment input to the <b>spit</b> itself emerges through feedbacks with the downdrift <b>spit</b> end, and in many cases faster <b>spit</b> progradation may coincide with reduced sediment input to the <b>spit</b> itself. Furthermore, as the depositional hook rests entirely beyond the maximum in alongshore sediment transport, this shoreline reach is susceptible to high-angle wave instability throughout and, as a result, <b>spit</b> depositional signals may be highly autogenic...|$|R
5000|$|Biryuchyi Island (Бирючий Острів, [...] ) is a <b>spit</b> (former island) in {{the northwestern}} part of the Azov Sea, {{expanded}} {{southern part of the}} Fedotova <b>Spit.</b> Together with the narrow northern part of the Fedotova <b>Spit,</b> Biryuchyi Island forms the Utljuk Lyman separating it from the sea from the east. Until 1929, the current <b>Spit</b> was an island, separated from {{the northern part of the}} Fedotova <b>Spit</b> by a narrow strait.|$|R
5|$|In the UK, 13 {{seconds of}} the film was cut. The {{original}} film showed Rajinikanth throwing a firecracker into his mouth, lighting it and then <b>spitting</b> it out at Pattimanram Raja, which was removed to give the film a 12A rating, The Ayngaran UK DVD release was uncut and given an 18 rating by the BBFC. It {{was also the first}} Tamil film to be officially released on a 1080p High Definition Blu-ray disc.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>spitting</b> cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at a {{potential}} threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} satires of Thatcher as Prime Minister involved satirist John Wells (as writer and performer), actress Janet Brown (voicing Thatcher) and future <b>Spitting</b> Image producer John Lloyd (as co-producer), who in 1979 were teamed up by producer Martin Lewis for the satirical audio album The Iron Lady, which consisted of skits and songs satirising Thatcher's rise to power. The album was released in September 1979.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spits</b> {{occur when}} {{longshore}} drift reaches {{a section of}} headland where the turn is greater than 30 degrees. The <b>spit</b> will continue out into the sea until water pressure (e.g. from a river) becomes too great to allow the sand to deposit. Vegetation may then start to grow on the <b>spit,</b> and the <b>spit</b> may become stable and often fertile. A <b>spit</b> may be considered a special form of a shoal. As <b>spits</b> grow, the water behind them is sheltered from wind and waves, and a salt marsh is likely to develop.|$|R

British suffragette activist Kitty Marion, standing on New York street corners, sold the Review at 20 cents per copy, enduring death threats, heckling, <b>spitting,</b> physical abuse, and police harassment. Over {{the course of}} the following ten years, Marion was arrested nine times for her birth control advocacy.|$|E
5|$|The Summer Festival {{usually takes}} {{place over the}} fourth weekend of July. Events at the festival recall the lumbering history of the park. Log rolling, axe throwing, and {{cross-cut}} sawing events are held, as are horseshoe and seed <b>spitting</b> contests. Black Moshannon Lake is open to canoe races and fishing. A Saturday night bonfire party is held at the beach, with music and refreshments.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of <b>spitting</b> water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E

5000|$|A {{roasting}} jack is {{a machine}} which rotates meat roasting on a <b>spit.</b> It {{can also be}} called a <b>spit</b> jack, a <b>spit</b> engine or a turnspit, although this name can also refer to a human turning the <b>spit,</b> or a turnspit dog. [...] Cooking meat on a <b>spit</b> dates {{back at least to}} the 1st century BC, but at first <b>spits</b> were turned by human power. In Britain, starting in the Tudor period, dog-powered turnspits were used; the dog ran in a treadmill linked to the <b>spit</b> by belts and pulleys. Other forms of roasting jacks included the steam jack, driven by steam, the smoke jack, driven by hot gas rising from the fire, and the bottle jack or clock jack, driven by weights or springs.|$|R
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and <b>spitting</b> the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps {{disperse}} the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and <b>spitting</b> up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
