40|$|In {{foundational}} {{models of}} network formation, the mechanisms for link formation are {{based solely on}} network topology. For example, preferential attachment uses degree distributions, whereas a <b>strategic</b> <b>connections</b> model uses internode distances. These dynamics implicitly presume that such benefits and costs are instantaneous functions of the network topology. A more detailed model would include that benefits and costs are themselves derived through a dynamic process, which, {{in the absence of}} time-scale separation, necessitates a coevolutionary analysis. This paper introduces a new coevolutionary model of strategic network formation. In this model, network formation evolves along with the flow of benefits from one node to another. We examine the emergent equilibria of this combined dynamics of network formation and benefit flow. We show that the class of strict equilibria is stable (or robust to small perturbations in the benefits flows). ...|$|R

This study examines how co-speech hand gestures mimicking pitch contours in space affect non-native Mandarin tone perception. Native English as well as Mandarin perceivers identified tones with either congruent (C) or incongruent (I) Audio+Face (AF) and Audio+Face+Gesture (AFG) input. Mandarin perceivers performed at ceiling rates in the Congruent conditions, but showed a partially gesture-based response in AFG-I, revealing that gestures were perceived as valid cues for tone. The English group’s performance was better in congruent than incongruent AF and AFG conditions. Their identification rates were also highly skewed towards the visual tone when gesture was presented in the AFG compared to AF conditions. These results indicate positive effects of facial and especially gestural input on non-native tone perception, suggesting that crossmodal resources can be recruited to aid auditory perception when phonetic demands are high...|$|R

Clustered networks where banks hold very similar portfolios are compared with unclustered networks where they hold less correlated portfolios. The network structure plays a role only in the case of short term financing, when investors condition their debt rollover decision on a signal revealing potential future bank defaults. We show that, {{depending on the size of}} costs banks incur when they default, the arrival of a negative signal can lead to early liquidation in a clustered network but not in an unclustered one so the latter can be superior. But if such a signal leads to early liquidation in both networks then the clustered network can be superior. ∗We are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from our discussant Richard Weber and par...|$|R
50|$|Designed by François-Alexis Cendrier, the Gare de la Bastille {{was one of}} Paris's {{earliest}} railway termini.

The Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Paris à Strasbourg was granted a concession to build the line, and a connecting line to Mulhouse. The Mulhouse line would share the Gare de Strasbourg (now the Gare de Paris-Est), but the Ligne de Vincennes would also create a new terminus close to the centre of Paris, the Gare de la Bastille. In 1853, the company, {{now known as the}} Chemins de fer de l'Est (CF de l'Est), opened the 17 km-long line between Vincennes and La Varenne.

In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of <b>strategic</b> <b>connections</b> such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the Bronx, and other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|R

In this presentation I will attempt to link four concepts, which are probably well known to most of us but are not commonly treated in the same discourse: moral economy, risk society, multi-level governance and flexible rigidities. I see it important to make these connections, because flexibility has become the Leitmotiv of contemporary European industrial relations policy. Dismantling long-established regulatory standards is almost universally presented as an unavoidable response to the imperatives of competitiveness.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the most recent results of the {{progressive}} cultural district model. In particular, it explores what the Marche Region has achieved in terms of improving the cultural heritage. The system of values referring to the heritage {{can be related to}} local development in order to increase territorial competitiveness. One of the tools developed in recent years is the progressive cultural district, which recognises a <b>strategic</b> <b>connection</b> between different cultural areas belonging to various production sectors. The progressive cultural district is characterised by a complex organisational structure that involves various subjects interested in the local development process. If the cultural sector is identified as a bearer of development, the architectural heritage must also be assessed according to different logic. A proper program creates a series of opportunities to produce value in terms of innovation. In an initial phase, the construction of the Marche Cultural District has been oriented towards knowledge of the cultural heritage in order to highlight its potential values. With this knowledge, a second phase has begun in favour of new territorial planning. Forms of cooperation in creating the shared objectives system can give rise to a transformation process that allows for increasing orientation towards a new economic policy for the protection and improvement of the cultural heritage...|$|E

Indeed, for many interventions, a person’s <b>strategic</b> <b>connection</b> to the most marginal people in a community, school or workplace could be the most important criteria (a concept better reflected by a person’s betweenness centrality score).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretically informed {{social history of}} the New Zealand Needle Exchange Programme (NEP) which has operated since 1988. Close {{attention is paid to}} how this 'harm reduction' programme demonstrates a pattern of 'peer-professional' hybridity - a form of quasiprofessionalism developed by injecting drug user (IDU) peers who began operating private needle exchanges funded by both illicit clients and state agencies. In this hybrid mechanism, the personal distrust required to pursue 'criminal' motivations has been connected, through the vulnerable yet influential intermediaries of peers and syringes, to the trust required to 'empower' the health of marginalised IDU communities. This research has drawn on immersed participant experience and on accounts from archival documents, supported by interviews. A reworking of actor-network methodologies has provided a core analytical approach to tracing the critical moments and boundary-shifts in the development and realignments of the NEP's hybrid heterogeneous assemblages. The assembling and reassembling has entangled policy goals, technologies, historical reviews, stigma, laws, logics, logistic systems, narratives, organisations, sterile and bloody syringes, monitoring systems, and professional occupations. IDU, health policy officials, peerprofessionals, managers, politicians, HIV/AIDS community organisers, and medical professionals have prevented HIV transmission by altering key <b>strategic</b> <b>connections</b> and alignments within this active network, while pursuing their public-private interests. The peer-professionals have publicly represented IDU, have advocated professionally for inclusive rather than exclusive public health provisions, while guaranteeing that the monitoring of syringes by state agencies would not harm IDU. The difficulties in shaping and stabilising the NEP have illustrated the 'messy reality' of its institutional and policy environment, yet have also led to highly successful and sustainable health promotion work...|$|R
