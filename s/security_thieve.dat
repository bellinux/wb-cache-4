50|$|Another {{security}} risk present {{is that of}} theft. Sometimes no method of securing items is provided, but even lockable lockers or baskets are usually designed for only minimal <b>security</b> allowing experienced <b>thieves</b> to steal the valuable items which people typically have with them before changing. Changing room operators frequently post signs waiving responsibility for stolen items, which discourage but do not eliminate claims for negligence.|$|R
50|$|At work, one of Koistinen's colleagues mockingly {{asks about}} his successes with women. Koistinen grabs the man, but stops himself from {{striking}} him {{and goes to}} his rounds. Mirja meets him and asks him to come and talk. Koistinen signs off and leaves with Mirja in his car. Mirja drugs Koistinen and passes his keys to one of Lindholm's contacts. Using Koistinen's keys and <b>security</b> code, the <b>thieves</b> rob a jewellery store at the mall.|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, governments put {{pressure}} on motor vehicle manufacturers to provide better <b>security</b> for vehicles. <b>Thieves</b> could steal cars and lorries with relative ease. The manufacturers responded by introducing electronic systems {{to make it more}} difficult for vehicles to be stolen without the key. However, as with most forms of technology, the software can be bypassed. In recent years, thieves have manipulated weaknesses in the technology, so that vehicles can be stolen without the key...|$|R
50|$|The Udayarpalayam taluk of the Ariyalur District, in Tamil Nadu, India {{has nearly}} 463 ancient temples, of which 200 {{belong to the}} Chola period dated 9th to 10th century AD. Most of these temples haven't seen {{maintenance}} for many decades and have lax <b>security.</b> Local <b>thieves</b> used to target the idols for their metal content, usually melting them. Some idols are pure gold, silver and panchaloha — five precious metals. However, the entry of international smuggling cartels has changed the situation. With antique Chola art being worth millions in the international market, idol thieves were recruited to lift them from the temples. In 2008, one such gang allegedly recruited by New York-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor was responsible for stealing eight idols from the Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan, 18 idols from the Varadharaja Perumal temple, and in 2010, 6 panchaloha idols from Chozeeshwarar temple at Vikiramangalam.|$|R
5000|$|Anti-theft {{measures}} taken for registered motor vehicles {{are often not}} used on construction equipment: open cabs of construction equipment can be easy for thieves to access; equipment often has [...] "one key fits all" [...] ignition systems; construction equipment often does not have standardized vehicle identification numbers or serial numbers, and when they do, thieves often remove the numbers; title and registration for the equipment are not mandated. Recordkeeping for construction equipment is often poor, making identification of recovered items difficult. Large construction equipment is used to flatten a <b>security</b> fence before <b>thieves</b> leave a storage or construction site.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} technological changes and developments in international transportation is the foundation and prevalence of containers in this area. Nowadays, operators of transportation and trade use containers because of their high strength, the ability to store them {{on top of each}} other on the ship, its water proof material, no need for a covered storage room, the fact that it can easily and quickly be loaded onto a ship, truck, or train, fast transportation, minimum cargo damage during cargo operation & transportation, its <b>security</b> against <b>thieves,</b> they are reusable, packages can be sorted like trays, and they can be used on refrigerated ships since each container has a set of goods with a packing list and the accumulation of these goods in one large package decreases the number of packing lists and at the same time decreases the number of customs documents. Considering this topic, the dangers related to the ship’s stability while loading and discharging containers in ports will be reviewed and solutions will be brought up.

2500|$|Issa {{was able}} to use his {{knowledge}} of the weaknesses in automotive <b>security</b> that car <b>thieves</b> preyed on to develop effective theft deterrents. Using sensors that, when armed, would detect motion and pressure on the body of the car, his device would create loud noise to draw attention to a would-be car thief, such as the car's horn honking or a speaker playing a recording with Issa's voice saying: [...] "Protected by Viper. Stand back" [...] and [...] "Please step away from the car", warnings for DEI's signature product, the Viper car alarm. Sales grew from a million dollars in the company's first year to $14 million by 1989.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, two men {{entered the}} Knightsbridge Safe Deposit Centre and {{requested}} to rent a safe deposit box. After being shown into the vault, they drew handguns and subdued the manager and <b>security</b> guards. The <b>thieves</b> then hung a sign on the street-level door explaining that the Safe Deposit Centre was temporarily closed, whilst letting in further accomplices. They broke open many of the safe deposit boxes and left with a hoard estimated to be worth £60 million (equivalent to roughly US$98 million at the 1987 exchange rate; the inflation-adjusted value would be £105 million ($174 million) [...] ). However, the true value of the haul was only estimated, as those renting the boxes may have, for various reasons, not accurately reported the contents.|$|R
30|$|The wide {{applications}} of {{various forms of}} networks and the Internet of the Things (IoT) as well as simultaneously the growing cloud computing architecture with the big data complexity are the remarkable challenge to the image steganography. In recent times, various government and private medical organizations are continuously migrating into the cloud and mobile environments with {{the increasing use of}} networking services. These systems require large-scale medical data centers for medical data storage. In store-forward version of the telemedicine, the doctor examines the medical image along with the patient data which are transmitted from remote places. Since the medical images and the data are transmitted from remote places, security parameters such as authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and availability have to be taken care of. The advent of high-speed Internet technology has changed the way patients receive medical care by expediting diagnosis and allowing immediate treatment. However, this incredible tool comes with a security onus, especially when sensitive patient information is transmitted. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), in fact, imposed regulations for data security and privacy under the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 [1, 2]. In recent years, several architectures for secure storage and transmission of medical records and patient identification information have been proposed, both for real- and semi-real-time applications like blood glucose monitoring, secure telemedicine [3], and non-real-time applications that involve maintaining and sharing medical records and databases. Most of these architectures, however, rely on some form of cryptography. Cryptographic techniques encrypt the medical records with a password and assume that only authorized parties have access to the password. While this does work most of the time, the encrypted data are prone to prying <b>security</b> <b>thieves,</b> who could decipher sensitive information like the patients’ insurance service provider, medication history, etc. Steganography provides an extremely effective alternative to this problem, hiding the very existence of sensitive data by concealing the data in a “carrier.” The objective of image steganography is to hide secret information in nondescript areas of the carrier image such that the changes made to the image are imperceptible, and the secret information itself is retrievable only by authorized, informed personnel [4]. As a consequence, a medical network system is considered as a network requiring high security that excellent protections and managerial strategies are inevitable to prevent illegal events and external attacks from happening. Since the debut of this era, one of the most intelligible terms of medical information technology and communication is the security of medical records and patient’s personal information like unique id, name of the patients, disease name, etc. Steganography is a method of secret communication in which secret information is embedded into other information, various multimedia files.|$|R
