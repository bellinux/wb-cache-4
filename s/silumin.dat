40|$|Purpose. As a rule {{secondary}} <b>silumins</b> {{are characterized}} by lower quality than their primary analogues. During manufacture of alloys a large quantity of intermetallides, first of all {{on the basis of}} iron, in their structure is ignored. To achieve the optimum level of properties it is necessary to search for ways to adapt refining-modifying, heat and laser treatments to peculiarities of the structure of secondary Al-Si alloys. Methodology. The research was carried out by using standard methods of metallographic analysis, determination of foundry, mechanical and service properties of alloys according to rotatable plans of multifactor experiments. Findings. It was established, that refiningmodifying treatment is a required procedure during manufacture of secondary <b>silumins</b> as it permits to effectively influence the iron-containing phases' segregations by changing their morphology, size and distribution and to increase the effectiveness of further treatment in solid state. It was found that standard modes of heat treatment are not optimal for secondary <b>silumins.</b> Laser treatment has shown high effectiveness in increasing of strength, wear resistance, corrosion and cavitation resistance of secondary Al-Si alloys, and the increased iron content contributed to additional solid solution hardening. Originality. It was established, that after refining-modifying treatment the phase Al 5 SiFe, which crystallizes in the shape of long stretched plates transformed into phase Al 15 (FeMn) 3 Si 2 in skeletal or polyhedral shape. The relationship between iron content in secondary <b>silumins</b> and holding time during heat treatment that ensures optimum of mechanical properties was obtained. It was proved that the presence of ironcontaining intermetallides Al 5 SiFe results in the decrease of hardened layer's depth during laser treatment.

40|$|Purpose: The study {{presents}} the results of investigations carried out on <b>silumins</b> with additions of Mg, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mo and W. The <b>silumins</b> containing Mg, Cu and Ni are well-known and commonly used in construction of machines and equipment. Design/methodology/approach: Additions of Cr, Mo and W have not been thoroughly investigated yet. They are considered a new family of innovative cast aluminium alloys. Findings: In Al-Si systems they form silicides, like Cr 3 Si, Mo 3 Si, W 3 Si and intermetallic phases of Al 13 Cr 4 Si 4, Al 12 Mo, Al 12 W and AlWSi. The silicides crystallise in cubic lattice of parameters similar to aluminium and silicon. Research limitations/implications: Therefore they can act as crystallisation substrates and occur as separate phases. The examinations under the microscope and X-ray microanalysis of the linear and point distribution of elements confirmed the presence of the above mentioned phases. A combination of two elements, e. g. Cr and Mo, or Cr and W, was observed to cause the formation of complex silicide layers of Mo 3 Si and (Cr, Mo) 3 Si, or Cr 3 Si as well as (W, Cr) 3 Si. Originality/value: The presence of the silicides has been indicated as a possible source of the refinement of α(Al) and β(Si) phases. The precipitations of these phases and of the intermetallic phases favour a high degree of the <b>silumins</b> hardening. A characteristic feature is the fact that nucleation and crystallisation of the successive phases takes place at the phase boundaries formed between the previously precipitated phase and solid solution α. The studies carried out so far have indicated that in complex <b>silumins</b> at high temperatures crystallise the silicides and peritectic phases of Al 12 W, AlWSi, Al 12 Mo and Al 13 Cr 4 Si 4. Phases α or β are the next ones to crystallise, followed by complex eutectic α + β +Al(Si, Cr, Mo, W, Fe). Further crystallise the phases of Mg 2 Si, Al 3 Ni and Al 2 Cu.
