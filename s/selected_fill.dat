Each newer version can import and Save As into the older versions formats. Older versions can't necessarily deal with the newer versions files. This cheat sheet will deal with version 97 / 98 / 2000. Note that Excel 2000 has some non-critical features (none covered here) which are ignored if the subsequent file is opened in earlier versions. Also, menu options in Excel 2000 are often hidden—click the double-arrow {{at the bottom of the}} menu to reveal additional options. Help: The help is context sensitive. If you're in a pop-up window the help button within that window gives you help specific to that task. You can search for help by name, but it helps if you know what Excel calls a particular feature. It may be useful to look first for a more general topic (or one that's somewhat tangential to your actual goal) that will tell you the name of the feature you're interested in. Once you know the name you can go directly to help on that topic. Data Entry and Formatting: The pointer changes to reflect what will happen when you click in a given location. Here are some examples: This pointer…pops up when you point to: Menu, Tool Bar, Scroll Bar Text in a cell. This is the insertion bar A cell when you are in selection mode The fill handle at the corner of a <b>selected</b> <b>fill</b> or range. A column or row heading boundary which can then be resized A split box on the scroll bar Numerical formatting (scientific notation, number of decimal places, etc.) and Text formatting are under Format [...] Cell, including aWrap Text option under the Alignment tab. Changes apply to all selected cells or just the selected portion of a single cell. This can be useful to get a special character (like greek letters from the symbol font), or a subscript mixed plain text. Double-clicking column and row boundaries at the edge of the sheet resizes the column or row to fit the data...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a field and numerical studies performed to understand the long-term performance of a bridge approach embankment designed with lightweight, expanded clay and shale (ECS) aggregates to mitigate the settlements on a soft soil foundation. The ECS aggregates and traditional <b>select</b> <b>fill</b> were used to build southern and northern approach embankments, respectively, for a bridge on State Highway 360 in Arlington, Texas. An extensive series of laboratory tests were conducted to obtain the engineering behavior of ECS and the <b>select</b> <b>fill</b> materials before the construction. These properties were then used in the finite element modeling to simulate the embankment sections to verify the long-term performance. The embankment sections were instrumented with vertical inclinometers to monitor the lateral movements {{for more than four}} years. This data was used to validate the numerical models with an acceptable amount of accuracy. Then a parametric study was conducted for varied heights of embankments, thicknesses of foundation soil and also compression/recompression indices of foundation soil to develop design charts. The numerical, as well as field data, indicate that there is a two-thirds reduction in settlement of the foundation soil {{with the use of the}} lightweight material. The pre-consolidation pressure and the overconsolidation ratios govern the settlement behavior of the foundation soil due to lightweight embankments. The design charts can be useful in either predicting the embankment settlements for a given ECS embankment configuration or determine the allowable height of the ECS embankment for a specified settlement value when constructing in similar foundation soil encountered in this study...|$|R
