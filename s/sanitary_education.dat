40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the recent {{attention of the}} water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector to resolving the menstrual hygiene crisis for young girls in developing countries. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) interventions, {{including the use of}} <b>sanitary</b> pads, <b>education,</b> and awareness, and where possible separate, sanitary toilets, are identified to have far-reaching impacts on the education and empowerment of girls. Field research conducted in Ghana's Northern Region indicates a pronounced socialized, sexualized understanding and experience of menstruation among young girls and their families, school teachers, and local NGOs. Unfortunately WASH initiatives only allow interventions to manage menstrual hygiene, leaving the young girls and others in their social settings to deal with the larger subset of sexuality issues. We argue that opening the dominant discourse of a medicalized concept of menstruation to other meanings and experiences will have significant implications for the education and empowerment of young adolescent girls...|$|R

Rising population, shrinking agricultural land, increasing demand for water resources, widespread land degradation and inadequate infrastructure appear to be major concerns of the agriculture sector in Pakistan. An attempt has been made to examine the population growth–agriculture growth–poverty alleviation linkage. It is argued that agriculture will continue to be one of the most important sectors of Pakistan’s economy for years to come. To alleviate poverty, it is suggested that Pakistan enhance the productivity of the agriculture sector through the provision of a series of inputs including provision of easy credit to the small farmer, availability of quality fertilizers and pesticides, tractor and harvester services, improvement in the effectiveness of the vast irrigation system and, finally, farmer education. It is concluded that the high rate of population growth needs to be curbed for increased agricultural productivity to have any significant effect on poverty in rural areas of Pakistan...|$|R

The post-treatment is based on autotrophic nitrogen removal. The challenges are classified in terms of operational features and system configuration, namely: (i) the short-term effects of organic carbon source, the COD/N ratio and the temperature on the autotrophic nitrogen removal; the results from this study confirms that the Anammox activity is strongly influenced by temperature, in spite of the COD source and COD/N ratios applied. (ii) The long-term performance of the Anammox process under low nitrogen sludge loading rate (NSLR) and moderate to low temperatures; it demonstrates that NSLR affects nitrogen removal efficiency, granular size and biomass concentration of the bioreactor.

40|$|Introduction This study {{evaluates the}} factors {{associated}} {{with the development of}} severe periportal fibrosis in patients with Schistosoma mansoni. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to December 2012 involving 178 patients infected with S. mansoni who were treated in the Hospital das Cl&# 237;nicas of Pernambuco, Brazil. Information regarding risk factors was obtained using a questionnaire. Based on the patients' epidemiological history, clinical examination, and upper abdomen ultrasound evaluation, patients were divided into 2 groups: 137 with evidence of severe periportal fibrosis and 41 patients without fibrosis or with mild or moderate periportal fibrosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using EpiInfo software version 3. 5. 5. Results Illiterate individuals (30. 1 %) and patients who had more frequent contact with contaminated water in towns in the Zona da Mata of Pernambuco (33. 2 %) were at greater risk for severe periportal fibrosis. Based on multivariate analysis, it was determined that an education level of up to 11 years of study and specific prior treatment for schistosomiasis were preventive factors for severe periportal fibrosis. Conclusions The prevailing sites of the severe forms of periportal fibrosis are still within the Zona da Mata of Pernambuco, although there has been an expansion to urban areas and the state coast. Specific treatment and an increased level of education were identified as protective factors, indicating the need for implementing social, <b>sanitary,</b> and health <b>education</b> interventions aimed at schistosomiasis to combat the risk factors for this major public health problem...|$|R

Since the fishery of the lake turned commercial in 1980 's due to the boom of Nile perch Lates niloticus, one expects the living conditions of these fishers and indeed the riparian communities to be changing. However, the reverse is what is being observed, WHY? This has been the concern of several people and of the ongoing Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP).

Nearly 61 % of the country’s populations live in rural areas. In Pakistan poverty has been increased in rural areas and is higher than urban areas. Of the total rural population 65 % are directly or indirectly linked with agriculture sector. In Pakistan more than 44. 8 % people generate their income from agriculture sector, and the higher rate of increase in poverty in the rural areas has provoked debate on growth and productivity trends in the agriculture sector. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to determine such factors which affect the poverty status of a rural household. Utilizing unique IFPRI (International Food and Policy Research Institute) panel data together with sub-sample of PRHS (Pakistan Rural Household Survey) for two districts of Punjab (Attock and Faisalabad) the present study aim at analyzing and estimating the rural poverty trends and determinants of rural poverty from the late 1980 ’s to 2002.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 students in June 2014 to determine STH and S. mansoni infections prevalence. Moreover, the knowledge of students about STH and S. mansoni was assessed. Data on knowledge and clinical symptoms were collected using structured questionnaires via face to face interview. Stool specimens were examined by formol-ether concentration method. The overall prevalence of intestinal helminths infections was 85. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 82. 1 - 89 %). STHs infections prevalence was 65. 6 % (95 % CI: 60. 7 - 70. 2 %). The prevalence of hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura were 31. 8 % (95 % CI: 27. 3 - 36. 6 %), 29. 4 % (25 - 31 %) and 3. 1 % (1. 8 - 5. 4 %), respectively.

40|$|Byrne, JohnClimate {{change and}} {{sustainable}} development are both challenging issues for developing countries, as they need to allocate their limited financial, human and technical resources to more immediate and urgent needs such as <b>education,</b> <b>sanitary</b> and infrastructure construction. Policy objectives on climate change and development may be conflicting {{in the short term}} but they could also be complementary. This dissertation explores potential synergies between climate change mitigation {{and sustainable development}} policies and proposes to integrate policy objectives of climate change mitigation and sustainable development in developing countries. Particularly, this dissertation focuses on China as China is currently undergoing a fundamental change in the social economy and China already became the largest GHGs emissions in the world. This dissertation investigates, at the national level, whether China's sustainable development policies climate friendly and whether China's climate change mitigation policies contribute to national sustainable development. Integration of climate change mitigation and sustainable development policy objectives in {{the development and implementation of}} CDM program is examined, which is partially because that CDM is designed with twin objectives on emissions reduction and sustainable development, and partially due to the fact that China alone accounts for more than half of the global CDM market. Both qualitative and quantitative methodologies are applied in this dissertation. Qualitatively, this dissertation reviews current status quo of social economic development, as well as challenges for climate change and sustainable development policies. Then this dissertation discusses China's climate change mitigation policies and sustainable development policies from the perspectives of policy objectives, budgeting and institutional governance. Balancing regional differences and sustainable energy development as two important issues that integrate climate change mitigation and sustainable development policies are carefully examined. The results turn out that there are only moderate integration of climate change mitigation and sustainable development in the energy sector. Quantitatively, this dissertation discusses China's CDM program development, implementation, and management. Despite the rapid increase of projects, China's CDM projects are concentrated in Wind (41 %) and Hydro (36 %) projects, but revenues from CERs (certified emission reductions) to date are mainly from HFCs (46 %), Hydro (16 %), and Wind and N 2 O projects (12 % respectively). Provinces with abundant hydro and wind resources, mainly Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia, which are also with lower GDP per capita, host far more CDM projects than any other provinces, but CER revenues to date are from Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, where higher GDP per capita generated. An examination on capacity building identifies that the capacity on monitoring and verifying emission reductions in China remains weak. Regression analysis for 2005 ??? 2011 projects and 2005 ??? 2012 projects finds out there is no indication of climate change and sustainable development objectives in the development and implementation of China's CDM projects. The analysis results indicate that the integration of climate change and sustainable development policy objectives at the national level is weak. There is moderate integration in the energy sector, but further integration is needed in the process of setting policy objectives, budgeting and institutional governance for better integrating climate change mitigation and sustainable development policies at the national level. With regard to China's CDM program, it is understood that project development and registration of CDM projects is largely influenced by overseas CERs buyers who would eventually pay for emission reductions resulted from project implementation, while what the Chinese government could do is to select projects that are more beneficial for sustainable development. However, the regression analysis shows there is little integration of climate change mitigation and sustainable development objectives in CDM implementation. Currently China is engaged in developing domestic carbon scheme, where the lessons and experiences learned from the CDM market should be applied to better integrate climate change and sustainable development objectives.

Dentro of the economic factors that influence in the self-medication completely highlight the unemployment, the bad work conditions and of life of most of the population and mainly the first floor economic family entrance that doesn't allow them to consent to the services of health that which is translated in the prescription lack by an enabled professional. Dentro of the cultural factors influences the access lack and scarce readiness of information what allows to the pharmaceutical companies to diffuse slanted information that it incites the population to the consumption of supposedly very sure fármacos, this is also joined to the <b>sanitary</b> faulty <b>education</b> with which we count and social-family aspect that allows to improve the knowledge on the rational use of the medication. Objective. To determine the Factors that Influence in the self-medication in people adults in the Four Populated Centers of Half Cuenca of the River Nanay. District San Juan Baustista, 2010. Methodology. Presently investigation work, you uses Qualitative and Quantitative method and a type of Descriptive, Prospective design, Correlacional and Traverse because it has allowed us to determine the factors that influence in the Selfmedication. Main Discoveries. You determines the factors that influence in the self-medication in mature 320 people 20 years old to 59 years of age, both sexes and they were found that the self-medication that one carries out in the 4 rural centers was bigger in the residents of Llanchama with 65. 8 %. The mature population carries out the purchase of the medications in the ambulatory market and with more prevalence Nina's inhabitants carried out it Rumi with 49. 1 %; The medication that the residents of Llanchama acquired was the dolocordralan NF pill with 28. 0 % and the one diagnoses but recurrent it was pain in general with 40. 0 % in this center town. The self-medication that the inhabitants of the 4 rural centers carried out, was with adult it prevailed those that has grade of primary instruction, standing out in Llanchama with 47. 4 % same.

One carries out a bigger self-medication in Port Almonds and it was of the feminine sex with 36. 8 % and in LLanchama of the masculine sex with 36. 8 %; The predominant age of the 4 rural centers went from 50 to 59 years with an average of 35. 05 % in the towns of Zungarococha, Nina Rumi and Llanchama. Conclusions. A high self-medication exists in mature people in the four rural centers, with an average of 60. 03 %, but with more proportion the residents of Llanchama with 65. 8 % and in the illness that but they had self-medication it was the pain in general with 40. 0 % in this population and the acquisition they carried out it in an ambulatory market with 49. 1 % Nina's residents Rumi. The medication that but you automedicaron was the dolocordralan NF pill with 28. 0 % and the residents of Llanchama acquired it. TesisLa automedicación es un tipo de conducta que implica tomar medicamentos según la propia iniciativa del paciente, por consejo de un familiar, técnico sanitario o de cualquier persona no médica. Son muchos los factores que influyen en este tipo de conducta, destacando los factores sociales como la presión de grupo o de nuestros propios familiares que nos ofrecen una alternativa para la solución de nuestros problemas de salud basados en su propia experiencia. También influye el bajo nivel de instrucción de personas especialmente de los padres de familia, los cuales ignoran por completo el riesgo que implica la automedicación. Dentro de los factores económicos que influyen en la automedicación destacan el desempleo, las malas condiciones de trabajo y de vida de la mayoría de la población y sobre todo el bajo ingreso económico familiar que no les permite acceder a los servicios de salud lo cual se traduce en la falta de prescripción por un profesional capacitado. Dentro de los factores culturales influyen la falta de acceso y escasa disponibilidad de información lo que permite a las empresas farmacéuticas difundir información sesgada que incita a la población al consumo de fármacos supuestamente muy seguros, esto además se aúna a la deficiente educación sanitaria con la que contamos y aspecto social-familiar que permita mejorar los conocimientos sobre el uso racional del medicamento. Objetivo. Determinar los Factores que Influyen en la automedicación en personas adultos en los Cuatro Centros Poblados de la Cuenca Media del Río Nanay – Distrito San Juan Baustista, 2010. Metodología. En el presente trabajo de investigación, se utilizó método Cualitativo y Cuantitativo y un tipo de diseño Descriptivo, Prospectivo, Correlacional y Transversal porque nos ha permitido determinar los factores que influyen en la Automedicación...|$|R
40|$|The UN Convention on {{the rights}} of the child speaks not only about needs but about the rights of {{children}} from the moment of a birth. The Convention covers a wide scale of the rights consolidated in three basic categories: - The right to life, - The right for survival and development, - The right for protection and participation. The Convention provisions assume that children should live in the environment providing for realization of their rights starting from the right for a name and citizenship and ending with the medical and <b>sanitary</b> care and <b>education.</b> They have the right to shelter from torture, exploitation, arbitrary detention, and unreasonable deprivation of family care. Children have the right to participate in decisions concerning their lives and to participate in the life of the local community. The Convention is not the hierarchy of the rights and therefore, one right cannot possible have a higher priority in comparison with the other right. The Convention demonstrates that all rights of the child are equally important. Rights complement each other and provide for survival and development of the child. The countries-signatories to the Convention make a commitment to respect and ensure the whole complex of rights stipulated by the Convention for each child within the limits of the state jurisdiction without any discrimination (UN CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 1989, ARTICLE 2 (1)). The state and the family are responsible for guaranteeing, respecting, and realizing the rights of the child. It is widely accepted that the state has a central and a primarily beneficial role in the protection of young people. Therefore, even if children experience extreme abuse or are neglect from their families the state authorities are supposed to provide comfort to those children. In the field of childhood studies there has been plentiful debate about the role of the state in children´s lives. Less attention is given to the ways in which the state is a source of risk for children (BOYDEN 2007, P. 240). The present research tries to show that with an effort to limit the influx of illegal migrants to their own countries many governments fail to realize their obligations towards migrant children. In many cases for reasons of national security they try to limit the rights of the child, putting at stake a notion of childhood as a life phase free from political blemish: in legal terms at least, children are the bearers of rights that cannot be compromised or alienated by circumstance. There are 192 countries of the world ratified the UN Convention {{on the rights}} of the child, including five Central Asian states. (ALSTON/TOBIN 2005, P. 10) Having joined the UN CRC, Central Asian countries have undertaken a wide range of obligations requiring serious revision of the current legislation, of the corresponding mechanisms for coordination of the child protection system and monitoring of the rights´ implementation. However, the UN Committee {{on the rights of}} the child in the concluding observations to periodic reports provided by the countries marks that there are still a number of problems in this area: - In countries of Central Asia the national legislation does not always fully comply with principles of the UN Convention {{on the rights of the}} child; - Lack of necessary financial and human resources, lack of the comprehensive approach in the child protection hinders the work of coordinating structures involved in the child rights protection (UNICEF INNOCENTI RESEARCH CENTER 2006, P. 31). - Lack of the statistical data on children, first of all, about the most vulnerable groups of children, hinders monitoring of the Convention implementation. Due to these existing problems the issues of children especially in need of assistance fall out of the focus of the governments. These children become «invisible» which means that the rights of these children will not be satisfied even at the level of basic needs such as sufficient nutrition, health care, school education and family care. The reasons causing such situations are lack of the data about children in the state agency of statistics, lack of the records about these children during development of the state program, duplication of functions of various departments and ministries. In 2006, countries of Central Asian initiated the Forum on child protection to overcome these problems. Issues of social policy, protection and inclusion of children, creation of the social protection system and overcoming of fragmentation were discussed. The Forum has demonstrated that it is an effective instrument for interstate cooperation and exchange of experience. Hereafter, it can serve as an impulse to conduct the integrated Forums (Forum on education, Forum on maternity and child health, Forum on child protection). The regional analysis of child protection systems shows that there is a fragmentation of the current child care systems. There is a multitude of actors, not necessarily well coordinated that have to respond to complex family situations and different child protection problems. Reforms of current child care systems into a continuum of services that provide individualized responses, rather than collectivist responses is one of the important regional lessons learned to strengthen the current system response. There are many implications for governments in this work: - They must be driving the vision for change and articulate operational plans, guiding principles for the reform as well as targets for the coming years. - Governments also need to be active in enforcing what are the core responsibilities of the state. This includes setting standards for the operation for the system, carry out gate-keeping functions, accreditation, provide support to planning, costing and budgeting at regional and local levels, defining the minimum package of services; and development of targeted social policies to support most vulnerable families - To overcome fragmentation and ensure proper coordination of the work, governments are also responsible for bridging gaps between sectors, coordination and facilitating institutional and professional capacity development. This includes regulate allocation of resources (decentralization with equity), define obligations of the different sectors (including responsibilities of the professionals encompassed in job descriptions), ensure continuum of services between the different actors (includes identifying missing services and functions) and improve professional competencies (job descriptions, training, lessons learned, sharing potential good practices, etc.) - Finally, governments need to take full responsibility for review of quality of services provided through monitoring of services (beyond financial monitoring), development of methods for result-based management, support to systems for data collection, provide opportunities for competition in service provision between state actors and NGOs. Having signed the UN Convention on the rights of the child, the governments of all Central Asian countries have undertaken to respect the rights of children, including the right to the proper standard of living. The governments of Central Asia should be aware of necessity to input funds in development of children because children are the future. Since 1998, the region enjoyed economic growth while the economic recession was left behind. Taking the economic growth into the account as well as reduction of the birth rate, today all Central Asian countries have a unique chance to invest in education and public health for the future of their children. In the long-term prospect these investments will allow the younger generation to make their own investment...|$|R
40|$|Human toxocariasis is a helminthozoonosis {{due to the}} {{migration}} of Toxocara species larvae through human organism. Humans become infected by ingesting either embryonated eggs from soil (geophagia, pica), dirty hands or raw vegetables, or larvae from undercooked giblets. The diagnosis relies upon sensitive immunological methods (ELISA or western-blot) which use Toxocara excretory-secretory antigens. Seroprevalence is high in developed countries, especially in rural areas, and also in some tropical islands. The clinical spectrum of the disease comprises four syndromes, namely visceral larva migrans, ocular larva migrans, and the more recently recognized "common" (in adults) and "covert" (in children) pictures. Therapy of ocular toxocariasis is primarily based upon corticosteroids use, when visceral larva migrans and few cases of common or covert toxocariasis can be treated by anthelmintics whose the most efficient appeared to be diethylcarbamazine. When diagnosed, all of these syndromes require thorough prevention of recontamination (especially by deworming pets) and <b>sanitary</b> <b>education...</b>|$|E
