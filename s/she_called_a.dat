She also said she would contact them when she returned. At 2:05 pm <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before , a Santa Clara River Valley {{telephone}} operator {{learned from the}} Pacific Long Distance Telephone Company that the dam had failed. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> California Highway Patrol officer who lived nearby, then began ringing the homes of those in danger. The officer and a fellow officer cris-crossed {{the streets in the}} danger zone with their sirens sounding. Within an hour the streets were empty, but little could be done for those on ranches and dairies in lowlands to the west of town.|$|E
25|$|The media {{coverage}} of the murders reached Acremant's mother, who had moved to Medford three weeks earlier with her son. Believing her son had committed the murders, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> police tip line and told police of her suspicion, based on her son's behavior and his resemblance to the composite sketch. She also showed police the labels of cardboard boxes used during her move to Medford with Acremant. Police matched the address labels to those on the boxes used to cover the women's bodies.|$|E
25|$|She {{remained}} {{as leader of}} the NAWSA and continued to travel extensively on suffrage work. She also engaged in local projects. In 1893, she initiated the Rochester branch of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. In 1898, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> meeting of 73 local women's societies to form the Rochester Council of Women. She {{played a key role in}} raising the funds required by the University of Rochester before they would admit women students, pledging her life insurance policy to close the final funding gap.|$|E

500|$|Three years later, writer Annette Carson, in {{her book}} Richard III: The Maligned King (2008), {{independently}} {{came to the conclusion}} that his body probably lay under the car park. She joined forces with Langley and Ashdown-Hill to carry out further research, in the course of which she found what <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "smoking gun"—a medieval map of Leicester showing the Greyfriars Church at the north end of what was now the car park.|$|E
500|$|In doing {{research}} for her proposed novel Show Boat, writer Edna Ferber spent several {{weeks on the}} James Adams Floating Palace Theatre in Bath, North Carolina, gathering material about a disappearing American entertainment venue, the river showboat. In a few weeks, she gained what <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "treasure trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true". Jerome Kern {{was impressed by the}} novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, Criss Cross.|$|E
500|$|Collins {{announced}} a new education package in June 1985 that included a five percent across-the-board pay raise for teachers, a reduction in class sizes, funding for construction projects, aides for every kindergarten teacher in the state, and a [...] "power equalization" [...] program to make funding for poorer school districts more {{equal to that of}} their more affluent counterparts. After favorable reaction to the plan from legislators, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> special legislative session to convene July 8 to consider the plan. After two weeks of deliberation, the General Assembly approved Collins' education plan, tripling the corporate licensing tax to $2.10 per $1,000 in order to pay for the package. The Assembly rejected a proposed five-cents-per-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax to finance other spending.|$|E

500|$|On June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, {{delivered}} {{a speech to}} the Senate <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Declaration of Conscience". In a clear attack upon McCarthyism, she {{called for an end to}} [...] "character assassinations" [...] and named [...] "some of the basic principles of Americanism: The right to criticize; The right to hold unpopular beliefs; The right to protest; The right of independent thought". She said [...] "freedom of speech is not what it used to be in America", and decried [...] "cancerous tentacles of 'know nothing, suspect everything' attitudes". Six other Republican senators—Wayne Morse, Irving M. Ives, Charles W. Tobey, Edward John Thye, George Aiken, and Robert C. Hendrickson—joined Smith in condemning the tactics of McCarthyism.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, La Luz del Mundo {{acquired}} a vacant nursery {{building in a}} commercial zone in Ontario, California. The Church planned {{to use it for}} religious activities and was assured that it could as long as building requirements were met. The city then passed a law requiring all new religious organizations to obtain a conditional use permit to operate a church in the commercial zone. In 1998, the Church petitioned for such a permit but concerned residents objected to its plans. María de Lourdes Argüelles, professor at Claremont Graduate University and board member of the Instituto Cristiano de México, led the opposition against the Church, which <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "destructive sect". She said she had seen children and teenagers working overnight on the site under precarious conditions.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Michael Howard, a {{young man}} {{interested}} in witchcraft and the occult wrote to Montalban after reading one of her articles in Prediction; she invited him to visit her at her home. The two became friends, with Montalban believing {{that she could see}} the [...] "Mark of Cain" [...] in his aura. She invited him to become a student of the ONS, which he duly did. Over the coming year, he spent much of his time with her, and in 1968 they went on what <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "magical mystery tour" [...] to the West Country, visiting Stonehenge, Boscastle and Tintagel. In 1969, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, something she disapproved of, and their friendship subsequently [...] "hit a stormy period" [...] with the pair going [...] " [...] own ways for several years." ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Scherstuhl wrote a very {{critical}} piece for The Village Voice; {{he called the}} film predictable and repetitive, and said it contained several facts that have been clearly [...] "common knowledge for years". Scherstuhl said it is scattershot, [...] "a litany of Things We Can All Agree Are Bad", but ultimately jumps between several topicswithout sufficient detail, in his opinionbut comes to no conclusion or alternative. Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged {{and that they would}} [...] "dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is". Similarly, while saying the film discusses important issues, both Genevieve Koski of The Dissolve and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them. Koski said, [...] "The True Cost is methodical to a fault", while Kermode said it is [...] "a good starting point" [...] on the topic. Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said it has an [...] "easy-to-swallow accessibility" [...] but that it [...] "oversimplifies" [...] some aspects of the industry. In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for [...] "lots of eye-popping statements", she said, [...] "trying to do everything, he skirted a lot of things". The Los Angeles Timess Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers, saying [...] "the effects of fertilizers...don't appear quite as tangible", and faulted Morgan for not exploring [...] "retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins", but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both pro and con views. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he wants {{to go back to the}} 1960s. She also criticized some interviewees, such as Miller, whom <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "conspiracy theorist", and Wolff, whom <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Marxist idealist". Crocker was dismissive of the film, saying, [...] "the film loses focus and credibility, criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it".|$|E
500|$|Critics complimented Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey {{for being}} well {{researched}} and compelling, {{but they also}} found Lohan's presence to be odd. In her Lost in Showbiz column in The Guardian, Marina Hyde repeatedly criticized the documentary, in particular the choice to include Lohan, since its inception. She mentions Lohan's then recent conviction for [...] "drink-driving and drug possession", describing her as a [...] "trainwreck star" [...] with a [...] " ... in foreclosure" [...] {{and goes on to}} question if BBC was doing [...] "image-laundering services" [...] and whether the decision to hire Lohan was [...] "symptomatic of a wider cultural malaise". Salon.com's Mary Elizabeth Williams likewise criticized BBC3's decision to have Lohan, whom <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "disaster-prone starlet", front the programme, though she also said that [...] "an effort that raises awareness of a global epidemic– even one that employs a crazy hot chick– is still an effort." ...|$|E
500|$|... #1's is {{the first}} {{compilation}} album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, released by Columbia Records on November 17, 1998. The album contained Carey's then thirteen number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as four new songs. In Japan, #1's also included her popular single [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", which remained Carey's biggest selling single there. Though showing {{the characteristics of a}} regular greatest hits album, Carey expressed a dislike for the track listing, which <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> large collection of her most commercial singles. Carey felt that if #1's was a traditional greatest hits album, then it would include other songs that did not reach number one, but were far more important in her career. She has regularly voiced her frustration with the song choices on the album, expressing her disappointment with the omission of her [...] "favorite songs".|$|E

500|$|In October 1868 Cosima {{asked her}} husband for a divorce, to which he would not {{initially}} agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately {{after the birth of}} her and Wagner's third and final child, Siegfried, Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> [...] "final attempt at an understanding". His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: [...] "You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your heart and mind to a higher being: far from censuring you for this step, I approve of it". Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.|$|E
500|$|Eddy set up what <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> {{secret society}} of her {{students}} (known as the P. M., or private meeting) to deal with malicious animal magnetism, but said that the group only met twice. In her later years, Wilson writes, Eddy concluded that individuals {{ought not to be}} [...] "taken up in thought," [...] and came to see animal magnetism as an impersonal force. From 1890 she felt that her students were focusing on it too much, and thereafter public discussion of malicious animal magnetism declined, although Gottschalk adds that it continued {{to play an important role}} in the teaching of Christian Science. Adam H. Dickey, Eddy's private secretary for the last three years of her life, wrote that hour-long watches were held in her home three times a day to protect her against it. The Manual of the Mother Church forbids members from practising it, and requires that Christian Science teachers instruct students [...] "how to defend themselves against mental malpractice, and never to return evil for evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria's {{husband died}} in London in September 1921. After meeting {{her at the}} Naval and Military Club in Piccadilly, he complained of feeling unwell and Victoria persuaded him to rest in a room they had booked in the club annexe. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> doctor, who {{prescribed}} some medicine and Victoria went out to fill the prescription at a nearby pharmacist's. When she came back, Louis was dead. On her widowhood, Victoria moved into a grace-and-favour residence at Kensington Palace and, {{in the words of}} her biographer, [...] "became a central matriarchal figure in the lives of Europe's surviving royalty". In 1930, her eldest daughter, Alice, suffered a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the following decade Victoria was largely responsible for her grandson Philip's education and upbringing during his parents' separation and his mother's institutionalisation. Prince Philip recalled, [...] "I liked my grandmother very much and she was always helpful. She was very good with children... she took the practical approach to them. She treated them in the right way—the right combination of the rational and the emotional." ...|$|E
