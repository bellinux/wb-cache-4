5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the <b>swinging</b> <b>light</b> and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E

60|$|Within {{the house}} {{something}} of this cheerlessness prevailed. It had an ascetic gloom, which the scant firelight of the reception-room, and the dying embers on the dining-room hearth, failed to dissipate. The central hall was broad, and furnished plainly {{with a few}} rush-bottomed chairs, on one of which half dozed a black body-servant of the commander-in-chief. Two officers in the dining-room, drawn close by the chimney-corner, chatted in undertones, as if mindful that {{the door of the}} drawing-room was open, and their voices might break in upon its sacred privacy. The <b>swinging</b> <b>light</b> in the hall partly illuminated it, or rather glanced gloomily from the black polished furniture, the lustreless chairs, the quaint cabinet, the silent spinet, the skeleton-legged centre-table, and finally upon the motionless figure of a man seated by the fire.|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{starting}} in 1990, Chris Wedge {{had been working}} on a short film named Bunny, intended to demonstrate CGI Studio. The film revolves around a rabbit widow who is irritated by a moth. The moth subsequently leads the rabbit into [...] "a heavenly glow, reuniting her with her husband." [...] At the time, Wedge had been the thesis advisor for Carlos Saldanha while Saldanha was {{a graduate student at the}} School of Visual Arts; Wedge shared storyboard panels for Bunny with Saldanha during this time. After Saldanhas graduation, Blue Sky Studios hired him as an animator, and he later directed a few commercials. It was not until 1996 when Nina Rappaport, a producer at Blue Sky Studios, assigned Wedge to complete the Bunny project, which required CGI Studio to render fur, glass, and metal from multiple light sources, such as a <b>swinging</b> <b>light</b> bulb and an [...] "ethereal cloudscape". In the initial stages of the Bunny project, Carl Ludwig modified CGI Studio to simulate radiosity, which tracks light rays as they reflect off of multiple surfaces. Blue Sky Studios released Bunny in 1998, and it received the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Bunnys success gave Blue Sky Studios the opportunity to produce feature length films.|$|E
5000|$|Filming {{began on}} July 27, 2010 in Nashville, Tennessee, {{but due to}} a storm it did not finish until July 28, 2010. The music video, which was {{directed}} by Randee St. Nicholas, premiered on CMT and GAC on August 18, 2010. It begins with Reba, {{dressed in a black}} hooded cloak and sunglasses, about to go into a warehouse, when train track arms come down and traffic stops. When inside the warehouse, after walking down a hallway with hanging, <b>swinging</b> <b>light</b> fixtures, she takes off her cloak and glasses, and finds a stack of radios on a metal cart. She then uses a box-cutter to open boxes that contain more radios. After putting these radios on the cart, she finds her cheating ex, sitting in a chair and looking blank. She appears to sing the kiss-off lyrics directly to him, but he just stares into space the whole time. As the instrumental bridge kicks in, she turns up the volume to maximum on every radio on the cart. Then, she ties her ex up with the microphone cord she was using to sing. She then puts back on her cloak and sunglasses and leaves. Before she gets into her car, she texts her ex, and the video ends with him finally taking his iPhone out, hitting the reply button, and seeing multiple texts from Reba saying [...] "Turn on the RADIO!!!", implying that she and him are no more.|$|E

50|$|A {{common form}} of home task {{lighting}} is a goose-neck lamp or <b>swing</b> arm <b>light</b> fixture. The adjustable neck allows light {{to be focused on}} the exact task needed, and the swing-arm wall sconces can be positioned next to a bed or chair, and adjusted to shine light on a printed page.

40|$|A pupillographic technique, an {{adaptation}} of the <b>swinging</b> <b>light</b> test, is described for the measurement of unilateral afferent pupillary defects. In normal persons it yielded accurate, reproducible estimates {{of the magnitude of}} artificial afferent defects made with neutral filters of 1 to 4 log units density. In 15 studies on 8 patients with unilateral optic neuritis and 2 with unilateral compressive lesions the measured afferent pupillary defects correlated closely with both visual acuity and visual threshold deficits. Measurement of the pupillary defect underestimated severe degrees of impairment revealed by visual threshold determination. Discrepancies between pupillary defect and visual acuity were observed in the 2 patients with compressive lesions and in 1 patient who had a central scotoma 4 months after an attack of optic neuritis...|$|E

50|$|Crinum thaianum is {{cultivated}} as an aquatic ornamental {{to decorate}} aquaria.
