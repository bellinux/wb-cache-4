40|$|This paper {{studies the}} diffuse field sound {{absorption}} coefficient of a system consisting of a rigid perforated panel with a thin porous woven/matted material glued to its back, which is {{placed in front of}} an air cavity with a rigid backing. To cut the cost of trial and error diffuse field {{sound absorption coefficient}} measurements, a prediction method was developed. Measurements were made in a two-microphone impedance tube of the complex <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedances of the unperforated rigid panel materials and of the thin porous materials in front of a rigidly terminated air cavity. These values were used in the transfer matrix method to predict the complex <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedances of the perforated panels systems {{as a function of the}} angle of incidence of the sound. These calculations assumed the systems to have infinite or finite lateral extent. The measured diffuse field sound absorption coefficient values usually lay between the infinite and finite predictions. The most important variables are the perforation factor of the panel, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of the thin porous material and the cavity depth...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} {{of an active}} control force on a thin-walled acoustic boundary can modify the motional dynamics, and so influence the impedance presented to incident waves. This impedance determines transmission of acoustic energy, reflection of acoustic waves from the boundary and absorption of incident energy. This thesis studies control systems that generate control forces for the active control of surface acoustic impedance. The proposed systems rely on measurement of the acoustic pressure and surface velocity of the boundary. The systems can use adaptive digital signal processing, which offers significant advantages over non-adaptive techniques. The active control of the <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance of a loudspeaker that terminates a waveguide for axially propagating plane waves provides a motivating problem. Theoretical analysis establishes the control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance of a simple compliantly-suspended piston by a control force. Operational constraints of a physical piston define theoretical operating limits for controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedances. The control systems use either feedback or feed-forward techniques for which theoretical treatment reveals restrictions on the range of controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance. A novel result is that conventional implementations of the control systems can be unstable for certain desired impedances unless feedback cancellation is used. Digital feedback techniques are less effective for broader frequency bandwidth where feed-forward techniques may work. Theoretical analysis produces solutions that confirm the feasibility of these control techniques for the active control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance. Potential errors {{in the implementation of}} the systems have predictable effects on the controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance. Experimental results support the theoretical work presented in this thesis, demonstrating active control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance for normally incident acoustic plane waves. An adaptive digital feed-forward control system creates desired <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedances for band-limited noise and transient signals...|$|R

40|$|With this study, {{we provide}} a global link between linear and {{non-linear}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of a perforation {{as a function}} of orifice geometry and Strouhal number. High amplitudes of acoustic pressure induce flow separation {{at the edges of the}} orifices. This is a non-linear mechanism increasing the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of a perforation. Quasi-static models have been used to predict the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> in the non-linear regime, yet the linear to non-linear transition has been out of focus so far. We carry out open-end impedance measurements in a semi-anechoic room with four different samples. These samples are selected to have different orifice geometries and edge profiles, so that the conclusions would be general. The most prominent result of this study is that the change in the non-linear resistance can be expressed {{as a function of}} the Strouhal number only, if the resistance is corrected for the vena-contracta factor which can be deduced from steady flow measurements. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{unification}} {{of the theory}} of the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of Helmholtz resonators including grazing flow is presented. The nonlinear resistance due to grazing flow is considered to be caused by an exciting pressure spectrum produced by the interaction of the grazing flow and the jets flowing from the resonator orifices. With this exciting pressure spectrum the resonator can be treated {{in the same manner as}} a resonator without grazing flow but with an exciting acoustic spectrum. One of the important implications of this model is that a multiple-degree-of-freedom resonator can be analyzed with grazing flow. Using the grazing flow pressure spectrum, the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> can be properly distributed among the several elements of the resonator...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the {{transverse}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> {{of liquid}} helium- 3 {{have been made}} at pressures between 0. 3 bar and 28. 0 bar in the temperature range 0. 015 Kelvin to 1. 0 Kelvin using a helium- 3 /helium- 4 dilution refrigerator. The method involved observation of the decay {{of a series of}} echos generated in a piezoelectric rod immersed in the liquid, one end of the rod being excited by a resonant cavity. The frequency of this cavity was 242 MHz in the greater proportion of this work but similar measurements were also made at 1048 MHz. The measurements at the lower frequency have confirmed the existence of the collective oscillation known as transverse zero sound in liquid helium- 3 at higher pressures, as predicted by the Landau Theory of a Fermi liquid. This has enabled an estimate to be made of the magnitude of the symmetrical Landau parameter, F 2 S. The result obtained was in agreement with those of other experimenters who have used a variety of methods to determine F 2 S. A similar experimental technique has been used to study the longitudinal <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of liquid helium- 3 in order to investigate the anomalously high value of F 2 S indicated by previous measurements of this phenomenon. These measurements, both transverse and longitudinal, have mainly been carried out on pure helium- 3 (ie. better than 99. 9997 per cent) but some data have been obtained for the transverse <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of helium- 3 in which a small amount of helium- 4 (about 1 %) was present.

Transmittance, {{a measure of}} the acoustic power absorbed by the ME, was found to have several important advan-tages over other measures of acoustic power flow. In addition to its simple and audiologically relevant physical interpretation (absorbed power), the normal transmittance curve has a simple shape that is visually similar to the ME transfer function.
