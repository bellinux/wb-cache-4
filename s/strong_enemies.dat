5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a revamped magic system, more onscreen enemies, new camera angles, and downloadable content.|$|E
500|$|Roger Travis, {{associate}} professor of classics at the University of Connecticut, compared the Master Chief to the epic hero Aeneas, in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> in a martial setting. The audience is intended {{to identify with the}} protagonist similarly in both stories. Matthew Stover compared Halo to the Iliad, saying that both stories share the meta-theme that [...] "war is the crucible of character". As military science fiction, Halo further raises the issue of being human. Stover argued that, since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief, the character is correctly presented as a cyborg, neither a flawless machine nor fully human. Players would be unable to empathize with the former, and the latter would be too specifically developed. This immersion has facilitated the use of the Halo series' multiplayer mode for live digital puppetry, as in Chris Burke's machinima talk show This Spartan Life.|$|E
500|$|Both Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean {{stretched}} {{the power of}} the Super Famicom to its limits, with a total of 48 megabits of data. [...] Additionally, Star Ocean was also one of two games that used a special S-DD1 chip to aid in compression of almost all graphics and map data, meaning that it effectively stored even more data than Tales of Phantasia, though the compression lead to a lower audio quality. [...] The game also featured special technology called a [...] "Flexible Voice Driver" [...] that allowed for the compression of sound, allowing for voice clips for characters when in battles, another trait that was both very rare for a Super Famicom game, and shared with Tales of Phantasia. Different voice clips would be played depending on the scenario; if the characters were confronted by weak enemies, they may say something more confident, where as if confronted by <b>strong</b> <b>enemies,</b> they may say something more fearful or frantic. Mode 7 graphics were generated using software, and appear when items pop out of treasure chests; the need for extra tiles, however, limited the graphical effects implementation. The game also featured surround sound. Planning for a sequel began as soon as development was completed on Star Ocean. Feedback about weak boss monsters later lead to more challenging battles in Star Ocean 2.|$|E

50|$|He is {{considered}} to be the greatest ruler of Gohad. During his rule he occupied many neighbouring forts. His rule {{is considered}} to be the golden period of Rana rulers by historians. He was brave, tactful, visionary and strong administrator. The Marathas were <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> of Gohad rulers but Mahadji Sindhia always desired to have friendship with Chhatar Singh.|$|E
5000|$|This game {{helps people}} to develop {{strategy}} and concept of teamwork by teaching {{that even though}} weak, if united, one can vanquish the <b>stronger</b> <b>enemy</b> as a team.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>enemy</b> is too <b>strong</b> to be {{attacked}} directly, then attack something he holds dear. Know that he cannot be superior in all things. Somewhere there is {{a gap in the}} armour, a weakness that can {{be attacked}} instead. The idea here is to avoid a head-on battle with a <b>strong</b> <b>enemy,</b> and instead strike at his weakness elsewhere. This will force the <b>strong</b> <b>enemy</b> to retreat in order to support his weakness. Battling against the now tired and low-morale enemy will give a much higher chance of success.|$|R
50|$|Meta-power greatly boosts {{the power}} of Baron Baldric's {{currently}} equipped spell, allowing him to use weaker spells to defeat <b>stronger</b> <b>enemies,</b> or blow them away using the more powerful spells.|$|R
50|$|Prussian tribes (of Baltic origin) were attacking Masovia, so Duke Konrad of Masovia {{invited the}} Teutonic Knights to settle near the Prussian area of settlement. The {{fighting}} between Prussians and the Teutonic Knights gave {{the more distant}} Lithuanian tribes time to unite. Because of <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> {{in the south and}} north, the newly formed Lithuanian state concentrated most of its military and diplomatic efforts on expansion eastward.|$|E

5000|$|A core {{component}} of many hacks (especially of role-playing video games) is editing data such as character, item, and enemy properties. This is usually done either [...] "by hand" [...] (with a hex editor) if {{the location and}} structure of the data is known, or with a game-specific editor that has this functionality. Through this, a hacker can alter how weapons work, how <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> are or how they act, etc. This can be done to make the game easier or harder, or to create new scenarios for the player to face.|$|E

50|$|Tales of the Tempest is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game. The player navigates the playable characters across 3D environments, including the overworld map, towns and dungeons.. The characters and environment are displayed on one screen of the Nintendo DS system, while menu options {{such as the}} character's current status are displayed on the other. The world is governed by a day-night cycle, effecting {{the environment and the}} behavior of elements within it. For instance, <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> appear at night, and towns cannot be accessed, but conversely some items and treasure are only available at night.|$|E
50|$|Despite husband's {{affection and}} public support, Barbara {{did not have}} {{stronger}} political influence. For example, her mother and brother urged her to prevent Piotr Tomicki, a known sympathizer with the Habsburgs, from becoming Bishop of Przemyśl and Vice-Chancellor of the Crown. Tomicki was promoted to the posts regardless and, after learning of Zápolyas' interference, became even stronger supporter of the Habsburgs. Marriage to Barbara also did not stop Sigismund from supporting the wedding between Louis II of Hungary and Maria of Castile, granddaughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. Sigismund's shift to pro-Habsburg policies {{was caused by the}} war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow - Sigismund did not feel confident enough to fight two <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> and sought an alliance with the Emperor.|$|E
5000|$|Sly 2: Band of Thieves brings {{several new}} {{gameplay}} elements into the fold. In addition to Sly, the player can play as Bentley and Murray. Bentley follows a more cloak and dagger approach to stealth. He can't climb poles or jump very far, {{but he is}} equipped with a sleep-dart crossbow and countdown bombs to defeat enemies or sabotage enemy equipment. Bentley can use his computer skills to hack villains' computers, bringing the player to a top-down shooter-like mini-game. Murray is much more direct. His brute strength allows him to take on groups of <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> by himself with powerful hooks and upper cuts. He can pick up objects and enemies to throw and his [...] "thunder flop" [...] attack can stun and destroy enemies. His strength allows him to help the gang with heavy-duty tasks.|$|E
5000|$|Rally: A grouped attack {{carried out}} {{with the help of}} other {{alliance}} members against a specific target. It features a timer which allows others to join. The main goal is the weakening of a <b>stronger</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... 3 RCR {{replaced}} 2 RCR in Korea {{in early}} 1953. Early in May the battalion withstood a <b>strong</b> <b>enemy</b> assault on its position about Hill 187. The attack was repulsed, but the engagement cost the Canadians heavy casualties - 26 killed, 27 wounded and seven taken prisoner.|$|R
50|$|The Archer is the ranged weapon specialist, {{replacing}} D&D's Arcane Archer and Ranger classes. The class {{receives the}} best attack bonus {{in the game}} when using ranged weapons (advancing at 1.25/level, for a max of +25 at 20th level), though the class' base attack progression for melee weapons is poor; the class also receives a decent defense growth, though HP and skill increases are merely average. The class also receives an Aim Pool, which is gathered by spending actions targeting a single enemy; the tokens from this pool {{may be used to}} power the special abilities of the class. As such, the Archer excels against single, <b>strong</b> <b>enemies.</b> The class also gains a number of bonus feats that must be spent on archery feats (which the class also has excellent access to), allowing Archer characters to diversify their abilities and remain effective against any opponent.|$|E

5000|$|At its core, the Remix {{version is}} similar to the main Captain Forever games. The player {{controls}} a spacecraft which they can build from various modules, fighting against other spacecraft and using modules knocked off from those to expand their own. The Remix version adds a more direct goal - completing 10 stages as the player races {{to the end of the}} solar system, facing <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> in each turn. The game is structured as a roguelike, as the encounters at each stage are procedurally-generated, and should the player's core unit be destroyed, they must start the game from the start. Each stage is completed by meeting a specific goal, such as destroying a ship of a given level (as assigned by the game). A larger meta-game, based on progress during a given playthrough, unlocks new [...] "starter kits" [...] for the initial ship, such as ships geared for long-range attacks, or for close-range overpowered attacks. The starter kits can be upgraded as well in the meta-game, providing better modules within the kit at the start.|$|E
25|$|The second battle, {{some twenty}} years later, took place around Chocontá {{in the north}} of the Bogotá savanna between the zipa and the zaque. Here again, Saguamanchica {{defeated}} his <b>stronger</b> <b>enemy</b> Michuá of around 60,000 warriors in a three hour fight. Both leaders died because of the bloody battle.|$|R
50|$|He is a playable {{character}} in the Samurai Warriors series and is usually one of the <b>strongest</b> <b>enemies</b> to defeat. His weapon is a two-pronged spear, similar to a sasumata.

5000|$|Each {{character}} has two {{different styles of}} fighting, each to handle different situations. For example, the character of Lucas can wield a two-handed sword to damage a lot of enemies at once but with less protection or use a one-handed sword and shield to fight against single <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> or to block attacks. In addition, there are three different special abilities for each stance that require [...] "focus", the game's equivalent to magic points, to use. The amount of focus required varies based on the ability used. Each of those abilities has an improved version available after meeting certain conditions, such as using the skill {{a certain number of}} times. There are also three different passive abilities (such as healing, increased armor etc.). The improved versions of the attack abilities and the passive abilities use a different system of power spheres. All improved and passive abilities will deplete such a sphere. Both the focus points and the spheres are refilled by fighting enemies. While amount of focus available will always be a maximum of 100%, the player will start with only one sphere and gain three additional ones at key points of the plot, regardless of their level or experience points. Additionally, each {{character has}} ten different skills they can increase at each level reached, allowing them to improve their attacks, get bonus effects when being hit, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{annexation}} of Estonia by the USSR in 1940 was complete, but never recognized internationally except by Eastern Bloc countries. After the annexation, Estonians {{were subject to}} conscription into the Red Army, which by international law is illegal if Estonia is not considered {{to have been a}} part of the USSR. When the Soviets retreated from Estonia and Germany fully occupied it, in the summer of 1941, the Germans continued the practice of dragooning Estonian men, although the majority joined the German Army voluntarily, often out of the desire to fight the USSR, which had made <b>strong</b> <b>enemies</b> with many groups of society in Estonia after introducing their socialist economic system. Up to March 1942 drafted Estonians mostly served in the rear of the Army Group North security. On August 28, 1942 the German powers announced the legal compilation of the so-called [...] "Estonian Legion" [...] within the Waffen SS. Oberführer Franz Augsberger was nominated the commander of the legion. Up to the end of 1942 about 1,280 men volunteered into the training camp. Bataillon Narwa was formed from the first 800 men of the Legion to have finished their training at Heidelager, being sent in April 1943 to join the Division Wiking in Ukraine. They replaced the Finnish Volunteer Battalion, recalled to Finland for political reasons. In March 1943, a partial mobilization was carried out in Estonia during which 12,000 men were conscripted into the SS. On May 5, 1943 the 3rd Waffen-SS Brigade (Estonian), another fully Estonian unit, was formed and sent to the front near Nevel.|$|E
50|$|On 21 February 1945, the 4th Marine Division {{was locked}} in battle against <b>strong</b> <b>enemy</b> forces {{protecting}} Motoyama Airfield #1. Multiple enemy defensive belts guarded this major complex on Iwo Jima's central plateau. The 24th Marines were assigned {{to drive to the}} O-1 line and clear the airfield.|$|R
50|$|The {{third major}} {{operation}} opened on October 24, when the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division began its advance down the South Beveland peninsula. The Canadians hoped to advance rapidly, bypassing opposition and seizing bridgeheads over the Beveland Canal, but they too were slowed by mines, mud and <b>strong</b> <b>enemy</b> defences.|$|R
5000|$|During 6 November the EEF had {{advanced}} about 9 mi capturing a [...] "series of <b>strong</b> <b>enemy</b> works covering a front of some 7 mi."
