40|$|R-plasmids {{originally}} {{isolated from}} Streptococcus pyogenes(pAC 1,pAM 15346), Streptococcus agalactiae(pIP 501), and Streptococcus faecalis(pAM beta 1) {{were shown to}} be self-transferable on filter membranes from S. faecalis JH 2 - 2 to Staphylococcus aureus recipients. The nonconjugative plasmid pAM alpha 1 was mobilized into S. aureus by pAM beta 1. Once in S. aureus, conjugative R-plasmids could be transferred to a second S. aureus recipient or back into S. faecalis. Determinants for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistances present on these streptococcal plasmids were expressed in S. aureus. Agarose gel electrophoresis, dye-buoyant centrifugation, and restriction endonuclease digestion showed that the plasmids were maintained intact as <b>self-replicating</b> <b>elements</b> in S. aureus recipients...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolutionary}} development of structures constituted a real revolution in biology: {{it was possible}} to understand how the very complex structures of life can arise in an out-of-equilibrium system. The investigation of such systems has shown that indeed, systems under a flux of energy or matter can self-organize into complex patterns, think for instance to Rayleigh-Bernard convection, Liesegang rings, patterns formed by granular systems under shear. Following this line, one could characterize life as a state of matter, characterized by the slow, continuous process that we call evolution. In this paper we try to identify the organizational level of life, that spans several orders of magnitude from the elementary constituents to whole ecosystems. Although similar structures can be found in other contexts like ideas (memes) in neural systems and <b>self-replicating</b> <b>elements</b> (computer viruses, worms, etc.) in computer systems, we shall concentrate on biological evolutionary structure, and try to put into evidence the role and the emergence of network structure in such systems.

40|$|A {{conjecture}} of Eigen and Schuster (1979) {{concerning the}} competitive exclusion of dis-joint hypercycles is finally proved. A hypercycle, as introduced by Eigen and Schuster [1], {{is a system}} of n self-replicating macromolecules, coupled together by a closed loop of catalytic reactions, such that each species catalyses the self-reproduction of the next one. Such hypercycles have been postulated as missing links in the prebi-otic evolution from simple <b>self-replicating</b> <b>elements</b> with enzyme-free copying mechanism to the early forms of RNA. One open problem concerns an exclusion principle for competing, disjoint hypercycles, conjectured in [1]. This principle {{plays a crucial role}} in explaining the uniqueness of the genetic code within the hypercycle theory, see [4]. It will be proved in the present paper. The mathematical model behind this are differential equations of the form x ̇ i = xi(ki xπ(i) − F), i = 1, [...] ., n, F = n∑ i= 1 ki xi xπ(i). (1) Here xi denotes the concentration of the ith species, ki> 0 are rate constants, π is a permutation of { 1, [...] ., n}. The flux term F ensures that the total num-ber of elements remains constant and (1) defines a flow on the simplex Sn = {x ∈ Rn: xi ≥ 0 and∑ni= 1 xi = 1 }...|$|E

40|$|Richard Dawkins' (1976) selfish DNA {{hypothesis}} (that {{the only}} purpose of DNA is to perpetuate itself) is clearly {{reflected in the}} case of repetitive DNA, especially retrotransposons. These ubiquitous, <b>self-replicating</b> DNA <b>elements</b> do not seem to do anything but invade the host's genome (Orgel and Crick 1980; Doolittle and Sapienza 1980). Mutations caused by the activity of retrotransposons may eventually be evolutionarily advantageous, but {{are more likely to be}} deleterious for the host organism and thus eliminated from the population (Charlesworth et al. 1994). However, insertions of those elements that do not alter any functional region of the genome may be perpetuated in the population...|$|R
40|$|The term plasmid was {{originally}} coined for circular, extrachromosomal genetic elements. Today, plasmids are widely recognised {{not only as}} important factors facilitating genome restructuring but also as vehicles for the dissemination of beneficial characters within bacterial communities. Plasmid diversity has been uncovered by means of culture–dependent or –independent approaches, such as endogenous or exogenous plasmid isolation as well as PCR-based detection or transposon-aided capture, respectively. High-throughput-sequencing made possible to cover total plasmid populations in a given environment, i. e. the plasmidome, and allowed to address the quality and significance of <b>self-replicating</b> genetic <b>elements.</b> Since such efforts were and still are rather restricted to circular molecules, here we put equal emphasis on the linear plasmids which – despite their frequent occurrence in {{a large number of}} bacteria – are largely neglected in prevalent plasmidome conceptions...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{evolutionary}} {{strategy of}} Homo sapiens (SESH) is built {{in accordance with}} the modular and hierarchical principle and consists of the same type of <b>self-replicating</b> <b>elements,</b> i. e. is a system of systems. On the top level of the organization of SESH is the superposition of genetic, social, cultural and techno-rationalistic complexes. The components of this triad differ in the mechanism of cycles of generation - replication - transmission - fixing/elimination of adoptively relevant information. This mechanism is implemented either {{in accordance with the}} Darwin-Weismann modus, or according to the Lamarck modus, the difference between them is clear from the title. The integral attribute of the system of systems including ESSH is the production of evolutionary risks. The sources of evolutionary risk for stable adaptive strategy of Homo sapiens are the imbalance of (1) the intra-genomic co-evolution (intragenomic conflicts); (2) the gene-cultural co- evolution; (3) the inter-cultural co-evolution; (4) techno-humanitarian balance; (5) inter- technological conflicts (technological traps). At least phenomenologically the components of the evolutionary risk are reversible, but in the aggregate they are in potentio irreversible destructive ones for bio-social, and cultural self-identity of Homo sapiens. When the actual evolution {{is the subject of a}} rationalist control and/or manipulation, the magnitude of the 4 th and 5 th components of the evolutionary risk reaches the level of existential significance...|$|E
30|$|Plasmids {{as diverse}} and <b>self-replicating</b> {{extrachromosomal}} <b>elements</b> encode {{a variety of}} traits which include antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and environmental adaptability. Plasmids also {{plays a major role}} in bacterial adaptation to environmental (Smets and Barkay 2005). Inc plasmids target the replicons of the major plasmid families occurring in Enterobacteriaceae (HI 2, HI 1, I 1 -ã, X, L/M, N, FIA, FIB, FIC, W, Y, P, A/C, T, K, B/O) (Carattoli 2009). Currently, there are 27 known Inc groups occurring among the Enterobacteriaceae family (Frost et al. 2005; Carattoli 2009). Classification of plasmids into Inc groups is desirable because specific plasmid types have been associated with virulence and/or antimicrobial resistance (Gilmour et al., 2004; Hopkins et al. 2006; Carattoli et al. 2014). In this study, 18 types of Inc plasmids were detected. IncI 1 plasmid has been shown to contribute to adhesion and invasion of shiga-toxigenic E. coli due to presence of a cluster encoding IV pili (Kim and Komano 1997). While plasmids mediating antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is highly variable, some plasmid families are largely prevalent and also prevalently associated with specific resistance genes (Carattoli 2009).|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{plasmids}} are <b>self-replicating,</b> extrachromosomal <b>elements</b> {{that are}} key agents {{of change in}} microbial populations. They promote the dissemination {{of a variety of}} traits, including virulence, enhanced fitness, resistance to antimicrobial agents, and metabolism of rare substances. Escherichia coli, perhaps the most studied of microorganisms, has been found to possess a variety of plasmid types. Included among these are plasmids associated with virulence. Several types of E. coli virulence plasmids exist, including those essential for the virulence of enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroinvasive E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. Despite their diversity, these plasmids belong to a few plasmid backbones that present themselves in a conserved and syntenic manner. Thanks to some recent research, including sequence analysis of several representative plasmid genomes and molecular pathogenesis studies, the evolution of these virulence plasmids and the implications of their acquisition by E. coli are now better understood and appreciated. Here, work involving each of the E. coli virulence plasmid types is summarized, with the available plasmid genomic sequences for several E. colipathotypes being compared in an effort to understand the evolution of these plasmid types and define their core and accessory components...|$|R
40|$|Among P 1 transductants in Escherichia coli K- 12 {{that were}} {{selected}} for the proximal and distal markers from the large F 14 merogenote, a variety of unusual genotypes were found. As earlier workers had found, one class of these could transfer the proximal genes (argH, metB) and distal genes (ilvEDAC) of the F 14 during conjugation. These F 14 genes could be transferred into RecA recipients, indicating that they were carried on an F-merogenote rather than on an Hfr chromosome. The transduced F-merogenotes could transfer other F 14 genes (metE, rha) as well. Transfer kinetic analysis showed {{that all of the}} latter transduced F-merogenotes that were examined were indistinguishable from the parental F 14 in the order of transfer and the genetic distance between proximal and distal markers. This suggests that the whole F 14 had been received somehow by the primary transductional recipients, a remarkable possibility since the F 14 is much larger than the largest deoxyribonucleic acid segment normally transduced by P 1. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not yet known. Many of the transductants did not transfer any of the F 14 markers tested. Some of these transductants segregated certain F 14 genes, indicating they were carried on <b>self-replicating</b> genetic <b>elements,</b> but others were not cured of F 14 markers, even by acridine orange. Cotransductional analysis of this group was consistent with the hypothesis that the F 14 markers in some of these strains had integrated into the chromosome in the expected manner, since in these latter the F 14 alleles were linked to the expected chromosomal genes. Other strains among the stable transductants had acquired new linkages in that genes previously separated by several minutes could now be cotransduced. These latter included the novel cotransductional linkages of rbs-ilv-argH, rbs-ilv-argH-metB, and ilvD-argH-purD. Such strains might have been formed as a result of insertion into the chromosome of small circles derived from F 14...|$|R
