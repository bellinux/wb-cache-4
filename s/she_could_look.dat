25|$|Subsequent to the attack, Piper {{moved out}} of her London flat and {{returned}} to Hampshire {{to live with her}} parents and younger sister Suzy. Her mother, Diane Piper, who was a classroom assistant in a primary school, gave up her job so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> after her daughter following the attack. Following her recovery and the successful establishment of the Katie Piper Foundation, Piper again {{moved out of}} the family home and returned to living alone in London, a process documented in episodes of Katie: My Beautiful Face; she later moved to live with her partner Richard, a carpenter and eventual father of Belle. Although no longer resident there, Piper continues to maintain strong links with Andover and Hampshire, where her family remains.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "another land, far away," [...] "many, {{many years}} ago," [...] {{about the time}} of fairy tales of castles, knights, fair maidens, romance, magic and witches," [...] a mysterious and icily {{beautiful}} woman with magical powers (a 1938 promotional brochure suggests she is able to work her witchcraft having sold [...] "herself body and soul to the bad spirits" [...] of the Harz mountains) has gained her royal position by seducing and marrying the widowed King, giving her rule over his kingdom before he died. [...] "From that time on the cruel Queen ruled all alone, her every word was law, and all trembled in mortal fear of her anger." [...] The vain Queen owned a magical mirror with which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> upon whatever she wished. The Magic Mirror shows a haunted, smokey face of her familiar demon which replies to the Queen's requests. She regularly asks the mirror who is the fairest in the realm ("Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?" [...] which is often misquoted as [...] "Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all"), and the mirror would always reply that she is.|$|E
2500|$|Yamin {{audition}}ed in Boston, Massachusetts, singing Leon Russell's [...] "A Song for You", but his audition was not aired (it {{was later}} aired on October 24, 2009, {{as part of}} the American Idol Rewind - season 5 show). He performed the song again in front of the judges during Hollywood rounds, as well as Rascal Flatts's [...] "Bless the Broken Road". During the group auditions, Yamin and his group performed [...] "It's In Her Kiss" [...] (aka [...] "The Shoop Shoop Song") from Betty Everett; Simon Cowell disliked the group performance, but Randy Jackson said Yamin was the best one in his group, and Paula Abdul said {{it was a good thing}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> past two left feet, in a way of saying he did not dance well but he could definitely sing. He was sent through by the judges and made it through to the finals of the competition.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{fixed her}} eyes on the ground. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> her mother in the face.|$|R
60|$|Tess again {{shook her}} head, her throat {{swelling}} with complicated emotion. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> up at d'Urberville.|$|R
6000|$|Christie wished <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{control her}} {{tell-tale}} color, but finding <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not, <b>looked</b> {{hard at the}} sea, and, ignoring his tender insinuation, said, with suspicious enthusiasm: ...|$|R
2500|$|Farren {{continued}} at the Gaiety {{for the next}} 25 years, playing in comedies of all kinds and in Shakespearean dramas, first under Hollingshead and then under George Edwardes, performing the lead in dozens of shows, many also starring Edward Terry, Kate Vaughan, Fred Leslie and E. W. Royce. [...] She was most acclaimed in the [...] "principal boy" [...] roles. These roles permitted the actress to show her legs in tights, and Farren became very popular with the young men of the Gaiety audience, who would wear a coloured scarf to show support for their favourite actress. Farren's colours were dark blue, light blue and white, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> out over the audience to compare the number of fans displaying her colours {{as compared to the}} colours of the other actresses. According to Hollingshead, Farren developed a [...] "spinal complaint, which troubled her in her early Gaiety career [...] developed into locomotor ataxy" [...] later.|$|E
2500|$|Woolf trusted Sackville-West so {{much that}} she {{admitted}} during a trip to France that she had been molested by her half-brother during her youth, an experience that Woolf normally preferred to avoid mentioning. A somber Sackville-West wrote in her diary: [...] "After dinner, V. read me her memoir of Old Bloomsbury and talked a lot about her brother". It was largely due to Sackville-West's encouragement and her role as an amateur therapist that Woolf overcome, at least partially, the damage caused to her self-esteem by the sexual abuse inflicted on her by her half-brothers, allowing {{her for the first time}} in her life to have a satisfying erotic relationship as Woolf told Sackville-West that she was the first person who had caused her to orgasm. Woolf, who suffered from spectrophobia, had her mood so improved by Sackville-West that she purchased a mirror during a trip to France with her lover, saying she felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> in a mirror for the first time in her life.|$|E
2500|$|Emma {{tries to}} ignite the spark into a flame when Rumplestiltskin's manifestation appears {{and says that}} Arthur will kill her if he reunites Excalibur, {{but she says she}} has no choice and can’t risk the lives of her family. Rumple's manifestation says that she can only light it when she’s ready to give up the darkness. As the manifestation tries to goad Emma into {{lighting}} the flame, Emma loses her temper and yells at him to stop. Henry finds Emma talking to herself, and he asks what she’s doing, and what the [...] "voices" [...] said. Emma says that they told her she wasn’t ready to give up the darkness. He shows her a photo of a house that he and Hook were looking at for their Operation Light Swan, which Hook planned to obtain for Emma after she was free of the Darkness. Henry tells her that it was a reminder of something <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> forward to. Emma shuts the lid on the spark and says that she's not ready to give up the darkness just yet, because she has to use her dark magic one more time.|$|E
60|$|Susie {{turned away}} and hid her face. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at those ghastly counterfeits of humanity. She was terrified and ashamed.|$|R
60|$|Agatha's eyes fell. <b>She</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at {{him just}} then, nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> answer his {{question}} honestly as she almost wished to.|$|R
60|$|Agatha's eyes fell. She {{felt that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at him nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> answer his {{question}} honestly as she desired to answer it.|$|R
60|$|With the {{relaxing}} of {{her fingers}} she eased him from her so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{from one to the}} other.|$|E
60|$|She set a {{trembling}} hand upon my head; {{she took my}} chin in the other, and raised my face until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{waited until}} the Fawn and Selim had stepped over a fallen alder across the trail, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into Graham's eyes when she answered: ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the hall-door she had one more {{question}} to ask; but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> in her father's face as she asked.|$|R
60|$|Joan trembled. The man, in an instant, seemed transformed, somber as death. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at him, but {{she must}} keep on talking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--and you can't reach me: I am {{higher up}} than you" [...] (peeping between the rails of the banister; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> over them).|$|R
6000|$|She {{waited a}} minute, until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{at her own}} daring project from another point of view. Where was the harm of it? what did her {{conscience}} say? ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Maie said: 'We {{have too}} little milk {{for all these}} folk. Now that I have a servant, with {{the same amount of}} trouble <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> after three cows.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You peek first, Susy, {{and see if}} {{it looks}} nice," [...] said one little girl, {{boosting}} her friend so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> through the bars in {{the upper part of the}} gate.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> {{directly}} at people. She flushed and winced before citizens who {{a week ago}} had been amusing objects of study, and in their good-mornings she heard a cruel sniggering.|$|R
60|$|Lenore {{waited with}} some perturbation. She had a guilty {{conscience}} and she feared {{he meant to}} quiz her about her sudden change of front regarding the Bend trip. So <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> up and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not say a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I?" [...] said Mrs. Gresham, {{standing}} {{opposite to}} a big bowl, and putting her head a little on one side, as though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> better <b>look</b> at her handiwork in that position.|$|R
60|$|As the girl's own {{theory was}} that all the {{dragging}} there might be would be upward, and moreover administered by herself, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at her aunt with a cold and inscrutable eye.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} palace {{and went to}} a place where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> through a clear pane of the glass dome into the {{surrounding}} water. Immediately she became interested in the queer sights that met her view.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the matter?" [...] she asked, {{as she put}} {{her hand}} through his arm, and hung forward upon it so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> up into his face. [...] "How did you get on with the love-business?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jane {{was so busy}} pouring the {{spoonful of}} milk through {{the bars of the}} cage into a little shallow basin, which she kept for the purpose within, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> up.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at him now, and {{her bosom}} {{rose and fell}} with a motion that was not due to fatigue. Her moist hair matted around her {{forehead}} gave her a boyish look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, I ask no more, for we maun all help Jean's bairns. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> down, Aaron, and see {{her little}} velvets, as she called him, lifting my little corduroys ower the pools!" ...|$|R
60|$|But the ghastly {{change in}} Jonas {{told her that}} the other person was already seen. Before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> round towards the door, she was put aside by old Martin's hand; and Chuffey and John Westlock entered with him.|$|E
60|$|Her {{trip was}} a fact now; no chance could rob her of it. She had looked forward twenty-three years toward it, and now <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> back at it accomplished. She took up her burden again, never more {{thinking}} to lay it down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] she said, {{and moving}} from the stone on which she had been sitting, she walked off, {{carrying}} her head very high, to {{a corner of the}} Pyramid from which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> forth alone towards the sands of Libya.|$|E
60|$|Elfride {{had come}} back. What {{she had come}} to do he did not know. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> on at his death, perhaps. Still, she had come back, and not deserted him utterly, and it was much.|$|R
60|$|Helen strove for utterance, but it {{was denied}} her. Roy's simple {{statement}} of Dale's love had magnified her emotion by completely changing its direction. She forgot what she had felt wretched about. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at Roy.|$|R
6000|$|Helen was so {{surprised}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> into the dark face above her. Then she dropped her gaze, abashed by his searching eyes. But, thinking of his question, she subdued the vague stirrings of pleasure in her breast, and answered coldly: ...|$|R
