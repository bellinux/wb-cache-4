5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars. Here all times meet, and characters {{can go from}} one time to another. Characters can come into the building from any time, but can leave it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even {{end up in a}} time when the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, U.S. President William McKinley {{was shot}} twice in an {{assassination}} attempt. While one bullet only grazed his sternum, another had lodged <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> inside his abdomen {{and could not}} be found. A worried McKinley aide sent word to inventor Thomas Edison to rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived but wasn't used. While the shooting itself had not been lethal, gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection six days later.|$|E
500|$|While {{he viewed}} the Muslim Mughals as despotic and the Marathas as predatory, Tod saw the Rajput social systems as being {{similar to the}} feudal system of medieval Europe, and their traditions of recounting history through the generations as similar to the clan poets of the Scottish Highlanders. There was, he felt, a {{system of checks and}} {{balances}} between the ruling princes and their vassal lords, a tendency for feuds and other rivalries, and often a serf-like peasantry. The Rajputs were, in his opinion, on the same developmental trajectory that nations such as Britain had followed. His ingenious use of these viewpoints later enabled him to promote in his books the notion that there was a shared experience between the people of Britain and this community in a distant, relatively unexplored area of the empire. He speculated that there was a common ancestor shared by the Rajputs and Europeans <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> in prehistory and that this might be proven by comparison of the commonality in their history of ideas, such as myth and legend. In this he shared a contemporary aspiration to prove that all communities across the world had a common origin. There was another appeal inherent in a feudal system, and it was not unique to Tod: the historian Thomas R. Metcalf has said that [...] Above all, the chivalric ideal viewed character as more worthy of admiration than wealth or intellect, and this appealed to the old landed classes at home as well as to many who worked for the Indian Civil Service.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a recounting of {{processes}} and works {{manifested in the}} studio between 2011 and 2013. The bulk of this text, however, is composed of various written personal and autobiographical vignettes, future hopes, and experiences. I use these not to find traces of their influence in the work (although they exist), but more importantly {{as a way of}} looking forward, hoping that discovering them might take me <b>somewhere</b> <b>deeper</b> in my future of making...|$|R
2500|$|... wasn't so {{much about}} The Beatles. It {{was a very good}} script in which the agency of these two famous people and their story takes you <b>somewhere</b> <b>deeper.</b> To me, that's the nature of friendship: How we grow, how we grow up, and how things change. These boys knew each other when they were 16 and now they're 35 and they have to find a new truth. We all have our own {{relationships}} like that, whether they're matrimonial relationships or friendships.|$|R

60|$|Big Spring had {{its source}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> under the gray, {{weathered}} bluff, from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water. Its fountainhead {{must have been}} a great well rushing up through the cold stone.|$|E

50|$|Beverly is, by {{some strange}} twist of fate, {{the epitome of}} the Dumb Blonde (pink). Although she's not Human, nobody is quite sure where she came from, {{although}} she claims to have escaped from a very secret genetic research laboratory <b>somewhere</b> in <b>deep</b> space. She's neurotic, unpredictable, and quite stupid (or pretends to be) but somehow she maintains her position. She is currently the Fourth Place Racer.|$|R
60|$|A {{soft light}} suffused {{his face and}} his eyes glistened, as though <b>somewhere</b> in the <b>deeps</b> of his being his {{ancestors}} had quickened and stirred with dim memories of tips received in former lives.|$|R
6000|$|It {{brought her}} eyes round to him again, {{and he could}} see how, after all, <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> within, she felt his {{rebellion}} more sweet than bitter. Its effect on her spirit and her sense was visibly to hold her an instant. [...] "We've gone too far," [...] she none the less pulled herself together to reply. [...] "Do you want to kill her?" ...|$|E
60|$|An unsuspected {{stream of}} loquacity had broken its dam <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> within the man, had diluted his fiery blood and {{softened}} his pitiless fibre. Schomberg experienced mingled relief and apprehension, as if suddenly an enormous savage cat {{had begun to}} wind itself about his legs in inexplicable friendliness. No prudent man under such circumstances would dare to stir. Schomberg didn't stir. Ricardo assumed an easy attitude, with an elbow on the table. Schomberg squared his shoulders afresh.|$|E
60|$|Mr Verloc stated huskily that he did. His whole vast bulk had {{a forward}} inclination. He {{stood on the}} carpet {{in the middle of}} the room, {{clutching}} his hat and stick in one hand; the other hung lifelessly by his side. He muttered unobtrusively <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> down in his throat something about having done his military service in the French artillery. At once, with contemptuous perversity, Mr Vladimir changed the language, and began to speak idiomatic English without the slightest trace of a foreign accent.|$|E
5000|$|About this period, Tandag {{became a}} {{port of call}} to the Spanish Galleon that sailed along the {{southern}} part of Mindanao. Until today, it is generally believed that <b>somewhere</b> underneath the <b>deep</b> sea near Tandag’s twin Linongao Islands lies a sunken galleon.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Verloc, undoing some hooks of her bodice, {{while she}} went on staring ahead beyond the splashboard, handed over to him the new pigskin pocket-book. He {{received}} it without a word, and seemed to plunge it <b>deep</b> <b>somewhere</b> into his very breast. Then he slapped his coat on the outside.|$|R
50|$|Sanctuary {{is located}} <b>somewhere</b> within a <b>deep</b> {{mountain}} range, near Athens, Greece. Its land is cloaked, and its existence is secret {{known only to}} those involved.

60|$|But Carter persisted. And {{at length}} {{he reached the}} flimsy, {{fluttering}} little soul of the shopgirl that existed <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> down in her lovely bosom. His words penetrated the heart whose very lightness was its safest armor. She {{looked up at him}} with eyes that saw. And a warm glow visited her cool cheeks. Tremblingly, awfully, her moth wings closed, and she seemed about to settle upon the flower of love. Some faint glimmer of life and its possibilities {{on the other side of}} her glove counter dawned upon her. Carter felt the change and crowded the opportunity.|$|E
60|$|This night a {{wonderful}} afterglow lingered {{long in the}} west, and against the golden-red of clear sky the bold, black head of Mount Ord reared itself aloft, beautiful but aloof, sinister yet calling. Small wonder that Duane gazed in fascination upon the peak! <b>Somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> in its corrugated sides or lost in a rugged canon was hidden the secret stronghold of the master outlaw Cheseldine. All down along the ride from El Paso Duane had heard of Cheseldine, of his band, his fearful deeds, his cunning, his widely separated raids, of his flitting here and there like a Jack-o'-lantern; but never a word of his den, never a word of his appearance.|$|E
60|$|Madeline was stirred with an {{anger toward}} the brutal cowboy {{that was as}} strong as her sorrow for the loyal old cattleman. And it was when Stillwell gave up that she {{resolved}} to take a hand. The persistent faith of Stillwell, his pathetic excuses {{in the face of}} what must have been Stewart's violence, perhaps baseness, actuated her powerfully, gave her new insight into human nature. She honored a faith that remained unshaken. And the strange thought came to her that Stewart must somehow be worthy of such a faith, or he never could have inspired it. Madeline discovered that she wanted to believe that <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> down in the most depraved and sinful wretch upon earth there was some grain of good. She yearned to have the faith in human nature that Stillwell had in Stewart.|$|E
50|$|Sheeps Milk on the Boil: 1994. <b>Somewhere</b> in Irelands <b>deepest</b> countryside, {{a couple}} {{on the brink}} of losing their {{one-time}} love, are suddenly hurtled through a series of fantastical events conducted by a motley band of spirit-demons, who mercilessly toy with their lives and emotions, throwing them between ecstasy and despair and leaving them both in a thoroughly state.|$|R
60|$|Ormsgill said nothing. He had <b>somewhere</b> buried <b>deep</b> {{in him a}} vague, unformulated faith which, however, seldom found {{expression}} of any kind in words, and was tinged with a bitterness against all conventional creeds, which was not altogether astonishing {{in the case of}} a man who had lived as he had done in the dark land. Still, he had traveled four days and nights to bring his sick comrade the assistance he felt would arrive too late and now, when he dragged himself along dead weary through the steamy shade, he had reasons for surmising that there was peril somewhere down the winding trail.|$|R
60|$|Succeeding {{weeks and}} months would add to that protection, by adding to the {{accumulated}} refuse. In the neglected condition of the grounds, the dust-heap had not been disturbed in search of manure. There it had stood, untouched, from {{the time when the}} family left Gleninch to the present day. And there, hidden <b>deep</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the mound, the fragments of the letter must be.|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned away}} {{as if it had}} been {{something}} final, and busied herself with household cares while Nostromo talked with her father. Conversation with the old Garibaldino was not easy. Age had left his faculties unimpaired, only they seemed to have withdrawn <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> within him. His answers were slow in coming, with an effect of august gravity. But that day he was more animated, quicker; there seemed to be more life in the old lion. He was uneasy for the integrity of his honour. He believed Sidoni's warning as to Ramirez's designs upon his younger daughter. And he did not trust her. She was flighty. He said nothing of his cares to [...] "Son Gian' Battista." [...] It was a touch of senile vanity. He wanted to show that he was equal yet to the task of guarding alone the honour of his house.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head to glance expectantly at her companion, and she saw the smile go out of his face and anger come in. Frona was helplessly aware that she had no grip over the situation, and, though a {{rebellion}} at the cruelty and injustice of it was smouldering <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> down, she could only watch the swift culmination of the little tragedy. The woman met his gaze with a half-shrinking, as from an impending blow, and with a softness of expression which entreated pity. But he regarded her long and coldly, then deliberately turned his back. As he did this, Frona noted her face go tired and gray, and the hardness and recklessness of her laughter were there painted in harsh tones, and a bitter devil rose up and lurked in her eyes. It was evident that the same bitter devil rushed hotly to her tongue. But it chanced just then that she glanced at Frona, and all expression was brushed from her face save the infinite tiredness. She smiled wistfully at the girl, and without a word turned and went down the trail.|$|E
60|$|A {{few pages}} back, I wrote {{that a man}} belonged in these days {{to a variety of}} countries; but the old land is still the true love, the others are but {{pleasant}} infidelities. Scotland is indefinable; it has no unity except upon the map. Two languages, many dialects, innumerable forms of piety, and countless local patriotisms and prejudices, part us among ourselves more widely than the extreme east and west of that great continent of America. When I am at home, I feel a man from Glasgow to be something like a rival, a man from Barra to be more than half a foreigner. Yet let us meet in some far country, and, whether we hail from the braes of Manor or the braes of Mar, some ready-made affection joins us on the instant. It is not race. Look at us. One is Norse, one Celtic, and another Saxon. It is not community of tongue. We have it not among ourselves; and we have it almost to perfection, with English, or Irish, or American. It is no tie of faith, for we detest each other's errors. And yet <b>somewhere,</b> <b>deep</b> down in the heart of each one of us, something yearns for the old land, and the old kindly people.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the Pod People clones in the 1978 film remains the same, though again only suggested. In this film, we see the aliens in their pre-invasion form. They appear as {{gelatinous}} creatures who abandon their dying world <b>somewhere</b> in <b>deep</b> space. Once they land on Earth, they assimilate leaves and become pink flowers; the aliens eventually begin growing the larger, 6 ft pods. This time, those subverted can scream in an eerie high-pitched alien voice, which is apparently used to alert other pod people of humans in their midst {{who have not yet}} been taken over. They also seem to exhibit a kind of extra-sensory perception. When one character stabs his almost formed pod double, another pod person immediately emits the alien scream.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1806, this band of hunters and {{survivors}} {{made their way to}} Fortune Bay, and from there to Quebec, where they were reunited with the remainder of their regiment and told the tale of the loss of Aeneas. Of Ensign Faulkner and his band, there has never been any sign. It is believed they perished <b>somewhere</b> in the <b>deep</b> woods, either of starvation or due to the advancing winter.|$|R
5000|$|Versus (Vāsasu) is a 2000 Japanese {{independent}} zombie action film co-written, produced, {{and directed}} by Ryuhei Kitamura. The film is set <b>somewhere</b> in the <b>deep</b> forest of Japan, known as the Forest of Resurrection, where an escaped convict simply referred to as [...] "Prisoner KSC2-303" [...] and a gang of Yakuza battle a horde of zombies {{while at the same}} time dealing with their sinister leader who wishes to open the forest's portal of darkness.|$|R
60|$|When she had {{finished}} dinner {{she went to her}} room to dress for her ride. The rush and roar of the storm were in her ears, and she was in wild tumultuous spirits. All her youth seemed to sweep back on her; or perhaps it was that the sickness {{of the last two years}} was swept away. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> down in Stephen's heart, below her intention or even her consciousness, was a desire to be her old self if only for an hour. And to this end externals were of help. Without weighing the matter in her mind, and acting entirely on impulse, she told her maid to get the red habit she had not worn for years. When she was dressed she sent round to have out her white Arab; while it was getting ready she went once more to the tower to see the storm-effect in the darkening twilight. As she looked, her heart for an instant stood still. Half-way to the horizon a great ship, ablaze in the bows, was driving through the waves with all her speed. She was heading towards the little port, beyond which the shallows sent up a moving wall of white spray.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the firing}} that did it. They {{should have kept}} their counsel; but when a few {{thousand}} foreigners are bursting with joy {{over the fact that}} a ship under the British flag has been fired at on the high seas, news travels quickly; and when it came out that the pearl-stealing crew had not been allowed access to their consul (there was no consul within a few hundred miles of that lonely port) even the friendliest of Powers has a right to ask questions. The great heart of the British public was beating furiously on account of the performance of a notorious race-horse, and had not a throb to waste on distant accidents; but <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> in the hull of the ship of State there is machinery which more or less accurately takes charge of foreign affairs. That machinery began to revolve, and who so shocked and surprised as the Power that had captured the Haliotis? It explained that colonial governors and far-away men-of-war were difficult to control, and promised that it would most certainly make an example both of the Governor and the vessel. As for the crew reported to be pressed into military service in tropical climes, it would produce them as soon as possible, and it would apologise, if necessary. Now, no apologies were needed. When one nation apologises to an-other, millions of amateurs who have no earthly concern with the difficulty hurl themselves into the strife and embarrass the trained specialist. It was requested that the crew be found, if they were still alive - they had been eight months beyond knowledge - and it was promised that all would be forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{it was all}} {{confounding}} enough, {{but this}} indication in particular would have jostled our friend's grasp of the presented cup had he had, during the next ten minutes, more independence of thought. That, however, {{was out of the}} question when one positively felt, as with a pang <b>somewhere</b> <b>deep</b> within, or even with a smothered cry for alarm, one's whole sense of proportion shattered at a blow and ceasing to serve. [...] "Not straight, and not too fast, shall we?" [...] was the ineffable young woman's appeal to him, a few minutes later, beneath the wide glass porch-cover that sheltered their brief wait for their chariot of fire. It was there even as she spoke; the capped charioteer, with a great clean curve, drew up at the steps of the porch, and the Princess's footman, before rejoining him in front, held open the door of the car. She got in, and Berridge was the next instant beside her; he could only say: [...] "As you like, Princess--where you will; certainly let us prolong it; let us prolong everything; don't let us have it over--strange and beautiful as it can only be!--a moment sooner than we must." [...] So he spoke, in the security of their intimate English, while the perpendicular imperturbable valet-de-pied, white-faced in the electric light, closed them in and then took his place on the box where the rigid liveried backs of the two men, presented through the glass, were like a protecting wall; such a guarantee of privacy as might come--it occurred to Berridge's inexpugnable fancy--from a vision of tall guards erect round Eastern seraglios.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Somewhere</b> above me, <b>deep</b> in {{the tangle}} of the summer wilderness, Mooween stood {{watching}} his back track, eyes, ears, and nose alert to discover what the creature was who dared frighten {{him out of his}} noonday bath. It would be senseless to attempt to surprise him now; besides, I had no weapon of any kind.--"To-morrow, about this time, I shall be coming back; then look out, Mooween," [...] I thought as I marked the place and stole away to my canoe.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will, if you {{abandon the}} love idea {{and the love}} motive, and if you stand apart, and never bully, never force from the {{conscious}} will. That's where Nietzsche was wrong. His was the conscious and benevolent will, in fact, the love-will. But the deep power-urge is not conscious of its aims: and {{it is certainly not}} consciously benevolent or love-directed.--Whatever else happens, <b>somewhere,</b> sometime, the <b>deep</b> power-urge in man will have to issue forth again, and woman will submit, livingly, not subjectedly." ...|$|R
5000|$|The year is 1985 and the {{location}} is somewhere in the vast, teeming jungles of the Amazon. Medical scientist Brian Raft and his two colleagues Dan Craddock and Bill Merriday are working at a small, newly built health center, researching tropical diseases. They are the only white men in the vicinity and are the last outpost of civilization. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>deeper</b> in the jungle drums have been beating for days and Craddock seems convinced {{that they are not}} beating a message, rather that they have some other, more sinister purpose. Craddock, despite his medical training, is a superstitious man [...] "with his Welsh ghosts and his shadow-people of the lost centuries", so Raft does not take much notice of him. But soon out of the unknown comes a canoe propelled by two men with paddles. They have been working themselves to the point of almost complete exhaustion. One of these newcomers, Thomas Da Fonseca, proves to be a pilot on a mapping expedition whose plane has crashed near the second man's property. This second man, Paulo da Costa Pereira, is of indeterminate origin; he speaks Portuguese, but in a faulty manner, and carries himself in a kind of confident, haughty, evasive way that annoys Raft. Da Fonseca is sick, with a temperature far below normal, and appears to have some tropical disease. Pereira, on the other hand, seems to recover remarkably quickly. Nevertheless, Raft insists, against Pereira's will, on taking a blood sample to be certain of his health. Pereira's blood seems to be strangely mutated. If anything, it works in a superior way to normal blood. Raft overhears Pereira talking to Craddock, then suddenly these two disappear. They are seen by Merriday departing in the Center's motorboat. Craddock seems to be under the hypnotic spell of Pereira. The next morning Raft, with five natives, sets out up the river in pursuit. Raft's journey will ultimately take him to the Valley of the Flame.|$|R
