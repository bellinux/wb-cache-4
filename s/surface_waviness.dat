50|$|The {{aerofoil}} {{section was}} a NACA laminar flow one {{to have a}} low profile drag. It was very important, therefore, that the sections be accurately made and <b>surface</b> <b>waviness</b> be kept small. To achieve this, the basic wing structure (spars and ribs) was built in a jig. Accurately profiled root and tip aerofoil sections were made in thick metal and carefully secured to one half wing. Two very straight heavy weight bars were held securely relative {{to each other and}} a router was fixed to a carriage which could slide along the bars. Using this set-up the entire half wing profile could be machined very accurately. The process was repeated for the other side. The skins could then be glued to the profiled structure. When work on the aircraft was nearing completion the wing surfaces were coated in epoxy resin and then carefully rubbed down to minimise any waviness. That process took several days, with careful profile checking as it went ahead. Flight observations suggested that the procedure had produced the required result. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} measured level speed at sealevel of 323 mph was close to the design estimate of 330 mph.|$|E

GMAW-CMT welding was carried out on 5 mm and 6 mm thick AA 6351 plates. An experimental test was conducted at different level welding speed, contact tip to work distance and material thickness. There are several equipment that had been utilized in order to execute the work such as magnifying glass, vision measuring machine, MG- 8 cam gauge, Insize weld gauge, Mahr Marsuft XR 20 surface roughness machine, S- 72 cleaner remover, 222 dye penetrant, LD- 3 developer, NortecB 500 series portable eddy current flaw detector and surface p~obe. The visual inspection, weld bead measurement, <b>surface</b> roughness and <b>waviness</b> measurement, dye penetration testing and eddy current testing have been performed to assess the weld characteristic of AA 6351 joints. The results of weld bead width, weld bead height, <b>surface</b> roughness and <b>waviness</b> were analyzed using Minitab 16 software. The results indicated that welding speed, contact tip to work distance and material thickness significantly affected the weld bead width, weld bead height, <b>surface</b> roughness and <b>waviness.</b> The lowest size weld bead width achieved was 5. 5 mm meanwhile the lowest size weld bead height was 1. 3 mm.
