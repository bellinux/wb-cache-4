This preliminary work focuses on the improvement of the existing Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based models in term of accuracy relative to experimental data. The computational domain and operating conditions were adapted from experimental study [1] where liquid velocity profiles, clear liquid height, and flow patterns were among the important quantities monitored. Gas-liquid interfaces and the existence of froth regime are clearly visualized via VOF model.

The hydrodynamics of the columns have been investigated with respect to tray pressure drops, aeration and froth properties, and entrainment of liquid by vapour on the trays. Dry tray pressure drop studies have been used extensively to examine the validity {{of some of the}} commonly employed published correlations and to determine their applicability to large hole sizes. An extensive study of entrainment has been carried out to evaluate the effects of tray spacing and operating variables.

The mass transfer efficiency of the absorption system, air-CO 2 -water has been reported with a critical examination of sampling technique and method of analysis.

The flow rates used are typical of those found in practice. The approach adopted {{was to investigate the}} effect of the gas flow on the liquid flow by comparing water only flow patterns across an unperforated tray with air-water flow patterns on perforated trays. Initial gas-liquid contacting experiments on the 6. 35 mm hole tray showed that, under certain conditions, the gas flow pattern beneath the test tray can {{have a significant effect on}} the tray liquid flow pattern such that gas-driven liquid circulation was produced. This was found to be a function of this particular air-water simulator design, and as far as is known this is the first time that this phenomenon has been observed. Consequently non-uniform gas flow effects were removed by modification of the gas distribution system. By eliminating gas circulation effects, the effect of the gas flow on the separation of liquid flow was similar to that obtained on the 1. 0 mm hole tray (Hine, 1990). That is, flow separation occurred at the ends of the inlet downcomer which produced large circulating zones along the tray segments both on the non-perforated and perforated trays. The air when forced through the liquid, inhibited circulating flow such that it only occurred at high water inlet velocities.

A {{need was}} {{identified}} {{for a set}} of basic design tools for Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) plant evaporators. This led to an investigation into the different types of evaporators as well as further research on horizontal falling film evaporators as used in the MED process. It also included the theory on these types of evaporators. In order not to duplicate existing design tools, an investigation was also performed on some of the tools that are currently available. The first set of tools that were developed were tools, programmed in EES (Engineering Equation Solver), for the vacuum system and the evaporator. These programs can be used to simulate different parameters (like different mass flows and temperatures). That enables the correct selection of components for the vacuum system and can be used to address sizing issues around the evaporator. It {{can also be used to}} plan the layout of the plant.

40|$|Remediation {{process of}} region, {{formally}} exploited for chemical leaching of uranium, {{is based on}} pumping water contaminated mostly by residuals of sulfuric acid from the relevant geological horizons. The contaminated water is then treated in a chemical plant. In the treatment process evaporators play the key role. Presently operating evaporators – three units – are of falling film type. Heating service is provided by compressed vapor that is generated by evaporators. For driving the compressors and associated circulating pumps of each unit electric power of 3, 4 MW is required. In the evaporators treated solution is distributed into individual tubes by nozzles of cyclone type that are mounted at the top end of tubes. In the evaporators feed solution contains calcium sulfide of low concentration. Once the calcium sulfide concentration in the evaporating process reaches the state of saturation, even locally, fouling is initiated. Thus the solids start to grow on the inner surface of the tube wall and the nozzle’s openings become restricted. The evaporator performance – evaporating rate – gradually declines and when it reaches the bottom limit the evaporator has to be shut down. This is followed by carrying out the cleaning procedure. At {{the time when the}} evaporators started operating (1996) the period between shut downs lasted around a half a year. However, gradually, this period has become substantially shorter – presently it may even last one week only. The thesis proposes two ways of approaching the present hardly acceptable state.

A new criterion, pzf, has been introduced and the values obtained for it confirm the correlation proposed by FAIR. The extent of relative liquid mixing on the tray was determined using the variance of the residence time distribution. Graphical correlations of the mean liquid residence time and the extent of mixing have been presented.

Large bark canoes provided transportation across the waterways. Baskets, <b>trays,</b> <b>sieves,</b> and supports for various vessels were woven with strips of creeper, and ceramic pots, pans, and dishes were manufactured. Musical instruments {{were a part of}} their culture as well, as they had drums, rattles, and bamboo trumpets. Weapons and ornaments were the only forms of private property. Iron tools obtained from Europeans were of great value, although the Apiaca occasionally stole them from the Europeans.|$|R
