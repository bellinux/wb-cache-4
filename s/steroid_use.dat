5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and <b>steroid</b> <b>use</b> to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole <b>steroid</b> <b>use</b> issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006 {{the book}} Game of Shadows, written by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, was {{released}} amid {{a storm of}} media publicity including the cover of Sports Illustrated. Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of Sports Illustrated. The book alleges Bonds used stanozolol {{and a host of}} other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds's <b>steroid</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic <b>steroid</b> <b>use.</b> Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E

5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term <b>steroid</b> <b>use,</b> osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It {{marked the first time}} since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for <b>steroid</b> <b>use.</b> He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E
5|$|Three Athletics' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. Reggie Jackson (1966) won World Series titles {{with the team}} in 1972, 1973, and 1974. Mark McGwire (1984) and Walt Weiss (1985) won with the 1989 championship team. Four A's first-round picks {{have gone on to}} win the Rookie of the Year Award: McGwire in 1987, Weiss in 1988, Ben Grieve (1994) in 1998, and Huston Street (2004) in 2005. Jackson also won a Most Valuable Player award in 1973, and Barry Zito (1999) won a Cy Young Award in 2002, making them the A's only picks to win these awards. Reggie Jackson, elected in 1993, is their only pick in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Although eligible McGwire has not been elected despite over 500 career home runs and briefly holding the single-season home run record (70). Some see McGwire's exclusion as a sign that the Hall is hesitant to elect players suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs as McGwire was suspected of <b>steroid</b> <b>use</b> (he later admitted his use in 2010). The Athletics have made eighteen selections in the supplemental round of the draft and have made the first overall selection once: in the first draft in 1965.|$|E

50|$|In 2009 {{researchers}} {{conducted a}} survey of 2552 retired football players. The survey reported that anabolic steroids {{were introduced to the}} National Football League as early as 1963. <b>Steroids</b> <b>use</b> became so prevalent that players suspected that 90% of the NFL had <b>used</b> <b>steroids.</b> In addition to these rough statistics, Offensive-Lineman Pat Donovan suggested that up to 70% of the Dallas Cowboys offensive line had been <b>using</b> <b>steroids.</b> In 1990, a survey to 120 current NFL athletes reported that 67% of Offensive Lineman <b>used</b> <b>steroids.</b> At the conclusion of the survey, researchers found that out of 2552 ex-NFL players, 9.1% self reported <b>using</b> anabolic <b>steroids</b> during their career. Furthermore, 16.3% of Offensive lineman and 14.8% of defensive lineman surveyed reported <b>using</b> <b>steroids</b> during their careers.|$|R
25|$|MLB Commissioner Bud Selig briefly {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to punish Rodriguez for his admitted <b>steroid</b> <b>use,</b> citing the illegality of the situation, among other things.

25|$|Dykstra {{was named}} in the Mitchell Report on <b>steroid</b> <b>use</b> in Major League Baseball on December 13, 2007.

It also stated that the Commissioner of Baseball's office had known about Dykstra's <b>steroid</b> <b>use</b> since 2000. Dykstra did not agree {{to meet with the}} Mitchell investigators to discuss the allegations.|$|E
25|$|Other {{side-effects}} {{can include}} alterations {{in the structure}} of the heart, such as enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle, which impairs its contraction and relaxation. Possible effects of these alterations in the heart are hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, heart attacks, and sudden cardiac death. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but <b>steroid</b> <b>use</b> may accelerate this process. However, both the connection between changes {{in the structure of}} the left ventricle and decreased cardiac function, as well as the connection to <b>steroid</b> <b>use</b> have been disputed.|$|E

25|$|Long term use of topical steroids {{may result}} in skin atrophy, stria, telangiectasia. Their use on {{delicate}} skin (face or groin) is therefore typically with caution.

25|$|A {{belief of}} counter-{{transhumanism}} is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement {{in many areas}} of life, but specifically on the social plane.
