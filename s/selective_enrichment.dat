40|$|The {{occurrence}} of pharmaceuticals {{in the environment}} have been a topic of increasing concern. Most of the pharmaceuticals are not completely mineralized {{in the human body}} and are released on the sewage systems as the pharmaceutical itself and as their “biologically active” metabolites through excretion, as well as by improper elimination and disposal. Once current wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed to remove these emerging pollutant, they are easily released into the environment. The effects of halogen on biological properties of molecules have had a marked impact on various fields such as pharmacology. It can improve metabolic stability, bioavailability and interactions with the biological target. However, it also increases the recalcitrance of the molecule to biotic and abiotic degradation. Ciprofloxacin (CPF) and Diclofenac (DCF) are two widely used halogenated pharmaceuticals, commonly found in the environment in concentrations that can range ng L− 1 to mg L− 1. CPF is a common human and veterinary broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic. DCF is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), also used as analgesic and antithermic treatment. In the present study, biodegradation of CPF and DCF was assessed by selective enrichements with actived sludge and with pure cultures of three different strains - Labrys portucalensis (F 11) and two Rhodococcus spp. (FP 1 and S 2) – which had previously demonstrated capacity to degrade a range of halogenated compounds. For CPF <b>selective</b> <b>enrichments,</b> a degradation of 100 % was achived after 206 days, although without fluoride release. These findings indicate that these <b>selective</b> <b>enrichments</b> are good candidates to find a bacterial strain able to biodegrade CPF. Regarding the pure cultures, F 11 exhibited the highest degradation capacity (57 %) after 62 days, but also without fluoride release. Concerning DCF <b>selective</b> <b>enrichments,</b> it was released 68 % of the stoichiometrically expected cloride ion behind 131 days. In the experiments with pure cultures, F 11 and S 2, was released the totality of the stoichiometrically expected cloride, elapsed 131 days.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The BCNU + O 6 benzylguanine (O 6 BG) driven <b>selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> {{strategy}} was first established for enhanced transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells. This study describes a novel {{application of this}} BCNU + O 6 BG driven <b>selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> strategy in skeletal muscle stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, this study addresses the three main limitations observed in previously reported skeletal muscle stem cell transplantation strategies. Limitation of ineffective donor cells which lack the ability for successful engraftment was overcome by using a heterogeneous population of donor cells which are present during a normal skeletal muscle regeneration response. The limitation of donor cell death upon transplantation {{as a result of}} competition from the endogenous stem cells of the host muscles was overcome by elimination of host muscle stem cells with BCNU + O 6 BG treatment. Efficiency of elimination of host muscle stem cells was further demonstrated by the complete inhibition of a regeneration response up to 3 months in injured, BCNU + O 6 BG treated muscles. The limitation of localised engraftment as a result of intramuscular injection of donor cells was also addressed. The transplanted donor cells demonstrated the ability to migrate via systemic circulation. This characteristic of the donor cells would allow the transplantation of cells via intraarterial or intravenous delivery which would overcome the limitation of localised engraftment. Finally, application of the BCNU + O 6 BG driven <b>selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> strategy in skeletal muscle stem cell transplantation demonstrated enhanced engraftment.
