5|$|It {{was under}} Florentino Pérez's first {{presidency}} (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition {{of becoming the}} world's richest professional football club. The club ceded part of its training grounds {{to the city of}} Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site. The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of <b>state</b> <b>subsidy.</b>|$|E

Coast Air therefore announced it would increase the number of departures between Haugesund and Bergen, {{and at the same time}} was willing to fly to Røros if a <b>state</b> <b>subsidy</b> was granted. The contract to Røros was however won by Danish Air Transport (DAT), who bid NOK500,000 per month, NOK64,000 less than Coast Air.|$|E

25|$|Boulez {{had in mind}} as a {{model the}} Bauhaus, which had {{provided}} a meeting place for artists and scientists of all disciplines. IRCAM's aims would include research into acoustics, instrumental design {{and the use of}} computers in composition. The original building was constructed underground, partly to isolate it acoustically (an above-ground extension was added later). The institution was criticised for absorbing too much <b>state</b> <b>subsidy,</b> Boulez for wielding too much power. At the same time Boulez founded the Ensemble Intercontemporain, a virtuoso ensemble which specialised in the performance of twentieth-century music and the creation of new works. Around this time he bought an apartment on the 30th floor of a building at 21-25 Quai André Citroën in the Front de Seine district of Paris.|$|E
25|$|The company's new cahier des charges (license) was liberal. It {{called for}} new French operas with spoken {{dialogue}} (opéra comique) or sung recitative, prose or verse librettos, and {{with or without}} ballets. No single composer could have more than six new acts presented in one season (acts were counted rather than works). Preference was {{to be given to}} Prix de Rome winners up to two years after the award. In addition, up to two translated foreign works were permitted, as well as French works ten years after their premiere, and any number of public domain works, so long as these did not exceed 33% of the number of new acts presented over a two-year period. The company had the right to revive any works it had already produced, to encourage the company to establish its own repertory. As the company did not receive any <b>state</b> <b>subsidy</b> before 1864, revivals of popular, established works were critical to its financial survival.|$|E
25|$|By 1964, {{commuter}} rail service to Worcester was being provided. In 1965, the Boston and Maine Railroad started receiving MBTA subsidies for its commuter service. In 1973, the MBTA bought {{most of its}} present-day {{commuter rail}} trackage from the Boston and Maine Railroad and Penn Central (into which the New York Central Railroad and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad had merged). It also purchased rolling stock at this time. Trackage between Framingham and Worcester was not acquired by the agency, and {{due to a lack}} of <b>state</b> <b>subsidy,</b> commuter rail service on this portion was cut in 1975. Service was resumed in 1994, though the track was still privately owned until the state purchased it from CSX Transportation in 2011. The Fairmount Line was purchased from Penn Central in 1976. Passenger service resumed there in 1979 during diversion of other lines during Southwest Corridor construction, and was continued even after the project was complete.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April, during Joanita's {{short run}} of 15 performances, the {{management}} {{decided to change}} the name of the company to Théâtre Lyrique. As attendance was falling rapidly, Joanita was replaced with La pie voleuse, a Castil-Blaze adaptation of Rossini's La gazza ladra, on 23 April. However, they only performed it seven times, as the season was almost over. The season had run from late September to the end of April, a pattern repeated in later seasons, which usually ran from September or early October to May, or sometimes even into the summer. Jules Seveste sought a <b>state</b> <b>subsidy</b> of 50,000 francs for the following year, but it was too late; the budget had already been finalized. In addition, the conductor Alphonse Varney resigned his position and went to Ghent so he would have more time for composition. He was replaced by his assistant conductor, Auguste Francis Placet, and the violinist Adolphe Deloffre, who had recently returned to Paris from London, was made assistant conductor.|$|E

50|$|During 1979, <b>state</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{became part}} of the debate. The 1970s saw a large {{increase}} in <b>state</b> <b>subsidies</b> to bus operations. Mayor Olav Gjærevoll had contacted the state to investigate if the tram could receive the same subsidy level as an equivalent bus route, but this had been rejected by the department, even though Minister of Transport, Ronald Bye of the Labour Party, was positive. Chief of Administration Odd Sagør suggested during the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications of the Norwegian Parliament's visit to Trondheim the same year, that state road funds could be used on tramway infrastructure, but this was rejected. He argued that not only did the trams not receive <b>state</b> <b>subsidies</b> for operation, but they were also responsible for covering the costs for their infrastructure.|$|R

Like most Swedish newspaper they each have a political editorial page, views of the Centre Party are expressed in ÖP and views of the Swedish Social Democratic Party are expressed in LT.

2500|$|He {{is largely}} known to history for his direction, from 1831-1835, of the Paris Opera. The new government, after the July Revolution of 1830, wished to offload {{the costs and}} {{responsibilities}} of the Opera, which had been effectively state-controlled since its inception. [...] Véron saw the great potential of adapting the Opera to the bourgeois tastes of new audiences and applied for the franchise, which brought with it limited <b>State</b> <b>subsidy.</b> By bringing together the talents of designers (such as Duponchel), composers (such as Meyerbeer, Auber and Fromental Halévy), and librettists (such as Eugene Scribe and Casimir Delavigne), and developing great singers such as Adolphe Nourrit and Cornélie Falcon, he created the genre of Grand Opera. The first new production under Véron's management, Meyerbeer's Robert le diable (21 November 1831) began {{a new era in}} opera. When the government decided to further reduce subsidy of the Opera in 1835, Véron prudently withdrew, having made a substantial profit.|$|E

2500|$|Outside the US, and {{especially}} in Europe, most opera houses receive public subsidies from taxpayers. In Milan, Italy, 60% of La Scala's annual budget of €115 million is from ticket sales and private donations, with the remaining 40% coming from public funds. In 2005, La Scala received 25% of Italy's total <b>state</b> <b>subsidy</b> of €464 million for the performing arts. In the UK, Arts Council England provides funds to Opera North, the Royal Opera House, Welsh National Opera, and English National Opera. Between 2012 and 2015, these four opera companies along with the English National Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and Northern Ballet accounted for 22% of the funds in the Arts Council's national portfolio. During that period, the Council undertook an analysis of its funding for large scale opera and ballet companies setting recommendations and targets for the companies to meet prior to the 2015–2018 funding decisions. In February 2015, concerns over English National Opera's business plan led to the Arts Council placing it [...] "under special funding arrangements" [...] in what The Independent termed [...] "the unprecedented step" [...] of threatening to withdraw public funding if the Council's concerns were not met by 2017. European public funding to opera {{has led to a}} disparity between the number of year-round opera houses in Europe and the United States. For example, [...] "Germany has about 80 year-round opera houses , while the U.S., with {{more than three times the}} population, does not have any.
