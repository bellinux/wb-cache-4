50|$|As {{the century}} progressed, the Philips brothers' {{personal}} and business ties with Manchester grew closer despite their continuing links with London; by its end, they had greater {{interests in the}} northern city than in Staffordshire. The relationships are, however, obscure, in part because names were shared across generations. Chapman says that the hatting business was established around 1750 at Dolefield in Manchester and was known as Thomas Philips & Co. He says that the business also manufactured tape. Watson and Mann say that this business was known as Thomas & Nathaniel Philips by the early 1770s. Chapman notes a <b>smallwares</b> manufacturer called Nathaniel & Falkner Philips, operating on two sites not far from Manchester, in Radcliffe and Whitefield. The Nathaniel involved in this was the uncle of the partners in J. & N. Philips, while Falkner refers to his son, Thomas Falkner Philips (1744-?). Watson and Mann differ from Chapman regarding the origin of these two operations, which they say were established by the Tean partnership, although they do agree that N. & F. Philips were manufacturing <b>smallwares</b> in Manchester in the 1770s. They add that the Tean partnership of J. & N. Philips also operated from a warehouse in Manchester {{at that time and}} refer also to a business called Nathaniel & John Philips, who manufactured silk and linen goods.|$|E
50|$|Francis Phylyppe, a Fleming, {{had settled}} in the English county of Staffordshire in the 16th century. His successors became minor landed gentry in the area until {{the lure of the}} newly industrialising city of Manchester caused two of them, {{brothers}} Nathaniel (1698-1776) and Thomas (1701-1782), to move there {{in the early part of}} the 18th century. The brothers probably set up businesses manufacturing <b>smallwares</b> but their older sibling, John, stayed in rural Staffordshire and gained the title of lord of the manor of Tean and Checkley. Some sources say that John Philips had a business manufacturing linen tape, and that it was this enterprise that formed the basis for the steps that would be taken by his sons.|$|E

At the close of 1928, Metropolitan Stores was operating a chain of 130 stores from coast to coast in both Canada and the United States, with 31 Canadian stores alone located in four provinces: Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.|$|E
50|$|J. & N. Philips and Company was a {{business}} established in 1747 {{by members of the}} Philips family, and which ceased trading in 1970. Originally based in Tean, Staffordshire, England, the business was a manufacturer of textile products that expanded both by organic growth and by taking over other businesses involved in the manufacture and merchanting of textile products and smallware. It formed a part of a network of companies operated by the family, whose business interests came to include manufacture of hats and textiles such as linen <b>smallwares,</b> silks and fustians, as well as cotton spinning and dealing, power loom weaving, export merchanting and general warehousing. The family was also involved in politics, with George Philips, Mark Philips and Robert Needham Philips all being Members of Parliament and all promoting the ideals of Manchesterism while in office. George's son, George Richard Philips, was {{also a member of the}} House of Commons.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with that}} of tapes, fringes, and other <b>smallwares,</b> the {{manufacture}} of cloth ribbons forms a special department of the textile industries. The essential feature of a ribbon loom is the simultaneous weaving in one loom frame {{of two or more}} webs, going up to as many as forty narrow fabrics in modern looms. To affect the conjoined throwing of all the shuttles and the various other movements of the loom, the automatic action of the power-loom is necessary, and it is a remarkable fact that the self-acting ribbon loom was known and extensively used more than a century before the famous invention of Cartwright. A loom in which several narrow webs could be woven at one time is mentioned as having been working in Dantzig {{towards the end of the}} 16th century. Similar looms were at work in Leiden in 1620, where their use gave rise to so much discontent and rioting on the part of the weavers that the states-general had to prohibit their use. The prohibition was renewed at various intervals throughout the century, and in the same interval the use of the ribbon loom was interdicted in most of the principal industrial centres of Europe. In 1676, under the name of the Dutch loom or engine loom, it was brought to London, and although its introduction there caused some disturbance, it does not appear to have been prohibited. In 1745, John Kay, the inventor of the fly-shuttle, obtained, conjointly with Joseph Stell, a patent for improvements in the ribbon loom. Since that period, it has benefited by the inventions applied to weaving machinery generally.|$|E
