Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces <b>spatial</b> <b>competition</b> from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sociologist}} John Yinger explains urban residential inequality as {{a result}} of natural housing market forces. [...] Yinger reasons that, all else being equal, housing becomes relatively more expensive as it grows closer to work sites. [...] Because poorer families often cannot afford to pay transportation costs they may be forced to live in inner-city locations closer to employment opportunities. [...] Consequently, in order to win the <b>spatial</b> <b>competition</b> for housing near work sites, lower-income families must compensate for high priced location by accepting smaller housing, lower quality housing, or both. [...] Ultimately these market forces are subject to other socio-economic factors as no single cause can explain housing inequality.|$|E

The most of effects of housing inequality are vicious circle because those who are affected tend to pay more money in order to catch up or fix the problems caused by housing inequality, such as transportation fee, cost of getting resources and so on. All the effects are connected to each other and keep causing stronger economic problems for those who are under housing inequality.|$|E
40|$|Two {{important}} issues in econometric freight transportation demand analysis are addressed: (1) the simultaneity between quantity shipped and mode/destination choices, and (2) {{the effect of}} <b>spatial</b> price <b>competition</b> on the demand for the transportation factor. In the theoretical model, <b>spatial</b> price <b>competition</b> determines the firm's market area and, thus, determines its sales and shipment sizes. The model is estimated using switching regression techniques, since shipment size and mode/destination choice are derived from the same optimization problem. The empirical model provides consistent estimates of unconditional freight demand. These estimates are needed to forecast transportation flows and derive elasticities for policy analysis.

2500|$|A loline {{alkaloid}} is {{a member}} of the 1-aminopyrrolizidines (often referred to as lolines), which are bioactive natural products with several distinct biological and chemical features. The lolines are insecticidal and insect-deterrent compounds that are produced in grasses infected by [...] endophytic fungal symbionts of the genus Epichloë (anamorphic species: Neotyphodium). Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect herbivores, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as drought and <b>spatial</b> <b>competition.</b> They are alkaloids, organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms. The basic chemical structure of the lolines comprises a saturated [...] pyrrolizidine ring, a primary amine at the C-1 carbon, and an internal ether bridge—a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds—joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1). Different substituents at the C-1 amine, such as methyl, formyl, and acetyl groups, yield loline species that have variable bioactivity against insects. Besides endophyte–grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some other plant species; namely, Adenocarpus species (family Fabaceae) and Argyreia mollis (family Convolvulaceae).|$|E

40|$|Local {{environmental}} {{variation is}} well known to bias genetic estimates if not accounted for properly. Several authors have recommended to routinely include spatial effects in models for genetic evaluation of trees [e. g. @Gilmour 97; @Dutkowski 02]. In contrast, the competition among trees is a known issue but much less frequently addressed and studied [@Muir 05; @Cappa 08; @Costa 13]. It produces a negative autocorrelation among neighbouring trees, which can compensate in part the spatial effect, making both effects more difficult to detect and separate. Moreover, it can have an important impact in the response to selection if not accounted for. First, because of biased genetic estimates. But most importantly, because direct and competition additive genetic effects are often antagonistic. Hence, selecting the *best* genotypes frequently means also selecting the most competitive individuals, which {{is not necessarily the}} optimal strategy. In addition, any phenotypic measure could potentially benefit from <b>spatial</b> and <b>competition</b> adjustments, delivering records that are less prone to bias by uncontrolled or hidden environmental factors, and therefore with clearer genetic signal for further use in association and genomic predictions.

The possibility {{and use of}} spatial price discrimination in these markets is well documented. It is also well known that the location of processors relative to competitors crucially affects the intensity of competition. However, insights regarding the relation between spatial price discrimination and the spatial differentiation of firms are barely present because the simultaneous investigation of these issues is often intractable analytically. We use computational economics to study these problems under a general theoretical framework. For instance, we show whether and under which conditions firms choose to differentiate their locations and/or price strategies.

5000|$|Important to the {{understanding}} of migrant community health is the increasingly stratified American society, manifested in residential segregation. Beginning in the 1970s, the low to moderate levels of income segregation in the United States began to degrade. [...] As the rich became richer, so did their neighborhoods. This trend was inversely reflected in the poor, as their neighborhoods became poorer. As sociologist Douglas Massey explains, “As a result, poverty and affluence both became more concentrated geographically.” Professor of public administration and economics John Yinger writes that “one way for poor people to win the <b>spatial</b> <b>competition</b> for housing is to rent small or low-quality housing.” However, he continues, low-quality housing often features serious health risks such as lead paint and animal pests. Though lead-based paint was deemed illegal in 1978, it remains on the walls of older apartments and houses, posing a serious neurological risk to children. Asthma, a possible serious health risk, also has a clear link to poverty. Moreover, asthma attacks have been associated with certain aspects of poor housing quality such as the presence of cockroaches, mice, dust, dust mites, mold, and mildew. The 1997 American Housing Survey found that signs of rats or mice are almost twice as likely to be detected in poor households as in non-poor households.|$|E

The pair contends that obstacles exist that have prevented blacks from accumulating wealth. Historical factors such as slavery and racial segregation, the two argue, have constrained African Americans from securing and accumulating assets. [...] As a result, African Americans have had a difficult time acquiring high quality housing. Yinger also suggests that racial discrimination still plays a role in housing searches. According to Yinger, black and Hispanic households must pay higher search costs, accept lower quality housing, and live in lower quality neighborhoods due to discrimination in the search process. One study found that 20% of potential moves made by black households and 17% of potential moves made by Hispanic households were discouraged by existing discrimination within the housing search process.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>spatial</b> <b>competition</b> for feedstock between biofuel firms (determined by firms’ locational configurations, capacity, and transportation cost), and the economic feasibility and environmental footprint of cellulosic biofuels. It does so by extending existing <b>spatial</b> <b>competition</b> models to accommodate multiple feedstocks, including crop residues and energy dedicated crops. The model endogenizes feedstock-specific demand and pricing, and market structure. A key insight from the analysis is that <b>spatial</b> <b>competition</b> induces cost-minimizing biorefineries to include energy-dedicated crops in the mix. This is because their inclusion alleviates competition for stover, allowing the plan to fill capacity at lower cost. Moreover, {{this results in a}} reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per gallon of biofuel traded in the market, relative to a counterfactual where stover is assumed to be the only available feedstock.

These experiments, however, are often limited to the well-mixed environments of a test tube or a chemostat. Since spatial organization can significantly affect evolutionary dynamics, the need is growing for evolutionary experiments in spatially structured environments. The surface of a Petri dish provides such an environment, but a more detailed understanding of microbial growth on Petri dishes is necessary to interpret such experiments. We formulate a simple deterministic reaction–diffusion model, which successfully predicts the spatial patterns created by two competing species during colony expansion. We also derive the shape of these patterns analytically without relying on microscopic details of the model. In particular, {{we find that the}} relative fitness of two microbial strains can be estimated from the logarithmic spirals created by selective sweeps. The theory is tested with strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for <b>spatial</b> <b>competitions</b> with different initial conditions and for a range of relative fitnesses.
