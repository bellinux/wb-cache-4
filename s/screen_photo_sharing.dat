40|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} become an important channel of communication in people’s daily lives. Online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing,</b> a type of artefact sharing on Facebook has also grown in popularity. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} research is to study the relationship of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviours on Facebook. The study will also examine privacy concerns regarding online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing.</b> A non-random purposive sampling approach gathered a total of 422 Malaysian young adults aged between 18 and 34. Data was collected via a web based questionnaire distributed on Facebook. The results show that intrinsic and extrinsic motivations have positive correlations with online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviours on Facebook. Intrinsic motivations showed a stronger connection to online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviours. There was no significance found between privacy concerns and online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviours on Facebook. There was also no difference between genders in their online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviours. However, males showed higher privacy concerns in regards to online <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> on Facebook...|$|R

An experimental <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> system was developed and tested that, compared to current systems, offers highly simplified, groupcentric sharing, automatic and persistent people-centric organization, and tightly integrated desktop and mobile sharing and viewing. In an experimental field study, the <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviors of groups of family or friends were studied using their normal <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> methods and with the prototype sharing system. Results showed that users found <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> easier and more fun, <b>shared</b> more <b>photos,</b> and had an enhanced sense of social presence when sharing with the experimental system.

This dissertation describes a mobile application that attempts to support traditional <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> activities by allowing users to <b>share</b> <b>photos</b> with other co-present users by synchronizing the display on multiple mobile devices. Various floor control policies (software locks that determine when someone can control the displays) were implemented.

40|$|<b>Photo</b> <b>sharing</b> {{on camera}} phones is {{becoming}} a common way of maintaining closeness and relationships {{with friends and family}} and can evoke pleasurable, enjoyable or exciting experiences. People have fun when <b>sharing</b> <b>photos</b> containing amusing scenes or friends being caught doing something ‘naughty’. Recent research has seen an increase in studies that focus on the use of camera phones, remote sharing using online services or sharing in a home environment using different digital technology. However, studies that extend this focus to the equally important issues of how co-located sharing using camera phones occurs and what influences it are less common. In addition, there is a dearth of research that links <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> with user experience (e. g. pleasure, fun, excitement collectively called hedonic experience; HE). The experience of <b>photo</b> <b>sharing,</b> however, does not exist in a vacuum but in a dynamic relationship with other people, places and objects and <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> is a social experience. This thesis explores the relationship between sharing practices within different groups of people and the various settings where sharing occurs. It investigates the situations when people experience pleasure, excitement or fun during the <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> activity. However, {{to understand the nature of}} HE using mobile interactive technology (digital cameras, PDAs, mobile phones) and what influences experiences a prerequisite is an investigation of <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> experiences using mobile phones. The HCI contributions of this thesis include dentification of different types of HE and their characteristics; provides factors influencing such experience and the vocabulary to help communicating issues related to HE when using technology. In addition, it proposes an empirically based <b>Photo</b> <b>Sharing</b> Components Model that captures the contributors of the <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> experience (Value of Photos, Social Affordances, Place Affordances and Technology Affordances) and the <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> scenario notations, which account for the different sharing behavioural phenomena occurring between different groups of people (e. g. family, friends, others) in different settings (e. g. private, public, work). Finally, an account of how this model might be developed by further research is detailed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Photo</b> <b>sharing</b> {{on camera}} phones is {{becoming}} a common way to maintain closeness and relationships with friends and family. How people <b>share</b> their <b>photos</b> in collocated settings using camera phones, with whom they share, and what factors influence their sharing experience were the themes explored in this study. Results showed that people exhibit different <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviour depending on who they <b>share</b> <b>photos</b> with, where the sharing takes place and what value a picture represents to its owner. In this paper, we will explain what triggers the <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> activity and how the sharing takes place depending on who <b>photos</b> are <b>shared</b> with {{and where they are}} shared (e. g. restaurant, pub, home). The sharing experience is hindered by the difficulty of controlling which photographs are made available to particular people; sharing with a group of people at once; and ensuring appropriate privacy measures. These findings highlight requirements for novel mechanisms for organising, <b>sharing,</b> and displaying <b>photos</b> as well as provide a better understanding of <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviour using camera phones in collocated settings...|$|R

Though almost all existing social networking services provide <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> capabilities, most of them lack a sound scheme to protect their users’ privacy.

40|$|The uptake {{of digital}} photos vs. print photos has altered the {{practice}} of <b>photo</b> <b>sharing.</b> Print <b>photos</b> are easy to share within the home, but much harder to share outside of it. The opposite is true of digital <b>photos.</b> People easily <b>share</b> digital <b>photos</b> outside the home, e. g., {{to family and friends}} by email gift-giving, and to social networks and the broader public by web publishing. Yet within the home, collocated digital <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> is harder, primarily because digital photos are typically stored on personal accounts in desktop computers located in home offices. This leads to several consequences. 1) The invisibility of digital photos implies few opportunities for serendipitous <b>photo</b> <b>sharing.</b> 2) Access control and navigation issues inhibit family members from retrieving photo collections. 3) Photo viewing is compromised as digital photos are displayed on small screens in an uncomfortable viewing setting. To mitigate some of these difficulties, we explore how physical memorabilia collected by family members can create opportunities that encourage social and collocated digital <b>photo</b> <b>sharing.</b> First, we studied (via contextual interviews with 20 households) how families currently practice <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> and how they keep memorabilia. We identified classes of memorabilia that can serve as memory triggers to family events, trips, and times when people took photos. Second, we designed SOUVENIRS, a photo-viewing system that exploits memorabilia as a social instrument. Using SOUVENIRS, a family member can meaningfully associate physica...|$|R

This, in turn, could make them feel more involved and in control during a session, creating a more enjoyable experience. To test these assumptions a design prototype was created that stimulates participants to use tangible artifacts for cooperative gestures, a promising direction for the future of HCI. The situation with the cooperative gestures was compared with the regular digital <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> situation, which makes use of a keyboard. In dyads, visitors felt more involved and in control in the design prototype cooperative gestures condition (especially during storytelling), resulting in a more enjoyable digital <b>photo</b> <b>sharing</b> experience...|$|R
