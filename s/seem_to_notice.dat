2500|$|Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss): Olson {{rises from}} being Draper's {{secretary}} {{to being a}} copywriter with her own office. She becomes pregnant with Pete Campbell's child, a pregnancy that neither she nor her family or coworkers <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice,</b> until {{she goes to the}} emergency room due to illness, and they tell her she is in labor. Campbell is unaware of her pregnancy until the end of Season 2, when Peggy tells him that she gave the baby up for adoption. In Season 3, Peggy is approached by Duck Phillips to leave Sterling Cooper, but turns him down, despite the fact that his persistence leads to a romantic relationship. While he rarely acknowledges it, Don appreciates Peggy's abilities, leading him to choose her to go with him to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. She is given more freedom to come up with her own creative advertising ideas, with Don always pushing her to be better. During Season 5, Peggy feels increasingly unappreciated and patronized by Draper. In the episode [...] "The Other Woman", she leaves SCDP to accept an offer to become head copywriter at Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough, though the agency merges with SCDP in Season 6, which once again places her under Draper's leadership. In the final season, she transitions to the McCann Erickson agency and eventually finds her true feelings for Stan Rizzo.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time in the series Richie Benaud won the toss and took the unusual step of putting England into bat, but he had four fast bowlers in his team and wanted to use them in the humid, {{swinging}} conditions. In the second over Ray Lindwall's first ball swung away and Trevor Bailey was caught first ball by Alan Davidson in third slip to give him his 216th Test wicket and equal Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record. Just before the Test Bailey had given a talk to the inmates of HMP Pentridge and had been asked if he had ever been out first ball in a Test match. He said he had not, but retained his sense of humour as he ordered roast duck for dinner after his dismissal. Peter May fell to Meckiff and England were 13/2, but Peter Richardson made a dogged 68 by forgoing his favourate deflections through the slips which had cost his wicket so many times. He added 48 with Colin Cowdrey (22) and 48 again with Tom Graveney (19), taking the score to 109/3. Tom Graveney was dismissed by Benaud; [...] "I remember him getting me out in the 1958–59 Melbourne Test by attacking my leg stump. He bowled me two half-volleys, the first of which I drove hard to Colin McDonald at mid-on. The second was just a fraction slower, and I was committed to the stroke before I spotted it. McDonald held the catch and the critics put it down to another casual shot from Graveney. They did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> the crafty part that Benaud had played in my dismissal". Ted Dexter was out first ball to Meckiff (2/57), Roy Swetman for 1 off Davidson and Richardson was caught and bowled by Benaud to leave England 128/7. Debutant John Mortimore showed his all round skills with an unbeaten 44, adding 63 with Fred Trueman (21) before Benaud (4/43) and Davidson (3/38) finished off the innings for 205 early on the second day.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nobody ever <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> my good conduct," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Vyner, still bent {{on making}} conversation. [...] "They always <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> {{the other kind}} fast enough; but the ’good’ <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> escape them." ...|$|R

60|$|Here {{there had}} been a decided stir among the pews. Hodder had not <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it.|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} help {{the last piece of}} irony, but Gascoyne, who did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it, groaned.|$|E
60|$|He drank his drink, {{and went}} on. He didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that I wasn't jumping about the room, yapping with joy.|$|E
60|$|Hetty did {{not move}} out of the shadow, and though Ingleby did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it there was a curious {{hardness}} in her voice.|$|E
6000|$|Alton <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> {{something}} unusual in his companion's inflection. [...] "You {{will have to}} talk straighter, Charley," [...] he said.|$|R

5000|$|Mayor Torgo (voiced by Michael Therriault) is {{the mayor}} of Awkward Falls. He is {{actually}} an evil alien but only Becky <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Jethro was silent, but Cynthia did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that. After a space {{she spoke}} again:--"I've been {{thinking}} {{it all out}} about you, Uncle Jethro." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> the boyish doggedness of his speech, except {{so far as}} {{it might}} have {{increased}} her inconsequent and nervously pitched levity.|$|E
60|$|This {{recalled}} a suspicion awakened by my vision, so suddenly that I felt myself blushing. She did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it, and was perfectly composed.|$|E

50|$|Henry works, {{but no one}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> {{because he}} just roams and tries to get {{inspiration}} for his book. Along his way he helps different people.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{presence}} of mind enough to conceal my surprise at this unexpected utterance. 'Don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> her, Elsie,' I said, looking away. 'Yes, we are English.' ...|$|E
60|$|Weston {{moved so}} that she might step across to the {{adjoining}} car; {{but she did not}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> this, and leaned on the rail close beside him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to the parlour full of dismay. Willis Starr {{remained}} gloomy and taciturn {{all the rest of the}} evening, but nobody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it but myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang you, I {{might have}} lost you! Children are the heedlessest creatures. But look here, friend, {{the boy did}} not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> you at all; how is that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “How observant you are,” said Adela bitterly. “You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> everything. As {{a matter}} of fact, it has got six {{chrysanthemums}} in its mouth at the present moment.” ...|$|E
60|$|Graham {{looked after}} {{her a little}} baffled, a little puzzled; his eye was on her a good deal {{during the rest of}} the evening, but she did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Kit looked round. The café was crowded, but {{the people}} were talking excitedly, and nobody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> him and the girl. The noise would prevent their talk being heard.|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{sat down}} in the chair he drew out for her near the stove, and he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that she glanced at the papers on the table, for he laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{thing is}} mortal man!" [...] {{repeated}} the hunter, scarcely <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> what was passing around him, so much were his thoughts absorbed in his own reflections. [...] "Toss!" ...|$|R
60|$|He did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> {{the lack}} of cordiality in my tone. He {{appeared}} so genuinely glad to see me again that I instantly became rather ashamed of my ill nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's {{fortunate}} {{that a change}} is not impossible to me--in fact, I think I've changed a good deal already. It rather hurt me, Elcot, that you didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|His eyes {{rested on}} {{her for a}} moment and she was unpleasantly {{conscious}} that her dress was badly creased and crumpled as well as shabby; but he did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> this.|$|E
60|$|The constable <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> Psmith for {{the first}} time. He turned and stared at him. Psmith's praise had not {{had the effect of}} {{softening}} him. His look was one of suspicion.|$|R
