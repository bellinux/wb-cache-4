5|$|Second class' {{passengers}} were leisure tourists, academics, {{members of the}} clergy and middle class English and American families. The ship's musicians travelled in <b>second</b> <b>class</b> accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult <b>second</b> <b>class</b> passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and for many of these passengers, their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. <b>Second</b> <b>class</b> passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. <b>Second</b> <b>class</b> children could read the children's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the <b>second</b> <b>class</b> promenade. Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the enclosed promenade in a stroller provided by the White Star Line.|$|E

5|$|According to Pat Southern, principes {{appear to}} have been born from {{remnants}} of the old <b>second</b> <b>class</b> of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The <b>second</b> <b>class</b> stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat {{at the hands of the}} Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.|$|E

Cadets applying to the Air Corps were classified as Air Cadets, with a modified curriculum that provided flying training but eliminated Military Topography and Graphics required for Ground Cadets. Olds' class was given an abridged <b>second</b> <b>class</b> course of study until January 19, 1943, when it began an abridged first class course.|$|E

All existing third class carriages also had their seats removed. A later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered that third class carriages would be situated closest to the engine, followed by <b>second</b> <b>class,</b> with first class at the rear.|$|E

5|$|The equestrians, {{the highest}} social class of all, served in mounted units known as equites. The first {{class of the}} richest {{citizens}} served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling hoplites), and provided {{the first line of}} the battle formation. The <b>second</b> <b>class</b> were armed similarly to the first class, but without a breastplate for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The <b>second</b> <b>class</b> stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the <b>second</b> <b>class</b> in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E

The results of the diagnostic of development of the metasubject competencies of the experimental group significantly improved compared with the figures before the specialized training.
