The simulation has been performed on two different furnace configurations, namely; small and large chambers of 15 m 3 and 27 m 3, with height to width ratios of 1. 49 and 2. 02 respectively and with corresponding burner capacities of 560 kW and 900 kW. Later a major experimental trial has been performed in order to validate the results and reasonable consistency has been observed. The predicted results, with particular focus on the temperature distribution and heat transfer rate for two cases have been studied in detail...|$|R
40|$|Operating {{conditions}} of the furnaces has the major effect {{on the quality of}} steel during steel production process. Furnaces also are the biggest energy consumer in the whole production process  which make them a center of concern, {{in order to get to}} the most optimized condition through both energy and quality aspects. <b>Soaking</b> <b>pit</b> <b>furnaces</b> are for heating steel ingots before rolling, in order to provide convenient conditions for ingots for further procedures. These batch furnaces are characterized by heat and temperature conditions that vary in time. The structure permits rapid heating of the metal inside the furnace, since heat is supplied over the entire surface of the ingot. One serious problem that these furnaces might contain is the existence of non-uniform temperature gradient inside the chamber that causes different temperature distribution on the ingots surface which leads to a bad surface quality of them, considering further rolling process. As the first step through obtaining the best temperature gradient inside the chamber, is to ensure the exact temperature condition in the current running procedure. In here as the first step through the problem solving of these furnaces, temperature profile, radiation profile and other effective parameters are investigated with the aid of CFD software. The simulation is done by ICEM and FLUENT programs for geometry and mesh designing, and modeling in respect. Modeling is based on four main steps:         I.             Modeling of the furnace chamber geometry and applying appropriate mesh style with ICEM       II.             Modeling the chamber with fluent, and taking the results (case 0)     III.             Modeling of six cases with different excess air, in order to investigate the best λ magnitude     IV.             Modeling of six cases with different burner capacities in order to investigate its affection on combustion parameter...|$|R

40|$|Model {{predictions}} of the thermal and stress evolution in steel ingots, combined with a metallurgical study, have confirmed the mechanism of formation of off-comer panel cracks. The cracks are gener-ated initially in the subsurface of the ingot {{during the early stages}} of reheating in the <b>soaking</b> <b>pit.</b> The volume change associated with ~/-c ~ transformation {{plays a major role in}} the generation of the tensile stresses as in the case of the mid-face panel cracks. Early in the reheating, a subsurface two-phase zone of c ~ and 3 /contracts within a surrounding field of austenite and is placed in tension. Crack formation is enhanced by the precipitation of AIN which embrittles the steel. The subsurface cracks subsequently may penetrate to the surface of the ingot immediately upon its withdrawal from the <b>soaking</b> <b>pit</b> owing to the generation of surface tensile stresses caused by rapid cooling of the in-got surface. Measures to minimize formation of off-corner panel cracks, therefore, include reducing air cooling time (prior to charging ingots to the <b>soaking</b> <b>pit)</b> to prevent 3 ~-c ~ transformation, reheating the ingots slowly in an initially cold <b>soaking</b> <b>pit</b> to reduce the tensile stresses, increasing the air cooling time substantially to force the cracks farther from the surface, and minimizing soaking times and temperatures.

40|$|Cities in the {{developing}} countries have multiple modes of human and animal waste treatment and disposal that finally decide the overall impact on the urban ecosystem, and these have been studied {{for the city of}} Bangalore. Four modes are found, namely underground sewage systems, decentralized <b>soak</b> <b>pits</b> and septic tanks, open defecation and a miniscule effort at composting. The extent of N released per unit area is high, ranging between 0. 44 and 1. 4 t $ha^{- 1 }$ of the urban landscape. In this study the N release and outflow have been estimated. The N entering or flowing in the lithosphere,hydrosphere and in wastewater streams forms the major component. The pool size has first been determined. The size and movement through these pools were estimated with a view to determine the state of the N cycle {{and if there is a}} cause for alarm in similar cities in other developing countries. N contribution from human waste (excreta and urine) forms the singlelargest influx and sewage flowing out of the city forms the single largest efflux of N pool. Owing to a seemingly large use of <b>soak</b> <b>pits</b> and open conveyance of sewage in some parts of the city, coliforms and $NO_ 3 $–N have seeped into shallow and deep-ground aquifers and show up in ground- and sub-soil waters in the city. The level of N in these waters at a few places is slightly higher than the permissible limits. This suggests that there is a need to find alternatives to modes like the ubiquitous <b>soak</b> <b>pit,</b> such that pollution of shallow and deep aquifers is avoided in the future. Currently,there is little effort in stripping the waste water off N. Also, there is no significant effort in recovery and reuse of nutrients, and this is required to increase the sustainability levels...|$|R

40|$|In most {{integrated}} works, ingots {{are used}} as an intermediate form during the production of steel. These ingots, produced by pouring molten steel into molds, are too large {{to be used as}} input for the finishing mills which produce steel products. Hence, more manageable forms (blooms, billets and slabs) are rolled from the ingots by primary mills. The necessity of having uniformly hot steel, provided by a battery of <b>soaking</b> <b>pits,</b> limits the production capacity of any primary mill. At times there is no hot steel and the mill comes into "nothing hot" delays. It is desirable to reduce these delays to a minimum through proper management of the system. One way of doing so is to properly control the charging into the <b>soaking</b> <b>pits</b> of ingots from the queue which builds up there. The paper investigates the properties of this problem which can be considered in two parts. Firstly, when there are ingots of various temperatures in the queue, which should be charged when space becomes available in the pits? Secondly, if space becomes available when there are no hot ingots in the queue, should the empty pit be kept idle waiting for more to arrive or should it be charged with cold ingots which though readily available require considerably longer to prepare for rolling? There is the possibility of inserted idle time. A model is made of the ingot queue-soaking pit-rolling mill system. The properties of the optimal control policy for the ingot queue are investigated using Markov programming. Results are presented which illustrate its complex state dependent nature. ...|$|R
