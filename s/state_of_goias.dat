25|$|Various {{accounts}} relate {{that the}} birds were more common in Pernambuco than in Bahia through the 1960s but not later. Spix's macaw was most recently (1974–1987) known in the Río São Francisco valley, in northeastern Brazil, principally in the basins {{on the south side}} of the river in the State of Bahia. In 1974, ornithologist Helmut Sick, based on information from traders and trappers, extended the possible range of the Spix's macaw to embrace the northeastern part of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goias</b> and the southern part of the state of Maranhao. Other ornithologists reporting the bird in various parts of the state of Piaui further extended the range to a vast area of the dry interior of northeast Brazil.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{even earlier}} {{specimen}} now recognized as P. goiasensis had been collected in 1966 near Posse {{in the northeastern}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Goiás</b> by a group from the New York Botanical Garden.

A description and illustration was completed and set aside for over twenty years. Then, in 1994, Taylor showed the specimen and description to Ray Harley in preparation for publication. Harley, who had been involved in the early 1990s discovery of P. bahiensis, recognized Taylor's materials as another species of the as yet undescribed genus.|$|E
