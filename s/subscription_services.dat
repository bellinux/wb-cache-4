5|$|While {{the concept}} of only eating locally grown food is not new, the book coincided with the {{emerging}} popularity of the locavore movement and farmer's markets. Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups. During World Food Day in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in The Tyee, the Vancouver City Hall held a 100-mile themed breakfast. Locavore groups have held local-only dinner parties and week-long challenges. Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus, one being The Herbfarm Restaurant in Woodinville, Washington. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances and motivations. Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet, or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province. A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter recognizing and encouraging local food markets.|$|E

25|$|Since {{it began}} broadcasting, RTÉ One has competed with BBC One and UTV and in 1980s RTÉ began {{competing}} with other satellite and cable channels that {{are widely available}} across Ireland through cable <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> due to the high take up of cable TV from pan-European and UK channels since the 1960s, and the continued roll out of MMDS and satellite during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

It was initially aimed at a pre-teen audience and shifted its target demographic to preschool-aged children in April 2002.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1999, Microsoft {{released}} Windows Media DRM, which read {{instructions from}} media files in a rights management language that stated what the user may {{do with the}} media. The language can define how many times the media file can be played, {{and whether or not}} it can be burned to a CD, forwarded, printed, or saved to the local disk. Later versions of Windows Media DRM also allow producers to declare whether or not the user may transfer the media file to other devices, to implement music <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> that make downloaded files unplayable after subscriptions are cancelled, and to implement regional lockout.|$|E
25|$|ONdigital had {{problems}} from the start, and renaming the service ITV Digital on 11 July 2001 failed {{to help the}} matter. All <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> except E4 and FilmFour went off-air on 1 May 2002 after the consortium collapsed, explained as being due to paying {{too much for the}} television rights for The Football League. However, the choice of 64QAM broadcast mode, the fact that at least 40% of homes would need new aerials to receive it, a high churn rate, an insecure hackable encryption system, the cost of having to provide free set-top boxes, and aggressive competition from BSkyB all contributed to ITV Digital's spiraling costs, before shareholders Granada and Carlton called a halt to the venture.|$|E

25|$|Another area {{of leisure}} {{activity}} on the Internet is multiplayer gaming. This form of recreation creates communities, where {{people of all ages}} and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> such as GameSpy and MPlayer. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{its early}} years, The Movie Channel {{struggled}} in a race for subscribers in a pay television industry that pitted it among {{as many as seven}} cable-originated competitors, and even some over-the-air <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> transmitted over independent stations in many U.S. cities such as ONTV and SelecTV. In addition to the launch of Cinemax as then-HBO parent Time Inc.'s movie-focused competitor to TMC in August 1980, the competition grew when Warner-Amex and Rainbow Media jointly launched the film and arts-focused Bravo (now a general entertainment basic cable channel, with a reality television focus) in September 1980; Walt Disney Productions threw itself into the fray when it announced plans in early 1982 to launch family-oriented The Disney Channel, a service which made its debut in April 1983 (it is now a basic cable channel, focusing mainly on children's programming).|$|E

In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200million, noting progress in advertising sales.

[...] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6billion according to eMarketer, others estimated 4.7billion, The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising. In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month. The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> such as Netflix and Hulu.

500|$|The user {{base for}} the PlayStation 2 version was {{truncated}} initially because of limited sales of the PlayStation 2's hard drive and network adapters that were needed for the game. The Japanese release of Rise of the Zilart was the number one selling game when it debuted in 2003 with 90,000 copies sold in the first week. The Treasures of Aht Urhgan, released three years later, sold over 103,000 copies for the PlayStation 2 in Japan during 2006. In the United States, Final Fantasy XIs computer version sold 340,000 copies ($15.5 million) by August 2006, after its release in October 2003. It was the country's 51st best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. The Final Fantasy XI All-in-One Pack was number 36 and Wings of the Goddess was number 40 on the top 50 best-selling Xbox 360 games in Japan as of December 2007. For the AprilSeptember 2004 financial period, Square Enix saw online gaming, particularly Final Fantasy XI, sales increase by 101 percent and operating profit increase by 230.9 percent. Revenues held steady from <b>subscription</b> <b>services</b> {{in the summer of}} 2006; in the fall, however, Square acknowledged that online subscription revenues were [...] "unsatisfactory", despite the steady performance of Final Fantasy XI. In December 2003, Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that there were over 200,000 subscribers to Final Fantasy XI, allowing the company to break even and start making a profit. There were between 200,000 and 300,000 active players daily in 2006. As of August 14, 2006 the Xbox 360 version was the sixth most played game on Xbox Live. In June 2012, Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that Final Fantasy XI had become the most profitable title in the Final Fantasy series. While many MMOs have switched to some form of free-to-play, including World of Warcraft, the base monthly subscription price point for Final Fantasy XI has remained the same since its debut in 2002.|$|E
