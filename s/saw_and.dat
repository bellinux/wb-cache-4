He wrote acclaimed books including British Zoology, the History of Quadrupeds, Arctic Zoology and Indian Zoology although he never travelled further afield than continental Europe. He knew and maintained correspondence with many of the scientific figures of his day. His books influenced the writings of Samuel Johnson. As an antiquarian, he amassed a considerable collection of art and other works, largely selected for their scientific interest. Many of these works are now housed at the National Library of Wales.|$|E

Marking Vidler's directorial debut, {{the film was}} adapted from the play of the same name, also written by Enright, which {{was inspired by the}} murder of Leigh Leigh. The film stars Laurence Breuls, Simon Lyndon and Linda Cropper, and also features the first credited film performance of Heath Ledger. The film follows Jared (Breuls), a young surfer who witnesses his friends raping a girl.

5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles {{can be made from}} straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to <b>saw</b> <b>and</b> to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E

He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them.

5|$|In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany {{to obtain}} Emperor Henry III's help in {{returning}} Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside, to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King Andrew I, having left England {{as an infant}} after his father's death and the accession of Cnut as King of England. In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year with Hermann II, the Archbishop of Cologne. He also {{was impressed with the}} buildings he <b>saw,</b> <b>and</b> later incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions. The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help Ealdred. Ealdred was able to discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court. Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor Henry IV, this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.|$|E

40|$|Subject of investigation: {{process of}} sawing of wood {{particle}} boards by circular saws. Purpose of the work: substantiation of the rational {{parameters of the}} circular <b>saw</b> teeth <b>and</b> <b>sawing</b> conditions. The theoretical results include the study and determination {{of the influence of}} technological and tool factors on the power, energy and qualitative characteristics of the process of sawing of wood particle boards by circular saws; specification of the peculiar dependences of the characteristics of the sawing conditions on the geometry of the saw teeth; development of a mathematical model for sawing of wood particle boards by the circular saws. The work substantiates the rational parameters of circular <b>saw</b> teeth <b>and</b> the conditions of sawing of wood particle boards which provide for lower power consumption and for a high quality of the sawn surface. The rational parameters are substantiated for the circular <b>saws</b> <b>and</b> for the conditions of sawing of wood particle boards by the circular saws. The use of the improved circular <b>saws</b> <b>and</b> <b>sawing</b> conditions makes it possible to decrease the extent of chipping of the edges of wood particle boards, to reduce power consumption in <b>sawing</b> <b>and</b> to prolong the durability of toolsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
5|$|Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was {{his account}} of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second {{appearing}} in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he <b>saw</b> <b>and</b> did and {{on the basis of these}} details, some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London. On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she <b>saw</b> <b>and</b> afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E

When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler <b>saw,</b> <b>and</b> reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers (there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time), weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries. A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, only 120miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All 9 crew perished in the wreck. Only 3 bodies were recovered, that of James Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. Insh, which were buried in Scalloway.|$|E
