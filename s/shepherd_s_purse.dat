Isolates from broccoli were identified as A. candida race 9 (Ac 9), from pak choi and Chinese cabbage as the sub-race V of Ac 7 or as a mixed population of sub-races A and V of the same race. Isolates from Shepherd 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>purse</b> were identified as Ac 4. Australian Ac 9 isolates caused white blister disease on broccoli, broccolini, cauliflower, Brussels sprout and other related Brassicaceae hosts including B. nigra (black mustard), B. napus (oilseed rape), and on B. rapa (turnip rape) 2 ̆ 7 Torch 2 ̆ 7 (a differential host of Ac 7). All cultivars of cabbage (B. oleracea var. capitata) and one new broccoli 2 ̆ 7 Booster 2 ̆ 7 inoculated with isolates from broccoli were immune to the isolate tested. This result indicates that the Australian A. candida varies from the European one that causes disease on cabbage as well as on other B. oleracea varieties and additionally on shepherd 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>purse</b> and an American one that causes disease on cabbage. The genotype of B. nigra tested was susceptible to both Ac 9 and Ac 7. This result indicates that B. nigra can serve as a host for both races.

40|$|Purpose. There {{were three}} {{objectives}} of this study: (1) To assess {{the possibility of}} using pupil diameter as an index of deception {{in the context of a}} comparison question polygraph test. (2) To determine if pupil diameter would make a significant contribution to an optimal multivariate classification equation in combination with the traditional predictor variables used in field polygraph practice. (3) We explored the possibility of replacing one or more of the traditional predictor variables with pupil diameter. Methods. We used a laboratory mock crime experiment with 24 participants, half of whom stole 20 (US) from a secretary 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>purse.</b> Participants were tested with a comparison question test modelled after standard field practice. Physiological measures were taken with laboratory quality instrumentation. Features were extracted from the physiological measures. Those features were subjected to a number of different statistical analyses. Results. Innocent participants showed larger increases in pupil diameter in response to probable-lie questions than to relevant questions. Guilty participants did not show differential responding to the question types. The additional of pupil diameter to a multivariate classification model approached, but did not reach significance. Subsequent analyses suggest that pupil diameter might be used to replace the traditional relative blood pressure measure. Conclusions. Pupil diameter was found to be a significant predictor variable for deception. Pupil diameter may be a possible replacement for the traditional relative blood pressure measure. Additional research to explore that possibility would seem to be warranted...|$|R
40|$|Al though {{ultimately}} victorious in the Crimean War (1854 - 56), {{the performance}} of the British Army had been so disappointing that the government at the time was compelled to investigate the causes of military dalliance. Apart from expected and repeated references to embarrassments of strategy, tactics and command, concern was expressed by the investigating committees over deficiencies in military financial and supply management. At the time, and in concert with these findings, the British Army was insistent that its performance in the field was deleteriously affected both by excessive economy in military spending and by the means with which Parliament exercised control over military spending. After the Civil War and military reign of Cromwell (1642 - 1658) and the Revolution of 1688 Parliament had determined that it could effectively control the administration of the British Army through its control of the Nation 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>purse.</b> Thus all matters related to military finance were given into the hands of civilian representatives of Parliament. For over two centuries the army was to have almost no say in its finances.

In particular the wider use of audits carried out by the Exchequer and Audit Department on behalf of Parliament extended Parliamentary control over military finance.

40|$|CD 1 d-restricted {{lymphocytes}} {{recognize a}} broad lipid range. However, how CD 1 d-restricted lymphocytes translate T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of lipids with similar group heads into distinct biological responses remains unclear. Using a soluble invariant NKT (iNKT) TCR and a newly engineered antibody specific for alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) -human CD 1 d (hCD 1 d) complexes, we measured the affinity of binding of iNKT TCR to hCD 1 d molecules loaded with {{a panel of}} alpha-GalCer analogues and assessed the rate of dissociation of alpha-GalCer and alpha-GalCer analogues from hCD 1 d molecules. We extended this analysis by studying iNKT cell synapse formation and iNKT cell activation by the same panel of alpha-GalCer analogues. Our results indicate the unique role of the lipid chain occupying the hCD 1 d F' channel in modulating TCR binding affinity to hCD 1 d-lipid complexes, the formation of stable immunological synapse, and cell activation. These data are consistent with previously described conformational changes between empty and loaded hCD 1 d molecules (Koch, M., V. <b>S.</b> Stronge, D. <b>Shepherd,</b> <b>S.</b> D. Gadola, B. Mathew, G. Ritter, A. R. Fersht, G. S. Besra, R. R. Schmidt, E. Y. Jones, and V. Cerundolo. 2005. Nat. Immunol 6 : 819 - 826), suggesting that incomplete occupation of the hCD 1 d F' channel results in conformational differences at the TCR recognition surface.

40|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour, territory {{size and}} diet of the scalyfin, Parma victoriae, were studied at three sites in South Australia. Two sites were in Ecklonia habitat on an exposed coast, one of them, Site 1, in a marine reserve at West I., and the other, Site 2, in an intensely fished area at The Bluff, Victor Harbor. The third, Site 3, was sheltered, in a fucoid community in Groper Bay, Flinders I., {{in the eastern}} Great Australian Bight. The algal food supply was highest at the reserve site (1), and lowest at the sheltered site (3). The scalyfin spent {{a greater proportion of}} time foraging, and a lower proportion of time sheltering, at the reserve site (1), than at the Bluff site (2). At Site 3, territories were about seven times larger than at the other two sites, and fish spent a higher proportion of time in defence and aggressive interactions than at the other sites. The diet at all sites was predominantly browsed rhodophytes, but at Site 3 the rhodophytes eaten were almost entirely epiphytic on fucoid algae and in low abundance. At the exposed sites (1, 2), where food algae were patchy, scalyfin removed Ecklonia sporophytes experimentally placed in their territories, but not at Site 3, dominated by fucoids. At the exposed sites they employed a saltatory foraging mode, whereas at Site 3 they adopted a cruise search foraging behaviour over their larger territories. Both modes seem optimal in their respective habitats. <b>Shepherd,</b> <b>S.</b> A.; Clark, M. and Ferguson, G. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) {{adopted a}} {{conservation}} and management measure (CMM) for North Pacific striped marlin (Kajikia audax). A 2012 stock assessment indicated that the limits in this CMM were insufficient to prevent overfishing of this stock. I used a survey employing Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), demographic and short answer questions to collect information on stakeholder opinions on select criteria and management options if a new CMM were to be developed. Management options with the highest ratings were circle hooks and catch limits while the lowest ratings were for a retention ban. Respondents had varied opinions {{on the need to}} manage striped marlin and additional research could bolster support for further management. An Ecopath with Ecosim model was then used to evaluate how implementation of different management measures for North Pacific striped marlin would impact biomasses of striped marlin and other groups. Increases in fishing effort had the greatest impact on relative biomass, with declines in most of the higher level trophic groups and increases in many of the mid-level trophic groups. The use of circle hooks and the elimination of the shallowest hooks from deep longline sets led to increases in striped marlin biomass, and effects to other species were limited. Recovery of striped marlin was greatest if measures were implemented to all fleets; conservation measures adopted unilaterally by the United States would have a minimal impact on biomass recovery for this species. Lastly, I discussed the benefits and costs of broader retention policies for purse seine and longline tuna fisheries in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). Using bycatch data from observers and logbooks from the U. <b>S.</b> <b>purse</b> seine and longline fleets operating in the WCPO, this dissertation documents the types and magnitude of fish discarded. Expanding retention policies beyond the target tunas and to other gear types would further reduce discarding and possibly provide stronger incentives to develop and use more selective techniques. Beyond impacts to the ecosystem and fisher behavior, adopting broader retention policies may have other implications, and this dissertation explored those implications on vessels, processors, and communities...|$|R
40|$|Satellite RNAs (satRNAs) {{depend on}} their helper viruses for replication, {{encapsidation}} and spread. The goal of the research was to determine helper virus specificity and host range of the RPV barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV-RPV) satRNA (satRPV RNA) and assay satRPV RNA for the ability to affect the accumulation and modulate disease symptoms of its helper viruses in protoplasts and plants. Although similar in structural genes, subgroup I and II luteoviruses have very different polymerases. BYDV-RPV and beet western yellows virus (BWYV), members of subgroup II luteoviruses, supported satRPV RNA replication in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous hosts, respectively. In contrast, BYDV-PAV and ST 9 associated RNA (ST 9 a RNA), subgroup I luteoviruses, failed to replicate satRPV RNA. However, the stimulation of BWYV by ST 9 a RNA resulted in an increased accumulation of satRPV RNA progeny in BWYV + ST 9 a RNA + satRPV RNA inoculated tobacco protoplasts. BWYV encapsidated satRPV RNA, but in a form different from that found in BYDV (RPV + PAV) particles. SatRPV RNA was transmitted to plants by aphids that acquired virus from infected protoplasts. The concentration of encapsidated helper and satRPV RNA had to be above a threshold level to facilitate aphid transmission. Oat plants infected with BYDV-RPV and satRPV RNA had milder symptoms than those infected with BYDV-RPV alone. SatRPV RNA reduced BYDV-RPV helper RNA accumulation in oat plants and protoplasts. However, it did not affect symptoms caused by the severe mixed infection of RPV and PAV BYDVs and {{had no effect on}} PAV RNA accumulation in oats. In contrast, satRPV RNA reduced the accumulation of both BWYV helper RNA and nonhelper ST 9 a RNA in shepherd 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>purse</b> plants but attenuated BWYV and ST 9 a RNA symptoms only slightly. Sat RPV RNA symptom modulation seems to be determined by competition between the satRPV RNA and its helper virus for replication and encapsidation. The results showed that satRPV RNA can replicate in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous protoplasts and plants and suggested that the specificity determinants of satRPV RNA replication are contained within the polymerase genes of supporting viruses rather than in structural genes or host plants...|$|R
