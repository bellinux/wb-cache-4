25|$|Controlling {{water vapor}} in air {{is a key}} concern in the heating, ventilating, and {{air-conditioning}} (HVAC) industry. Thermal comfort depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called refrigeration, and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food <b>stores,</b> <b>like</b> supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or food cases, which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.|$|E

25|$|Asda {{had also}} {{neglected}} {{many of the}} older stores within its estate by not refurbishing them in line with other stores that had been refurbished and its more expensive new store sites. One example was the Astley Bridge, Bolton store which had been built in 1970. This store did not receive its first major refurbishment until 1993, and was until that point still trading with the old blue and orange Asda corporate logo and signage attached to the building in various positions, {{and there were many}} other <b>stores</b> <b>like</b> that. It meant that Asda had left the older, outdated unrefurbished stores in locations where competitors were opening new stores more vulnerable to losing customers to their shiny new rivals.|$|E

25|$|On many systems, a program's {{virtual address}} may refer to data {{which is not}} {{currently}} in memory. The layer of indirection provided by virtual addressing allows the operating system to use other data <b>stores,</b> <b>like</b> a hard drive, to store what would otherwise have to remain in main memory (RAM). As a result, operating systems can allow programs to use more memory than the system has physically available. When a program needs data which is not currently in RAM, the CPU signals to the kernel that this has happened, and the kernel responds by writing the contents of an inactive memory block to disk (if necessary) {{and replacing it with}} the data requested by the program. The program can then be resumed from the point where it was stopped. This scheme is generally known as demand paging.|$|E

After that however, he rarely went to the former shop and instead bought equipment from local <b>stores</b> <b>like</b> Atomic Music in Beltsville, Maryland {{for most of his}} life. He disliked Guitar Center for its [...] "dystopian" [...] and [...] "unpleasant" [...] environment, {{which was one of the}} major parts of him being influenced to make No Stairway: [...] "I wanted to take something unattractive and be able to extract beauty from it. I wanted to make that environment float on a cloud. [...] I wanted to inspect little nuances, capture them, and paint with them." [...] While living in New York City, there was a point where Greenwald became bankrupt and wanted to create great-sounding tracks with no budget whatsoever without the need of using samples from a digital audio workstation or other computer software. While waiting for the train one day, he went to a Guitar Center store near Atlantic Terminal out of boredom. At the store, he heard someone playing a Green Day song on an electric guitar and noticed the instrument's poor tone: ...|$|E
