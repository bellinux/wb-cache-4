5|$|Between the <b>second</b> <b>century</b> BCE {{and ninth}} century CE, the islands {{came under the}} control of {{successive}} indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Western Satraps, Abhira, Vakataka, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Shilaharas from 810 to 1260. Some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are the Jogeshwari Caves (between 520 and 525), Elephanta Caves (between the sixth to seventh century), Walkeshwar Temple (10th century), and Banganga Tank (12th century).|$|E

5|$|Many {{texts from}} the Roman Empire {{refer to the}} mysteries of Isis, but the only source to {{describe}} them {{is a work of}} fiction, the novel Metamorphoses, written in the <b>second</b> <b>century</b> CE by Apuleius. In it, the initiate undergoes elaborate ritual purification before descending into the innermost part of Isis's temple, where he has an intense religious experience, seeing the gods in person.|$|E
5|$|Most of the city's monumental {{projects}} were {{built on the}} wadi's northern bank. Among them is the Temple of Bel, on a tell which {{was the site of}} an earlier temple (known as the Hellenistic temple). However, excavation supports the theory that the tell was originally located on the southern bank, and the wadi was diverted south of the tell to incorporate the temple into Palmyra's late first and early <b>second</b> <b>century</b> urban organization on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|Palmyrene trade {{reached its}} apex during the <b>second</b> <b>century,</b> aided by two factors; {{the first was}} a trade route built by Palmyrenes, and {{protected}} by garrisons at major locations, including a garrison in Dura-Europos manned in 117 AD. The second was the Roman conquest of the Nabataean capital Petra in 106, shifting control over southern trade routes of the Arabian Peninsula from the Nabataeans to Palmyra.|$|E

5|$|The {{hermeneutic}} {{style is}} {{a style of}} Latin in the later Roman and early Medieval periods characterised by the extensive use of unusual and arcane words, especially derived from Greek.

In the early medieval period, some leading Continental scholars were exponents, including Johannes Scotus Eriugena and Odo of Cluny.|$|E

The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh. A relief of the goddess Brigantia found near Birrens in Dumfriesshire, combines elements of native and classical art.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a Christian community before the late <b>second</b> <b>century</b> AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in the early to mid third century, a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea.|$|E

5|$|Citing the Palmyrenes' combat {{skills in}} large, sparsely {{populated}} areas, the Romans formed a Palmyrene auxilia {{to serve in}} the Imperial Roman army. Vespasian reportedly had 8,000 Palmyrene archers in Judea, and Trajan established the first Palmyrene Auxilia in 116 (a camel cavalry unit, Ala I Ulpia dromedariorum Palmyrenorum). Palmyrene units were deployed throughout the Roman Empire, serving in Dacia late in Hadrian's reign, and at El Kantara in Numidia and Moesia under Antoninus Pius. During the late <b>second</b> <b>century</b> Rome formed the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum, which was stationed in Dura-Europos.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's reign {{came to an}} end in 96 when he {{was assassinated}} by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was {{condemned}} to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful <b>second</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

He scored his first first-class century against Durham, scoring 101 in an innings victory. He added a <b>second</b> <b>century</b> (115) against Nottinghamshire, before rejoining the England under-19 squad for the series against Pakistan under-19s. He struggled in the one-day series, scoring just 36runs in three matches, but finished as the top run-scorer in the youth Tests; with 377 at an average of 62.83.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the <b>second</b> <b>century</b> and power rested in the hands of the council.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to form by striking 141 against Gloucestershire before taking 3/9, his first three-wicket haul at first-class level, to help Australia take a nine-wicket win. He added a <b>second</b> <b>century</b> {{in as many}} innings with 118 in an innings win over Northamptonshire. Harvey then struck 122 in the rain affected Third Test at Manchester; he helped Australia take a 42-run first innings lead, but was out for a duck in the second innings. Australia collapsed to 8/35 and were saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.|$|E
