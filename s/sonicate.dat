The ultrasound source (or transducer) is pulsed on and off, and moved in a defined pattern to <b>sonicate</b> the tissue of interest. The pulsing of the ultrasound serves two purposes: to agitate the tissue matrix by extending and compressing it and to keep the tissue from absorbing too much energy and ablating it, so preventing necrosis. The manual movement of the transducer allows for control of the sonicated volume of tissue and where the drug may penetrate more readily.|$|E

Pretreatment of mice with Shigella dysenteriae 60 R <b>sonicate</b> elevated serum NO levels and enhanced the convulsive response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), as indicated by a higher mean convulsion score and a higher number of mice responding with seizures. Treatment of the mice with S-methylisothiourea sulfate (SMT), a potent inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (NOS), prevented the elevation of serum NO levels and concomitantly reduced the enhanced response to PTZ. The mean convulsion scores were 0. 7, 0. 7, 1. 3, and 0. 8 for mice treated with saline, saline and SMT, S. dysenteriae 60 R <b>sonicate,</b> and S. dysenteriae 60 R <b>sonicate</b> with SMT, respectively (P = 0. 001 for 60 R <b>sonicate</b> versus saline and P = 0. 013 for 60 R <b>sonicate</b> versus 60 R <b>sonicate</b> with SMT).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether intravenous <b>sonicated</b> dextrose albumin could improve endocardial border resolution during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Background. <b>Sonicated</b> albumin improves endocardial border resolution in patients undergoing exercise stress echocardiography. Because a <b>sonicated</b> mixture of albumin with dextrose results in better transpulmonary passage than <b>sonicated</b> albumin alone, this agent could be utilized to further improve endocardial border resolution during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Methods. We gave intravenous injections of <b>sonicated</b> dextrose and albumin to 50 patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography. Left ventricular video intensity, contrast agent persistence (in seconds), number of contrast agent-enhanced cardiac cycles and improvement in endocardial border resolution were assessed from the apical four-chamber view at baseline, low dose (10 μg/kg body weight per min) and peak dobutamine infusion. Results. There was significantly better left ventricular peak video intensity at peak dobutamine infusion than after the same injection at baseline (p < 0. 005, analysis of variance). The number of contrast agent-enhanced cardiac cycles in the left ventricular cavity was also significantly longer at peak infusion. Endocardial border resolution was improved (mainly in lateral segments) in 93 % of patients at low dose and 95 % of patients at peak infusion. Conclusions. Intravenous <b>sonicated</b> dextrose albumin improves endocardial border resolution during dobutamine stress echocardiography...|$|R
40|$|The {{homogenisation}} of {{milk and}} cream has been widely studied but the effect of sonication on the structural and functional properties of cream is not well known. In this study, raw milk, ultrafiltration retentate and cream samples were <b>sonicated</b> at 20 kHz and the rennet and acid gelation properties of these <b>sonicated</b> samples investigated. High pressure homogenisation at 80 bar was also performed for comparison. Sonication of raw milk and retentate samples led to {{a decrease in the}} fat globule size. Conversely, the fat globules in cream samples <b>sonicated</b> at < 10 °C flocculated to form grapelike structures whereas the cream samples <b>sonicated</b> at 50 °C did not form such aggregates. High pressure homogenisation at 50 °C led to similar flocculated structures, but these were not observed at low temperatures. This suggests a potential benefit of sonication technology in allowing low temperatures to be utilised for cream homogenisation, reducing energy demand. However, a gel made using cheese-milk with <b>sonicated</b> cream resulted in separation of a fat layer rather than the incorporation of the fat globules into the gel matrix.

The <b>sonicated</b> IESBO was tested for morphology, elasticity, melting behavior and chemical composition and compared to those of the non-sonicated IESBO to determine what physical and chemical changes manifest as a consequence of sonication. Application of power ultrasound had significant effects on the physical properties of IESBO. The <b>sonicated</b> IESBO showed smaller crystals and was harder than the non-sonicated IESBO. Sonication increased elasticity (G 2 ̆ 7; storage modulus) of the IESBO from 194. 9 ± 17. 9 to 597. 2 ± 159. 6 Pa. Sonication also affected the melting behavior of the crystallized fat when the melting behavior of <b>sonicated</b> stearin fraction (crystals) was evaluated. Stearin fraction of the <b>sonicated</b> IESBO showed a sharper and narrower peak than that of the non-sonicated IESBO. However, sonication did not affect its chemical composition, which was determined by fatty acid methyl ester compositions of the stearin fractions with and without sonication.

40|$|Prosthetic joint {{infection}} (PJI) {{is a rare}} but refractory {{complication of}} arthroplasty. Accurate identification of pathogens is a key step for successful treatment of PJI, which remains a challenge for clinicians and laboratory workers. We designed a combined culture method with sonication of implants and incubation in a BD Bactec system to improve the effectiveness of pathogen diag-nosis in PJI. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of <b>sonicate</b> fluid cultures in the BD Bactec system and to compare the results with those of synovial fluid cultures in the BD Bactec system. The prosthetic components removed were sonicated in Ringer’s solution, and then <b>sonicate</b> fluid was incubated in Bactec bottles for 5 days. Synovial fluid was incu-bated in Bactec bottles for 5 days as a control. Synovial fluid cultures with Bactec bottles and <b>sonicate</b> fluid cultures with Bactec bottles showed sensitivities of 64 % and 88 %, respectively (P 0. 009), with specificities of 98 % and 87 % (P 0. 032), respec-tively. <b>Sonicate</b> fluid cultures with Bactec bottles were more sensitive than synovial fluid cultures with Bactec bottles regardless of whether antimicrobial agents were used within 14 days before surgery (81 % versus 52 %; P 0. 031) or not (93 % versus 72 %; P 0. 031). Sonication of explanted prostheses followed by incubation of the resulting <b>sonicate</b> fluid in Bactec bottles detected manymore pathogens than did synovial fluid cultures with Bactec bottles. This method is also effective in cases with antibiotic treatment before surgery. Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a rare but refractory compli-cation of arthroplasty that leads to severe consequences if un-resolved, not only for patients but also for society, because of lon...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Cross-reactivity in {{the delayed}} {{hypersensitivity}} response to mycobacteria of different Runyon groups was tested in Swiss white mice immunised with live mycobacteria. All the strains tested gave cross-reactions and, generally, slow growers gave stronger cross-reactions with other slow growers than with rapid growers and vice versa. Sonicates of cross-reacting mycobacteria were also tested {{for their ability}} to generate activated macrophages in mice immunised with Mycobacterium avium. All the mycobacterial sonicates generated activated macrophages but a <b>sonicate</b> of Salmonella typhi did not. The <b>sonicate</b> of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv also generated activated macrophages, which indicates that there might be protective cross-reactions between M. tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the bactericidal effect of shock waves (SWs) on gram-negative or gram-positive monocultured biofilms grown on an orthopedic implant in vitro. Cortical bone screws were individually cultured with Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis to produce a biofilm. In each run of 8 screws, 6 screws were treated with shock waves and then <b>sonicated</b> to disrupt the biofilm. One screw was <b>sonicated</b> only and one was not shock waved or <b>sonicated</b> before sampling for plate count dilutions. Post-treatment serial dilutions and plate counts were done on an aliquot from the vial containing each screw to obtain the number of colony-forming units (CFUs). Shock waves were at a constant energy of 0. 15 mJ/mm 2. Pulse number and screw orientation were varied. A linear mixed-effects model was used with “treatment” as a fixed effect and “run” as a random effect. Pairwise comparisons of treatments were performed with Tukey-Cramer’s adjustment for P-values. <b>Sonicated</b> plate counts were greater than nonsonicated counts for each run. When all <b>sonicated</b> screws were compared to all nonsonicated screws, the counts were significantly increased (P = 0. 0091). For each paired comparison between <b>sonicated</b> and shock wave treatment, the only significant difference was in the S. epidermidis biofilm treated at 2000 pulses in a horizontal position, which increased the post-treatment count (P = 0. 0445). No bactericidal effects were seen on monocultured biofilms on cortical bone screws treated with shock waves...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{incubation}} time and cell density on glycolytic rate {{were examined in}} suspensions of intact, permeabilized and <b>sonicated</b> L- 929 cells. <b>Sonicates</b> exhibited strong dependence on cell density and a distinct lag in glycolytic rate, while intact cells showed no cell density dependence and linear glycolytic rates. Permeabilized cells exhibited linear glycolytic rates, but sometimes showed dependence on cell density. Rates of lactate production (nmol at 30 min/ 106 cells) were highest in <b>sonicates</b> and lowest in intact cells. These results are interpreted as support for the previously proposed hypothesis that enzymes of the glycolytic pathway are highly organized in intact L- 929 cells...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFlowers with poricidally dehiscent anthers are {{typically}} nectarless but are avidly visited and often solely pollinated by bees that <b>sonicate</b> the flowers to harvest pollen. Sonication results from shivering the thoracic flight muscles. Honey bees (Apis) and the 4, 000 + species of Megachilidae are enigmatic in their seeming inability to <b>sonicate</b> flowers. The oligolectic megachilid bee Osmia brevis was found audibly sonicating {{two of its}} beardtongue pollen hosts, Penstemon radicosus and P. cyananthus. The bees’ high-pitched sonication sequences are readily distinguishable from flight sounds in audiospectrograms, as well as sounds that result from anther rasping. Instead, floral sonication by O. brevis resembles the familiar sounds of bumblebees buzzing, in this case while visiting P. strictus flowers...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{were studied}} for {{lymphocyte}} transformation {{responses to a}} variety of Neisseria gonorrhoeae antigens and to a Neisseria catarrhalis <b>sonicate.</b> Cells from infected patients manifested significant uptake of tritiated thymidine in response to one or more gonococcal antigens. In some cases, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was so marked in lymphocytes not challenged by antigens in vitro that added blastogenesis was either obscured or inhibited. At five weeks posttherapy, lymphocytes were relatively nonreactive to gonococcal antigenic stimulation. Blastogenesis in response to N. catarrhalis was also seen for a few gonorrhea patients and normal controls. Cross-antigenicity of catarrhalis organisms and gonococci was indicated by the disappearance of reactivity to catarrhalis <b>sonicate</b> by the lymphocytes of almost all convalescent gonorrhea patients...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on the safety and skin delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} (DTH), responses of the Leishmania donovani whole cell <b>sonicate</b> antigen delivered in conjunction with alum-BCG (AlBCG), Montanide ISA 720 (MISA) or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) in groups of vervet monkeys. Following three intradermal injections of the inoculums on days 0, 28 and 42, safety and DTH responses were assessed. Preliminary tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&# 945;) and interferon gamma (IFN-&# 947;) levels were also measured and these were compared with DTH. Only those animals immunized with alum-BCG reacted adversely to the inoculum by producing ulcerative erythematous skin indurations. Non-parametric analysis of variance followed by a post-test showed significantly higher DTH responses in the MISA+Ag group compared with other immunized groups (p < 0. 001). The MPLA+Ag group indicated significantly lower DTH responses to the <b>sonicate</b> antigen compared with the AlBCG+Ag group. There was a significant correlation between the DTH and cytokine responses (p < 0. 0001). Based on this study we conclude that Leishmania donovani <b>sonicate</b> antigen containing MISA 720 is safe and is associated with a strong DTH reaction following immunization...|$|E

40|$|A single bolus {{of either}} Escherichia coli endotoxin, <b>sonicated</b> {{suspension}} of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, or pyrogen-free normal saline was intratracheally instilled in six week old specific-pathogen-free pigs. Pigs exposed to E. coli endotoxin developed fever, leukopenia followed by leukocytosis, and endotoxemia. Leukocytosis {{was the only}} clinical abnormality noted in pigs receiving the <b>sonicated</b> suspension of H. pleuropneumoniae. At one day postexposure, focal areas of atelectasis and consolidation were observed in the caudal lung lobes of animals receiving either E. coli endotoxin or the <b>sonicated</b> suspension of H. pleuropneumoniae. Lesions were characterized by a neutrophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis with alveolitis in the surrounding tissue. Increased numbers of alveolar macrophages and evidence of phagocytosis were observed by light and electron microscopy. No clinical abnormalities or lesions were observed in animals receiving normal saline. Lesions typical of acute porcine Haemophilus pleuropneumonia were not produced by either E. coli endotoxin or <b>sonicated</b> suspension of H. pleuropneumoniae, indicating that multiple virulence factors are probably involved in lesion development...|$|R
