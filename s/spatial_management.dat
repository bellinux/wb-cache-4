40|$|The master's thesis {{explores the}} {{transformation}} of urban public space by using the sustainable urban transport planning {{on the subject of}} open public spaces in the wider centre of Ljubljana. Under the term »transformation« we imply the connection between <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> of open public space in the town and the scope of sustainable mobility, because our opinion is that a well-managed open public space is to be transformed, i. e. its usage and its use of sustainable ways of mobility. This implies that non-motorised ways of mobility are used more often as well as people spending time in public space more often. The master's thesis comprises of two parts. We dealt with the first part theoretically, we also presented the significance of open public space for the city in depth. We dealt with another variable theoretically, namely with the sustainable mobility and their mutual interconnection. The second part of the thesis contains the analysis of spatial and traffic management of the chosen open public spaces in Ljubljana. With the help of literature we chose indicators for determining the <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> of open public spaces. That was the base to determine the criteria for grading the <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> of open public spaces (a non-managed, medium-managed, well-managed space). We chose the cases of well-managed and medium-managed open public spaces in Ljubljana. The questionnaire-based aim of the research, whose database consisted of possible users of such public spaces was to find out the scope and scope-change of sustainable mobility in Ljubljana, related to users' evaluation of <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> of open public space and also related to the significance of <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> of open public space for the users. With the view that the well-managed open public space in the city encourages the use of sustainable non-motorised ways of mobility and regular usage of open public space, we set out three hypotheses, whose validity we checked with statistical tests ANOVA and the Kullback test for connectedness. The first two hypotheses were concerned with dependency on frequency of chosing non-motorised ways of mobility, i. e. on the <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> of open public space and on users' grading of <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> of open public space. The statistical test ANOVA proved the two hypotheses partly. The third hypothesis was concerned with users' contentment of open public spaces in relation to the car-traffic closure for the city centre of Ljubljana (as one of the <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> activities for open public space), and the closure's impact on users visiting the city centre. The Kullback test entirely confirmed the hypothesis for connectedness...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{claims for}} the importance of electronic tagging and the resulting data for improved management of fished species, there are few examples where this has occurred. In this contribution we describe how pop-up satellite archival tagging data have been incorporated into a habitat prediction model to support <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> in an Australian longline fishery, specifically throughreduction of unwanted bycatch of a quota-managed species, southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii). This model, and its practical application, has evolved over time (2002 -present), due to the successful cooperation between scientists, fishery managers and stakeholders. To illustrate this example of successful use of tagdata in management, we review the appropriate biology of SBT and its’ interaction with the fishery, the management challenge that tagging and the habitat model helped resolve, and how this approach has been implemented. Discussion of the management costs associated with this management system shows that fine-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> is a suitable approach for this bycatch issue. We conclude with some general lessons for the application of flexible <b>spatial</b> <b>management</b> approaches, based on management and science constraints...|$|E

Especially, with the increasing of the volume of spatial data and the extending of the application of GIS, one of the requirements for the <b>spatial</b> database <b>management</b> systems (SDBMS) of the future is the ability to handle the huge volume spatial data. These applications involve spatial data mining and knowledge discovery, multi-dimensional and dynamic GIS, spatial-temporal GIS etc. Therefore, the paper presents a new software framework of <b>spatial</b> data <b>management</b> in GIS based on the parallel <b>spatial</b> database <b>management</b> system (PSDBMS) to solve the difficulties in storing and retrieval of the huge volume spatial data. The application of the parallel database management system in GIS will come forth lots of new issues.

In order to improving the integrated performance of parallel GIS, it is properly necessary to utilize the parallel database management system in the parallel GIS.
