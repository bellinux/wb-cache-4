50|$|Mämmi is {{traditionally}} made of water, rye flour, and powdered malted rye, seasoned salt, and dried powdered Seville orange zest. The mixture is then {{allowed to go}} through a slow natural <b>sweetening</b> <b>process</b> before being baked in an oven until set with Maillard reaction. Preparation takes many hours, and after baking the mämmi is stored chilled for three to four days before being ready to eat. Instead of being allowed to sweeten naturally, traditionally, commercially made mämmi is usually seasoned with dark molasses. Traditional mämmi tastes aromatic sweet, having only up to 2% sugar, but commercially produced mämmi can have as much as 20% sugar and tastes different, not so aromatic sweet. Mämmi has up to 10% protein and is rich in trace elements. Mämmi was traditionally stored in small bowls made of birch bark called tuokkonen or rove. Finnish packaging still prints birch bark-like texture on the carton boxes.|$|E
5000|$|Although Douglass had a {{monopoly}} on the laugh track, he eventually faced competition by 1977 when other sound engineers began to offer laugh tracks that differed from Douglass' distinctive laughs. Most notably, engineer and Douglass protégé Carroll Pratt started his own company, Sound One. Pratt and his brother had been working under Douglass since the early 1960s, but began to notice that Douglass' technique was falling behind as advances were made in production technology. Pratt commented that after years of constant use, an audible hiss could be heard when a laugh was being cued up due to Douglass' tapes wearing out. While not stubborn, Douglass was so fond of his machine and technique that he felt no urgency to advance his technology. Pratt parted ways with Douglass, and created a new [...] "laff box," [...] one that was simpler to use and had greater capacity than Douglass' (Pratt's recordings were on cassette tape, Douglass' on an older reel-to-reel tape). With the advent of stereo television, Pratt's stereo recordings matched the sound quality of television shows being filmed or videotaped in that audio format, whereas Douglass attempted to convert previous mono analog recordings to stereo. Pratt introduced an innovative laugh track that contained more realistic (though less distinctive) reactions. While Pratt's laugh track {{had its share of}} recognizable chuckles as well, they are more quiet and subtle than Douglass', which had become so familiar and ubiquitous that they sounded trite. Several sitcoms switched to Pratt's laugh track after 1977, including M*A*S*H and The Love Boat. Several live sitcoms, such as Laverne and Shirley, Happy Days, and all post-1978 MTM productions like WKRP in Cincinnati (CBS, 1978-82) and Newhart (CBS, 1982-90), also chose Pratt over Douglass for the <b>sweetening</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

A total of 1282 pieces of data for 27 ILs (including 23 imidazolium-based and four ammonium-based ILs) have been used to build and test the model. The coefficient of determination (R- 2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the ELM model for the test set are 0. 990 and 0. 0301, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — Natural gas usually {{contents}} {{several of}} non-hydrocarbon components for example, hydrogen sulphide, {{carbon dioxide and}} water vapor. Moreover, these components are undesirable and cause several technical problems for instance, corrosion and pollution. Indeed, chemical solvent gas <b>sweetening</b> <b>process</b> may be considered the most popular technology to remove acid gases from natural gas stream [1]. However, this process may face several technical problems during its operation for example, amine carry over and pressure dropping in the amine absorber. Therefore, this study aims to simulate gas-sweetening process at North Gas Company (N. G. C.) {{as a case study}} using Aspen HYSYS simulator program. The laboratory analysis has shown that the gas at the NGC possesses huge amounts of H 2 S (about 2. 95 %) and CO 2 (about 2. 54 %). The simulation work has examined the effects of declining amine contactor pressure on the <b>sweetening</b> <b>process</b> performance and rich amine loading. Moreover, the simulation study has been found that when the amine contactor tower declines that will effect acid gases loading in amine solution...|$|E

However, because natural gas exists in deep underground reservoirs it may contain several non-hydrocarbon components, for example, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. These impurities are undesirable compounds and cause several technical problems, for example, corrosion and environmental pollution. Recently, the Iraqi Kurdistan region has achieved huge development in many fields, for example, education, economic and in the oil and gas industries. Khurmala dome is located in southwest Erbil-Kurdistan region. The Kurdistan region government has paid great attention to this dome to provide fuel for the Kurdistan region. Currently, the Khurmala associated natural gas is flaring at the field and there is a plan to recover and trade this gas and to use it either as feedstock to the power station or to sell it on the global market. However, laboratory analysis has shown that the Khurmala natural gas has huge quantities of H 2 S (about 5. 3 %) and CO 2 (about 4. 4 %). Therefore, this study aims to simulate the prospective Khurmala gas <b>sweetening</b> <b>process</b> by using the latest version of the Aspen HYSYS V. 7. 3 program.

40|$|Background: During {{recent decades}} {{household}} incomes have increased steadily, leading {{to changes in}} dietary habits and food expenditure. Aim: To report changes in household food expenditure focusing on trends in processed food across income quintiles in Metropolitan Santiago. Material and Methods: Information obtained from the Fourth (1986 - 1987), Fifth (1996 - 1997) and Sixth National Institute of Statistics (INE) Surveys (2006 - 2007) were used. Food expenditure data over the study periods was extracted from household expenditure surveys (HES) after verifying and adjusting food prices registered by the INE to current 2007 prices. Results: Absolute food expenditure over the study period increased for all groups; the largest increase was found in lowest income quintiles; however, the proportion of total family budget spent on food decreased in all groups. The largest increases in food expenditure corresponded to <b>sweetened</b> beverages, <b>processed</b> fruit juices, alcoholic drinks, ready meals and "eating out". Expenditure on fish rose slightly whereas the absolute spending on legumes, eggs and oils decreased. Expenditure in processed food as percentage of total food expenditure increased from 42 % to 57 % of total for mean household. For the 2 nd quintile it rose from 31 % to 48 % and for the lowest quintile increased from 53 % to 68 % over the three decades (1987 - 2007). Changes were greatest in energy rich processed foods such as bread, pastries, confectioneries and granulated sugar. These particular foods are of high energy density and contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and added sugars.

Natural gas in the above form is typically subjected to a <b>sweetening</b> <b>process</b> that removes these acid gases. Microscale technologies {{have the potential to}} substantially enhance mass transport phenomena on account of their inherently high surface area to volume ratio. The present work reports the mass transfer characteristics during gas-liquid absorption in a microreactor. The absorption of CO 2 mixed with N 2 into aqueous diethanolamine was investigated in a single straight channel having a hydraulic diameter of 762 micrometer and circular cross-sectional geometry. The performance of the reactor was characterized with respect to the absorption efficiency and mass transfer coefficient. Close to 100 % absorption efficiency was obtained under optimum operating conditions. Shorter channel lengths were observed to yield enhanced values of mass transfer coefficient on account of the improved utilization of the liquid reactants ’ absorption capacity for a given reactor volume. In comparison to the 0. 5 m long channel, the mass transfer coefficients with the 0. 3 m and 0. 1 m channels were higher on an average by 35. 2 % and 210 %, respectively. Parametric studies investigating the effects of phase superficial velocity, liquid and gas phase concentration were performed.

Also {{available}} from the publisher at: [URL] Open AccessAwareness that maternal diet may influence the outcome of pregnancy as well as the long-term health of mother and child has increased in recent years. A new food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed and validated specifically for the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The MoBa FFQ is a semi-quantitative tool which covers the average intake of food, beverages and dietary supplements during the first 4 to 5 months of pregnancy. It includes questions about intakes of 255 foods and dishes and was used from 2002 onwards. Data assessed by the MoBa FFQ is available for 87, 700 pregnancies. Numerous sub-studies have examined associations between dietary factors and health outcomes in MoBa. The aim {{of this paper is to}} summarize the results from 19 studies of maternal diet and pregnancy outcomes, which is the complete collection of studies based on the MoBa FFQ and published before September 2014. The overall research question is whether maternal diet – from single substances to dietary patterns – matters for pregnancy outcome. The pregnancy outcomes studied till now include birth size measures, infants being small and large for gestational age, pregnancy duration, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, as well as maternal gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention. As a whole, the results from these studies corroborate that the current dietary recommendations to pregnant women are sound and that maternal diet during pregnancy is likely to contribute to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications including preterm birth, preeclampsia, and reduced foetal growth. The results provide supporting evidence for recommending pregnant women to consume vegetables, fruit, whole grain, fish, dairy, and water regularly and lower the intake of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages, <b>processed</b> meat products and salty snacks. The results showing negative impact of even low levels of environmental contaminants support the precautionary advice on consumption of foods containing these. New findings are that particularly lean fish explained the positive association between seafood intake and foetal growth, and the indications of a protective effect of probiotic and antimicrobial foods on pregnancy outcomes. This points to the importance of diet composition for a healthy gut flora and the body’s immune response. Although these studies are observational and cannot infer causality, the results identify diet as an important modifiable lifestyle factor, suggesting that healthy eating, defined as following the official recommendations, is particularly important in pregnancy...|$|R

The MoBa FFQ is a semi-quantitative tool which covers the average intake of food, beverages and dietary supplements during the first 4 to 5 months of pregnancy. It includes questions about intakes of 255 foods and dishes and was used from 2002 onwards. Data assessed by the MoBa FFQ is available for 87, 700 pregnancies. Numerous sub-studies have examined associations between dietary factors and health outcomes in MoBa. The aim {{of this paper is to}} summarize the results from 19 studies of maternal diet and pregnancy outcomes, which is the complete collection of studies based on the MoBa FFQ and published before September 2014. The overall research question is whether maternal diet – from single substances to dietary patterns – matters for pregnancy outcome. The pregnancy outcomes studied till now include birth size measures, infants being small and large for gestational age, pregnancy duration, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, as well as maternal gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention. As a whole, the results from these studies corroborate that the current dietary recommendations to pregnant women are sound and that maternal diet during pregnancy is likely to contribute to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications including preterm birth, preeclampsia, and reduced foetal growth. The results provide supporting evidence for recommending pregnant women to consume vegetables, fruit, whole grain, fish, dairy, and water regularly and lower the intake of sugar <b>sweetened</b> beverages, <b>processed</b> meat products and salty snacks. The results showing negative impact of even low levels of environmental contaminants support the precautionary advice on consumption of foods containing these. New findings are that particularly lean fish explained the positive association between seafood intake and foetal growth, and the indications of a protective effect of probiotic and antimicrobial foods on pregnancy outcomes. This points to the importance of diet composition for a healthy gut flora and the body’s immune response. Although these studies are observational and cannot infer causality, the results identify diet as an important modifiable lifestyle factor, suggesting that healthy eating, defined as following the official recommendations, is particularly important in pregnancy...|$|R
