5|$|In 1994, Ma {{recovered}} {{more than}} 1,200 Warring States period bamboo slips from the Kingdom of Chu, {{now known as}} the Shanghai Museum bamboo slips. Several ancient texts were written on the strips, including the Kongzi Shi Lun, a previously unknown commentary on the Confucian Classic of Poetry attributed to Confucius himself. The discovery caused a <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> academia, and the texts {{have been the subject of}} intense studies by numerous scholars, including Ma himself.|$|E

5|$|Motivations for {{clitoral}} modification and mutilation vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires and the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of a penis) often result in the retention of the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as a penis analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} penis through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits retention of sexual <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Natalee Ann Holloway (born October 21, 1986) was an American {{teenager}} whose disappearance made {{international news}} after she vanished on May 30, 2005, {{while on a}} high school graduation trip to Aruba in the Caribbean. Holloway lived in Mountain Brook, Alabama, and graduated from Mountain Brook High School on May 24, 2005, shortly before the trip. Her disappearance caused a media <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> the United States, and the case remains unsolved.|$|E

5|$|The 1873 mahant–Elokeshi {{incident}} {{was not the}} first incident against a mahant of Tarakeswar. Mahant Shrimanta Giri was executed in 1824 for the murder of his mistress's lover. However, according to Sarkar (author of Hindu wife, Hindu nation), while the 1824 scandal hardly created any public outrage and faded quickly from public memory, the 1873 affair was embedded in public memory and created a huge <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> contemporary Bengal. When a satyagraha was organised against the reigning mahant of Tarakeswar, Satish Giri, in 1974 for his sexual and financial misconduct, the 1873 affair was alluded to several times.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS {{or simply}} Tourette's) {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple motor tics {{and at least one}} vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E

5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a {{stinging}} <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> {{the eyes of}} people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This {{is caused by the}} release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating {{a stinging}} sensation. This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Anning {{discovered}} a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656. When Conybeare presented {{his analysis of}} plesiosaur anatomy to {{a meeting of the}} Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> scientific circles. The second fossil was named and described as Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus and is the type specimen (holotype) of this species, which itself is the type species of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> {{the area of the}} clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E

5|$|Petrosino {{received}} anonymous {{letters from}} Neapolitans in New York that confirmed Alfano's {{presence in the}} city, where he allegedly had given a banquet to several local Camorra members in a Grand Street restaurant. On April 17, 1907, Petrosino and his agents raided the apartment at 108 Mulberry Street where Alfano was living and arrested him. The arrest caused a <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> Naples. He {{had been convicted of}} a crime involving moral turpitude in Italy and was turned over to the Federal authorities. Within three days he was expelled and put on a ship to Le Havre in France, where he was picked up by the Italian police. He was put behind bars in Naples. According to some sources, Alfano was the man behind Petrosino's murder in Palermo on March 12, 1909, which has since been attributed to the Sicilian Mafia, and to Vito Cascioferro in particular.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a common}} neurological condition. We investigated the prevalence of RLS in patients suffering from unpleasant <b>sensations</b> <b>in</b> the legs. METHODS: We included 16, 543 patients consulting one of 312 primary care practices in Germany on November 8, 2007. All patients filled out a self-assessment questionnaire. Patients who reported suffering from unpleasant <b>sensations</b> <b>in</b> the legs were then assessed by the physician. Main outcome measures were the overall prevalence of unpleasant <b>sensations</b> <b>in</b> the legs and the prevalence of RLS; the most common differential diagnoses in the subpopulation suffered from unpleasant leg sensations. RESULTS: Out of all participating patients 7704 (46. 6 %) suffered from unpleasant <b>sensations</b> <b>in</b> the legs and 1758 (10. 6 %) were diagnosed with RLS according to the four essential clinical criteria. Among patients with unpleasant leg sensations, the prevalence of RLS was considerably higher (22. 7 %) than in the total population. The most common differential diagnoses were osteoarthritis (21. 5 %), disc lesion (19. 2 %), varicose veins (18. 8 %) and muscle cramps (14. 6 %). Of the patients with RLS 53. 4 % had already consulted their physician about their leg problems in the past. Still, only 20. 1 % of the RLS patients had received the correct diagnosis. Comorbidity rates were significantly increased in RLS patients compared to patients suffering from leg symptoms of other origin. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of RLS in primary care patients with unpleasant <b>sensations</b> <b>in</b> the legs. Thus, in patients presenting with these symptoms the diagnosis of RLS should routinely be considered. Copyright © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E
5|$|Their first match {{took place}} on 16 September 1905 against Devon, who had been runners-up {{in the most recent}} English county championship, and for whom played ten members of Devonport Albion, the top club in England. Because of this, Devon went into the match as favourites, however the crowd of 6,000 at the match were soon stunned by the New Zealanders as they scored 12 tries and {{eventually}} won 55–4. Billy Wallace scored 28 points, including three tries, and it would be another 51 years before another All Black would score more points in one match. The score caused a <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> Britain, and some newspapers even incorrectly reported the score as Devon 55, New Zealand 4. Eventually the reports were corrected, and the New Zealanders returned to Newton Abbot to be greeted by a brass band and cheering crowd.|$|E
5|$|Bueno's {{schedule}} at {{the time}} included twenty-five to thirty shows weekly. Due to his demanding tours, Bueno began consuming beer to excess, which began to interfere with his performing. His stress level was further increased from receiving multiple death threats. Following a concert at the nightclub Escándalo in La Plata, Bueno was returning {{to the city of}} Buenos Aires on the evening of June 24, 2000. After his path was blocked by another driver who had passed him on the turnpike, Bueno tried to chase the vehicle to move in front of it again. In the process, he lost control of his SUV and crashed against a barrier. He was ejected from the SUV and he died instantly. His death caused an immediate <b>sensation</b> <b>in</b> the Argentine media, with speculation about a possible murder conspiracy. After a short trial, the driver of the other vehicle was found not guilty; the judge considered Bueno to have been responsible for driving imprudently.|$|E
