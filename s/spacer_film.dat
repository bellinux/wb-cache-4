40|$|We {{show that}} ferroelectrics-based {{periodic}} structure made of BaSrTiO 3 (BST) cubes, arrayed onto a metal {{plate with a}} thin dielectric <b>spacer</b> <b>film</b> exhibit a dramatic enhancement of absorbance with value close to unity. The enhancement is found around the Mie magnetic resonance of the Ferroelectrics cubes with the backside metal layer stopping any transmitted waves. It also involves quasi-perfect impedance matching resulting in reflection suppression via simultaneous magnetic and electrical activities. In addition, it was shown numerically {{the existence of a}} periodicity optimum, which is explained from surface waves analysis along with trade-off between the resonance damping and the intrinsic loss of ferroelectrics cubes. An experimental verification in a hollow waveguide configuration with a good comparison with full-wave numerical modelling is at last reported by measuring the scattering parameters of single and dual BST cubes schemes pointing out coupling effects for densely packed structures. © 2014 AIP Publishing LL...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the surface plasmon mode that propagates at a metal dielectric interface and the localized plasma resonances (LPR) is investigated experimentally in Ag-island films. A stair-stepped sample geometry comprising a glass substrate, a continuous 50 -nm Ag film, an LiF <b>spacer</b> <b>film</b> of thickness d = 5 - 60 nm, and an Ag-island film of mass thickness 3 nm is used in near-normal-reflectivity and plasmon-propagation-constant (k) determinations. The results are presented graphically and discussed. The overall shape of the reflectivity curves {{is found to be}} characteristic of Ag films, but with a dip at about 400 nm (corresponding to the absorption resonance of the island film) which is most pronounced with d = 25 nm. It is inferred that the island resonances are strongly coupled to a continuous-film dissipative mechanism at this d value. This inference is supported {{by the fact that the}} variation in k, correctd for LiF effects and plotted as a function of d, is greatest at around d = 25 nm. The implications of this finding for broad-band coupling into a thin-film mode, LPR enhancement of waveguide nonlinear effects, and new surface-enhanced-Raman-scattering geometries are indicated...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} {{on the material}} properties and growth control of silicon nitride (SiN x) <b>spacer</b> <b>films</b> in transistors are becoming ever more stringent as scaling of transistor structures continues. One method to deposit high-quality films with excellent control is atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, depositing SiN x by ALD {{has turned out to}} be very challenging. In this work, it is shown that the plasma gas residence time t is a key parameter for the deposition of SiN x by plasma-assisted ALD and that this parameter can be linked to a so-called 2 ̆ 2 redeposition effect 2 ̆ 2. This previously ignored effect, which takes place during the plasma step, is the dissociation of reaction products in the plasma and the subsequent redeposition of reaction-product fragments on the surface. For SiN x ALD using SiH 2 (NH t Bu) 2 as precursor and N 2 plasma as reactant, the gas residence time t was found to determine both SiN x film quality and the resulting growth per cycle. It is shown that redeposition can be minimized by using a short residence time resulting in high-quality films with a high wet-etch resistance (i. e., a wet-etch rate of 0. 5 ¿nm/min in buffered HF solution). Due to the fundamental nature of the redeposition effect, it is expected to play a role in many more plasma-assisted ALD processes...|$|R

For these kind of multilayers, we have found coercivities which are close to those for single layer ﬁlms with no out-of-plane anisotropy.

30|$|The {{synthesis}} of the hierarchical TiO 2 spheres (HTSs) began with the {{synthesis of}} the TiO 2 nanoparticles using the solvothermal method given in a previous paper [23]. In a typical synthesis, 0.45  M titanium butoxide (TBT), 0.90  M hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid (HNO 3), and acetic acid (HAc) (CH 3 COOH) were added to 25  mL of n-hexane and stirred {{at room temperature for}} 30  min. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 150  °C for 5  h. The autoclave was then cooled down to room temperature naturally. After completion of the solvothermal reaction, the white precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed with absolute ethanol two times, and dried in ambient air at 80  °C for 12  h. For preparation of the HTS electrode, the HTS paste was screen-printed onto a FTO glass plate using a doctor-blading method. The thickness of TiO 2 films was controlled by using a layer of adhesive tape (3 M Scotch brand) as a frame and <b>spacer.</b> All <b>films</b> were heat treated at 450  °C for 1  h and cooled to room temperature.

40|$|Abstract—The {{significance}} of optimization of gate–source/drain extension region (also known as underlap design) in double gate (DG) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) FETs {{to improve the}} linearity performance of a low power folded cascode operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is described. Based on a new figure-of-merit (FoM) involving A V, linearity, f T and dc power consumption P DC, the paper presents guideline for optimum design for underlap <b>spacer</b> s and <b>film</b> thickness T si to maximize the performance of OTA. It {{has been shown that}} FoM exhibited by an underlap DG MOSFET OTA gives significantly higher value (≅ 9) compared to a conventional single gate bulk MOSFET OTA. This is due to a combination of both higher f T, and higher gain A V for the same linearity at low power consumption of 360 µW. With gate length scaling, FoM continues to improve, primarily due to higher value of f T. A scaled bulk MOSFET OTA exhibits similar but much smaller enhancement in trend for Fo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} mixing vanes (MVs) {{attached}} to a grid spacer {{on the characteristics of}} air–water annular flows were experimentally investigated. To know the effects, a grid spacer with or without MV was inserted in a vertical circular pipe of 16 -mm internal diameter. For three cases (i. e., no spacer, spacer without MV, and spacer with MV), the liquid film thickness, liquid entrainment fraction, and deposition rate were measured by the constant current method, single liquid film extraction method, and double liquid film extraction method, respectively. The MVs significantly promote the re-deposition of liquid droplets in the gas core flow into the liquid film on the channel walls. The deposition mass transfer coefficient is three times higher for the spacer with MV than for the spacer without MV, even for cases 0. 3 -m downstream from the <b>spacer.</b> The liquid <b>film</b> thickness becomes thicker upstream and downstream for the spacer with MV, compared with the thickness for the spacer without MV and for the case with no spacer...|$|R
30|$|A {{homemade}} in situ liquid TEM cell {{was used}} for the experiment. Liquid precursors were enclosed between two Si 3 N 4 window grids in the in situ cell. The details of the in situ cell structure have been previously reported [15, 23]. Metallic thin <b>film</b> <b>spacers</b> of ~ 100  nm were formed on one of the grids to limit the minimum space between the substrates; however, the typical separation between the Si 3 N 4 windows was generally larger and also varied from place to place because of the Si 3 N 4 window deformation resulting from the clamping pressure. The EB was focused on the Si 3 N 4 windows to induce the breaking up of the precursor molecules and the deposition of the nanomaterials. Because of the bowing up deformation, the separation of the two Si 3 N 4 windows can be of the order of 10  µm [15]; thus, the focus conditions for the two windows are usually different, and the focused beam exposure/nanostructure development observation was usually performed on the top substrate only.|$|R

40|$|A lipid {{membrane}} was tethered to a gold film by a peptide spacer molecule terminated by a sulfhydryl group. Membranes were formed by fusion of liposomes prepared from egg phosphatidylcholine on self assembled monolayers of the thiolipopeptide Myr-Lys(Myr) -Ser-Ser-Pro-Ala-Ser-Ser-Ala-Ala- Ser-Ala-Cys-amide mixed with mercaptoethanol as a diluent molecule or lateral <b>spacer.</b> These mixed <b>films,</b> although not representing a perfect lipid bilayer, {{have been shown}} to retain the activity of incorporated H+-ATP synthases from chloroplasts in contrast to films prepared from the pure thiolipopeptide. The activity of the protein was demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy. The resistance decreased due to proton transport across the lipid film, which occurs as a consequence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Several effects previously determined from kinetic measurements of the enzyme reconstituted in liposomes such as saturation with respect to the substrate (ATP), inhibition by venturicidin, activation by a positive potential pulse and increase of the proton current as a function of increasingly negative potentials have been confirmed also for this tethered membrane system. Changes in the impedance spectra due to the addition of ATP were fully reversible. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} a quasi-analytical self-consistent {{model of the}} stripline-based broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements of ferromagnetic films. Exchange-free description of magnetization dynamics in the films allowed us to obtain simple analytical expressions. They enable quick and efficient numerical simulations of the dynamics. With this model we studied the contribution of radiation losses to the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth, as measured with the stripline FMR. We found that for films with large conductivity of metals the radiation losses are significantly smaller than for magneto-insulating films. Excitation of microwave eddy currents in these materials contributes to the total microwave impedance of the system. This leads to impedance mismatch with the film environment resulting in decoupling of the film from the environment and, ultimately, to smaller radiation losses. We also show that the radiation losses drop {{with an increase in}} the stripline width and when the sample is lifted up from the stripline surface. Hence, in order to eliminate this measurement artifact one needs to use wide striplines and introduce a <b>spacer</b> between the <b>film</b> and the sample surface. The radiation losses contribution is larger for thicker films...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{interlayer}} exchange coupling in magnetic multilayers with superconducting (SC) spacer is addressed in La_ 0. 67 Sr_ 0. 33 MnO_ 3 (LSMO) - YBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 (YBCO) - La_ 0. 67 Sr_ 0. 33 MnO_ 3 (LSMO) epitaxial trilayers through resistivity, ac-susceptibility and magnetization measurements. The ferromagnetic (FM) LSMO layers possessing in-plane magnetization suppress the critical temperature (T_c) of the c-axis oriented YBCO thin <b>film</b> <b>spacer.</b> The superconducting order, however, survives even in very thin layers (thickness d_Y∼ 50 Å, ∼ 4 unit cells) at T < 25 K. A predominantly antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange coupling between {{the moments of}} the LSMO layers at fields < 200 Oe {{is seen in the}} normal as well as the superconducting states of the YBCO spacer. The exchange energy J_ 1 (∼ 0. 08 erg/cm^ 2 at 150 K for d_Y = 75 Å) grows on cooling down to T_c, followed by truncation of this growth on entering the superconducting state. The coupling energy J_ 1 at a fixed temperature drops exponentially with the thickness of the YBCO layer. The temperature and d_Y dependencies of this primarily non-oscillatory J_ 1 are consistent with the coupling theories for systems in which transport is controlled by tunneling. The truncation of the monotonic T dependence of J_ 1 below T_c suggests inhibition of single electron tunneling across the CuO_ 2 planes as the in-plane gap parameter acquires a non-zero value.

50|$|In spacer patterning, a <b>spacer</b> is a <b>film</b> layer {{formed on}} the {{sidewall}} of a pre-patterned feature. A spacer is formed by deposition or {{reaction of the}} film on the previous pattern, followed by etching to remove all the film material on the horizontal surfaces, leaving only the material on the sidewalls. By removing the original patterned feature, only the spacer is left. However, since there are two spacers for every line, the line density has now doubled. This is {{commonly referred to as}} Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP). The spacer technique is applicable for defining narrow gates at half the original lithographic pitch, for example.As pitch splitting has become more difficult due to possible differences in feature positions between different exposed parts, sidewall image transfer (SIT) has become more recognized as the necessary approach. The SIT approach typically requires a spacer layer to be formed on an etched feature's sidewall. If this spacer corresponds to a conducting feature, then ultimately it must be cut at no less than two locations to separate the feature into two or more conducting lines as typically expected. On the other hand, if the spacer corresponds to a dielectric feature, cutting would not be necessary. The prediction of how many cuts would be needed for advanced logic patterns has been a large technical challenge. Many approaches for spacer patterning have been published (some listed below), all targeting the improved management (and reduction) of the cuts.|$|R
40|$|The thermal-hydraulic design {{characteristics}} of a boiling water reactor are strongly dependent on the physics of heat-removing mechanisms from nuclear rods. Performance is often limited {{by a lack of}} understanding of the heat and momentum transfer in thin liquid films close to dryout. This is particularly important with regard to power uprates of reactors. Flow control by functional spacers equipped with vanes adds complexity to the flow behavior. Instead of improving the heat removal, they can cause a local reduction of the film thickness under unfavorable conditions. This work presents a novel experimental technique to measure the velocity of the liquid phase and to study the turbulent mixing of a passive scalar in the film. The studies were performed in vertical annular flow in a double-subchannel geometry. The liquid film was labeled by either continuous or pulsed tracer injection. An electrically conductive tracer (salt solution) is injected into the film consisting of deionized water. The salt is traced using a liquid film sensor, a high-frequency nonintrusive conductivity-based technique. The experiments are conducted with and without a swirl-type spacer to quantify the effect of the <b>spacers</b> on the <b>film</b> flow for different gas and liquid flow rates. An ensemble averaging of the data obtained from individual injection pulses provides time-averaged liquid velocities in the film. The turbulent dispersion was characterized by analyzing the spread of the tracer in axial and lateral directions. Spacer vanes are found to induce a characteristic transverse movement of the liquid in the film. The effect of waves on mixing is analyzed and is found to enhance it...|$|R
40|$|The high {{frequency}} dynamic magnetic responses of FeCo thin films and structures {{have been investigated}} mainly using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) technique. The FMR resonance condition and linewidth are first derived from the dynamic Landau- Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, followed by {{a study of the}} conversion between FMR field and frequency linewidths. It is found that the linewidth conversion relation based on the derivative of resonance condition is only valid for samples with negligible extrinsic linewidth contribution. The dynamic magnetic properties obtained by using FMR measurements of FeCo thin films grown on Si/SiO 2 substrates with varying deposition temperatures is then presented. The effective Landé g-factor, extrinsic linewidth, and Gilbert relaxation rate are all found to decrease in magnitude with increasing sample growth temperature from 20 oC to about 400 – 500 oC and then on further increase of the growth temperature to increase in magnitude. Samples grown at about 400 – 450 oC display the smallest coercivity, while the smallest value of the Gilbert relaxation rate of about 0. 1 GHz is obtained for samples grown at 450 – 500 oC. An almost linear relation between extrinsic linewidth and coercivity is observed, which suggests a positive correlation between magnetic inhomogeneity, coercivity and extrinsic linewidth. Another major discovery in this study is that the Gilbert relaxation decreases with increasing lattice constant, which is ascribed to the degree of structural order in the films. A micromagnetic model is established for an asymmetric trilayer system consisting of two different ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by thin non-magnetic (NM) layer, treating the magnetization in each FM layer as a macrospin. Based on the model, numerical simulations of magnetization curves and FMR dispersion relations, of both the acoustic mode where magentizations in the two FM layers precess in phase and the optic mode where they precess out-of-phase, have been carried out. The most significant implication from the results is that the coupling strength can be extracted by detecting only the acoustic mode resonances at many different unsaturated magnetic states using broadband FMR technique. Finally, trilayer films of FeCo(100 Å) /NM/FeNi(100 Å) with NM=Ru or Cu were prepared and studied. The thickness of the Ru and Cu spacer was varied from 0 to 50 Å. For the Ru <b>spacer</b> series, the <b>film</b> with 10 Å Ru spacer shows antiferromagnetic coupling while all other films are ferromagnetically coupled. For the Cu spacer trilayers, it is found that all films are ferromagnetically coupled and that films with thin Cu spacer are surprisingly strongly coupled (the coupling constant is 3 erg/cm 2 for the sample with 5 Å Cu spacer). The strong coupling strength is qualitatively understood within the framework of a combined effect of Ruderman-Kittel- Kasuya-Yosida interaction and pinhole coupling, which is evidenced by transmission electron microscopy analysis. The magnetic coupling constant decreases exponentially with increasing Cu spacer thickness, without showing an oscillatory thickness dependence. The results have implications for the design of multilayers for spintronic applications...|$|R
