40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{structure-activity relationship}} approach was used to investigate the mutagenicity {{of a series of}} seventeen-monosubstituted propylene oxides in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 100 and TA 1535. Mutagenicity in strain TA 100, using a liquid <b>suspension</b> <b>assay,</b> was found to correlate with chemical reactivity, as measured by the rates of reaction with two model bionucleophiles, nicotinamide and 4 -(4 -nitrobenzyl) pyridine. However, since the reactivity of three of the epoxides did not correlate to their Taft [sigma]* values, as a measure of the electronic effects of substituent groups, neither was their mutagenicity predicted by this substituent constant. The relative mutagenicity for the propylene oxides was different in the liquid <b>suspension</b> <b>assay</b> than that determined by the standard plate incorporation assay and also differed between the two bacterial strains. The assay differences were attributed to epoxide stability. The differences between strains was observed to be due to the response of the error-prone repair system, found only in TA 100, to the stronger alkylating agents...|$|E

They {{have been shown to}} confer worse prognosis in some of these entities. Notably, about 2 / 3 of these mutations are missense mutations in codon R 882 of the gene. We aimed at the development and validation of a novel easily applicable in routine practice method for quantitative detection of the DNMT 3 A p.

The assay was further validated on plasmid standards at different ratios between wild type and mutant alleles and on clinical samples from 120 patients with known or suspected myeloid malignancies. This is the first report on the quantitative detection of DNMT 3 A R 882 mutations using bead-based <b>suspension</b> <b>assay</b> with BNA(NC) -modified probes.

Adv. Mater. doi: 10. 1002 /adma. 200802339 (2008). Certain marker molecules {{can be found}} in the blood of cancer sufferers, and detecting them can lead to early diagnosis. Maximum sensitivity and flexibility in the detection assays are clearly advantageous, and a new diagnostic tool, known as <b>suspension</b> <b>assays,</b> can offer improvements over conventional plated techniques. However, the success of <b>suspension</b> <b>assays</b> depends upon accurately identifying the encoding, or 'barcodes', of the samples as they are free to mix in solution. Zhongze Gu and co-workers at Southeast University in Nanjing 1 now offer a spectrum-encoding approach that is based on photonic beads. The researchers make the beads by creating droplets of aqueous solution suspended in oil. The droplets contain polystyrene spheres and tiny silica particles. The polystyrene spheres self-assemble into ordered lattices, with the silica particles infiltrated between them. Drying and heating solidifies the matrix and removes the polystyrene to leave a porous bead (pictured). The ordered pores of the beads give them a characteristic spectral signature. This signature can be used to identify samples that the beads are attached to. When a probe molecule is attached to a bead, it changes the spectral signature. Target molecules can then become attached to the probe molecules, again changing the bead's signature and thereby signifying the target is present. The researchers have demonstrated their method for the detection of tumour markers...|$|R

Biochar is a stabilized, recalcitrant carbon compound, created when biomass is heated to temperatures between 300 - 1000 °C, under low oxygen concentrations. It {{can be produced}} {{from a variety of}} biomass feedstock, such as agricultural residues, wood chips, and manure. Recently, biochars have found several applications in environmental remediation. This study evaluated the effect of biochar on microbial sulfate reduction in cell <b>suspension</b> <b>assays</b> and batch growth experiments, as well as the potential of biochar to remove heavy metals from aqueous solution. Irrespective of dosage (0. 5 – 10 g/L), biochar increased the extent of sulfate reduction by Desulfovibrio alaskensis G 20 up to 4 -fold in <b>suspension</b> <b>assays.</b> Batch growth experiments demonstrated that biochar concentrations up to 10 g/L have no inhibitory effects on microbial sulfate reduction and cell growth. We further compared the sorptive properties of different biochars for copper and nickel. Biochars were pyrolyzed in the presence of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2) or magnesium chloride (MgCl 2) and sorption isotherms for copper and nickel were compared to unmodified biochar. Copper and nickel sorption capacities were greatly improved for the magnesium-enhanced biochars, indicating that biochar mineral supplementation can increase the efficiency of metal adsorption and removal from solution. Ongoing research under this theme aims at the development of a biochar-mineral composite material that promotes biological sulfate reduction and heavy metal adsorption in order to provide an efficient, low-cost, environmentally-friendly absorbent material {{that can be used for}} mine water treatment in bioreactors and/or permeable reactive barriers...|$|R

Star anise oil reduced viral infectivity by > 99 %, phenylpropanoids inhibited HSV infectivity by about 60 – 80 % and sesquiterpenes suppressed herpes virus infection by 40 – 98 %.

These reporters are based on the regulatory protein AlkS and the alkB 1 promoter from Alcanivorax borkumensis SK 2, a widespread alkane degrader in marine habitats. Escherichia coli cells with the reporter construct reacted strongly to octane in short-term (6 h) aqueous <b>suspension</b> <b>assays</b> but very slightly only to tetradecane, in line with what is expected from its low water solubility. In contrast, long-term assays (up to 5 days) with A. borkumensis bioreporters showed strong induction with tetradecane and crude oil. Gel-immobilized A. borkumensis reporter cells were used to demonstrate tetradecane and crude oil bioavailability at a distance from a source. Alcanivorax borkumensis bioreporters induced fivefold more rapid and more strongly when allowed physical contact with the oil phase in standing flask assays, suggesting a major contribution of adhered cells to the overall reporter signal. Using the flask assays we further demonstrated the effect of oleophilic nutrients and biosurfactants on oil availability and degradation by A. borkumensis.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the mechanism of}} surface phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN). Surface phagocytosis of unopsonized bacteria occurred, but was significantly enhanced {{by the presence of}} serum. The serum requirement was low, and a maximal effect occurred with serum concentrations of 0. 25 - 0. 5 %. The opsonic effect of serum was not removed by heat inactivation of complement but was adsorbed, at low serum concentrations, by protein A, indicating that opsonin-dependent surface phagocytosis requires IgG but not C 3. The requirement of opsonin-dependent surface phagocytosis for IgG was demonstrated further with purified IgG preparations as the sole opsonin. Activation of PMN by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) increased opsonin-independent surface phagocytosis by 47 % and 66 %, respectively, but had no effect on opsonin-dependent surface phagocytosis. Blockade of the PMN iC 3 b receptor (CR 3), which has lectin-like properties, by a panel of monoclonal antibodies against the alpha- and beta-chains of CR 3 did not inhibit the surface phagocytosis of opsonized or unopsonized S. aureus, and one antibody (NIMP-R 10) enhanced opsonin-independent surface phagocytosis. These results indicate that the mechanism of surface phagocytosis is quite different to that observed in <b>suspension</b> <b>assays.</b> Opsonin-independent surface phagocytosis occurs and is enhanced by PMN activation, opsonin-dependent surface phagocytosis is dependent on IgG and not complement, and neither opsonin-independent nor -dependent surface phagocytosis proceeds through CR 3...|$|R

Using proteomics, we identified 16 dit-encoded proteins that were significantly more abundant in LB 400 cells grown on dehydroabietic acid (DhA) or abietic acid (AbA) than in succinate-grown cells. A key difference in the catabolism of DhA and AbA lies in the differential expression of the P 450 s; DitU was detected only in the AbA-grown cells, whereas DitQ was expressed both during growth on DhA and during growth on AbA.

An increased ratio of bacteria to monocytes decreased the rate of killing. A 30 -min preopsonization of gonococci in 10 % serum resulted in an enhanced rate of killing. Monocytes were able to kill plate-grown, but not log-phase, organisms. Disruption of the monocytes by sonication to release internalized bacteria did not increase the number of viable organisms.

These studies have created a great deal of interest in understanding CHIP activity, expression and modulation. While CHIP knockout mice have the potential to provide essential insights into the molecular control of cell fate and survival, the animals have been difficult to characterize in vivo due to severe phenotypic and behavioral dysfunction, which have thus far been poorly characterized. Therefore, in the present study we conducted a battery of neurobehavioral and physiological assays of adult CHIP heterozygotic (HET) mutant mice to provide {{a better understanding of the}} functional consequence of CHIP deficiency. We found that CHIP HET mice had normal body and brain weight, body temperature, muscle tone and breathing patterns, but do have a significant elevation in baseline heart rate. Meanwhile basic behavioral screens of sensory, motor, emotional and cognitive functions were normative. We observed no alterations in performance in the elevated plus maze, light-dark preference and tail <b>suspension</b> <b>assays,</b> or two simple cognitive tasks: novel object recognition and spontaneous alternation in a Y maze. Significant deficits were found, however, when CHIP HET mice performed wire hang, inverted screen, wire maneuver, an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fungal {{deterioration}} is a {{major issue}} in garment mills; mainly it affects high cellulosic materials like cotton. This study empirically explains the saccharification of cotton by Trichoderma sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Fusarium sp., and Helminthosporium sp. which were cultured and applied in cotton wool broth. Extracted enzyme <b>suspension</b> was <b>assayed</b> with filter paper and activity was analyzed by DNS reagent method. Tricchoderma sp. and Aspergillus sp. depicts high cellulolytic activity of 33. 08 and 32. 52 FPU/ml respectively on raw cotton, in addition their saccharifying ability depicted 1. 25 and 1. 23 %. Optimum temperature and pH for activity of each fungal enzyme also affirmed...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} and characterization of a phototrophic ferrous iron [Fe(II) ]-oxidizing bacterium named TIE- 1 that differs from other Fe(II) -oxidizing phototrophs {{in that it}} is genetically tractable. Under anaerobic conditions, TIE- 1 grows photoautotrophically with Fe(II), H 2, or thiosulfate as the electron donor and photoheterotrophically with a variety of organic carbon sources. TIE- 1 also grows chemoheterotrophically in the dark. This isolate appears to be a new strain of the purple nonsulfur bacterial species Rhodopseudomonas palustris, based on physiological and phylogenetic analysis. Fe(II) oxidation is optimal at pH 6. 5 to 6. 9. The mineral products of Fe(II) oxidation are pH dependent: below pH 7. 0 goethite ({alpha}-FeOOH) forms, and above pH 7. 2 magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) forms. TIE- 1 forms colonies on agar plates and is sensitive to a variety of antibiotics. A hyperactive mariner transposon is capable of random insertion into the chromosome with a transposition frequency of ~ 10 – 5. To identify components involved in phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation, mutants of TIE- 1 were generated by transposon mutagenesis and screened for defects in Fe(II) oxidation in a cell <b>suspension</b> <b>assay.</b> Among approximately 12, 000 mutants screened, 6 were identified that are specifically impaired in Fe(II) oxidation. Five of these mutants have independent disruptions in a gene that is predicted to encode an integral membrane protein that appears to be part of an ABC transport system; the sixth mutant has an insertion in a gene that is a homolog of CobS, an enzyme involved in cobalamin (vitamin B 12) biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Recent reports {{describe}} {{the ability of}} select bacterial strains to bind human norovirus, although the specificity of such interactions is unknown. The purpose of this work {{was to determine if}} a select group of bacterial species representative of human gut microbiota bind to human norovirus, and if so, to characterize the intensity and location of that binding. The bacteria screened included naturally occurring strains isolated from human stool (Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter spp., Bacillus spp., Enterococcus faecium and Hafnia alvei) and select reference strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae). Binding in PBS was evaluated to three human norovirus strains (GII. 4 New Orleans 2009 and Sydney 2012, GI. 6) and two surrogate viruses (Tulane virus and Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV)) using a <b>suspension</b> <b>assay</b> format linked to RT-qPCR for quantification. The impact of different overnight culture media prior to washing on binding efficiency in PBS was also evaluated, and binding was visualized using transmission electron microscopy. All bacteria tested bound the representative human norovirus strains with high efficiency (90 % binding efficiency) (p> 0. 05); there was selective binding for Tulane virus and no binding observed for TCV. Binding efficiency was highest when bacteria were cultured in minimal media (90 % bound), but notably decreased when cultured in enriched media (1 - 3 log 10 unbound or 0. 01 -< 90 % bound)) (p< 0. 05). The norovirus-bacteria binding occurred around the outer cell surfaces and pili structures, without apparent localization. The findings reported here further elucidate and inform the dynamics between human noroviruses and enteric bacteria with implications for norovirus pathogenesis...|$|E

Optimum formulation a-CH-CHF/PLF 68, 1 % produced the highest bioactivity, enzyme encapsulation (20. 08 ± 3. 91 %), loading (22. 31 ± 4. 34 µg/mg), FPF (fine particle fraction) (37. 63 ± 0. 97 %); FPD (fine particle dose) (179. 88 ± 9. 43 µg), MMAD (mass median aerodynamic diameter) (2. 95 ± 1. 61 µm), and the mucinolytic activity was equal to the native non-encapsulated enzyme up to 5 h. DNase I-CHF/PLF 68, 1 % resulted in enzyme encapsulation (17. 44 ± 3. 11 %), loading (19. 31 ± 3. 27 µg/mg) and activity (81. 9 ± 2. 7 %).

40|$|Objectives A {{critical}} step before treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) {{is the correct}} staging of the disease. As late stage is established when trypanosomes cross the blood-brain barrier and invade the central nervous system, we hypothesized that matrix metalloproteinases and cell adhesion molecules could indicate, alone or in combination, the disease progression from the first to {{the second stage of}} HAT. Methods We measured the levels of MMP- 2, MMP- 9, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and E-selectin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 63 Trypanosoma brucei gambiense-infected patients (15 stage 1 and 48 stage 2). Staging was based on counting of white blood cells (WBC) and/or parasite detection in CSF. Concentrations were obtained either by ELISA or multiplex bead <b>suspension</b> <b>assays,</b> and results were compared with three known HAT staging markers (CXCL 10, CXCL 8 and H-FABP). Results ICAM- 1 and MMP- 9 accurately discriminated between stage 1 and stage 2 patients with HAT with 95 % sensitivity (SE) for 100 % specificity (SP), which was better than CXCL 10 (93 % SE for 100 % SP), {{one of the most promising}} known markers. Combination of ICAM- 1 and MMP- 9 with H-FABP provided a panel that resulted in 100 % of SE and SP for staging HAT. Conclusions ICAM- 1 and MMP- 9, alone or in combination, appeared as powerful CSF staging markers of HAT. Final validation of all newly discovered staging markers on a large multi-centric cohort including both forms of the disease as well as patients with others infections should be performed...|$|R
40|$|We have cloned and sequenced the dit {{gene cluster}} {{encoding}} enzymes of the catabolic pathway for abietane diterpenoid degradation by Pseudomonas abietaniphila BKME- 9. The dit gene cluster {{is located on}} a 16. 7 -kb DNA fragment containing 13 complete open reading frames (ORFs) and 1 partial ORF. The genes ditA 1 A 2 A 3 encode the α and β subunits and the ferredoxin of the dioxygenase which hydroxylates 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid to 7 -oxo- 11, 12 -dihydroxy- 8, 13 -abietadien acid. The dioxygenase mutant strain BKME- 941 (ditA 1 ::Tn 5) did not grow on nonaromatic abietanes, and transformed palustric and abietic acids to 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid in cell <b>suspension</b> <b>assays.</b> Thus, nonaromatic abietanes are aromatized prior to further degradation. Catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase activity of xylE transcriptional fusion strains showed induction of ditA 1 and ditA 3 by abietic, dehydroabietic, and 7 -oxodehydroabietic acids, which support the growth of strain BKME- 9, {{as well as by}} isopimaric and 12, 14 -dichlorodehydroabietic acids, which are diterpenoids that do not support the growth of strain BKME- 9. In addition to the aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes, the dit cluster includes ditC, encoding an extradiol ring cleavage dioxygenase, and ditR, encoding an IclR-type transcriptional regulator. Although ditR is not strictly required for the growth of strain BKME- 9 on abietanes, a ditR::Kmr mutation in a ditA 3 ::xylE reporter strain demonstrated that it encodes an inducer-dependent transcriptional activator of ditA 3. An ORF with sequence similarity to genes encoding permeases (ditE) is linked with genes involved in abietane degradation...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequestration}} of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (pRBC) {{away from}} the peripheral circulation is a property of all field isolates. Here we have examined the pRBC of 111 fresh clinical isolates from children with malaria {{for a number of}} adhesive features in order to study their possible coexpression and association with severity of disease. A large number of adhesion assays were performed studying rosetting, giant rosetting, and binding to CD 36, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, thrombospondin, heparin, blood group A, and immunoglobulins. <b>Suspension</b> <b>assays</b> were performed at the actual parasitemia of the isolate, while all the static adhesion assays were carried out at an equal adjusted parasitemia. The ability to bind to multiple receptors, as well as the ability to form rosettes and giant rosettes, was found to be more frequent among isolates from children with severe versus mild malaria (P = 0. 0015). Rosettes and giant rosettes were more frequent for children with severe malaria, and the cell aggregates were larger and tighter, than for those with mild disease (P = 0. 0023). Binding of immunoglobulins (97 % of isolates) and of heparin (81 % of isolates) to infected erythrocytes was common, and binding to heparin and blood group A was associated with severity of disease (P = 0. 011 and P = 0. 031, respectively). These results support the idea that isolates that bind to multiple receptors are involved in the causation of severe malaria and that several receptor-ligand interactions work synergistically in bringing about severe disease...|$|R
