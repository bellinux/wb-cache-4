40|$|Abstract: The {{well-being}} of laying hens in cages of 5, 10, 20 and 40 -birds/cage, and enrichment with perches, nest boxes and <b>scratch</b> <b>pads,</b> {{was assessed using}} behavioral and physiological parameters. Laying hens were Lohmann Brown (n = 360) and White Leghorns (n = 360), housed from 17 to 65 weeks of age. Behavioral parameters were; the percentage of birds per cage roosting on perches, claw length (n = 288), {{and the percentage of}} eggs laid within nest boxes. Physiological parameters were; the assessment of feather cover from measurements of radiated temperatures by infrared thermography (IRT), bone mineral content of the humerus and femur by quantitative computer tomography (QCT) scans, and adrenocor-tical function as a marker of chronic stress by measurements of corticosterone concentrations in egg yolk and albumin. The majority of eggs (72. 7 %) in furnished cages were laid in nest boxes. Nest use was highest in Brown hens (P 80 %, but significantly less in the 10 -bird cages (P < 0. 0012) due to a shorter perch length. Claws were shorter on birds in cages with <b>scratch</b> <b>pads</b> (P < 0. 0001). Feather insulation declined from 35 to 60 weeks of age for breast and back areas (P < 0. 0001). White birds exhibited superior breast feather insulation compared to Brown birds. Egg albu-min corticosterone levels declined between 35 and 60 weeks of age (P < 0. 011).

40|$|Furnished cages for {{laying hens}} {{exist in a}} wide variety of sizes and designs and should be {{equipped}} to allow hens to express some of their behavioural priorities. European Council Directive 1999 / 74 /EC stipulates that litter must be provided for pecking and scratching but the type of litter and the pad where litter is delivered are not defined. In the same way, neither the maximum nor the optimum number of birds per cage has been defined. Two successive experiments were carried out to analyse pecking, scratching (PS) and dustbathing (DB) behaviours performed in different furnished cages with different designs. Three group sizes of ISA brown laying hens (20, 40 or 60 hens, with the same density in all the cages), with or without additional feed distribution as litter substrate, were compared in the first experiment. The second experiment focussed on DB behaviour and compared two pecking and <b>scratching</b> <b>pads</b> (artificial turf or rubber mats), with or without wheat bran distribution as litter substrate, in groups of 60 hens per cage. Irrespective of litter presence, group size, and type of pad, DB and PS were mainly performed in the pecking and scratching area, showing the attractiveness of this area. In the first experiment, feed–litter provision in pecking and scratching area increased PS and DB behaviours, while group size did not affect them. In the second experiment, hens performed more DB in the pecking and scratching area when wheat-bran litter was present than when it was absent. Rubber matting was more attractive to hens for DB than artificial turf matting. Durations of DB bouts were not affected by the presence or absence of wheat-bran litter or the choice of pecking and <b>scratching</b> <b>pad.</b> In furnished cages, hens clearly seek out pads and litter to perform PS, and providing litter (feed or wheat bran) or rubber in pecking and scratching area is attractive for hens to DB in it.

40|$|A {{thermomechanical}} {{model to}} describe the mechanisms of polishing <b>pad</b> <b>scratching</b> in chemical–mechanical planarization (CMP) has been formulated and investigated. CMP is a necessary process in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication to planarize wafers with nanoscale features after patterned layer deposition. Polishing pad asperities can produce microscale scratches on the wafer surface during CMP, reducing IC manufacturing yields. The constructed thermomechanical model accounts for stresses of the pad and wafer contact and also provides the means to track input energy dissipation during CMP. Tracking energy dissipation offers information about processes that may influence scratch production. This knowledge ultimately produces a greater physical understanding of CMP {{for the prevention of}} <b>pad</b> <b>scratching.</b> Polishing <b>pad</b> stress relaxation experiments demonstrate the importance of viscoelastic and plastic strain energy dissipation with its effects on the wafer stress field. Scratch producing ability of the polishing pad is found to decrease with use in CMP, with slurry soaking and increasing polishing time. Mechanical behavior of the polishing pad is demonstrated to differ when in compression and in tension. Compressibility of the pad material is shown to be significant in stress modeling through experimental measurement of polishing pad volume change. Differential scanning calorimetry of used polishing pad samples revealed energy dissipation into the polishing pad surface with increasing polishing time of CMP. Energy dissipation processes influence <b>pad</b> <b>scratching</b> in CMP. Analytical wafer stress field modeling unveils that the scratching ability of a polishing pad decreases when it is less stiff or has a smoother surface...|$|R

40|$|The {{exponential}} increase {{through time}} {{in the number of}} components in a typical integrated circuit, known as Moore's Law, is driving the need for improvements in manufacturing. A key semiconductor manufacturing process is chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), which is used to create connecting metal channels above the transistors in a chip. A typical form of this process used in industry is metal CMP. Metal CMP is the process of using a pad combined with an abrasive slurry to remove excess material, such as Cu, and planarize a surface. The continuing trend {{to increase the number of}} components per chip leads to the necessity of Cu features being increasingly small. This increases the resistance of each copper connection, leading to an increase in the RC time delay of each circuit. To counteract the increase in resistance, the use of low dielectric constant (k) materials in place of SiO₂ has been explored. Low-k dielectrics are much softer than SiO₂, which has led to problems with scratching of the Cu during CMP, resulting in faulty parts. Recent research by Thor Eusner indicates that the pad used to polish the surface, not the abrasives in the slurry, may be responsible for the scratching of the Cu surface. This thesis applies this <b>pad</b> asperity <b>scratching</b> model to several CMP pads. The most relevant parameters to <b>scratching,</b> <b>pad</b> to copper hardness ratio and the coefficient of friction, are measured for each pad and the results indicate that scratching should be a problem with nearly all of the pads. This indicates that current CMP pads or slurries are too hard, have too much friction, have asperities that are too sharp, or some combination of these factors. Reengineering CMP pads and slurries is thus recommended to alleviate <b>scratching</b> by <b>pad</b> asperities. by Michael P. Roberts. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} {{that supports the}} view that most models of short-term memory cannot account for {{the flexibility of the}} primary memory system. It is argued that the working memory model outlined by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) is, however, a potentially adequate model. Working memory, in this thesis, is depicted as a system that assembles 'constellations' consisting of the central executive and one or more sub-systems. This view suggests a formulation that is considerably more complex than the 1974 model. The empirical studies examine the role of the visuo-spatial <b>scratch</b> <b>pad</b> in the formation and maintenance of working memory constellations. It is concluded from these studies that the <b>scratch</b> <b>pad</b> is independent of the articulatory loop but is usually coupled to the central executive except during maintenance rehearsal. Furthermore, it can be used concurrently with the articulatory loop to process spatial aspects of highly verbal tasks. However a constellation consisting of the executive, the loop and the <b>scratch</b> <b>pad</b> is vulnerable to a wider range of interference effects than a simpler constellation.

This study was {{conducted}} to examine the different effects of caging systems, furnished cages vs. battery cages, on bird behaviors. One hundred ninety-two 1 -d-old non-beak-trimmed Hy-Line W- 36 White Leghorn chicks were reared using standard management practices in raised wire cages. At 19 wk of age, the birds were randomly assigned into battery cages or furnished cages. The battery cages were commercial wire cages containing 6 birds per cage, providing 645 cm 2 of floor space per birds. The furnished cages had wire floors and solid metal walls, with perches, a dustbathing area, <b>scratch</b> <b>pads,</b> and a nestbox area with a concealment curtain. Based on the company recommendations, 10 birds were housed per cage, providing a stocking den-sity of 610 cm 2 of floor space per bird. Behavioral ob-servations were conducted using the Noldus Observer software package. The birds were observed at 5 -min intervals for the entire light period. The birds housed in battery cages had higher posture and behavioral transi-tions and increased time spent walking and perform-ing exploratory behavior (P < 0. 05, 0. 01, respective-ly), which may indicate they were stressed, resulting in restlessness, whereas the birds housed in furnished cages had higher levels of preening (P < 0. 05).

The CSES project involves 3 housing systems for egg production at the same research farm site in the Midwest, USA, namely, a conventional cage (CC) house, an aviary (AV) house, and an enriched colony (EC) house. The CC house (141. 4 m L × 26. 6 m W × 6. 1 m H) had a nominal capacity of 200, 000 hens (6 hens in a cage at a stock-ing density of 516 cm 2 /hen), and the cages were ar-ranged in 10 rows, 8 tiers per cage row, with a per-forated aisle walkway at 4 -tier height. The AV house (154. 2 m L × 21. 3 m W × 3. 0 m H) and the EC house (154. 2 m L × 13. 7 m W × 4. 0 m H) each had a nomi-nal capacity of 50, 000 hens. The AV house had 6 rows of aviary colonies, and the EC house had 5 rows of 4 -tier enriched colonies containing perches, nestbox, and <b>scratch</b> <b>pads</b> (60 hens per colony at a stocking density of 752 cm 2 /hen).
