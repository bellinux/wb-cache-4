With {{the last of his}} strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underworld and must not be allowed to have the Fortress. Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal lich form, which the party defeats. The Mana Beast finally flies in and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish. With the sprite's encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into snow. At the conclusion of the game, the hero is seen returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the Potos waterfall.|$|E
5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E

More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by Philip K.

Ray is Founder, President and CEO of Prime Time Records, which releases mostly rap music. Through eBay Platinum Reserve, he now owns Airwolf, Keith Moon's head, and the world's biggest laser. He enjoys throwing lavish parties with unusual themes. Ray drives a Cadillac Escalade. He is very generous to his friends and to people in general, but on an entirely random basis and interspersed with long periods of outright rudeness and total insensitivity. He also has a very serious obsession with Ketel One and Zinfandel alcohols. Although Ray personally obtained his musical skills from a deal with the devil, there has been at least one other musical genius in his lineage: his paternal grandfather Antonyne Cheops Smuckles, better known as the legendary bluesman Rustmouth Chafings.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{was anxious}} about the divine work, {{including}} the King Indradyumna. After a fortnight of waiting, the King who was anxious to see the deity, could not control his eagerness, and he visited the site where Vishwakarma was working. Soon enough Vishwakarma was very upset and he left the carving of the idol unfinished; the images were without hands and feet. The king was very perturbed by this development and appealed to Brahma to help him. Brahma promised the King that the images which were carved would be deified as carved and would become famous. Following this promise, Indradyumna organized a function to formally deify the images, and invited all gods to be present for the occasion. Brahma presided over the religions function as the chief priest and brought life (<b>soul)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> image and fixed (opened) its eyes. This resulted in the images becoming famous and worshipped at Jagannath Puri in the well known Jagannath Temple as a Kshetra (pilgrimage centre). It is, however, believed that the original images are in a pond near the temple.|$|E

500|$|... "Cross Road Blues" [...] (more {{commonly}} known as [...] "Crossroads") is a blues song written and recorded by American blues artist Robert Johnson in 1936. [...] Johnson performed it as a solo piece with his vocal and acoustic slide guitar in the Delta blues-style. The song {{has become part of}} the Robert Johnson mythology as referring to the place where he supposedly sold his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Devil in exchange for his musical talents, although the lyrics do not contain any specific references.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} used to {{perpetuate}} the myth of Johnson selling his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Devil for his musical ability. [...] The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a Faustian bargain, but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his <b>soul</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent). [...] Music historian Elijah Wald believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea. [...] Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth. [...] However, musicologist Robert Palmer points out that Johnson was [...] "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery." [...] His song [...] "Hellhound on My Trail" [...] tells of trying to stay ahead of the demon hound which is pursuing him and in [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he sings, [...] "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon my door, and I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'". [...] These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree [...] "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".|$|E
