25|$|During {{his spare}} time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting. Many of the wrestlers who were {{competing}} in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing. Among those attending his performances were Jack and Gerald Brisco, two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region. Impressed by Hogan's physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked Hiro Matsuda the man who trained wrestlers working for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) {{to make him a}} potential trainee. In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Having been a wrestling fan since childhood, Hogan eventually agreed. At first, however, Mike Graham, the son of CWF promoter Eddie Graham, refused to put Hogan in the ring; according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two did not get along. However, after Hogan quit Ruckus and <b>started</b> <b>telling</b> people in town {{that he was going to}} be a wrestler, Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers' request.|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} team, headed by Henry Millar, {{had arrived at}} South Beach, Nassau on January 12, 1987, almost a month before {{principal}} photography commenced there.

500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity, was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience of getting in trouble as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother. Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and <b>started</b> <b>telling</b> us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{no music}} video was officially {{confirmed}} or produced, media outlets {{reported that a}} music video for [...] "Superstar" [...] was to be shot in October 2012. Madonna wanted to dress as a [...] "Terror Bride", which {{is a combination of}} an Iraqi bridal veil and a US soldier's uniform. The dress was to be portrayed as a statement for oppression against women and warfare. However, the singer's advisers talked her out of wearing the costume because they thought it would [...] "put her life at risk". Sources then stated [...] " [...] had the outfit ready to go. She was really proud of it and said it was her 'Terror Bride' costume [...] At first, when people <b>started</b> <b>telling</b> her it was madness, she just brushed it off, but when they mentioned that her actions could put her life at risk, she decided to ditch it from her video and certainly won't be wearing it on stage." [...] Madonna said she was [...] "really disappointed" [...] about not wearing the outfit, but had put aside the idea for a future use.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} he began {{recording}} his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went. He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He <b>started</b> <b>telling</b> people that DreamWorks was out to get him: [...] "Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have {{wound up in the}} hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house." [...] During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.|$|E
500|$|Episodes {{were written}} {{by a team of}} writers, which {{consisted}} of Dohrn, David Fain, Greenblatt, Mr. Lawrence, Lender, Mark O'Hare, Povenmire, William Reiss, Springer, Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. During the season, the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for individual episodes. For example, in the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", SpongeBob learns profanity. The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." [...] In [...] "Secret Box", SpongeBob wants to see what is inside Patrick's secret box. The idea came to Drymon because he too had a secret box as a child. Creator Hillenburg said, [...] " [...] <b>started</b> <b>telling</b> us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He <b>started</b> <b>telling</b> me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} has made numerous brief {{returns to the}} serial as a guest character. In 1993, she was featured in a special week of episodes, filmed on-location in Paris, France, where Frank discovered, to his horror, that Diane was pregnant with an unknown foreign man's baby. In June 1994, Diane returned to Walford {{as part of a}} storyline involving her father's disappearance. In 1997, another week's worth of episodes set in Paris reunited Ricky and Diane. Shortly after, the character returned to the soap's setting of Walford, but Lawrence reportedly quit weeks after making her comeback. She had since commented on her reasons for quitting so soon: [...] "Going back to EastEnders was like going back to school and none of your friends are there. I was [...] there with people like Nick Berry (Simon Wicks) and Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts) and they'd all gone. One of the young actors, who will remain nameless, made me a coffee and <b>started</b> <b>telling</b> me all about what it was like. He had no idea I'd been in the soap before." [...] In addition, Lawrence was suffering physically as she was still getting over injuries she sustained from a car accident and was forced to remove a neck brace for filming purposes. On-screen, the character departed to travel with her musician boyfriend, abandoning her young son in her brother's care. Bosses at EastEnders had reportedly been keen for Lawrence to remain on the show, as they were hoping for an on-screen reunion of the Butcher family; Mike Reid had agreed to reprise his role as Frank, though Diane departed before his reintroduction.|$|E
