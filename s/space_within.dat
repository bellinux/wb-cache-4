5|$|Outer space, also simply called space, {{refers to}} the {{relatively}} empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer <b>space</b> <b>within</b> the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at {{what is known as}} the heliopause.|$|E

5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal <b>space</b> <b>within</b> choruses.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{known as}} the Alumnae Gymnasium, the {{building}} was erected {{as a response to}} the perception that Vassar's physical education program was falling behind those of other Seven Sisters colleges. Plans for the hall were made, scrapped, and remade as the college and alumnae benefactors struggled to raise sufficient funds. Ultimately, the building was designed by William Tubby and constructed in 1889, signaling a physical decentralization away from the college's Main Building. When it opened, the gymnasium featured a large pool and a variety of other athletic spaces. Vassar's enrollment quickly outgrew the limited <b>space</b> <b>within</b> the building, and it was first expanded and then superseded by Kenyon Hall in the 1930s. The Geology Department moved into the building shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The {{volume of}} <b>space</b> <b>within</b> which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of <b>space</b> <b>within</b> each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E

5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if <b>space</b> <b>within</b> the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a <b>space</b> <b>within</b> her home.|$|E
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Relic Entertainment {{and published by}} Sierra Studios on September 28, 1999, for Microsoft Windows. Set in space, the science fiction game follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing hyperspace jump technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing mothership to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. In each of the game's levels, the player gathers resources, builds a fleet, and uses it to destroy enemy ships and accomplish mission objectives. The player's fleet carries over between levels, and can travel in a fully three-dimensional <b>space</b> <b>within</b> each level rather than being limited to a two-dimensional plane.|$|E

5|$|Interstellar {{space is}} the {{physical}} <b>space</b> <b>within</b> a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 1965, the New York City Transit Authority {{announced}} plans to construct a subway station on the island along the planned 63rd Street Line, {{as part of the}} island's proposed transit-oriented development (TOD). TOD tries {{to increase the amount of}} residential, business and leisure <b>space</b> <b>within</b> walking distance of public transport. With this announcements, more suggestions for what to do with the island were made. The construction of a station was viewed to be vital for the development of the island, which was still known as Welfare Island. At that point, it was decided to build a shell for the station, to allow for the station to open after the opening of the rest of the line, with a projected savings of $4 million compared to building the station as an infill station after the rest of the line opened. The projected cost of the station was $3,300,000. It was soon decided to build the station with the rest of the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl <b>space.</b> <b>Within</b> the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

5|$|The local {{interstellar}} medium is {{a region of}} <b>space</b> <b>within</b> 100parsecs (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the Local Bubble, which {{is characterized by a}} lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250pc or more.) This volume contains about 104–105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the {{interstellar medium}}. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000K and radii of 0.5–5pc.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free <b>space</b> <b>within</b> the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
5|$|Walter de Lacy {{travelled}} to Ireland in 1201 and {{the following}} year his properties, including Ludlow Castle, were once again confiscated to ensure his loyalty and placed {{under the control of}} William de Braose, his father-in-law. Walter's lands were returned to him, subject to the payment of a fine of 400marks, but in 1207 his disagreements with royal officials in Ireland led to King John seizing the castle and putting it under the control of William again. Walter reconciled himself with John the following year, but meanwhile William himself had fallen out with the King; violence broke out and both Walter and William took refuge in Ireland, with John taking control of Ludlow yet again. It was not until 1215 that their relationship recovered and John agreed to give Ludlow back to Walter. At some point during the early 13th century, the innermost bailey was constructed in the castle, creating an additional private <b>space</b> <b>within</b> the inner bailey.|$|E
