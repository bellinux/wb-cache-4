5000|$|USS Burrfish (SS/SSR-312) was a [...] of the United States Navy {{named for}} the burrfish, a <b>swellfish</b> of the Atlantic coast. The vessel entered service in 1943 and saw action during World War II and in the postwar era. In 1961 Burrfish was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy where she served as HMCS Grilse (SS 71) and was used {{primarily}} as a training boat from 1961 until 1969.|$|E
50|$|The Tetraodontidae are {{a family}} of {{primarily}} marine and estuarine fish of the order Tetraodontiformes. The family includes many familiar species which are variously called pufferfish, puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, <b>swellfish,</b> toadfish, toadies, honey toads, sugar toads, and sea squab. They are morphologically similar to the closely related porcupinefish, which have large external spines (unlike the thinner, hidden spines of the Tetraodontidae, which are only visible when the fish has puffed up). The scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey.|$|E
40|$|Dense aggregations of the <b>swellfish,</b> Lagocephalus gloveri Abe et Tabeta, {{ranging from}} 220 to 330 mm in fork length, {{temporarily}} appeared west off Ojika Island, Nagasaki Prefecture, west of Kyushu during September to November 1983. The fish {{was attracted to}} mackrel meat put in a wire basket that was lowered to the depth of about 70 m. A crowd of the fish swum {{up to the surface}} following a bait-basket hauled gradually upward, when they were scooped with a dip net. On some days, over one hundred fishing boats belonging to the Ojikacho Fishermen's Cooperative Association operated the dip net fishing. The fishing boats averaged five tons in size, each generally having two fishermen on board. The total landing of the <b>swellfish</b> at the fish market of the Ojikacho FCA during the 1983 fishing season of about two months was estimated at about 700 tons. The maximum daily catch by a single boat attained to 2. 9 tons, while the maximum daily catch per boat (CPUE) was 750 kg which was observed on October 2, 1983. The CPUE decreased as days go by during October through November...|$|E
40|$|Spermatozoa of five {{species of}} tetraodontid fishes of Japanese seas, {{consisting}} of two Lagocephalus species, two Takifugu species and an artificial inter-specific cross of Takifugu, were observed by a scannig electron microscope. The spermatozoa observed in this study had been cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for 177 to 299 days before the observations. The head of a spermatozoon of Shirosabafugu, Lagocephalus wheeleri is nearly glove, measuring 1. 42 μm in length and 1. 12 μm in width and that of Kurosabafugu, L. gloveri is oval, 1. 51 μm and 0. 95 μm, respectively. Those of Kusafugu, Takifugu niphobles, Torafugu, T. rubripes and the artificial cross between female T. niphobles and male T. rubripes are all ellipsoid measuring as 1. 77 ～ 1. 93 μm in length and 0. 75 ～ 0. 82 μm in width. The tail length of the spermatozoon of L. wheeleri is about 15 times the head length (1. 42 μm) and that of T. rubripes is about 12 times the head length (1. 93 μm). The morphometric difference {{of the head of}} the spermatozoon between Lagocephalus and Takifugu partly explains the difficulty in artificial intergeneric cross reported. The similarity of the spermatozoon heads among Takifugu species partly interprets the ease in artificial interspecific crosses in the genus and common occurrence of <b>swellfishes</b> which are supposed as interspecific crosses in nature, in the East China Sea and its adjacent seas...|$|R
