25|$|Security Checkpoints and roadblocks were erected {{inside and}} between Palestinian cities, {{subjecting}} all people and vehicles to <b>security</b> <b>inspection</b> for free passage. Israel defended those checkpoints as being necessary to stop militants {{and limit the}} ability to move weapons around. However some Palestinian, Israeli and International observers and organizations have criticized the checkpoints as excessive, humiliating, and a major cause of the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Territories. Transit could be delayed by several hours, depending on the security situation in Israel. Sniper towers were used extensively in the Gaza Strip before the Israeli pullout.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to repeated rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Navy imposed a maritime blockade on the area. Israel also sealed {{the border and}} closed Gaza's airspace in coordination with Egypt, and subjected all humanitarian supplies entering the Strip to <b>security</b> <b>inspection</b> before transferring them through land crossings. Construction materials were declared banned due to their possible use to build bunkers. The blockade has been internationally criticized {{as a form of}} [...] "collective punishment" [...] against Gaza's civilian population.|$|E

40|$|The quality {{assurance}} technique software inspection {{is often not}} sufficiently appreciated, especially for analyzing the quality attribute security of large and complex systems. Limited security expertise among software developers, reservations concerning the required inspection effort and missing acquaintance with {{the potential benefits of}} software inspections are some reasons why <b>security</b> <b>inspections</b> are still not in prevalent use. To provide better security guidance for inexperienced inspectors in a generic and reusable way and to reduce the barriers for applying software <b>security</b> <b>inspections,</b> we introduce four different inspection models that lead even unskilled inspectors through critical <b>security</b> aspects. An <b>inspection</b> tool supporting most of these models has been developed to enhance the efficiency of the defect detection. In this article, we give an overview of the four security models and show an exemplarily application with our inspection tool...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon, a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU), showed that the consequences of an incident on an offshore energy facility can be significant.

The Coast Guard and the Department of the Interior (Interior) share oversight responsibility for offshore energy facilities. The Coast Guard is to conduct <b>security</b> <b>inspections</b> of such facilities, whereas based on an agreement between the two agencies, Interior is to conduct safety compliance inspections on some offshore facilities on behalf of the Coast Guard as well as its own inspections to verify production. This testimony addresses: (1) {{the extent to which the}} Coast Guard has conducted <b>security</b> <b>inspections</b> of offshore energy facilities, and what additional actions are needed; (2) the extent to which Interior has conducted inspections of offshore energy facilities, including those on behalf of the Coast Guard, and challenges it faces in conducting such inspections; and (3) the Coast Guard's oversight authority of MODUs.
