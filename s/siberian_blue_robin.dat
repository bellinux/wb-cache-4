5000|$|The Japanese robin, {{together}} with the Ryukyu robin and the European robin, was previously placed in the genus Erithacus [...] A 2006 molecular phylogenetic {{study found that the}} two east Asian species were more similar to the <b>Siberian</b> <b>blue</b> <b>robin,</b> at the time in Luscinia, than to the European robin. In 2010 a large study confirmed this result and also found that Luscinia was non-monophyletic. The genus Larvivora was therefore resurrected to accommodate a clade containing the Japanese robin, the Ryukyu robin, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> and several other species that had previously been placed in Luscinia.|$|E

50|$|The six {{species in}} this genus were all {{previously}} placed in other genera. A large molecular phylogenetic study published on 2010 {{found that the}} genera Luscinia and Erithacus as defined by Edward C. Dickinson in 2003 were not monophyletic. The genus Larvivora with the type species Larvivora cyane was reinstated to accommodate a well-defined clade. Although the rufous-headed robin {{was not included in}} the phylogenetic study, it was moved to the resurrected genus as it is similar in structure, song and behaviour to the Indian blue robin and the <b>Siberian</b> <b>blue</b> <b>robin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (Larvivora cyane) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was formerly classified {{as a member of}} the thrush family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to belong to the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. It and similar small European species are often called chats. Recent research suggests that this species and some other East Asian members of Luscinia should be classified in a new genus, together with the Japanese and Ryūkyū robins. The genus name Larvivora comes from the new Latin larva meaning caterpillar and -vorus meaning eating (vorace to devour), and cyane is Latin for [...] "dark-blue".|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} the study on the avian fauna of the Taebaeksan (Mt.) region of the Seodeukbong of the BaekduDaegan between May and October of 2007 are as follows. A total of 1, 831 {{individuals}} of 71 bird species were observed in the study sites, and based on the average of the highest number of individuals, the most dominant species was the Brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) at 28. 6 individuals (21. 8 %), followed by the Yellow-throated bunting (Emberiza elegans) at 13. 5 individuals (10. 3 %), Long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) at 11. 6 individuals (8. 8 %), Brown-eared bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis) at 7. 6 individuals (5. 8 %), Marsh tit (Parus palustris) at 6. 9 individuals (5. 3 %) and the Great tit (Parus major) at 6. 5 individuals (5. 0 %). This was followed by the dominance, in decreasing order, of the Jay (Garrulus glandarius) at 5. 7 individuals (4. 4 %), <b>Siberian</b> <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (Luscinia cyane) at 4. 1 individuals (3. 2 %), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea) at 3. 9 individuals (3. 0 %), Varied tit (Parus varius) at 3. 6 individuals (2. 8 %), Crowned willow warbler (Phylloscopus occipitalis) at 3. 5 individuals (2. 7 %) and Arctic warbler (Phylloscopus borealis) at 2. 9 individuals (2. 2 %).

50|$|The Nilgiri <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (S. major) has the lores {{black and}} the upperside, the throat, breast are dark slaty blue but the lower plumage is rufous. The centre of the belly is buffy white. The brow is not as well-marked as in the other species and is diffuse bluish.|$|R
50|$|The {{natural habitat}} of the white-bellied <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> is forest patches {{in the valleys}} of high {{altitude}} grasslands known as sholas. The species {{has been found to}} occur only above 1200 m altitude in the higher hill ranges of southern India. These forest patches are highly restricted in size and the species is thus threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The white-bellied <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (Sholicola albiventris) {{refers to}} a kind of bird in the family Muscicapidae endemic to the Shola forests of the higher hills of {{southern}} India. The Nilgiri <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> and this species were once considered separate species, later lumped as sub-species of a single species (major) and elevated again to full species in 2005 by Pamela C. Rasmussen. The species was earlier thought {{to be related to the}} shortwings and placed in the genus Brachypteryx and later moved to Myiomela since species in the genus Brachypteryx shows marked sexual dimorphism. In 2017, a study found that this is a sister group of the flycatchers in the genera Niltava, Cyornis and Eumyias among others. It was then placed in newly erected genus Sholicola. This small bird is found on the forest floor and undergrowth of dense forest patches sheltered in the valleys of montane grassland, a restricted and threatened habitat.|$|R
50|$|The blackthroat (Calliope obscura), {{also known}} as the black-throated <b>robin</b> or black-throated <b>blue</b> <b>robin,</b> is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae. It breeds in north-central China but its {{wintering}} grounds are uncertain. It has been recorded as a vagrant in northwest Thailand. Its natural habitat is bamboo thickets within coniferous forest at altitudes of 3000-3,400 metres. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The Nilgiri <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (Sholicola major), {{also known}} as Nilgiri shortwing, white-bellied shortwing or rufous-bellied shortwing is a species of {{passerine}} bird in the family Muscicapidae endemic to the Shola forests of the higher hills of southern India, mainly north of the Palghat Gap. This small bird is found {{on the forest floor}} and undergrowth of dense forest patches sheltered in the valleys of montane grassland, a restricted and threatened habitat.|$|R
50|$|The town's attractions {{include the}} golf course, trout streams, Victoria Park, and boating or fishing on Lake Gregory. Victoria Park is an {{attractive}} and well-used oasis. It is popular with birdwatchers at quieter times because of the good opportunities for seeing species, particularly the Indian <b>blue</b> <b>robin,</b> pied thrush or scaly thrush lurking in the denser undergrowth. The Kashmir flycatcher is another attractive bird species in the park.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> {{is similar}} in size to the related {{bluethroat}} at 15 cm long. The adult male has blue upperparts and rufous underparts. A bright white supercilium contrasts with a black mask that continues down the neck. The lower belly and undertail are also whitish. The female is olive brown above and buff below with a light eye-ring and rufescent rump. The breast and flanks are buffy.|$|R
50|$|In {{a recent}} bird survey {{carried out in}} the sanctuary, {{reported}} in January 2014, the total number of bird species identified in the park are 280, which include 19 new species. Some of the notable species reported are: Indian courser, Malabar parakeet, large-billed leaf warbler, green leaf-warbler, western crowned leaf warbler, fairy-bluebird, the Indian <b>blue</b> <b>robin,</b> the yellow-throated bulbul, the crested goshawk, rosefinch, Blyth's swift, Orphean warbler, European bee-eater, and Eurasian crag martin.|$|R
50|$|Populations {{are mainly}} in the Palni Hills, but also found {{in some of the}} other {{associated}} ranges to the south of the Palghat gap. These include the Nelliampathy, Cardamom, Chemungi and Chimpani Hills. The population in the Ashambu hills {{has been described as a}} new species Ashambu <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (Sholicola ashambuensis) which differs slightly in coloration and is estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor about 1.24 - 0.49 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (Larvivora brunnea) {{is a small}} bird {{found in}} South Asia.

5000|$|The white-bellied <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> was {{formerly}} considered conspecific with this species but in 2005 the two taxons were split by Pamela C. Rasmussen, a treatment that {{is followed by}} some authorities. Their genus remained uncertain until a 2017 molecular phylogenetic study found that these two south Indian species formed a sister group to a clade containing the genera Eumyias, Niltava and Cyornis. A new genus Sholicola was therefore erected for these two species.|$|R
50|$|The white-bellied <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> (S. albiventris) has a black {{face mask}} {{with a short}} whitish brow. The upperside and breast are slaty blue grading to grey on the flanks. The centre of the belly and vent is white. This can appear {{somewhat}} like the male of the syntopic white-bellied blue flycatcher (Cyornis pallipes) but can be distinguished by behaviour apart from the longer legs and greyer colouration. Although the plumage is identical between males and females, males are slightly longer winged and have longer tarsi.|$|R

50|$|The Indian <b>blue</b> <b>robin</b> is insectivorous and feeds {{mainly on}} the ground. It skulks in {{undergrowth}} and hops on the ground, frequently flicking and fanning its tail. The breeding season is May to July and the nest is a large cup of vegetation placed on the ground between the roots of large fir tree or in depression. The nest is lined with roots, hair and down. The usual clutch is 4 light blue eggs. Only the female is believed to incubate but both sexes take part feeding the young. The cuckoo Cuculus canorus has been recorded in old literature as a brood parasite of the species.|$|R
