40|$|Ras-ERK {{signalling}} in {{the brain}} plays {{a central role in}} drug addiction. However, to date, no clinically relevant inhibitor of this cascade has been tested in experimental models of addiction, a necessary step toward clinical trials. We designed two new cell-penetrating peptides - RB 1 and RB 3 - that penetrate the brain and, in the micromolar range, inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, histone H 3 and S 6 ribosomal protein in striatal slices. Furthermore, a screening of small therapeutics currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy revealed PD 325901 as a brain-penetrating drug that blocks ERK signalling in the nanomolar range. All three compounds have an inhibitory effect on cocaine-induced ERK activation and reward in mice. In particular, PD 325901 persistently blocks cocaine-induced place preference and accelerates extinction following cocaine self-administration. Thus, clinically <b>relevant,</b> <b>systemically</b> administered drugs that attenuate Ras-ERK signalling {{in the brain}} may be valuable tools for the treatment of cocaine addictio...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A Task Force was convened by the EFNS/MDS-ES Scientist Panel on Parkinson's disease (PD) {{and other}} {{movement}} disorders to <b>systemically</b> review <b>relevant</b> publications on {{the diagnosis of}} PD. METHODS: Following the EFNS instruction for the preparation of neurological diagnostic guidelines, recommendation levels have been generated for diagnostic criteria and investigations. RESULTS: For the clinical diagnosis, we recommend {{the use of the}} Queen Square Brain Bank criteria (Level B). Genetic testing for specific mutations is recommended on an individual basis (Level B), taking into account specific features (i. e. family history and age of onset). We recommend olfactory testing to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian disorders including recessive forms (Level A). Screening for pre-motor PD with olfactory testing requires additional tests due to limited specificity. Drug challenge tests are not recommended for the diagnosis in de novo parkinsonian patients. There is an insufficient evidence to support their role in the differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. We recommend an assessment of cognition and a screening for REM sleep behaviour disorder, psychotic manifestations and severe depression in the initial evaluation of suspected PD cases (Level A). Transcranial sonography is recommended for the differentiation of PD from atypical and secondary parkinsonian disorders (Level A), for the early diagnosis of PD and in the detection of subjects at risk for PD (Level A), although the technique is so far not universally used and requires some expertise. Because specificity of TCS for the development of PD is limited, TCS should be used in conjunction with other screening tests. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging at 1. 5 T are recommended as neuroimaging tools that can support a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy versus PD on the basis of regional atrophy and signal change as well as diffusivity patterns (Level A). DaTscan SPECT is registered in Europe and the United States for the differential diagnosis between degenerative parkinsonisms and essential tremor (Level A). More specifically, DaTscan is indicated in the presence of significant diagnostic uncertainty such as parkinsonism associated with neuroleptic exposure and atypical tremor manifestations such as isolated unilateral postural tremor. Studies of [(123) I]MIBG/SPECT cardiac uptake may be used to identify patients with PD versus controls and MSA patients (Level A). All other SPECT imaging studies do not fulfil registration standards and cannot be recommended for routine clinical use. At the moment, no conclusion can be drawn as to diagnostic efficacy of autonomic function tests, neurophysiological tests and positron emission tomography imaging in PD. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of PD is still largely based on the correct identification of its clinical features. Selected investigations (genetic, olfactory, and neuroimaging studies) have an ancillary role in confirming the diagnosis, and some of them could be possibly used in the near future to identify subjects in a pre-symptomatic phase of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of coral reef ecosystems to {{the social and economic}} welfare of coastal communities, the condition of these marine ecosystems have generally degraded over the past decades. With an increased knowledge of coral reef ecosystem processes and a rise in computer power, dynamic models are useful tools in assessing the synergistic effects of local and global stressors on ecosystem functions. We review representative approaches for dynamically modeling coral reef ecosystems and categorize them as minimal, intermediate and complex models. The categorization was based on the leading principle for model development and their level of realism and process detail. This review aims to improve the knowledge of concurrent approaches in coral reef ecosystem modeling and highlights {{the importance}} of choosing an appropriate approach based on the type of question(s) to be answered. We contend that minimal and intermediate models are generally valuable tools to assess the response of key states to main stressors and, hence, contribute to understanding ecological surprises. As has been shown in freshwater resources management, insight into these conceptual relations profoundly influences how natural resource managers perceive their systems and how they manage ecosystem recovery. We argue that adaptive resource management requires integrated thinking and decision support, which demands a diversity of modeling approaches. Integration can be achieved through complimentary use of models or through integrated models that <b>systemically</b> combine all <b>relevant</b> aspects in one model. Such whole-of-system models can be useful tools for quantitatively evaluating scenarios. These models allow an assessment of the interactive effects of multiple stressors on various, potentially conflicting, management objectives. All models simplify reality and, as such, have their weaknesses. While minimal models lack multidimensionality, system models are likely difficult to interpret as they require many efforts to decipher the numerous interactions and feedback loops. Given the breadth of questions to be tackled when dealing with coral reefs, the best practice approach uses multiple model types and thus benefits from the strength of different models types...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{consequences}} of Austria's integration into the Common Market and into Economic and Monetary Union for its financial stability. It shows that financial stability has been increased by a more efficient allocation of capital (as a result of intense competition), a higher degree of risk diversification, a reduced probability of asymmetric shocks and enhanced influence on the establishment of a harmonized framework. These positive effects have to some extent been weakened only by the increased risk of cross-border spillover effects and the growing importance of <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> institutions. Setbacks in the earnings of financial institutions brought about by the integration process seem to have been offset at least in part by measures leading to higher cost efficiency.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a change in}} focus from considerations of factors which could impede competition, for example over-regulation, {{to the need to}} strike a balance between over-regulation and insufficient regulation – in order to provide the right level of safety for consumers (such that they are protected from risky investments). A driving force behind the need for deregulation over the past two decades has been the objective and desire to foster competition. Re-regulation thereafter assumed centre stage in some jurisdictions in response to the need to manage cross sector services' risks more efficiently. Rescue cases involving guarantees (contrasted with restructuring cases) during the recent Financial Crisis, have illustrated the prominent position which the goal of promoting financial stability has assumed over that of the prevention or limitation of possible distortions of competition which may arise when granting State aid. The importance attached to maintaining and promoting financial stability - as well as the need to facilitate rescue and restructuring measures aimed at preventing <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> financial institutions from failure, demonstrate how far authorities are willing to overlook certain competition policies. However increased government and central bank intervention also simultaneously trigger the usual concerns – which include moral hazard and the danger of serving as long term substitutes for market discipline. An interesting observation derives from the relationship between State aid grants, competition, and the potential to induce higher risk taking levels. Whilst the need to promote and maintain financial stability is paramount, safeguards need to be implemented and enforced to ensure that measures geared towards the aim of sustaining system stability (measures such as lender of last resort arrangements and State rescues) do not unduly distort competition as well as induce higher risk taking levels. This paper will draw attention to safeguards which have been provided by the Commission where approval is considered for the grant of State aid to financial institutions whose problems are attributable to inefficiencies, poor asset liability management or risky strategies. Whether the distinction drawn by the Commission – with regards to the preferential grant of recapitalisation packages to fundamentally sound banks (which require less restructuring measures) is justified, will also be considered. How far central banks and governments should intervene and how far distortions of competition should be permitted ultimately depends on how <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> a financial institution is. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{well as a}} {{consideration}} of why the lender of last resort facility {{should be used for}} emergency situations and <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> institutions in particular, an interesting point which will be considered in this paper is the comparison between the European Central Bank (ECB) Recommendation and its application by the Commission in the Re capitalisation Communication, specifically with its Annex, where the Commission explains how it determines the price of equity (ordinary or common shares) - balancing the “real value” with the “market value” within a crisis context. Whether the Commission and Member States have applied this methodology in determining the price of equity with respect to the capital of banks acquired by Member States, will also be addressed. Such consideration could provide a vital key to determining the real value of State Aid and the best possible price for which capital could be sold. Given the scale of government intervention and State rescues which occurred during the recent crisis – as well as the prominence accorded to measures aimed at preventing and limiting distortions of competition, calls have been made for competition authorities to take on more formidable roles in designing and implementing exit strategies. In order to foster competition as much as possible, it is proposed that ”governments should provide financial institutions with incentives to prevent them from depending on government support once the economy begins to recover. ”...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} risk diversification in complex networks. Nodes represent e. g. financial actors, whereas weighted links represent e. g. financial obligations (credits/debts). Each node has a risk to fail because of losses resulting from defaulting neighbors, which may lead to large failure cascades. Classical risk diversification strategies usually neglect network effects and therefore suggest that risk can be reduced if possible losses (i. e., exposures) are split among many neighbors (exposure diversification, ED). But from a complex networks perspective diversification implies higher connectivity of {{the system as a}} whole which can also lead to increasing failure risk of a node. To cope with this, we propose a different strategy (damage diversification, DD), i. e. the diversification of losses that are imposed on neighboring nodes as opposed to losses incurred by the node itself. Here, we quantify the potential of DD to reduce systemic risk in comparison to ED. For this, we develop a branching process approximation that we generalize to weighted networks with (almost) arbitrary degree and weight distributions. This allows us to identify <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> nodes in a network even if their directed weights differ strongly. On the macro level, we provide an analytical expression for the average cascade size, to quantify systemic risk. Furthermore, on the meso level we calculate failure probabilities of nodes conditional on their system relevance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the resilience of}} credit institutions to instances of financial instability based on simple publicly available balance sheet and income statement figures. In {{the course of the}} recent financial crisis and the related credit turmoil, the loss absorption capacity of the global financial system has been stretched to its limit. Globally active financial institutions, many of them <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant,</b> needed government support to keep their capital ratios above regulatory and/or market required minima. Central banks had to step in to provide liquidity when large parts of the financial markets ceased to function. From an ex-post perspective, the crisis provided a real stress scenario which we use to explain bank performance by examining simple indicators such as capitalization, liquidity, funding structure and asset-side exposure. To cover systemically important European banks we choose a subset from the bank sample used by the European Banking Association for the EU-wide stresstesting exercise in 2011. We add three Austrian banks to arrive at a sample of 90 European banks in total (including altogether six Austrian banks). To measure bank performance, we use return on average assets, return on average equity, operating profits, required government support and equity prices. We show that these performance measures can be explained adequately by our simple indicators. We are able to identify the strong, respectively weak, banks that did not, respectively did, need government support in 2009. Regarding the other performance measures we give a forecast for 2011 about which banks are expected to perform well, ordinarily and poorly. bank performance, financial crisis, stress testing, early warning...|$|E
40|$|With Germany's banking sector still {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} the financial crisis, public discussion of plans to place toxic assets in one or more bad banks has gained steam in recent weeks. The following paper presents a bad bank plan from the German Institute for Economic Research. The key element of the plan is the valuation of troubled assets at their current market value - assets with no market would thus be valued at zero. The current shareholders will cover the losses arising from the depreciation reserve in the amount of the difference of the toxic assets' current book value and their market value. Under the plan, the government would bear responsibility for the management and future resale of toxic assets at its own cost and recapitalize the good bank by taking an equity stake in it. In extreme cases, this would mean a takeover of the bank by the government. The risk to taxpayers from this investment would be acceptable, however, once the banks are freed from toxic assets. A clear emphasis that the government stake is temporary would also be necessary. The government would cover the bad bank's losses, while profits would be distributed to the distressed bank's current shareholders. The plan is viable independent of whether the government decides to have one centralized bad bank or to establish a separate bad bank for each <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> banking institute.

40|$|Objective: A rat {{model is}} here {{used to test}} a {{hypothesis}} that Momordica charantia (Bitter melon (BM)) extract favorably alters processes in cardiovascular tissue and is <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and related cardiovascular disease. Methods: Male Lean and Zucker Obese (ZO) rats were gavage-treated for six weeks with 400 mg/kg body weight bitter melon (BM) extract suspended in mucin–water vehicle, or with vehicle (Control). Animals were segregated into four treatment groups, 10 animals in each group, according to strain (Lean or ZO) and treatment (Control or BM). Following six-week treatment periods, peripheral blood was collected from selected animals, followed by sacrifice, thoracotomy and mounting of isolated working heart setup. Results: Body mass of both Lean and ZO rats was unaffected by treatment, likewise, peripheral blood fasting glucose levels showed no significant treatment-related effects. However, some BM treatment-related improvement was noted in postischemic cardiac functions when Lean, BM-treated animals were compared to vehicle treated Lean control rats. Treatment of Lean, but not ZO, rats significantly reduced the magnitude of infarcted zone in isolated hearts subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 2 h of working mode reperfusion. Immunohistochemical demonstration of caspase- 3 expression by isolated heart tissues subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion, revealed significant correlation between BM treatment and reduced expression of this enzyme in hearts obtained from both Lean and ZO animals. The hierarchy and order of caspase- 3 expression from highest to lowest was as follows: ZO rats receiving vehicle > ZO rats receiving BM extract > Lean rats treated receiving vehicle > Lean rats administered BM extract. Outcomes of analyses of peripheral blood content of cardiac-related analytics: with particular relevance to clinical application was a significant elevation in blood of ZO and ZO BM-treated, versus Lean rats of total cholesterol (high density lipoprotein HDL-c + low density lipoprotein LDL-c), with an inferred increase in HDL-c/LDL-c ratio—an outcome associated with decreased risk of atherosclerotic disease. Conclusions: BM extract failed to positively affect T 2 DM- and cardiovascular-related outcomes at a level suggesting use as a standalone treatment. Nevertheless, the encouraging effects of BM in enhancement of cardiac function, suppression of post-ischemic/reperfused infarct size extent and capacity to modulate serum cholesterol, will likely make it useful as an adjuvant therapy {{for the management of}} T 2 DM and related cardiovascular diseases...|$|E
40|$|Candidiasis {{represents}} {{a growing problem}} for our public health system. Among those especially affected are immune-suppressed patients, those being treated with antibiotica and those undergoing intensive therapy. In addition, some patients suffer from chronically recurrent mycosis which, though especially common in vulvovaginal cases, also occurs in other extra-intestinal areas. It is pathomechanically noteworthy that after Candida infections patients rarely develop lasting immunity, which thus permits a renewed infection by the same agent. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify prostate and gall bladder, which have received little attention in this connection until now, as microbial risk factors for the entire organism and as pathogenic reservoirs for chronically recurrent candidiasis, especially in the vulvovaginal area. The test samples used were biopsies from the prostate, ejaculates and bile samples obtained from the autopsies of more than 100 test persons. Analyses were made additionally of post-mortally obtained oral and anal smears. The removal of test material from different parts of the body was aimed at achieving a better understanding of the propagation paths of fungi in the organism. The large number of positive findings confirmed our thesis that the gall bladder and prostate should be viewed as potential endogen infection reservoirs for the Candida species. This is especially true of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata settlements in the gall bladder as well as Candida glabrata infection in the prostate area. As for the gall bladder, it must be assumed that what our investigation turned up were primary Candida colonization which for the time being has no disease relevancy. Yet if <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> predispositional factors become involved then the gall bladder must be viewed, with a high degree of probability, as a microbial risk factor. The therapeutic relevancy of our studies becomes evident in the case of those patients where the eradication of intestinal mycoflora was ineffective despite intensive drug therapy. The reason for this phenomenon might be the colonization of the gall bladder in a way which could not be eliminated by such measures. The results of the ejaculate analyses and the relatively high indication of Candida glabrata connected with them showed that the prostate must also be seen as a possible potential endogen agent reservoir, especially for this species. This is especially important due to the risk of re-infection with women who suffer chronically recurrent vulvovaginal mycoses even after anti-mycosis therapy...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the recent Financial Crisis -after it had been widely accepted that "a serious disturbance in the economy of Member States" had occurred, and that several measures were required to remedy this disturbance, various Commission communications were adopted and these include: The Communication on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions {{in the context of}} the current global financial crisis (hereinafter "the Banking Communication"), its Communication on the recapitalization of financial institutions in the current financial crisis: limitation of aid to the minimum necessary and safeguards against undue distortions of competition (hereinafter "the Recapitalization Communication"), and its Communication on the return to viability and the assessment of restructuring measures in the financial sector in the current crisis under the State aid rules (hereinafter "the Restructuring Communication"). " The Banking Communication will constitute the focus of this study. Are rescue aids (as distinguished from other forms of State aids) justified even where the possibility exists that rescue attempts are unlikely to succeed? Should rescue aids still be granted at a point when other measures such as winding down measures and the provision of other forms of liquidity assistance could be introduced? At what point should the Government decide upon the nationalization of ailing institutions? Furthermore, should State aids be provided to all classes of financial institutions which are considered to qualify for such aid – as stated within the Banking Communication? These questions interalia constitute questions which are not only raised in this paper, but which this paper aims to address through a consideration of different State aid rescue and restructuring measures, as well as reference to two rescue aid cases, namely those of Bradford & Bingley (State aid NN 41 / 2008 – United Kingdom Rescue Aid to Bradford & Bingley) and Hypo Real Estate (State aid NN 44 / 2008 – Germany Rescue Aid for Hypo Real Estate). In addition, the impact of the recent crisis on the choice of legislation and legal basis for compatibility assessments will be highlighted. Whereas State aid to individual undertakings in difficulties is usually assessed under Article 87 (3) (c) of the EC Treaty and the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty, the systemic relevance of a financial institution and the impact of such an institution's failure on the economy, has been reflected by the preference for Article 87 (3) (b) EC Treaty and Article 107 (3) (b) TFEU. rescue aids, liquidity, banking communication, <b>Systemically</b> <b>Relevant</b> Financial Institutions, guarantees, recapitalization, financial crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the legal environment of netting agreements covering financial contracts. It concludes that an international instrument {{should be developed}} capable of improving the effectiveness of netting agreements in mitigating systemic risk. To this end, two {{different aspects of the}} enforceability of netting agreements are considered: (i) the general enforceability of netting, and (ii) the possibility of precluding the operation of netting a mechanism by way of a regulatory moratorium for considerations of systemic stability. The first part of the study presents the use of netting and the various forms it may take before going on to explain the benefits and drawbacks of enforceable netting agreements. Benefits for individual firms consist in lower counterparty risk and more favourable capital requirements. Benefits for the financial market as a whole flow from greater financial market stability since the contagion of <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> institutions by the default or insolvency of another institution is limited, thus helping to avoid systemic effects. Additionally, the use of netting arrangements can improve overall market liquidity. A potential drawback of enforceability of netting, in certain situations, is that the operation of a netting mechanism could actually work against the purpose of systemic stability where the transfer of parts of the business of an insolvent financial institution to a solvent bridge entity would enhance or maintain value {{to a greater extent than}} the operation of a netting agreement would. Regulatory authorities are considering under which conditions a moratorium to halt the netting mechanism until the situation is solved could avoid this threat to systemic stability. The second part of the {{study examines}} whether there is the potential to support the purpose of enhanced systemic stability by way of international harmonisation of private and insolvency law. As regards the issue of general enforceability, the global picture of netting legislation is heterogeneous. Given the great practical relevance of the matter, an international instrument could be very useful. As to the issue of private law consequences of regulatory moratoria, the absence of a harmonised framework appears to lead to actual cross-border inconsistency and legal uncertainty as regards financial contracts that are governed by a foreign law. Taking these to aspects into account, this paper recommends that work on developing an international instrument be undertaken. The final part of the study suggests a set of preliminary guidelines for the development of suchan instrument. In the light of the findings of the previous sections, a mixed, two-step approach is recommended. First, a non-binding instrument could be developed, serving as a benchmark and reservoir of legal solutions in respect of the relevant issues. Secondly, isolated aspects relating to both the general enforceability of netting and the accommodation of a regulatory moratorium in foreign private and insolvency law could be dealt with in an international Convention, in particular where cross-border situations involving netting require uniformity of applicable legal rules...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. One of {{the major}} lessons from the current {{financial}} crisis refers to the systemic dimension of financial risk which had been almost completely neglected by bankers and supervisors in the pre- 2007 years. 2. Accordingly, the most needed change in financial regulation, {{in order to avoid}} a repetition of such a crisis in the future, consists of influencing individual bank behaviour such that systemic risk is decreased. This objective is new and distinct from what Basle II was intended to achieve. 3. It is important, therefore, to evaluate proposed new regulatory instruments on the ground of whether or not they contribute to a reduction, or containment of systemic risk. We see two new regulatory measures of paramount importance: the introduction of a Systemic Risk Charge (SRC), and the implementation of a transparent bank resolution regime. Both measures complement each other, thus both have to be realized to be effective. 4. We propose a Systemic Risk Charge (SRC), a levy capturing the contribution of any individual bank to the overall systemic risk which is distinct from the institution’s own default risk. The SRC is set up such that the more systemic risk a bank contributes, the higher is the cost it has to bear. Therefore, the SRC serves to internalize the cost of systemic risk which, up to now, was borne by the taxpayer. 5. Major details of our SRC refer to the use of debt that may be converted into equity when systemic risk threatens the stability of the banking system. Also, the SRC raises some revenues for government. 6. The SRC has to be compared to several bank levies currently debated. The Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) does not directly address systemic risk and is therefore inferior to a SRC. Nevertheless, a FTT may offer the opportunity to subsidize on-exchange trading at the expense of off-exchange (over-the-counter, OTC) transactions, thereby enhancing financial market stability. The Financial Activity Tax (FAT) is similar to a VAT on financial services. It is the least adequate instrument among all instruments discussed above to limit systemic risk. 7. Bank resolution regime: No instrument to contain systemic risk can be effective unless the restructuring of bank debt, and the ensuing loss given default to creditors, is a real possibility. As the crisis has taught, bank restructuring is very difficult in light of contagion risk between major banks. We therefore need a regulatory procedure that allows winding down banks, even large banks, on short notice. Among other things, the procedure will require to distinguish <b>systemically</b> <b>relevant</b> exposures from those that are irrelevant.
