Whenever the cloud lifted from the Tent, the Israelites would follow it until the cloud settled, and there the Israelites would make camp and stay as long as the cloud lingered. God told Moses to have two silver trumpets made to summon the community and to set it in motion. Upon long blasts of the two horns, the whole community was to assemble before the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. Upon the blast of one, the chieftains were to assemble. <b>Short</b> <b>blasts</b> directed the divisions encamped on the east to move forward, and a second set of <b>short</b> <b>blasts</b> directed those on the south to move forward.

50|$|Blast-Induced TBI {{results from}} wave {{propagation}} from a blast source through the brain. These injuries are most commonly {{found on the}} battlefield, as explosions occur close enough to humans that the high intensity waves apply stresses and strains that greatly surpass neuron elastic thresholds. As the wave passes through the skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and through the brain, neurons undergo sequences of tension and compression {{for the duration of}} the blast wave. Even very <b>short</b> <b>blast</b> waves with high intensity can cause immediate cell death, even through the cerebrospinal fluid buffer. Blast-Induced damage is not localized to a specific region due to its wave nature, and can penetrate deep into the brain before finally subsiding, depending on the blast intensity and proximity.|$|E

50|$|A {{contributing}} factor was {{the failure of}} the express engineman to properly observe the train order signal at Shepherdsville. However the system (in which all signals were held in the stop position until an approaching train, within 600 yards of the signal sounded four <b>short</b> <b>blasts</b> to request the signal be cleared) was unworkable since, if the engineman fails to see the clearing of the signal, then he is required to stop at the signal; but high-speed trains such as the Flyer required considerably more distance than 600 yards to come to a halt.|$|R

An urgent warning could also be given over the radio, for example, if the called vessel appears to be unaware that it is potentially or at risk of endangering a person in a small boat or a person swimming, such as running the person down.

5000|$|In 1964, Wingfoot Express {{returned}} to Bonneville for a week, but the engine never regained the strength shown in their earliest runs, {{and struggled to}} pick up speed. Even when another engine was installed, success eluded them. Finally, Walt's brother and longtime competitor Art Arfons, a brilliant intuitive mechanic for both piston and jet engines, suggested that the 17 inch (432 mm) opening of the [...] "clamshells" [...] on the engine exhaust was the problem. [...] "it was a 1/16 turn of the idle adjustment on the engine and opening of the afterburner clamshells to 19 inches (483 mm) that brought the engine up to record performance", Green recalls. Green also removed some of the sheet metal around the engine intake, later realizing that in the process he had destroyed the Goodyear logo. But the Wingfoot Express now easily hit 299 miles per hour (481 km/h) with no afterburner. On the last day they had available, October 2, 1964, at 4:06 pm, a <b>short</b> <b>blast</b> of afterburner brought the car to a recorded 406 mph (653 km/h), but the official record required the run be [...] "backed up" [...] in the opposite direction. The lateness of the hour left no time for refueling, so {{the decision was made}} to save fuel by not making a full run over the entire distance for acceleration, and the car started the return run only 2 miles (3 km) away from the timing lights. Green and the car accelerated like a rocket, recording a remarkable speed of 420.07 miles per hour (676.04 km/h), thus averaging 413.20 miles per hour (664.98 km/h) in both directions and setting a new record not quite 2% faster than Breedlove's.|$|E
