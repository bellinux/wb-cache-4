25|$|Recently, {{aesthetic}} and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation {{as a work}} of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza wrote Revelation: Vision of a Just World from the viewpoint of rhetoric. Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about <b>saying</b> <b>things,</b> partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.|$|E
25|$|Receptive aphasia: The {{patients}} {{suffer from}} lesions or damage {{located in the}} left temproparietal lobe. Receptive Aphasic patients mostly suffer from lexical-semantic difficulties, but also have difficulties in comprehension tasks. Though they have difficulty <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> or describing things, these people showed {{that they could do}} well in online comprehension tasks. This is closely related to Parkinson's disease because both of the diseases have trouble in distinguishing irregular verbs. For instance using the example of the dog went home, a person suffering from expressive aphasia or Parkinson's disease would say the dog goed home.|$|E

It's about how the defendants got money, {{and to a lesser}} extent, what they did with that money when they got it...

Before the show, a political prisoner had died in a hunger strike in protest of the Cuban government, and Cuban exiles in Miami criticized the group for performing at such a time. Residente defended the performance, noting that it had been inaccurately reported and that [...] "we said things that no artist had said from the stage, like 'here the people are in charge, and the government has to obey.'" [...] These events had a major impact on Residente's lyrical style and the subjects he planned to discuss on the new album: [...] "What's making me more mature is not about my age, it's about what I'm seeing and living.

500|$|Like {{other black}} {{players in the}} 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes {{both on and off}} the field. Paul Brown would not {{tolerate}} discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just stand right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> and just turn their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were." [...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E
500|$|Stewart served {{not only}} as host {{but also as a}} writer and {{executive}} producer of the series. [...] He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of The Onion Ben Karlin who, along with fellow Onion contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things [...] " [...] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, [...] "The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> that you know they don't believe." ...|$|E

She's way out of his league, {{but there is a}} lot of chemistry between them. I think they'd make a really good couple. That would be cool. Fatboy may be young, but he's got an old soul and he's not just some young boy messing about. There is potential there if Denise could see it, but because of the age thing, I think she might worry that people were <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> about her. Right now, she's just enjoying herself."

[...] Timbers said they chose to stick to Church of Scientology primary source material for background on the script because [...] "We thought {{that the best way}} to satirize the Church of Scientology was to let the Church speak for itself." [...] During production, the creative team worked with cast members to educate them about the play's background. [...] "Kids shouldn't just be <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> that they don't understand. That's what we're criticizing...people who just parrot behavior and language. We wanted to have an honest conversation with them," [...] Jarrow said.

Whedon commented that he was [...] "obsessive about progressing a plot in a song, about <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> we haven't said", comparing the musical theater format to the fourth-season episode [...] "Hush", in which characters begin communicating when they stop talking. According to Buffy essayist Zoe-Jane Playdon, earlier episodes' [...] "false saccharine behaviour" [...] impedes the characters so crucially that it summons a demon {{to force them to}} be honest. The consequences in the episode of concealing truth, spontaneous combustion, is an allusion to Bleak House by Charles Dickens—of whom Whedon is a fan—where characters also face immolation for being deceitful. For Buffy, however, truth is slow in coming, as she continues to lie to the Scoobies, claiming to forget what she sang about in the graveyard during [...] "Going Through the Motions". Buffy continues her charade in the chorus number [...] "If We're Together", beginning the song by persuading others to join in one by one, as if each is convinced that she is still invested and in charge, and their strength as a group is infallible.

The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales.

Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother, Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), and given to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed.
