The predictable frequency range of the static circuit parameters on prediction of the transmission characteristics of <b>step</b> microstrip <b>line</b> is researched in this paper. The circuit parameters are {{extracted from the}} full wave results of <b>step</b> <b>line,</b> respectively, at three frequencies (9 GHz, 15 GHz and 20 GHz).

By comparing these time and frequency domain results obtained from the static circuit parameters with those obtained directly from the full wave method, the available condition of the static circuit parameters of the <b>step</b> microstrip <b>line</b> can be analyzed. This comparison shows that the static circuit parameters can be used in frequency bands from DC up to 20 GHz.

40|$|The 1946 M 7. 3 Ancash {{earthquake}} {{triggered a}} large number of landslides in an epicentral area along the continental divide in the Andes of Peru. Reconnaissance reports by Silgado (1947, 1951), Heim (1949) and Rüegg (1950) published shortly after the earthquake describe some of the landslides, but lack any detailed documentation. A review of literature, field traverses, aerial photograph interpretation and GIS mapping, identified 45 landslides inferred to have been triggered by the event. The cumulative volume-frequency plot shows a strong power law relation, similar in form to that derived for landslides triggered by the 1994 Northridge earthquake (Harp and Jibson, 1995). Data for the Ancash earthquake plots near the regression line calculated by Keefer (1994), and modified by Malamud et al. (2004), for earthquake moment magnitude vs. total volume moved by landslides during the earthquake. A denudation (average surface lowering) of 76 mm and a denudation rate of 0. 00585 mm/yr was estimated for the area over which the earthquake-triggered landslides occurred. Rock avalanches constituted 83 % of the landslides which involved Cretaceous limestones interbedded with shales. Rock slope failures were common on slopes with a southwest aspect, an orientation corresponding to the regional dip direction of major planar structures in the epicentral area. In valleys oriented transverse to the NW-SE structural trend of the epicentral area, south-westerly dipping bedding planes combined with orthogonal joint sets to form numerous wedge failures. Three rock avalanches were analysed using conventional wedge failure criteria. Two of the rock avalanches which did not satisfy conventional criteria were utilized to develop a new criteria, i. e. stepped wedge criteria. Stepped wedge failure involves wedge movement along a <b>stepped</b> <b>line</b> of intersection formed by a nearly-vertical discontinuity, striking roughly parallel to the slope, and the conventional line of intersection formed by the bedding and orthogonal joint set. The nearly-vertical discontinuity forms the essential backscarp needed to facilitate stepped wedge failure. Additional characteristics of stepped wedge failure were also distinguished based on the wedge failures studied in the epicentral area of the 1946 Ancash earthquake...|$|E

Our formula agrees well with experimental data for both Ag and Cu{ 111 } surfaces, indicating that NN interactions alone can account for the data in these cases (in contrast to results for Cu{ 001 }). Experimentally significant corollaries of the low-temperature derivation show that the <b>step</b> <b>line</b> tension cannot be extracted from the stiffness and that with plausible assumptions the low-temperature stiffness should have six-fold symmetry, in contrast to the three fold symmetry of the crystal shape. We examine Zia's exact implicit solution in detail, using numerical methods for general orientations and deriving many analytic results including explicit solutions in the two high-symmetry directions.

From the pzc and the potential dependence of the capacitance curves, the potential dependence of the surface tension of the vicinal Surfaces is determined. The line tension of the steps is then calculated from the difference between the Surface tensions of stepped (1 1 n) and the nominally step-free (0 0 1) Surfaces.

The fabrication of highly regular ICs is straightforward. Poly and metal layers are arranged into 1 D layouts. These 1 D layouts facilitate a two-step patterning approach: a line-creation step, followed by a line-cutting step, to form the desired IC pattern (See Figure 1). The first <b>step,</b> <b>line</b> creation, can be accomplished {{with a variety of}} lithography techniques including 193 nm immersion (193 i) and Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) 1.
