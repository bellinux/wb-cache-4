5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right <b>side</b> <b>up,</b> load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E

25|$|Each {{event in}} the regatta {{takes the form of}} a {{knockout}} competition, with each race consisting of two crews racing side by <b>side</b> <b>up</b> the Henley course. The course is marked out by two lines of booms (wooden bars which float on the water, secured between vertical poles), which are placed along the river to form a straight course 2,112metres long. The course is wide enough to allow two crews to race down with a few metres between them. As such it is not uncommon for inexperienced steersmen or coxswains to crash into the booms, possibly costing their crew the race.|$|E

25|$|Pardew {{was named}} the new manager of Southampton on 17 July 2009, after the new owner Markus Liebherr {{had taken over the}} club and sacked Mark Wotte a day after {{completing}} the deal to save the Saints. Pardew's first signing for the club was Dan Harding, who signed on a free transfer after being released by Ipswich Town. His first league match in charge was against Millwall on 8 August 2009, which ended in a 1–1 draw. He brought many new signings to the club, including League One strikers Rickie Lambert and Lee Barnard, the first of whom cost £1million. Pardew led his <b>side</b> <b>up</b> the League One table, and, despite their ten-point deduction, their challenge for a playoff place was kept alive until there were just two league games remaining.|$|E

The Sergeant contacts Donna, alerting her that Jack did not enter the green area alone, but in fact continued in a different direction, still with his male companion. There was never any footage of Jack by himself.|$|E
25|$|From the carpark {{at the end}} of Glenesk Road, {{directions}} {{are clearly}} signposted. A well formed loop track, used by around 30,000 people a year (2005), follows the Glen Esk Stream with minor undulations (on the south <b>side)</b> <b>up</b> to a lookout where you find a huge Macrocarpa bench seat to rest on and admire the view. The bench seat was made by offenders doing community work (2005). The track then descends down wooden steps {{to the base of the}} falls (40 minutes from the carpark). The track then crosses the stream next to the lower swimming hole and returns down the north side. However, instead of going down again, a walker can climb a reasonably steep track (the Connect Track) which begins about 100m from the base of the falls on the northern side of the stream. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the top of the falls. There is a good swimming hole at the top although the water is cool. From this high vantage point there are great views down the valley.|$|E

25|$|The Doolittle Raiders held {{an annual}} reunion almost {{every year from}} the late 1940s to 2013. The high point of each reunion was a solemn, private {{ceremony}} in which the surviving Raiders performed a roll call, then toasted their fellow Raiders who had died during the previous year. Specially engraved silver goblets, {{one for each of}} the 80 Raiders, were used for this toast; the goblets of those who have died were inverted. Each Raider's name was engraved on his goblet both right <b>side</b> <b>up</b> and upside down. The Raiders drank a toast using a bottle of cognac that accompanied the goblets to each Raider reunion. In 2013, the remaining Raiders decided to hold their last public reunion at Fort Walton Beach, Florida, not far from Eglin Air Force Base, where they trained for the original mission. The bottle and the goblets had been maintained by the United States Air Force Academy on display in Arnold Hall, the cadet social center, until 2006. On 19 April 2006, these memorabilia were transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|These {{two broad}} {{categories}} may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind's eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as {{being on the}} left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right <b>side</b> <b>up</b> and then neglect {{the left side of}} the adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a barbell, patients will more significantly neglect {{the left side of the}} barbell, as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the object, even though it is now on the right side of space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of the World may neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map.|$|E
25|$|Son of Gaius Claudius Pulcher (who was consul in 177 BC), he {{was elected}} consul for 143 BC, and, to obtain a pretext for a triumph, {{attacked}} the Salassi, an Alpine tribe. He was at first defeated, but afterwards, following the directions of the Sibylline Books, gained a victory. On his return {{the celebration of the}} triumph was refused; but he triumphed at his own expense, and when one of the tribunes attempted to drag him from his car, his daughter Claudia, one of the Vestal Virgins, walked by his <b>side</b> <b>up</b> to the capital. Next year he was an unsuccessful candidate for the censorship, though he afterwards held that office with Quintus Fulvius Nobilior, probably in 136 BC. He allied with Tiberius Gracchus who married his daughter Claudia. Appius backed Tiberius' land reform bill and in 133 BC with Tiberius and Tiberius' brother, Gaius Gracchus, was chosen commissioner for the division of the lands. Their post allowed them to survey the ager publicus, publicly owned land that Tiberius wanted to distribute to citizens who had lost their property. Another faction in the Senate opposed them and Tiberius was assassinated in 132 BC. Appius was the enemy of Publius Scipio Aemilianus. He died shortly after Tiberius Gracchus, probably in 130 BC. He was one of the Salii, an augur, and princeps senatus. Cicero says that his style of speaking was fluent and vehement. He married Antistia.|$|E
