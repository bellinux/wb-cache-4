5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store carbon in their <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> biomass as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this change in the carbon stock of the <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E
5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality <b>soil,</b> <b>and</b> absence of predators.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and <b>soil,</b> <b>and</b> acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil.

5|$|Also in {{the park}} are the black, lumpy, very slow-growing colonies of cryptobiotic soil, which are a mix of lichens, algae, fungi, and cyanobacteria. Together these organisms slow erosion, add {{nitrogen}} to <b>soil,</b> <b>and</b> help it to retain moisture.|$|E

5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum, {{commonly}} known as the rayed earthstar or four-footed earthstar, is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to the genus Geastrum, or earthstar fungi. First described scientifically by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, G.quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan—but not common—species of Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a saprobe, feeding off decomposing organic matter present in the <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> litter of coniferous forests.|$|E
5|$|H. aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid, a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid.
