5|$|Jerome had a {{post office}} by 1883. It added a schoolhouse in 1884 and a public library in 1889. After four major fires between 1894 and 1898 {{destroyed}} much of the business district {{and half of the}} community's homes, Jerome was incorporated as a town in 1899. Incorporation made it possible to collect taxes to build a formal fire-fighting <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> establish building codes that prohibited tents and other fire hazards within the town limits. Local merchant and rancher William Munds was the first mayor.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the {{previous}} game in the Mana series, 1999's Legend of Mana, several members of the development team for the game left Square to form a new development studio, Brownie Brown. These included character designer Kameoka Shinichi and lead artist Kouji Tsuda, as well as several other writers and artists. Square, in turn, outsourced development of the fifth game in the Mana series to Brownie Brown. The producer for the game was Square's Koichi Ishii, who had directed or designed the previous games in the series. Ishii had served as the director for the original game in the series, Final Fantasy Adventure, which Sword of Mana is a remake of. The remake, in addition to adding enhanced graphics to the original Game Boy title, sought to add elements present in later games in the series, such as the Ring Command menu <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> expand the game's storyline. It also removed elements from the Final Fantasy series, which had been placed in the original game {{as a part of the}} marketing for the game before its sequels moved to be a distinct series.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{demanded the}} right to return to Hill 82 in order to destroy the bunker <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> recover the bodies of Parker and Gillson, and he and Major John Essex-Clark—the {{operations}} officer—began planning a battalion attack. However, with American casualties rising and all available helicopters required for casualty evacuation, the planned operation was cancelled. The thick jungle canopy compounded the issue, and Williamson decided to stage the casualties through an area secured by the Australians at LZ Princess. Operation Hump concluded on 9 November, with the US 1/503rd Battalion and 1 RAR being extracted by helicopter and returning to Bien Hoa in the late afternoon. Following 1 RAR's return to Bien Hoa, Brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct the operation. A battalion attack was subsequently planned for 14 November, but Williamson later deferred it dependent {{on the availability of}} air and helicopter support, and the start date of the upcoming Operation New Life. Ultimately it was never conducted.|$|E
5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, {{to lay out the}} desired strategy of the weapons <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was used successfully for more than a decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E
