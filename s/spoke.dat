5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population <b>spoke</b> only English, 3.2 percent <b>spoke</b> only French, 15.1 percent <b>spoke</b> both, and 0.9 percent <b>spoke</b> neither.|$|E

50|$|Semi-{{aerodynamic}} and aerodynamic wheelsets {{are characterized}} by greater rim depth, which is the radial distance between the outermost and the innermost surfaces of the rim; a triangular or pyramidal cross-section; and by fewer numbers of <b>spokes,</b> or no <b>spokes</b> at all—with blades molded of composite material supporting the rim. The <b>spokes</b> are also often flattened in the rotational direction to reduce wind drag. These are called bladed <b>spokes.</b> However, semi-aerodynamic and aerodynamic wheelsets tend to be heavier than more traditional <b>spoked</b> wheelsets due to the extra shapings of the rims and <b>spokes.</b> More importantly, the rims must be heavier when there are fewer <b>spokes,</b> as the unsupported span between <b>spokes</b> is greater. A number of wheel manufacturers are now producing wheels with roughly half the <b>spokes</b> of the highest performance traditional wheel from the 1980s, with approximately the same rotational inertia and less total weight. These improvements have been made possible primarily through improved aluminium alloys for the rims.|$|R

5|$|In 1846, 57 {{percent of}} Belgians <b>spoke</b> dialects of Dutch or Flemish {{as their primary}} {{language}} while 42 percent <b>spoke</b> dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais.

5|$|Approximately 70.3% of the {{population}} (over five years old) <b>spoke</b> only English at home. An additional 23.5% of {{the population}} <b>spoke</b> Spanish at home.

50|$|<b>Spokes</b> {{are usually}} {{circular}} in cross-section, but high-performance wheels may use <b>spokes</b> of flat or oval cross-section, {{also known as}} bladed, to reduce aerodynamic drag. Some <b>spokes</b> are hollow tubes.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{conventional}} bicycle wheels now use 32 or 36 <b>spokes</b> {{front and}} rear, although the asymmetry {{of the rear}} wheel (to allow for the cluster of sprockets), and the additional weight it carries, means it benefits from having more <b>spokes</b> than the front. Commonly used models vary from 18 <b>spokes</b> for racing bikes to 36 for cross-country touring bikes to 48 <b>spokes</b> on tandems and heavily abused BMX bikes. The minimum number of <b>spokes</b> allowed for competition is 12. Some lowrider bicycles use as many as 144 brightly chromed <b>spokes</b> per wheel, although these are not meant for serious riding.|$|R
50|$|The rim is {{connected}} to the hub by several <b>spokes</b> under tension.

2500|$|The {{reaction}} to a radial load of a well-tensioned wire <b>spoked</b> wheel, such as by a rider sitting on a bicycle, is that the wheel flattens slightly near the ground contact area. The rest of the wheel remains approximately circular. The tension of all the <b>spokes</b> does not increase significantly. Instead, only the <b>spokes</b> directly under the hub decrease their tension. The issue of how best to describe this situation is debated. Some authors conclude from this that the hub [...] "stands" [...] on those <b>spokes</b> immediately below it that experience a reduction in tension, even though the <b>spokes</b> below the hub exert no upward force on the hub and can be replaced by chains without much changing the physics of the wheel. Other authors conclude that the hub [...] "hangs" [...] from those <b>spokes</b> above it that exert an upward force on the hub, and that have higher tension than the <b>spokes</b> below the hub, which pull down on the hub.|$|R

50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} the most common {{material}} for <b>spokes,</b> although most mass-produced budget wheels use galvanized steel <b>spokes.</b> Other materials such as titanium or aluminum are often used to reduce weight. Some wheels are designed around carbon fiber <b>spokes,</b> which are often completely integrated with the hub and rim and bladed in shape. Non-steel <b>spokes</b> are normally reserved for racing bikes and other specialist applications where weight, aerodynamics and performance are valued over durability and cost.|$|R
50|$|The hub {{shell is}} the part of the hub to which the <b>spokes</b> (or disc structure) attach. The hub shell of a <b>spoked</b> wheel {{generally}} has two flanges extending radially outward from the axle. Each flange has holes or slots to which <b>spokes</b> are affixed. Some wheels (like the Full Speed Ahead RD-800) have an additional flange {{in the center of the}} hub. Others (like some from Bontrager and Zipp) do not have a noticeable flange. The <b>spokes</b> still attach to the edge of the hub but not through visible holes. Other wheels (like those from Velomax/Easton) have a threaded hub shell that the <b>spokes</b> thread into.|$|R
