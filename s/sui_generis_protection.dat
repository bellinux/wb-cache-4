40|$|This Paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of legal protection of databases in USA and EU.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{question in}} the debate about a registration system for geographical indications (GIs) for food products other than wine is whether Australian registered GIs could provide useful protection in important markets such as Japan and China. Those countries have both regional collective trade mark and <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> GI registration options, as do other Asian nations. The GI registers are open to foreign applicants, but only where the application {{is based on a}} domestic registration in the source country. This is an argument in favour of establishing a GI register for food in Australia. The <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> GI <b>protection</b> regimes in China and Japan also offer considerable forensic and substantive advantages compared to trade marks and reliance on unfair competition laws.

50|$|Currently, {{only a few}} nations offer {{explicit}} <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>protection</b> {{for traditional}} knowledge. However, {{a number of countries}} are still undecided as to whether law should give traditional knowledge deference. Indigenous peoples have shown ambivalence about the intellectual property approach. Some have been willing to investigate how existing intellectual property mechanisms (primarily: patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets) can protect traditional knowledge. Others believe that an intellectual property approach may work, but will require more radical and novel forms of intellectual property law ("sui generis rights"). Others believe that the intellectual property system uses concepts and terms that are incompatible with traditional cultural concepts, and favors the commercialization of their traditions, which they generally resist. Many have argued that the form of protection should refer to collective human rights to protect their distinct identities, religions and cultural heritage.|$|E
5000|$|Each new {{technology}} for creative work {{has led to}} debate over what protection should be accorded to such works, {{as has been the}} case most recently for software copyright and database rights. Similar debates occurred over the copyright protection of photographs. The Berne Convention allows a shorter period of protection than for other works (twenty-five years from creation rather than fifty years post mortem auctoris, Art. 7.4), and many countries apply a different period of copyright protection to photographs than to other works. An alternative approach, adopted notably by Germany and Italy, has been to offer full copyright protection to photographs that are clearly [...] "artistic works" [...] and protect all photographs, whatever their creative value, by a shorter sui generis related right. This focuses the debate on those photographs that still have value {{at the end of the}} <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>protection</b> (no-one would bother to try to protect photographs without value), which are the photographs most likely original. However it also means that photographs are subject to a higher test of originality than other works of art, with copyright being reserved only for those the courts felt to be particularly meritous, in contravention of the spirit (if not the letter) of the Berne Convention. The sui generis protections are found at § 72, UrhG for Germany (50 years) and Arts. 87 - 92, Legge 22 aprile 1941 n. 633 for Italy (20 years). The different treatment of photographs and other artistic works was eliminated by European Union Directive 93/98/EEC (Art. 6), which states that the only applicable criterion for copyright protection is that the photograph be [...] "original in the sense that they are the author's own intellectual creation", a lower criterion than used until then, but equivalent to the criterion used for other copyright works. The <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>protection</b> may be retained for photographs that do not meet this criterion (e.g., photographs taken automatically such as for a passport).|$|E

40|$|Economic {{development}} in Sri Lanka has {{relied heavily on}} foreign and domestic investment. Digital databases are a new and attractive area for this investment. This thesis argues that investment needs protection and this is crucial to attract future investment. The thesis therefore proposes a digital database protection mechanism {{with a view to}} attracting investment in digital databases to Sri Lanka. The research examines various existing protection measures whilst mainly focusing on the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> right <b>protection</b> which confirms the protection of qualitative and/or quantitative substantial investment in the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents of digital databases. In digital databases, this process is carried out by computer programs which establish meaningful and useful data patterns through their data mining process, and subsequently use those patterns in Knowledge Discovery within database processes. Those processes enhance the value and/or usefulness of the data/information. Computer programs need to be protected, as this thesis proposes, by virtue of patent protection because the process carried out by computer programs is that of a technical process - an area for which patents are particularly suitable for the purpose of protecting. All intellectual property concepts under the existing mechanisms address the issue of investment in databases in different ways. These include Copyright, Contract, Unfair Competition law and Misappropriation and <b>Sui</b> <b>generis</b> right <b>protection.</b> Since the primary objective of the thesis is to introduce a protection system for encouraging qualitative and quantitative investment in digital databases in Sri Lanka, this thesis suggests a set of mechanisms and rights which comprises of existing intellectual protection mechanisms for databases. The ultimate goal of the proposed protection mechanisms and rights is to improve the laws pertaining to the protection of digital databases in Sri Lanka in order to attract investment, to protect the rights and duties of the digital database users and owners/authors and, eventually, to bring positive economic effects to the country. Since digital database protection is a new concept in the Sri Lankan legal context, this research will provide guidelines for policy-makers, judges and lawyers in Sri Lanka and throughout the South Asian region...|$|R
40|$|The European Database Directive {{introduced}} a new protection regime for database producers in 1996. This was to complement the already existing copyright protection for collections. This new <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> right offers <b>protection</b> to producers who undertake a substantial investment {{in the production of}} a database. Even though it was presented as a unique right without precedent, its scope closely resembles an intellectual property right, while its rationale – preventing misappropriation of another’s investment – is related to the tenet of unfair competition. The <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> right is the main focus of this book. Its most important concepts are extensively discussed, such as the criterion of the substantial investment, the definition of the producer, and the scope of the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> right. For this, a comparative study is made of the literature and case law of the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom. Particular attention is paid to the important judgments which the European Court of Justice delivered on the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> right in November 2004. Furthermore, consideration is given to the (re) introduction of a compulsory licensing regime to ward off information monopolies.

40|$|This {{inquiry is}} {{prompted}} by the unprecedented policy of the European Medicines Agency that enables the disclosure of clinical trial reports submitted for drug marketing authorization, effective as of January 1, 2015. It addresses the question whether such practice is {{in compliance with the}} international standard of clinical data protection under Article 39. 3 of the TRIPS Agreement. Most scholarly and policy debate regarding this provision analyzes whether it precludes the referential use of data to facilitate the approval of a generic drug. Rather than focusing on a particular use, this Article seeks to identify the principle underlying the protection obligation by which the legitimacy of “use X” can be evaluated. In doing so, it interprets the provision from literal, historical and teleological perspectives, and it analyzes a peculiar overlap between three legal regimes: unfair competition, trade secret, and <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> data <b>protection.</b> The proposed principle allows avoidance of situations where, due to the ambiguous notion of unfair commercial use, the protection of data under the TRIPS Agreement can be stretched indefinitely. With regard to data disclosure for experimental use, it is argued that the protection obligation under 39. 3 TRIPS does not justify monopoly type protection of clinical trial data, neither does it require the reservation of experimental use exclusively for the data originator, even if such use can have commercial benefits for competitors...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{one of the}} most {{contentious}} issues in intellectual property has been the question of statutory protection for databases and compilations. A number of factors had converged during the 1990 ’s to place this issue on the policy agenda, including court decisions holding that the factual elements within collections of information are not necessarily covered by copyright laws, 1 the adoption within the European Union of a Directive on the subject, 2 and the continued advances in informational technologies that have made database collections increasingly vulnerable to misappropriation. 3 The efforts of proponents of new, or <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> database <b>protections</b> to enact new legislation in the United States had been unsuccessful in the 104 th, 105 th, 106 th and 108 th Congresses, 4 and an effort to bring database protections within the ambit of the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) system of treaties failed to gain approval at its 1996 diplomatic conference. The continuing efforts of the European Union to place the issue of a new database treaty at the fore of the WIPO agenda through its Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights, has been unsuccessful in the face of growing resistance from developing countries. 5 In the United States, various efforts to mediate the disparate position of the various stakeholders have been largely unsuccessful. 6 This paper presents the drive towards <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> legislation for databases as a case study that exemplifies the expansionary nature of the contemporary intellectual property policy environment. Section I places the problem in context by discussing the strategic importance of databases for the contemporary research enterprise. Focusing on what databases are, how they are used by researchers, how they are becoming increasingly central to the process of scientific research, and how <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> legislation would disrupt these processes helps frame the subsequent discussion of particular legislative proposals. Section II outlines and evaluates the three primary justifications advanced by proponents of <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> database legislation; the need to fill in a perceived gap caused by lack of adequate protection under U. S. copyright law, the need to harmonize U. S. law with the European Union Database Directive, and the increased risks of misappropriation brought about by technological advances. Section III turns to the legislative response in the U. S., describing the database legislation that has been introduced in the 104 th, 105 th, 106 th, and 108 th Congresses, and setting forth the principle arguments raised by proponents and opponents of the measures. Section III also contains a discussion of the draft Database Treaty that had been considered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996. Section IV provides an assessment of the validity of the claims of the proponents of database legislation by placing the database debate in a deeper political and economic context. The conclusion is reached that <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> database legislation would hamper the goals of promoting scientific progress, and that such attempts should be rejected by policymakers...|$|R

The main reasons are temporarily effective capital controls, large bank default risk premia, and capital market imperfections.

This paper, through an examination of the concept of intellectual property and its intersection with culture and heritage, elucidates the nature and scope of indigenous intellectual property rights as represented by traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and genetic resources. This paper, through a review of the interface between indigenous knowledge systems and the intellectual property law regime, illustrates the limitations of conventional intellectual property rights systems i. e. : copyright, patent, trade secrets and trademark in providing adequate recognition and protection for indigenous intellectual property rights. It also posits that the establishment of a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> system of <b>protection</b> offers a plausible solution to the inadequacy of the existing regimes of protection.
