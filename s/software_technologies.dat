25|$|In 2011, Nintendo {{released}} the Nintendo 3DS, {{based upon a}} glasses-free stereoscopic 3D display. In February 2012, Nintendo acquired Mobiclip, a France-based research and development company specialized in highly optimized <b>software</b> <b>technologies</b> such as video compression. The company's name was later changed to Nintendo European Research & Development. During {{the fourth quarter of}} 2012, Nintendo {{released the}} Wii U. It sold slower than expected, despite being the first eighth generation console. By September 2013, however, sales had rebounded. Intending to broaden the 3DS market, Nintendo released 2013's cost-reduced Nintendo 2DS. The 2DS is compatible with but lacks the 3DS's more expensive but cosmetic autostereoscopic 3D feature. Nintendo also released the Wii Mini, a cheaper and non-networked redesign of the Wii.|$|E

40|$|<b>Software</b> <b>technology</b> {{is gaining}} {{prominence}} in national information technology (IT) strategies {{due to its}} huge potential for socioeconomic development, particularly through the support it provides in the productive sectors of the economy, delivery of public services and engagement of citizens. In growing numbers of developing countries, <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> is also being leveraged for income generation from digital services and products. For instance, in recent years, India, Chile, the Philippines, Brazil, China, and Indonesia have emerged as important global players in the offshore software services industry, with India and China standing out as leaders. Cooperation between developing countries (south-south) {{in the area of}} <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> has also been growing; particularly in the application of <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> to agriculture, public administration and governance (e-governance), transportation and the society (knowledge society). The paper presents the current state of <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> in the south and specifically, the maturity of the software industries in China, India, Brazil, and South Africa (CIBS). It establishes profiles of different regions based on the level of education, quality of research and availability of e-infrastructure and e-applications for determining the potential of these regions in terms of growth and competitiveness in the global software industry. Further complementary analysis of country profiles produced country clusters, helping to identify potential collaboration scenarios for advancing software capacity in the south. Finally, the paper discusses how CIBS can pivot regional or inter-regional cooperation in <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> in the south. <b>software</b> <b>technology,</b> <b>software</b> industry, south-south cooperation, China, Brazil, India, South Africa...|$|R

In 2006, more than 3,000 start-ups were created in Israel, a number that is only second to the US. Newsweek Magazine has also named Tel Aviv as one of the world's top ten [...] "Hot High-Tech Cities". In 1998, Tel Aviv was named by Newsweek as one of the ten technologically most influential cities in the world.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCurrently, systematic techniques for assessing macro mechanisms for transferring <b>software</b> engineering <b>technologies</b> are non-existent. This leads to inefficient allocation of research resources and increased risk to <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> intensive programs. Consequently, <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> transition today is an ill-defined and non-repeatable, inefficient process for bringing advanced <b>software</b> engineering <b>technologies</b> to market. This dissertation develops the fundamental elements of an industrial {{model of a}} <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> transition engine. The mechanisms are developed utilizing information theory, communication theory, chaos control theory, and learning curve principles. The combination of those scientifically sound mechanisms provides a basis for assessing, and / or prescribing a portfolio of technologies and the implementing macro infrastructure. This provides the theoretical framework for a practical method for a program manager to establish a high capacity transition channel, which accelerates technology maturation and insertion. Data samples assess the following technologies: <b>software</b> engineering, <b>software</b> <b>technology</b> transfer, Ada, Java, abstract data types, rate monotonic analysis, cost models, software standards, and software work breakdown structures.
