40|$|Abstract. High {{contact stress}} between the vane tips and the cam ring {{is one of}} the main {{obstacles}} to improve the working pressure of a water hydraulic vane pump. A pressure-reducing valve for regulating the bottom pressure of the vanes at the pump <b>suction</b> <b>zone</b> is presented in this paper. Through optimization and simulation, it is found that the throttle structure has great influence on the dynamic performance of the pressure-reducing valve, and the triangular-rectangular groove is proved to be more suitable for the valve among all the investigated grooves. The theoretical analysis results show that the use of the pressure reducing valve can obviously reduce the contact forces between the cam ring and the vanes at the <b>suction</b> <b>zone</b> of the pump. The work in this research provides a feasible solution to improve the working pressure of a water hydraulic vane pump...|$|E

Analytical, experimental and computational investigations of EM Flow Control are presented here. This work is intended to understand the basic mechanisms involved in turbulence intensity and skin friction reductions as well as in coherent structure extinction. First, EM actuator and its modes of action are described. This description includes: some general remarks on EM actuator; the set of equations suitable to EM control in seawater; and a selection of dimensionless parameters analysed in term of possible mechanisms of action. Second, some experimental investigations and visualizations of wall bounded flows under EM actuation are presented: near wall vortex around the actuator; <b>suction</b> <b>zone</b> above the actuator; wall jets around the actuator; boundary layers “suction- blowing”. ...|$|E
40|$|Cutting {{heads are}} core {{components}} of abrasive {{water jet cutting}} plants which dramatically affect the achievable cutting performance. Therefore, investigating their characteristics to achieve an efficient design is fundamental to improve the AWJ technology. In this study, computational fluid dynamics models for ultrahigh velocity waterjets and abrasive waterjets are established using ANSYS FLUENT® software. Jet flow dynamic characteristics inside a cutting head are simulated under unsteady state, turbulent, two-phase and three-phase flow conditions. Water and particles velocities are obtained under different operating conditions to provide an insight into the jet characteristics and study the effect of cutting head geometry. The comparison with experimental data shows {{the accuracy of the}} numerical simulations in predicting cutting head performance, as well as revealing the effect of operating conditions. Moreover, the fact that results obtained with two different geometrical models (2 D-axisymmetric and 3 D) are similar reveals that the flow pattern does not depend much on the position of the abrasive and air <b>suction</b> <b>zone.</b> This investigation aids the understanding of the flow inside the AWJ cutting head and provides information for designing this component to suit optimum performances...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{flow field}} around a {{low-rise}} building model with 45 º pitched gable roof having different eave types {{has been investigated}} experimentally in order to search the wind loads that can damage the building roofs.   The experiments were carried out in an atmospheric boundary layer that is modeled in the wind tunnel. Atmospheric boundary layer was simulated with combination of barrier, elliptic vortex generators and elements of roughness and a 150 mm height boundary layer was formed at 15 m/s wind velocity. The mean and fluctuating surface pressures were measured on the roofs having different eave types in detail for various wind directions to observe critical <b>suction</b> <b>zones</b> on the roof surfaces.

However, hydrological benefits provided byplant-induced suction through transpiration are often overlooked. The objective {{of this study is}} to measure and identify any <b>suction</b> influence <b>zone</b> induced by bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) in completely decomposed granite (CDG; silty sand) in laboratory. The CDG was compacted in a rectangular test box at a degree of compaction of 80 % and the grass was allowed to germinate on the soil surface. The test box was instrumented with heat dissipation matric water potential sensors, which allow matric suction up to 350 kPa to be measured indirectly. The setup was placed in a plant room, where atmospheric conditions such as temperature, solar energy and relative humidity were controlled and measured. For comparison purposes, a control experiment (without vegetation), which has an identical experimental setup, was performed. Variations of matric suction between the vegetated and bare specimens were measured and compared. Any grass-induced <b>suction</b> influence <b>zone</b> was identified, in terms of magnitude and distribution...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present the {{application}} of time-lapse non invasive 3 D micro-electrical tomography (ERT) to monitor soil-plant interactions in the root zone. The goal {{of the study is}} to better understand the soil-vegetation interactions by the use of non invasive technique, and how this dynamical process can be monitored by time lapse geophysical measurements to explain water balance exchanges in the upper subsoil critical zone. We designed, built and installed a 3 D electrical tomography apparatus for the monitoring of the root zone of a single apple tree in an orchard located in the Trentino region, Northern Italy. The micro-ERT apparatus consists of 48 buried electrodes on 4 instrumented micro boreholes plus 24 mini-electrodes on the ground surface. We collected repeated ERT and TDR soil moisture measurements for about one year and performed three different controlled irrigation tests: one during a very dry summer and, during a highly dynamic plant growing spring period and one during a very wet autumn period. We also performed laboratory analysis on soil specimens, in order to evaluate the electrical response at different saturation steps. The results demonstrate that 3 D micro-ERT is able to characterize subsoil conditions and monitor root zone activities, especially in terms of root <b>zone</b> <b>suction</b> regions. In particular, we note that in very dry conditions, 3 D micro ERT is able to image water plumes on the shall subsoil produced using a drip irrigation system. In the very dynamic growing season, under induced widespread irrigation, micro 3 D ERT can detect the main <b>suction</b> <b>zones</b> caused by the tree root activity. Complex interactions between soil moisture and pore water salinity complicate the interpretation. The presented approach is a very promising tool for a better understanding of hydrological interactions in the shallow subsoil, and for the quantification of the soil-plant-atmosphere mass exchanges...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} corroborated that rewetting occurs after suction boxes and couch rolls. A certain amount of water is left in the forming fabric after the <b>suction</b> <b>zone,</b> resulting in external rewetting which decreases the dry content of the web with 3 - 5 % - units. In the present work different super absorbents with high absorption capacity were used with the intension to absorb the water left in the forming fabric after a suction pulse before it flowed back into the web. First the possibility of reducing rewetting was investigated in laboratory scale. A super absorbent was placed underneath the forming fabric and the web in a laboratory suction box during a suction pulse. A number of different absorbents were tested and several of them did significantly reduce the rewetting of the web. In some trials the reached dry content did not decrease at all after the suction pulse. Second the idea was verified in pilot scale. The rewetting was unfortunately not reduced in the same extent in the pilot trials as in the laboratory trials. But with the proposed justifications of the method it could be proved to work in also pilot scale. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Landslides {{are between}} the main hazards of the {{environment}} and the natural disasters. The losses in money and human lives due to the occurred landslides are of significant number. Rainfall-induced landslides are common phenomena, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas. The impact of rainfall is more important in slopes which are formed by unsaturated soils. The distinction between saturated and unsaturated soils is important in many aspects of the engineering science. The most important difference between those two is a zone of negative pore water pressure that appears in unsaturated soils. This is called “suction zone ” and is responsible for an increase on the shear strength of the soil. During and after rainfall events the water table rises and water infiltrates through the soil, so the <b>suction</b> <b>zone</b> tends to disappear. Pore water pressures, in these cases, become positive and the resistance of the slope in failure decreases significantly. In this paper, a description of the landslide process due to rainfall is been made. Also, a methodology for the examination of the effect of rainfall in unsaturated soils is been proposed. An area in Greece has been selected in order to apply the methodology. The Combined Hydrology And Stability Model (CHASM) has been used for the analysis, while GIS have offered significant help for the evaluation of the particular area...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{provides}} an optimal control strategy, {{based on the}} nonlinear Navier–Stokes equations, aimed at hampering {{the rapid growth of}} unsteady finite-amplitude perturbations in a Blasius boundary-layer flow. A variational procedure is used to find the blowing and suction control law at the wall providing the maximum damping of the energy of a given perturbation at a given target time, with the final aim of leading the flow back to the laminar state. Two optimally growing finite-amplitude initial perturbations capable of leading very rapidly to transition have been used to initialize the flow. The nonlinear control procedure has been found able to drive such perturbations back to the laminar state, provided that the target time of the minimization and the region in which the blowing and suction is applied have been suitably chosen. On the other hand, an equivalent control procedure based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations has been found much less effective, being not able to lead the flow to the laminar state when finite-amplitude disturbances are considered. Regions of strong sensitivity to blowing and suction have been also identified for the given initial perturbations: when the control is actuated in such regions, laminarization is also observed for a shorter extent of the actuation region. The nonlinear optimal blowing and suction law consists of alternating wall-normal velocity perturbations, which appear to modify the core flow structures by means of two distinct mechanisms: (i) a wall-normal velocity compensation at small times; (ii) a rotation-counterbalancing effect al larger times. Similar control laws have been observed for different target times, values of the cost parameter, and streamwise extents of the blowing and <b>suction</b> <b>zone,</b> meaning that these two mechanisms are robust features of the optimal control strategy, provided that the nonlinear effects are taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Evapotranspiration from a grass-covered {{ground is}} known to induce suction by soil {{evaporation}} and grass transpiration. However, grass-induced suction in the ground when it is subjected to wetting and drying are not yet well understood. In this study, a laboratory test program was conducted to investigate the magnitude and distribution of suction induced by Bermuda grass growing in silty sand. In total, four test boxes compacted with silty sand were prepared, three of which covered with Bermuda grass while one test box was left bare as control. All the four test boxes were subjected to wetting and drying in a plant room with temperature and humidity controlled. Under identical atmospheric conditions and initial soil density and water content, peak suction induced within the root zone in grassed soil was 1. 5 times higher than that in bare soil after 20 days of drying. A vertical <b>suction</b> influence <b>zone</b> was identified {{to be up to}} four times the root depth while the lateral <b>suction</b> influence <b>zone</b> was one diameter of ring collar away from the centre of the plot. Upon wetting, suction retained at depth right below the root zone in grassed soil was found to be 40 % higher than that in bare soil. For three grass replicates that were germinated under identical atmospheric conditions, they produced different shoot lengths and induced different magnitudes of suction. No direct correlation between grass shoot length and grass-induced suction could be found. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

To {{review the}} literature {{to establish the}} factors which have traditionally been regarded as most crucial {{to the design of}} effectlve exhaust ventilation systems. 2. To design, construct, install and calibrate a wind tunnel. 3. To develop procedures for air velocity measurement followed by a comprehensive programme of aerodvnamic data collection and data analysis for a variety of conditions. The major research findings were:- a) The literature in the subject is inadequate. There is a particular need for a much greater understanding of the aerodynamics of the suction flow field. b) The discrepancies between the experimentally observed centre-line velocities and those predicted by conventional formulae are unacceptably large. c) There was little agreement between theoretically calculated and observed velocities in the <b>suction</b> <b>zone</b> of captor hoods. d) Improved empirical formulae for the prediction of centre-line velocity applicable to the classical geometrically shaped suction openings and the flanged condition could be (and were) derived. Further analysis of data revealed that: - i) Point velocity is directly proportional to the suction. flow rate and the ratio of the point velocity to the average face velocity is constant. ii) Both shape, and size of the suction opening are significant factors as the coordinates of their points govern the extent of the effect of the suction flow field. iii) The hypothetical ellipsoidal potential function and hyperbolic streamlines were found experimentally to be correct. iv) The effect of guide plates depends on the size, shape and the angle of fitting. The effect was to very approximately double the suction velocity but the exact effect is difficult to predict. v) The axially symmetric openings produce practically symmetric flow fields. Similarity of connection pieces between the suction opening and the main duct in each case is essential in order to induce a similar suction flow field. Additionally a pilot study was made in which an artificial extraneous air flow was created, measured and its interaction with the suction flow field measured and represented graphically...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{negative}} pore water pressure or matric <b>suction</b> in the <b>zone</b> above the ground water level in silty loess soil, which can be as deep as 5 - 10 m in the Belgrade area. This primary characteristic of unsaturated soil, i. e., matric suction, {{should be included in}} laboratory testing and geotechnical analyses. Direct shear or triaxial testing of unsaturated soil are very expensive and time-consuming and require specially modified equipment. Instead, the prediction of unsaturated shear strength using the soil water characteristic curve, SWCC, and the effective shear strength parameters c' and φ' is a widely accepted practice. In this study, constitutive soil-water characteristic curves were obtained from the results of experimental testing by draining saturated soil samples under different pressures. This testing was performed {{for the first time in}} Serbia in a 15 bar pressure plate extractor according to ASTM standards. The laboratory testing included natural samples of loess sediments with the original macroporous structure and loess sediments with a destroyed soil structure.

A theoretical model previously {{developed by the}} authors for the rate of tree root water uptake together with an associated numerical simulation is used to {{study the effects of}} a wide range of soil, tree, and atmospheric parameters on partially saturated ground. The influence of different parameters on the maximum initial rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. Field measurements taken from previously published literature are compared with numerical predictions for validation. The rate of selected parameters such as potential transpiration and its distribution, suction at wilting point, the coefficient of permeability and the distribution of root length density are studied in detail. The analysis shows that the rate of potential transpiration increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, while the potential transpiration rate has an insignificant effect on the distribution of soil suction. Root density distribution factors affect the size of the influence <b>zone.</b> <b>Suction</b> at the wilting point increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, whereas the saturation permeability decreases the maximum soil matric suction generated.

40|$|It is {{conventionally}} assumed in {{the analysis}} and design of earth dams that the soil located above the phreatic line, i. e. the uppermost seepage flow line, is completely dry. However, there is often an unsaturated flow of water through an unsaturated zone above this borderline and variation in moisture content in this zone results in variation of matric suction throughout this region. Variation of matric suction, in turn, results in variation of effective stresses in this zone. In this research, the seismic response of earth dams {{in terms of the}} displacement and acceleration at the crown of the dam as well as the stress distribution in the dam body is investigated. Taking into account the effect of unsaturated zone, a comparison is made to investigate the effect of conventional simplification in ignoring the dynamic characteristics of the unsaturated zone above the phreatic line and the more complicated analysis which includes the unsaturated zone. A function for the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) was assigned to the soil in the unsaturated zone to determine the variation of matric <b>suction</b> in this <b>zone</b> and analyses were made using finite difference software (FLAC). Results are then compared to the conventional method for homogeneous dams. In these analyzes the soil shear modulus was assumed to vary with the mean effective stress both for saturated and unsaturated zones. Among various results, it was notable that the history of crest x-displacement, and acceleration show higher values in models accounting for the unsaturated region. It was attributed to the considerably lower values of damping ratio in the crest region in the unsaturated models...|$|R
40|$|The state-of-art {{technical}} devices - {{from the}} aircraft and missile equipment to mobile machines in sphere of construction and agriculture -widely use hydraulic drives based on adjustable axial-piston hydraulic machines. During operation of such hydraulic drives, pressure fluctuations and power fluid flow rate occur, and {{it results in}} vibrations of hydraulic machine housing and its components and acoustic radiation of units. Such processes arise from the wave transients that may appear when a mode of operation is changed, or are available when the hydraulic machine separate units are in operation. Origination specificities of these processes and their development are not well studied. So implementation of such hydraulic machines in hydraulic drives of equipment {{with a wide variety}} of dynamic loads requires additional experimental and theoretical investigations. The objectives of this paper is to develop a hydraulic drive model based on adjustable axial-piston hydraulic machines and to investigate transients that are available in the operational cycle of a hydraulic drive. To study transients a method of mathematical modeling was used. For hydraulic drive mechanism with rotational displacement, a model with lumped parameters was developed. The model takes into consideration the kinematic and physical features of hydraulic drive components structure, peripheral devices and physical and mechanical properties of power fluid, thereby partially solving the task of investigating transients. There is no possibility to describe all aspects of transients within the framework of a mathematical model with lumped parameters. Difficulties spring up when modeling the wave processes that occur at transient of pumping unit hydraulic cylinders between the <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>zones.</b> For modeling the power fluid transient from pumping unit into discharge line, was developed a two-dimensional turbulent model with distributed parameters.
