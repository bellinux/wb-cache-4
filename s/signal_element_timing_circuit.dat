40|$|Abstract—Negative-bias {{temperature}} instability (NBTI) and positive-bias {{temperature instability}} (PBTI) weaken PFET and NFET over {{the lifetime of}} usage, leading to performance and reliability degradation of nanoscale CMOS SRAM. In addition, most of the state-of-the-art SRAM designs employ replica <b>timing</b> control <b>circuit</b> to mitigate the effects of leakage and process vari-ation, optimize the performance, and reduce power consumption. NBTI and PBTI also degrade the <b>timing</b> control <b>circuits</b> and may render them ineffective. In this paper, we provide comprehensive analyses on the impacts of NBTI and PBTI on a two-port 8 T SRAM design, including the stability and Write margin of the cell, Read/Write access paths, and replica <b>timing</b> control <b>circuits.</b> We show, for the first time, that because the Read/Write replica <b>timing</b> control <b>circuits</b> are activated in every Read/Write cycle, they exhibit distinctively different degradation behavior from the normal array access paths, resulting in degradation of timing control and performance.
