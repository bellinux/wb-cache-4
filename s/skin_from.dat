5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> the tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, though there is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect}} it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} retinoic acid {{in the skin}} may {{contribute}} to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E

5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson {{proclaimed the}} red-eared cat {{commonly}} found in Nepal to be a lynx and therefore named it Lynchus erythrotus; Ceylonese naturalist Edward Frederick Kelaart described the first jungle cat <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> Sri Lanka in 1852 and stressed upon its close resemblance to Hodgson's red cat. William Thomas Blanford pointed out the lynx-like appearance of cat skins and skulls from the plains around Yarkant County and Kashgar when he described Felis shawiana in 1876.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} Mexico as importer, manufacturer, producer and distributor centre of reptile <b>skins</b> <b>from</b> non-native and native species, {{through a combination of}} documentary research and survey methods. A number of key findings were derived from this study. Although Mexico has adopted the "System for the Conservation, Management and Sustainable Use of Wildlife" (SUMA), the country still relies on reptile <b>skins</b> <b>from</b> non-native species. In contrast, the smaller numbers of <b>skins</b> used <b>from</b> native species mainly derive from captive breeding schemes that although biologically sustainable, provide no incentive for habitat conservation. Sustainable use of reptile <b>skins</b> <b>from</b> native species could positively encourage conservation in Mexico. However, as a megadiverse country with potential to produce wildlife, Mexico will have to implement an appropriate regulatory framework to support local communities to promote the sustainable use of native species. ...|$|R

5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} safe room and finds a colored number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. <b>Skin</b> <b>from</b> a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Skins</b> <b>from</b> dry and hot-climate {{areas and}} poorly fed goats are {{preferred}} for djembes {{because of their}} low fat content. <b>Skins</b> <b>from</b> cold-climate goats with high-value nutrition have {{more than double the}} fat content; they tend to sound dull and lifeless in comparison. Even though the fat content of male goats is lower than that of female goats, many players prefer female skins because they do not smell as strongly and are reputed to be softer.|$|R

25|$|In either case, in {{contrast}} to the carapace of a tortoise or the cranium of a vertebrate, the exoskeleton has little ability to grow or change its form once it has matured.

25|$|Researchers at the University of Utah in 2004 {{found that}} human skin {{contains}} photoreceptors {{like those in}} the retina, allowing it to mount an immediate defence against damaging ultraviolet radiations.

25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the <b>skin</b> <b>from</b> underlying tissues.
