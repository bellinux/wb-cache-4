5|$|The King {{sought a}} divorce, but his advisors {{suggested}} that any divorce proceedings might involve {{the publication of}} details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured {{the introduction of the}} Pains and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|September through October is the malaria season, {{which may}} complicate efforts to treat Ebola. For example, one Freetown doctor did not {{immediately}} quarantine herself because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> malaria not Ebola. The doctor was eventually diagnosed with Ebola and died in September 2014.|$|E

25|$|Sabatini {{said that}} she {{deliberately}} lost matches in her youth to avoid reporters and the limelight. She made this claim when she was 43, saying her shyness was a major problem, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to speak after winning a tournament; so, she often lost in semifinals.|$|E
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been {{contaminated}} at the plant. Kerr-McGee's management {{said that}} Silkwood had contaminated herself {{in order to}} portray the company in a negative light. According to Richard L. Rashke's book, The Killing of Karen Silkwood (1981/2000), security at the plant was so lax that workers could easily smuggle out finished plutonium pellets. Rashke wrote that the soluble type of plutonium found in Silkwood's body came from a production area which she had not accessed for four months. The pellets had since been stored in the vault of the facility.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} on July 12, 1955, shortly before her 11th birthday, Muir was {{admitted}} into the institution {{solely on the}} basis of information provided by her mother, without any diagnostic testing. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been sent to an orphanage. Under superintendent Leonard Jan Le Vann, a precondition for admission into the Provincial Training School was a signature from Muir's mother permitting the legal enforcement of compulsory sterilization. Over the years, Muir was educated to a grade 5 level and saw her mother only intermittently until her departure from the institution at the age of 20.|$|E

500|$|Lycett Green was {{followed}} into the witness box by his wife, and her testimony {{ran into the}} following day. Under questioning she confirmed that she had seldom played baccarat before; although she had seen nothing untoward on the first night, she accepted her husband's second-hand version of events as the truth, but did not agree {{that as a result}} she had been watching Gordon-Cumming. Although she [...] "gave {{the most important part of}} her evidence with clarity and conviction", and had impressed the public and press, according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, she provided a different series of events to those outlined by other witnesses, although she stated that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen Gordon-Cumming illicitly add to his stake.|$|E
500|$|At the time, de Boer {{was busy}} working in Canada but was unknown {{as an actress}} in the United States. She was called to Los Angeles to {{audition}} in person based {{on the strength of}} the tape, where she performed a four and a half minute scene written specifically for the audition. It was later converted into a scene used in the episode [...] "". <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ruined her audition when she nearly choked on a glass of water as executive producer Rick Berman entered the room and had to run to the bathroom, by which time she had already soaked her clothes and caused her mascara to run. But Behr praised her, saying [...] "We got a good vibe off her, she knew her part. She got it. And that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Head writer Maria Arena Bell {{dedicated}} the 4th of July episode to Sharon, {{stating that}} the episode would [...] "shed more light on Sharon and all the factors that caused her {{to be in this}} situation, why she's acted the way she has and why she's gone into the pit of [...] self-esteem." [...] Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the [...] "unforgivable things" [...] she has done (especially her devious move of letting them believe she was dead). Jones further said: [...] "Some will say she did what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do. Even though it seemed as if it was easy, it's never that easy {{to walk away from the}} people you love".|$|E
60|$|Penelope gave {{herself up}} as lost. There was nothing now {{for her to}} do but to submit to her fate. It was a pity, <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not been slain with her husband.|$|R
50|$|In the Ultimate Universe, Jean Grey {{was placed}} in a mental {{institute}} after she began hearing voices and seeing visions of an omnipotent Phoenix God. After her release, <b>she</b> later <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> contacted a celestial God-entity which destroyed worlds.|$|R

500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1975 interview, Welch said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "good" [...] in Kansas City Bomber, Myra Breckenridge and The Last of Sheila [...] "but {{being good}} in a bad movie doesn't do {{anything}} for your career." ...|$|E
2500|$|One role Lake {{really liked}} was Hold That Blonde (1945), {{supporting}} Eddie Bracken (in a part {{turned down by}} Bob Hope). [...] "It's a comedy, rather like what Carole Lombard used to do ... It represents a real change of pace". <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a good part in The Blue Dahlia.|$|E

6000|$|Statira said, [...] "What a shame!" [...] She {{said there}} were some Barkers over East Willoughby way; and she confessed that when he said his name was Barker, and he was from Willoughby Pastures, {{that night in the}} station, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> should <b>have</b> gone through the floor.|$|R
60|$|As to Mrs. Gummidge, he roused that {{victim of}} despondency with a success never {{attained}} by anyone else (so Mr. Peggotty informed me), since the decease {{of the old}} one. He left her so little leisure for being miserable, that she said next day <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> must <b>have</b> been bewitched.|$|R
2500|$|There {{is a major}} debate {{concerning}} the Russian Gymnast Anna Pavlova. Her first vault scored a 15.625, placing her well in medal contention.

[...] She was given a 0 on her second vault.|$|E
2500|$|General Manager of {{his family}} {{bathroom}} fixture business Hao Sheng [...] Cold and hot tempered, all of his employees are terrified of him. He does {{not like to be}} deceived or lied to by others because he was betrayed by his former employees when he took over his family business. He cares deeply {{of his family}} and is very protective of them. He has been in love with Yang Yi-ru since meeting her in college and searching for her ever since. For anyone that crosses him he makes sure there is payback, even if it's the girl he loves. After his misunderstanding is cleared with Yi-ru, he tries hard to change his cold-hearted attitude to win her love. He eventually convinces Yi-ru that his love for her is sincere and they get married for real when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> almost lost him during an accident.|$|E
2500|$|She {{hated her}} Jewish {{background}} and was convinced it had poisoned her life. For {{much of her}} adult life she was what would later be called self-hating. Her overriding desire was to free herself from the shackles of her birth; since, as <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "pushed out of the world" [...] by her origins, {{she was determined to}} escape them. She never really succeeded. In 1810, she changed her family name to Robert... And in 1814, after her mother died, she converted. But her origins continued to haunt her even on her deathbed. ... She considered her origins [...] "a curse, a slow bleeding to death." ... The idea that as a Jew she was always required to be exceptional—and go on proving it all the time—was repugnant to her. [...] "How wretched it is always to have to legitimize myself! That is why it is so disgusting to be a Jew." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{mother did}} not suffer her {{authority}} to pass from her without a shadow of protest.

6000|$|After {{recording}} {{that last}} fact, it is unnecessary {{to explain what}} was the matter with Christie. <b>She</b> honestly <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> got religion; but it was piety's twin-sister, who produced this wonderful revival in her soul; and though she began in all good faith she presently discovered that she was ...|$|R
60|$|Mary reflected, but {{the only}} repartee that she could conjure at the moment was {{something}} about ancient lights which did not seem appropriate. Therefore, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done enough for honour, and to remind her awe-inspiring relative {{that he could not}} suppress her, suddenly she changed the subject.|$|R
2500|$|World War II shocked {{her into}} a more {{conventional}} belief: [...] "I believe if {{people are looking for}} the truth, the truth of the Christian religion will come out and meet them." [...] And in the early 1950s, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: [...] "I could not go on with being a Catholic... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation." [...] Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: [...] "The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Magical Girl Mii" [...] {{was used}} in the anime, though its origins were changed. In the anime it was a {{specialized}} cosplay costume she had created to mimic a magical girl television show which cost a lot of money, but Ai seemed easily able to pay for it. That episode she met a chronically ill girl named Miyuki and attempted to cheer up. After this, she wears it around and pretends to help stop evil and believes she has superpowers. Later during the episode, Miyuki collapsed from overexertion playing with Mii. Mii tried to use powers <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to heal her. The attempt was successful, and Ai revealed to the viewers that Mii's special power was healing. However, Mii remains unaware of this for {{a good portion of the}} season, and continues to believe that she has other powers as well. After the episode, Mii continues to cosplay in the outfit with the same type of antics. Mii is voiced by Toromi in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Momoi Haruko and in English by Jocelyne Loewen.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, Bakari {{released}} {{an account of}} her ordeal in a French memoir, [...] "Moi Bahia, la miraculée" [...] ("I'm Bahia, the miracle girl"), published by Jean-Claude Gawsewitch Éditeur in Paris, France. In the book, co-authored with French journalist Omar Guendouz as ghostwriter, Bakari provides details about her survival and rescue. She discloses that immediately after the crash, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fallen out of the airplane by pressing her forehead too hard against the window, and that her motherwho she believed had landed safely without herwould scold her for not wearing her seat belt. Then, floating on debris {{in the midst of}} a jet fuel slick released from the aircraft's burst fuel tanks, she recalls having [...] "...this taste of fuel in my mouth, mixed with salt, which burned my throat, my lungs and my stomach." [...] Bakari writes that she only realized her plane had crashed and that she was the sole survivor when she was in the hospital, believing until then that she had simply fallen out into the ocean. AOL News reports that Steven Spielberg approached Bakari to make a film based on her book, but she turned him down, worried that [...] "it would be too terrifying." ...|$|E
