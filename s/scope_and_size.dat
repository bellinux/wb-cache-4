5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E

As the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of the fleet increased so did the rig of the vessels change, as brigs, schooners, and finally ships and barks were introduced.

25|$|Finance {{remained}} the dominant {{influence on the}} production of the volumes, rather than literary or academic concerns about the work of the Historical Section. The subcommittee met six times in 1923 and on 9 August, Hankey managed to obtain a permanent Cabinet Subcommittee of Control of the Official Histories, chaired by the President of the Board of Education and meeting annually. There were twelve meetings between 1924 and 1946, with representatives from the Treasury, War Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry and the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Daniel and Edmonds usually attended; other official historians and members of the Colonial and India offices were present for particular discussions; where the committee failed to agree, a ruling was made by the Cabinet. Edmonds submitted an annual report, other historians added summaries of their work, progress reports, staff and personnel matters and publications by foreign official historians. Meetings considered costs and the progress of publication, the number of volumes, their <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>size.</b> On rare occasions the committee made a ruling on content, after complaints by a department; in 1928, the War Office strenuously objected to some of the content of the first Gallipoli volume by C.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} challenges of <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> components <b>and</b> modeling the tank to wheel energy flows in new and rapidly evolving classes of automotive vehicles. It introduces a system of computer models, known as the Oxford Vehicle Model (OVEM), which provide for the novel simulation of the powertrains of electric (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). OVEM has a three-level structure that makes a unique contribution {{to the field of}} vehicle analysis by enabling a user to proceed from performing <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> exercises through to accurately simulating the energy flows in powertrains of EVs and HEVs utilizing existing and emerging technologies based on real world data. Level 1 uses simplified models to support initial component <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> exercises in an analysis environment where uncertainty regarding component specifications is high. Level 2 builds on Level 1 by obtaining more refined component <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> estimates via the use of component models based on well-understood scientific principles that are product-independent – a crucial feature for obtaining unbiased <b>scoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> estimates. Level 3 employs a high degree of fidelity in that its models impose actual physical limits and are based on data from real technologies. This dissertation concludes with two chapters based on studies published as journal articles that used OVEM to address key issues facing the development of EVs and HEVs. The first study used OVEM to make the novel comparison between high-speed flywheels, batteries, and ultracapacitors on the bases of cost and fuel consumption while functioning as the energy storage systems in an HEV. The second study applied OVEM towards a novel examination of the CO 2 emissions from plug-in HEVs (PHEVs) and compares their CO 2 emissions to those from similar EVs and ICE-based vehicles.

500|$|American sperm whaling soon {{spread from}} {{the east coast of}} the American colonies to the Gulf Stream, the Grand Banks, West Africa (1763), the Azores (1765), and the South Atlantic (1770s). From 1770 to 1775 Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ports {{produced}} 45,000 barrels of sperm oil annually, compared to 8,500 of whale oil. In the same decade, the British began sperm whaling, employing American ships and personnel. By the following decade, the French had entered the trade, also employing American expertise. Sperm whaling increased until the mid-nineteenth century. Spermaceti oil was important in public lighting (for example, in lighthouses, where it was used in the United States until 1862, when it was replaced by lard oil, in turn replaced by petroleum) and for lubricating the machines (such as those used in cotton mills) of the Industrial Revolution. Sperm whaling declined {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century, as petroleum came into broader use. In that sense, petroleum use may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation. Sperm whaling in the eighteenth century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats. The fleet's <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> increased over time, and larger ships entered the fishery. In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century sperm whaling ships sailed to the equatorial Pacific, the Indian Ocean, Japan, the coast of Arabia, Australia and New Zealand. Hunting could be dangerous to the crew, since sperm whales (especially bulls) will readily fight to defend themselves against attack, unlike most baleen whales. When dealing with a threat, sperm whales will use their huge head effectively as a battering ram. Arguably the most famous sperm whale counter-attack occurred on 20 November 1820, when a whale claimed to be about [...] long rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship Essex. Only 8 out of 21 sailors survived to be rescued by other ships. This instance is popularly believed to have inspired Herman Melville's famous book Moby-Dick.|$|E

Building a {{probabilistic}} {{network for}} a real-life domain of application {{is a hard}} and time-consuming process, which is generally performed {{with the help of}} domain experts. As the <b>scope</b> <b>and,</b> hence, the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity of networks are increasing, the need for proper documentation of the elicited domain knowledge becomes apparent. To study the usefulness of ontologies for this purpose, we constructed an ontology for the domain of oesophageal cancer, based upon a real-life probabilistic network for the staging of cancer of the oesophagus and the knowledge elicited for its construction. In this paper, we describe the various components of our ontology and outline the benefits of using ontologies in engineering probabilistic networks. ...|$|R

2500|$|Although the Yongle Emperor ordered {{episodes of}} bloody purges like his father—including the {{execution}} of Fang Xiaoru, who refused to draft the proclamation of his succession—the emperor had a different attitude about the scholar-officials. He had a selection of texts compiled from the Cheng-Zhu school of Confucianism—or Neo-Confucianism—in order to assist those who studied for the civil service examinations. The Yongle Emperor commissioned two thousand scholars to create a 50-million-word (22,938-chapter) long encyclopedia—the Yongle Encyclopedia—from seven thousand books. This surpassed all previous encyclopedias in <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>size,</b> including the 11th-century compilation of the Four Great Books of Song.
