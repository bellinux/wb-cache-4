50|$|Starting in the 1960 model year, Chrysler built {{all their}} {{passenger}} cars with Unibody (unit-body or monocoque) construction, except the Imperials which retained body-on-frame construction until 1967.

This construction technique, now the worldwide standard, offers advantages in vehicle rigidity, handling, and crash safety, while reducing <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> development as the vehicle ages. Chrysler's contributions to the technology included the first use of computers to design unit-body cars, and the first setup where exterior sheet metal was not required for structural strength, making sheet metal replacement easier.|$|E

50|$|A 4-poster or four poster {{automotive}} {{test system}} is {{specifically designed for}} the testing of vehicles (cars, trucks). These test systems consist of 4 hydraulic actuators on top of which {{the wheels of the}} vehicle are placed. Movements of the actuators simulate the road surface and forces exerted by the road on the wheels. The movements of the system are tightly controlled by a digital test controller. During the research phase of a vehicle a 4-poster system is used to test newly designed suspension systems and their durability. In production 4-poster systems are usually used to test every vehicle {{at the end of the}} production line on <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle,</b> which is a check to make sure the vehicle doesn't have any loose parts. Different kinds of testing are possible: sine test (sweep in frequency); simple wave form on each actuator; open loop test (driven by an external tension signal); a particular testing method called ICS control, which allows to reproduce on a car an actual service environment, starting from those data coming from the outdoor acquisition sessions.|$|E
50|$|Safety {{engineering}}: Safety {{engineering is}} {{the assessment of}} various crash scenarios {{and their impact on}} the vehicle occupants. These are tested against very stringent governmental regulations. Some of these requirements include: seat belt and air bag functionality testing, front and side impact testing, and tests of rollover resistance. Assessments are done with various methods and tools, including Computer crash simulation (typically finite element analysis), crash test dummies, and partial system sled and full vehicle crashes.Fuel economy/emissions: Fuel economy is the measured fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon or kilometers per liter. Emissions testing includes the measurement of vehicle emissions, including hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and evaporative emissions.NVH engineering (noise, vibration, and harshness): NVH is the customer's feedback (both tactile felt and audible heard) from the vehicle. While sound can be interpreted as a rattle, squeal, or hot, a tactile response can be seat vibration or a buzz in the steering wheel. This feedback is generated by components either rubbing, vibrating, or rotating. NVH response can be classified in various ways: powertrain NVH, road noise, wind noise, component noise, and <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle.</b> Note, there are both good and bad NVH qualities. The NVH engineer works to either eliminate bad NVH or change the “bad NVH” too good (i.e., exhaust tones).|$|E
40|$|<b>Squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> is a {{cause of}} high {{warranty}} costs and a driver behind the production of pre-series cars for subjective evaluation. An important feature for a premium car brand is a high perceived quality and consequently the lack of <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> issues. To bring down development time and cost while still increasing the <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> capabilities, the automotive industry is now striving towards better models for virtual evaluation of <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle.</b> This master’s thesis is a step toward virtual rattle evaluations at Volvo Car Corporation. A test rig for rattle measurement was successfully designed, built, tested and evaluated. An objective rattle metric, based on psychoacoustics theory, was evaluated by comparison of subjective clinical trial results of rattle produced by the test rig. Some features, such as temperature dependency, could be verified through the virtual evaluation of rattle with the objective metric while other features could not, judging from comparisons with the subjective data. The overall congruence between subjective and objective evaluation was inconsistent. More work is needed before any model for virtual evaluation {{can be used in}} the development of new car models. However, all hypotheses set out by the group were confirmed, if considering the mean value trends, both by the objective metric and the subjective listening clinical trials if studying the results of these independently. This means that both of the evaluation methods work well by itself but that the connection between them is yet to be established.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} fact that the thermo-mechanical {{behaviors}} of polymeric materials are strongly influenced by environmental factors, and, for automobiles, the mechanical properties of interior plastic structures are noticeably changed by being repeatedly exposed to environments such as sun light and rains.

To consider Buzz, <b>Squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rattle</b> (BSR) from initial stage of the interior design, {{it is very important}} to obtain, analyze and understand the structural behaviors of the materials under environmental changes as well as time. In this report, the mechanical property changes of the plastics for automobiles are measured to investigate the temperature and humidity effects.

40|$|In {{the world}} of BSR (Buzz, <b>Squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rattle)</b> testing, {{there is a high}} level of sophistication {{regarding}} the test machines employed to excite the items under test as well as the techniques used to ensure that the test is representative of real-life operating conditions.

40|$|The {{noise and}} {{vibration}} of a poor automotive seat aggravate the interior cabin noise and discomfort.

The characterization of seat structural dynamics behavior in early design phase assists to effectively improve the NVH quality of the seat. The seat nonlinear buzz, <b>squeak,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> (BSR) noise are the major issues which are directly linked to the NVH quality of the vehicle.

Three modifications are proposed to optimize the dynamics of the seat structure to prevent the seat rattle noise.

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{have discussed}} {{the dynamics of the}} vehicle seat structure in response to vibration. The structural dynamics of the seat is linked to the seat noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) quality. The interaction of the vehicle seat resonances with the seat mounting points or the floor resonances may considerably increase the transmission of the vibration into the seat and cause either vibration discomfort or the rattle noise. The vehicle seat rattles or, in general, buzz, <b>squeak,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> (BSR) noises are one of the major issues which are directly linked to the NVH of the vehicle. Predicting and improving the seat BSR noise in early design phase is still challenging.

40|$|<b>Squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> (S&R) are two {{undesired}} {{phenomena that}} can affect the quality perception of cars. The main reason of S&R is the relative displacement between parts [1]. One mean to identify the critical area for S&R at Volvo Cars during the virtual phase is the E-line method. This method, which was presented in a SAE paper [2] 2012, calculates the relative displacement along a line/gap. The application of the method at Volvo Cars was shown in a Beta paper 2013 [3]. Relative displacement calculation along the closure gaps such as tailgate closure gap is shown high sensitivity to damping value and sealing stiffness. Therefore, a correlation work in time domain has been performed to update the damping value and sealing stiffness. The test object is a body in white (BIW) including some assembly parts. The relative displacement along the closure gap of tailgate is measured and simulated in different setups which results in updating the unknown parameters. The updated sealing stiffness value takes into account all three directions and the damping value is only valid for the BIW. Moreover, {{in order to increase}} the precision of the E-line method, a new principle to align measurement directions of the dynamic displacement with measurement directions of calculated geometrical variation has been developed. Geometrical variation or static displacement must be considered when assessing rattle because the minimum size of a gap is one of the essential parameters. Definition of measurement direction is based on a surface strip that is generated in the CAT (Computer Aided Tolerancing) tool RD&T. The combination of E-line with the surface strip shows a higher accuracy in the simulation method, which is presented in an industrial case-study. These enhancements improve the capability of relative displacement simulation significantly...|$|E

The special edition Formula Firehawk that appeared in 1991 was still available, although a lot of dealers were unaware of its existence. Lack of awareness and a sky high price tag conspired to keep the sales figures down on the special Firehawk. As {{for the rest of}} the line, new exterior colors were available, including a bright [...] "Jamaica Yellow". One interior color was changed, from the camel colored beechwood to a greyish beige. Convertibles were still available. One improvement made on all 1992 f-bodies was the addition of some extra bonding agents to stiffen the structure of the cars. The extra bonding was an attempt to correct <b>squeaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattles</b> that some owners had complained about. This also allowed GM to experiment with some of the new technologies which were to be implemented on the fourth generation cars. Mid-year, TPI-equipped cars only received blank throttle body plates rather than ones that had been marked [...] "TUNED PORT INJECTION" [...] on similar engines in prior model years; and black-painted valve covers replaced the silver components from previous years. As use of the L98 in the Corvette had come to an end, rough-cast runners found their way into L98-equipped Firebirds, and some cars received special rubber snubbers on the rear hatch frame that were designed to make the hatch more stable. This would be the last year for the light weight deep dish cross-laced wheels that had been available since 1987, and had been styled to look like expensive aftermarket rims. It would be the last year for the GTA, the last year for concealed windshield wipers, and the last year for the aerodynamic body with the long hood and low roofline. It was also the last year for full leather covering on the front seats. Some GTA's ended up with drum brakes on the rear, presumably because of a shortage of disk brake parts. Buyers were compensated for the downgrade. Ultimately, very few Trans Ams, GTA's, and Formulas were produced in this model year, as most buyers were waiting for the next-generation models.|$|R

40|$|In {{daily life}} sound {{is a vital}} {{dimension}} for {{the perception of the}} world around us but can in some cases be considered as annoying, irritating, or even harmful. In these cases the sound is labelled as noise and can be addressed in two ways, either by insulating the noise problem from the receiver (person) or by altering the source. The work performed in this thesis has been focusing on the latter approach. To be able to alter the source, knowledge about the physical properties governing the sound generation process is essential. Advanced measurement and modelling methods have been applied in the study of two different cases of noise generation. Milling machine noise: The first study addressed sound generating vibrations in milling machine operations which are a common operation in e. g. the automotive and aerospace industry. Large metal work pieces are reduced to a fraction of their original weight when creating complex thin structures. During these operations it is important that unwanted behaviours such as excessive tool vibrations (chatter) can be avoided. Chatter causes poor surface finish and/or material damage and can expose machine operators to annoying and/or harmful noise levels. In order to predict process parameters for a chatter-free milling operation, knowledge of the properties of the dynamic system are essential. To improve the possibility of measuring milling machine tool vibrations or any other rotor vibration with a high accuracy a method for single beam Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) measurements on rotating spindles was developed. The method solved two major problems using LDV on rotating targets, speckle noise and cross talk. To analyse the dynamic response of a rotor and its speed dependency, a method based on inductive displacement measurement, electromagnetic excitation, and FEM was developed. The measured dynamic response and the simulations of the studied milling machine, revealed the ball bearings as the weakest link capable of causing chatter vibrations and noise at high rotational speeds. Friction induced noise: The second study addressed problems regarding annoying sound generating vibrations in car door sealing systems and how these could be predicted and simulated for future car models. In the design process of a car door weather strip seals different conditions and demands must be considered. The primary goal of the seal is to act like a flexible barrier and protect the door/frame joint. The seal should prevent e. g. water and dust from entering the compartment and insulate the compartment from temperature and sound pressure differences between the two sides. Different types of seal geometries and rubber material can be used to achieve this. The seal stiffness affects the dynamic behaviour of the door and could result in <b>squeak</b> <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> problems if not designed correctly. Relative displacement between the door and the seals can also be a source to squeaking noise. A common problem in winter conditions at sub-zero temperatures is when humidity on the seal surface freezes and cause the seal to stick to the door, with the risk of ripping the seal when the door is opened. In order to avoid this, different kinds of consumer lubrication products {{can be applied to the}} seal surface. By doing this the contact conditions between the door and the seal will change. To analyse the affect of different contact conditions and relative displacement, measurements and simulations of a seal segment compressed by a metal plate have been performed. The study showed that different contact conditions can affect the desired seal function by altering the resulting seal shape during compression, and that the energy relaxation is an important aspect when establishing the long term stiffness. A stick-slip phenomenon generating audible sound was generated by translating a metal plate along a car door seal. A difference, governed by the surface properties of the rough metal plate, between the static and the kinetic friction allowed the seal to stick to the translating surface and release its charged elastic energy in a sliding repelling motion creating an audible sound pulse. The frequency of this stick-slip oscillation was found to be linearly dependent on the plate speed and the static friction was found to be dependent on the plate speed. FEM simulations confirmed that a difference between the static and the kinetic friction could result in a stick-slip vibration.
