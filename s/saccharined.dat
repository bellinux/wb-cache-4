40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>saccharine</b> in beverages sold {{in elementary schools}} Klojen Malang district has been done. This study identified the presence of <b>saccharine</b> and determined the level concentration by thin layer chromatography- densitometry method. The TLC method used silica gel 60 F 254 plate as the stationary phase, and a mobile phase composed of chloroform: glacial acetic acid (70 : 30). Out of the seven samples, {{it was found that}} four samples were positively contained <b>saccharine.</b> The spots had similar Rf values 0, 66 to 0, 67, and similar spectra pattern, λmax 275 nm and their MF (Match Factor) were more than 900. Relationship between the concentration and the area of <b>saccharine</b> spots was evaluated by linear regression with r> 0. 9682. Average levels of the six replication were S 3 : 77. 37 mg / L, S 4 : 76. 00 mg / L, S 5 : 73. 06 mg / L, and S 7 : 99. 62 mg / L. According to Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia regulation No. 722 /Menkes/Per/IX/ 1988 the maxima allowable concentration of artificial sweeteners <b>saccharine</b> in beverage that was equal to 300 mg / L. So it could be concluded those levels of <b>saccharine</b> still below the maximum level. Keywords: beverages, <b>saccharine,</b> TLC-densitometr...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate four cultivars of <b>saccharine</b> sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) regarding productivity, chemical composition of plant parts, {{and quality of the}} ensiling process. The tested varieties of <b>saccharine</b> sorghum were BRS 506, BRS 508, BRS 509, and BRS 511. The experiment was divided into two trials, which assessed: production, morphological composition, and nutritional quality of the <b>saccharine</b> varieties; and fermentation quality and nutritional value of the silage produced from the <b>saccharine</b> varieties. Of the tested varieties, BRS 509 and BRS 511 showed the highest total dry matter (DM) production. The BRS 508 variety presented the highest in vitro digestibility of the whole plant (70. 65 % DM). During ensiling, the BRS 509 variety showed the lowest DM loss (8. 87 %). The highest effluent production was observed for BRS 506 and BRS 508, with yields of 521. 87 and 393. 16 kg Mg- 1 ensiled DM, respectively. The BRS 511 variety is the most recommended because of the best results for plant production and nutritional quality. Regarding the ensiling process, BRS 509 presents the lowest fermentation losses and the highest nutritional value of silage...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} neuroendocrine {{mechanism}} of sugar preference, we investigated {{the role of}} glucose feeding in the regulation of expression levels of neuropeptides derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in fructose preference rats. Fructose preference rats were induced by using the lithium chloride backward conditioning procedure. The fructose preference was confirmed by the two-bottle test. The drinking behavior of rats was assessed by the fructose concentration gradient test. The preference of 10 % glucose or 0. 1 % <b>saccharine</b> was assessed, and the expression levels of neuropeptides derived from POMC in the LH and the NAc in fructose preference rats were measured by Western blot analysis. Fructose preference rats displayed a greater fructose preference than control rats. Furthermore, fructose preference rats preferred glucose solution rather than <b>saccharine</b> solution, while control rats preferred <b>saccharine</b> solution rather than glucose solution. The expression levels of neuropeptides derived from POMC in the LH and the NAc were changed by glucose but not <b>saccharine</b> intake. In summary, the data suggests that glucose intake increases the expression of neuropeptides derived from POMC in the LH and the NAc in fructose preference rats...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{approaches}} {{are considered to}} application of medical feed at <b>saccharine</b> diabetes. An analysis is conducted more than 30 literary sources. It is set that a dietotherapy is obligatory for all of patients <b>saccharine</b> diabetes and allows to obtain his indemnification more than in third of cases. It is marked that at <b>saccharine</b> diabetes of the I type it is necessary basis of diet to count the severe observance of time of reception of meal, constancy of its composition and amount. At diabetes II type a substantial value is acquired by achievement and subsequent support of ideal mass of body. It is set that basic modern principles of dietotherapy at <b>saccharine</b> diabetes is: physiological composition of carbonhydratess (55 - 60 %), fats (20 - 25 %) and albumens (15 - 20 %); calculation of power value of day's ration taking into account mass of body, age, floor, power charges; exception from the diet of the refined carbonhydratess which are easily mastered; a feed must be a shot; severe mode of distributing of power value of day's ration and sacchariferous value of meal on an amount and clock of reception of meal...|$|R
40|$|Stress may {{influence}} the sensitivity of subjects to rewarding stimuli and stress modality may differentially affect this sensitivity. This relation was investigated in our animal model using chronic physical (repeated mild foot shocks) and emotional (witness) stress. Previous research has established that the two stressors have differential long-term effects on behaviour, where physical stress caused inactivity in a small open field and emotional stress hyperactivity. Rats were stressed on 5 consecutive days and tested for locomotor activity in a small open field (day 10) and <b>saccharine</b> preference (day 11). The preference for graded concentrations of <b>saccharine</b> over water {{was used as a}} measure for their sensitivity to reward. Physical stress treatment induced a long-term decrease both in preference for <b>saccharine</b> and open field activity compared to control treatment. Emotional stress animals showed an increase in open field behaviour activity and a slight increase in <b>saccharine</b> preference. Physical stress seems to cause anhedonia, while emotional stress might cause an increased sensitivity to reward. In conclusion, stress can induce differential long-term effects on sensitivity to positive stimuli and the response to novelty depending on stress modality. Femke T. A. Pijlman, Gerrit Wolterink and Jan M. Van Re...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Stevia extract was {{prepared}} by boiling stevia leaf powder in water.

The pharmacological similarity of the deficit to the changes accompanying affective disorders further supports the potential applicability of the chronic stress model...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{sweeteners}} {{were introduced}} in therapy as sugar substitutes for diabetic patients. Nowadays these substances are widely used for sugar substitution in low calorie drinks and sweets. Most commonly used products to date are <b>saccharine,</b> cyclamate, aspartame, and acesulfam; maximum accepted daily intakes are stated for each one. A simple reverse phase (RP 18) HPLC-UV method with direct detection (196 nm) was developed by us {{in order to measure}} the concentrations of the three sweeteners. No sample preparation is required, other than dilution. Limits of detection are 12 mg l− 1, 0. 5 mg l − 1 and lower than 0. 25 mg l− 1 for cyclamate, aspartame and <b>saccharine,</b> respectively. Concentrations ranged between 113. 14 – 280. 07 mg l− 1 in the case of cyclamate, 17. 96 – 50. 94 mg l- 1 for <b>saccharine,</b> and 9. 94 – 296. 82 mg l− 1 for aspartame. ...|$|R
40|$|Eight rats {{were trained}} to consume (or {{withhold}} consumption of) a <b>saccharine</b> flavoured solution in a discrimination task. On Safe days, water deprived rats were placed in one context (either white or black box) for 20 min. During the first 10 min fluid was absent. During the second 10 min rats were given access to a <b>saccharine</b> solution {{through a hole in}} either the long or short wall of the test box. Immediately following this trial, rats were injected with saline and placed back into their home cage. Danger days consisted of the same rat being placed in the opposite colour context with the spout placed through the hole that was not used on the Safe day. Rats were injected with LiCl after the 20 min Danger trial. The location of the <b>saccharine</b> was fixed on Safe and Danger days. Both amount of <b>saccharine,</b> and taste reactivity responses were measured in parallel for each trial. Rats drank less <b>saccharine</b> on Danger days relative to Safe days and these changes in fluid consumption were correlated with aversive and appetitive behavioural changes. The aversive and appetitive behavioural changes occurred in anticipation of fluid delivery. Hole-poking behaviour revealed that animals anticipate fluid delivery on Safe days, but do not show anticipatory hole-poking on Danger days. A retention test 25 days later revealed that rats remembered the discrimination, with levels of fluid consumption and behavioural measures remaining intact. These findings indicate that conditional control of fluid consumption observed during discrimination training mirrors aversive and appetitive responses. These findings suggest that environmental cues can gain control over anticipatory nausea and may prove helpful in the control of nausea in clinical settings...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that stress-induced alterations in Neurogranin (Ng) synthesis and/ or utilization might underlie stress-related depression and anxiety. Rats were randomly divided into five conditions: chronic swim stress (CS), acute swim stress (AS), and three control groups. The CS group was exposed to daily swim stress (5 min/day) for 14 consecutive days, the AS group received a single swim stress, and control groups were maintained in a stress-free condition. Both before and after swim stress, rats were tested for body weight gain, open-field locomotor activity, and <b>saccharine</b> preference. Ng and phospho-Ng (P-Ng) levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were determined by Western blot analysis. Compared to controls, CS animals displayed significantly decreased body weight gain, ambulation, and <b>saccharine</b> intake, and increased grooming behavior.
