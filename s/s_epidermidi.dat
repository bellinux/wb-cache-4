40|$|Staphylococci are {{significant}} human pathogens. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus causes {{a variety of}} infections. Recently, coagulase-negative staphylococci have been recog-nized as important pathogens. Fluoroquinolones {{have been widely used}} to treat staphylococcal infections. However, quin-olone-resistant strains have been clinically isolated among S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. One of the mechanisms of resistance to quinolones is an alteration of DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase contains the two sub-units of GyrA and two subunits of GyrB encoded by the gyrA and gyrB genes, respectively. DNA gyrase catalyzes ATP-de-pendent supercoiling of DNA and is a target of the quinolones (3). Ser- 843 Leu, Ser- 843 Ala, Ser- 853 Pro, Glu- 883 Gly, and Glu- 883 Lys changes were identified in S. aureusGyrA (1) and a Ser- 843 Phe mutation was observed in <b>S.</b> <b>epidermidi...</b>|$|E

The study of vaginal microbiome and biological properties of same microorganisms is a necessary step for choice the treatment strategy. The aim of research was to analyze qualitative and quantitative composition of microbiome of the vagina of women using the test-system Femoflor- 16 and to study the ability of staphylococci strains to biofilm-formation. Using molecular genetic methods for detecting of microorganisms disorders of vaginal microbiome was confirmed in 92. 7 % of the surveyed women. It our study, 21 (41. 2 %) cases of dysbiosis were found to accompany infectious diseases. Candida spp., Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium and Ureaplasma (urealyticum + parvum) showed overwhelming. Most of the pathogens detected were a monoinfection (71 %), with two-agent associations accounting for only 29 % of the cases. The predominant associations of opportunistic bacteria, detected during disorders of vaginal microbiome, were Gardnerella vaginalis + Prevotella bivia + Porphyromonas spp. that found in 50. 9 % of patients and Megasphaera spp. + Veillonella spp. + Dialister spp. – found in 34. 5 % of patients. Among cases of monoinfection the most often found opportunistic pathogens were Eubacterium spp. – 50. 9 % of cases and Staphylococcus spp. – 49. 1 % of cases: 92. 6 % of these were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis and 7. 4 % – as Staphylococcus saprophyticus. 44 % of <b>S.</b> <b>epidermidi</b> s strains were able to form biofilm.

It is well known, that patients with deep burns belong to the category of critically ill ones. According to the data of National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (2004), Staphylococcus spp. are among leading opportunistic pathogens of infectious complications in such patients. Nowadays much attention is given to the problem of antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus clinical strains. More often antiseptics are used in treatment of infectious complications, caused by antibiotic resistant miсroorganisms. The aim of the research was to study microbiological {{aspects of the}} effectiveness of antimicrobial drugs. Materials and methods. There were examined 372 critically ill patients with burns, having infectious complications. In all patients microbiological examinations were carried out during the first 7 days after burn trauma. There were isolated 115 clinical strains of Staphylococcus spp [...] Their morphological, cultural, biochemical qualities and sensitivity to antibiotics, antiseptics were studied. Rresults of the study. We found, that clinical strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis were highly resistant to oxacillin (46, 9; 59, 1 % respectively); were insensitive to clavulanate and sulbactam potentiated beta-lactams; ceftriaxone; meropenem, imipenem; ciprofloxacin. Sensitivity of Staphylococcus to amikacin, linezolid, vancomycin was found. There was shown the sensitivity of antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus to decamethoxin, its polymer composition, chlorhexidine digluconate. In the research there was proved the decreasing {{of the effectiveness of}} chlorhexidine digluconate against Staphylococcus in conditions of increasing microbial load to 109 CFU/ml in 6, 6 times comparably to decamethoxin drugs (p< 0, 001). Conclusions Resistant to the majority of antibiotics strains of Staphylococcus spp. store their high sensitivity to antiseptic decamethoxin and its polymeric composition, chlorhexidine digluconate. Microbial load increase up to 109 CFU/ml decreases antimicrobial effectiveness of chlorhexidine digluconate in 4, 2 – 4, 8 times. Antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococci do not have cross-resistance to antiseptic drugs. Clinical strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis cause purulent-inflammatory complications in critically ill patients with burns and have resistance to oxacillin (46, 9; 59, 1 % respectively), beta-lactam antibiotics with clavulanic acid and sulbactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate – 67, 47 ± 9, 30 %; ampicillin/sulbactam – 58, 63 ± 8, 58 %;); ceftriaxone (55, 75 ± 14, 24 %); carbapenems (meropenem – 64, 93 – 70, 35 %; imipenem – 66, 43 – 66, 78 %); ciprofloxacin (65, 47 ± 9, 11 %). S. aureus, <b>S.</b> <b>epidermidi</b> are sensitive to amikacin (74, 62 – 80, 75 %), linezolid (77, 2 – 87, 44 %); vancomycin (91, 88 – 92, 46 %).
