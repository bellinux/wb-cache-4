25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the <b>secondary</b> <b>winding</b> of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the <b>secondary</b> <b>winding</b> is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} coil {{consists of two}} transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary.

40|$|We {{continue}} {{to explore the}} accretion model of the massive binary system eta Carinae by studying the anomalously high He II 4686 line. The line appears just before periastron and disappears immediately thereafter. Based on the He II 4686 line emission from O-stars and their modeling in the literature, we postulate that the He II 4686 line comes from the acceleration zone of the <b>secondary</b> stellar <b>wind.</b> We attribute the large increase in the line intensity to {{a slight increase in}} the density of the <b>secondary</b> stellar <b>wind</b> in its acceleration zone. The increase in density could be due to the ionization and subsequent deceleration of the wind by the enhanced X-ray emission arising from the shocked <b>secondary</b> <b>wind</b> further downstream or to accretion of the primary stellar wind. Accretion around the secondary equatorial plane gives rise to collimation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>wind,</b> which increases its density, hence enhancing the He II 4686 emission line. In contrast with previous explanations, the presently proposed model does not require a prohibitively high X-ray flux to directly photoionize the He. Comment: ApJ, in pres...|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} the X-ray luminosity and light curve for the stellar binary system Eta Carinae {{for the entire}} orbital period of 5. 54 years. By using a new approach we find, as suggested before, that the collision of the winds blown by the two stars can explain the X-ray emission and temporal behavior. Most X-ray emission in the 2 - 10 band results from the shocked <b>secondary</b> stellar <b>wind.</b> The observed rise in X-ray luminosity just before minimum is due to increase in density and subsequent decrease in radiative cooling time of the shocked fast <b>secondary</b> <b>wind.</b> Absorption, particularly of the soft X-rays from the primary wind, increases as the system approaches periastron and the shocks are produced deep inside the primary wind. However, absorption {{can not account for}} the drastic X-ray minimum. The 70 day minimum is assumed to result from the collapse of the collision region of the two <b>winds</b> onto the <b>secondary</b> star. This process is assumed to shut down the <b>secondary</b> <b>wind,</b> hence the main X-ray source. We show that this assumption provides a phenomenological description of the X-ray behavior around the minimum. Comment: The Astrophysical Journal, in pres...|$|R
25|$|Unipolar - One {{end of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>winding</b> is {{connected}} to a single high voltage terminal, the other end is grounded. This type is used in modern coils designed for entertainment. The primary winding is located near the bottom, low potential end of the secondary, to minimize arcs between the windings. Since the ground (Earth) serves as the return path for the high voltage, streamer arcs from the terminal tend to jump to any nearby grounded object.|$|E
25|$|The supply {{transformer}} (T) <b>secondary</b> <b>winding</b> {{is connected}} across the primary tuned circuit. It might {{seem that the}} transformer would be a leakage path for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large inductance gives it a very high impedance at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current. If the supply transformer has inadequate leakage inductance, radio frequency chokes are placed in its secondary leads to block the RF current.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} coil's {{high voltage}} output {{is connected to the}} rotor that sits on top of the distributor shaft. Surrounding the rotor is the distributor cap. The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the <b>secondary</b> <b>winding</b> to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the ignition coil’s magnetic field.|$|E

40|$|The X-ray {{emission}} of η Carinae shows multiple features at various {{spatial and temporal}} scales. The central constant emission (CCE) component is centred on the binary and arises from spatial scales {{much smaller than the}} bipolar Homunculus nebula, but likely larger than the central wind [...] wind collision region between the stars as it does not vary over the ∼ 2 - 3 month X-ray minimum when it can be observed. Using large-scale 3 D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we model both the colliding-wind region between the stars, and the region where the <b>secondary</b> <b>wind</b> collides with primary wind ejected from the previous periastron passage. The simulations extend out to one hundred semimajor axes and make two limiting assumptions (strong coupling and no coupling) about the influence of the primary radiation field on the <b>secondary</b> <b>wind.</b> We perform 3 D radiative transfer calculations on the SPH output to synthesize the X-ray emission, with the aim of reproducing the CCE spectrum. For the preferred primary mass-loss rate Ṁ_A≈ 8. 5 × 10 ^- 4 M_ yr^- 1, the model spectra well reproduce the observation as the strong- and no-coupling spectra bound the CCE observation for longitude of periastron ω≈ 252 ^∘, and bound/converge on the observation for ω≈ 90 ^∘. This suggests that η Carinae has moderate coupling between the primary radiation and <b>secondary</b> <b>wind,</b> that both the region between the stars and the comoving collision on the backside of the secondary generate the CCE, and that the CCE cannot place constraints on the binary's line of sight. We also discuss comparisons with common X-ray fitting parameters. Comment: 14 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We use the {{accretion}} {{model to}} explain the early exit of Eta Carinae from its 2009 X-ray minimum. In the accretion model the secondary star accretes mass from the primary wind near periastron passage, a process that suppresses the <b>secondary</b> <b>wind.</b> As the shocked <b>secondary</b> <b>wind</b> is {{responsible for most of}} the X-ray emission, the accretion process accounts for the X-ray minimum. The early exit from the 2009 X-ray minimum after four weeks, instead of ten weeks as in the two previous minima, is attributed to the primary wind that during the last minimum was somewhat faster and of lower mass loss rate than during the two previous X-ray minima. This results in a much lower mass accretion rate during the X-ray minimum. We show that using fluctuations in these quantities that are within the range deduced from fluctuations in the X-ray flux outside the minimum, can account for the short duration of the last X-ray minimum. The shorter X-ray minimum may have further implications on the recovery of the system from the spectroscopic event. Comment: ApJ Letters, 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a <b>secondary</b> <b>winding</b> rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E
25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The <b>secondary</b> <b>winding</b> has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the <b>secondary</b> <b>winding,</b> transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{emission}} and the absorption components of he N II lines recently observed in Eta Carinae can originate in the <b>secondary's</b> <b>wind</b> acceleration zone. We base this claim {{in part on the}} presence of these lines in hot nitrogen rich stars, such as WN 8 stars, and on the expected clumpy nature of such winds. The envelope of the secondary star in Eta Carinae is expected to be nitrogen rich due to accretion of few solar masses of the primary luminous blue variable's nitrogen rich material during the nineteenth century Great Eruption. Another argument in support of N II lines origin in the acceleration zone of the <b>secondary</b> <b>wind</b> is the behavior of the emission components. The emission components of the lines show the same Doppler shift variation as that of the absorption components. The secondary's-wind origin of the N II lines is compatible with the binary orientation in which the secondary is closer to us near periastron passage.

40|$|We {{study the}} usage of the X-ray light curve, column density toward the hard X-ray source, and {{emission}} measure (density square times volume), of the massive binary system Eta Carinae to determine the orientation of its semi-major axis. The source of the hard X-ray emission is the shocked <b>secondary</b> <b>wind.</b> We argue that, by itself, the observed X-ray flux cannot teach us much about {{the orientation of the}} semi-major axis. Minor adjustment of some unknown parameters of the binary system allows to fit the X-ray light curve with almost any inclination angle and orientation. The column density and X-ray emission measure, on the other hand, impose strong constrains on the orientation. We improve our previous calculations and show that the column density is more compatible with an orientation where for {{most of the time the}} secondary - the hotter, less massive star - is behind the primary star. The secondary comes closer to the observer only for a short time near periastron passage. The ten-week X-ray deep minimum, which results from a large decrease in the emission measure, implies that the regular <b>secondary</b> <b>wind</b> is substantially suppressed during that period. This suppression is most likely resulted by accretion of mass from the dense wind of the primary luminous blue variable (LBV) star. The accretion from the equatorial plane might lead to the formation of a polar outflow. We suggest that the polar outflow contributes to the soft X-ray emission during the X-ray minimum; the other source is the shocked <b>secondary</b> <b>wind</b> in the tail. The conclusion that accretion occurs at each periastron passage, every five and a half years, implies that accretion had occurred at a much higher rate during the 20 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae in the 19 th century.

25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to <b>secondary</b> <b>winding,</b> the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency.
