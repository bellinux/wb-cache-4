40|$|The {{usefulness}} of <b>star</b> <b>occultation</b> measurements for space navigation and {{the determination of}} a horizon density profile {{which could be used}} to update atmospheric models for horizon-based measurement systems were studied. The time of occultation of a known star by a celestial body, as seen by an orbiting observer, determines a cylinder of position, the axis of which is the line through the star and the body center, and the radius of which is equal to the occulting-body radius. The dimming percentage, with respect to the altitude of this grazing ray from the star to the observer, is a percentage altitude for occultation. That is, the star can be assumed to be occulted when it reaches a predetermined percentage of its unattenuated value. The procedure used was to measure this attenuation with respect to time to determine the {{usefulness of}} the measurements for autonomous space navigation.

40|$|Life and {{astrobiology}} related topics form a {{very wide}} field of study. One interesting subtopic is the identification of organic compounds in places other than Earth, their interrelation and the conditions they are subject to. One particularly interesting object {{from this point of}} view is Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the only one in the Solar System known to have a thick N 2 /CH 4, planet-like atmosphere. This atmosphere is long ago known to be rich in organic compounds of high interest for astrobiology. The NASA-ESA-ASI mission Cassini-Huygens, designed to explore the Saturnian system, gives an excellent opportunity to study Titan. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) onboard Cassini is a valuable tool that, among other capabilities, allows to study composition, elements distribution and temperatures in Titan's upper atmosphere. <b>Star</b> <b>occultation</b> by Titan's atmosphere is a convenient technique to retrieve altitude profiles of absorbing compounds. Cassini fly-bys provide excellent opportunities for this. The quality of the result is highly dependent on the resolution of the measured transmission spectra. It also depends on the available molecular absorption cross section data for the atmosphere's component species used in the retrieval (Ferradaz et al., 2009). In this work, transmission spectra for different altitudes in Titan's atmosphere are obtained from UVIS data. The data, in the form of spatial spectral cubes, correspond to <b>star</b> <b>occultation</b> events. The data products include those of the December 2004 Titan fly-by (Tb). The transmission spectra are used together with recent experimental measurements of absorption cross sections of the relevant molecules to determine the presence and distribution of carbonaceous compounds in Titan's atmosphere. UVIS and absorption cross section spectral resolution are improved with respect to previous instruments and experimental data respectively (for example Vervack et al. (2004)). The modeled atmosphere used for the retrieval includes CH 4, C 2 H 2, HCN, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, C 4 H 2, HC 3 N and C 2 N 2. Some of the results are in agreement with previous works and photochemical models but in some cases the densities presented are a few orders of magnitude bigger than the references. The presented combined results for C 2 N 2 and HC 3 N was not found in the bibliography consulted. The profiles retrieved from two star occultations are coincident for most of the species and altitudes. The densities retrieved with absorption cross section measured at temperatures consistent with the ones in the upper atmosphere of Titan do not differ significantly from those retrieved using absorption cross sections measured at room temperature. The analysis of the results includes a discussion of the effect of each species in different regions of the transmission spectra. This permits to asses the deficiencies in the procedure employed. The comparison of the results with several available photochemical models will help to improve the comprehension of Titan's atmospheric organic chemistry. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA <b>star</b> <b>occultation</b> by Pluto was {{monitored}} in August 2003 {{by several}} telescopes, at several wavelengths between 0. 7 μm and 2. 23 μm. Besides information concerning pressure and temperature profiles, this observation revealed a chromatic {{effect in the}} light transmitted through the atmosphere at the limb. It was attributed to an extinction layer produced by spherical particles of about 0. 2 μm, and {{it was suggested that}} such large particle size may be due to fractal particles as on Titan. In this paper, we use an aerosol microphysical model to estimate if such extinction could be due to photochemical aerosols only. We use the case of Titan to scale the haze production rate on Pluto and we show that the chromatic effect {{is not likely to be}} produced in this way. We then study how a troposphere in Pluto's atmosphere could generate condensation droplets. We conclude that such an extinction layer is produced by condensation droplets that potentially could grow as large as observed. We find that only N 2 and CO are able to condense easily. CH 4 probably does not condense or, if it does, it needs to reach a very high saturation ratio and, in any case, is supersaturated on Pluto. Noteworthily, a similar layer was observed on Triton by Voyager. Finally, at the end of the paper we discuss which are the conditions to detect a chromatic effect for submicrometer to micrometer particles in future observations...|$|E

40|$|Spectroscopy for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Mars (SPICAM) is {{the first}} {{instrument}} orbiting a planet other than Earth that {{is dedicated to the}} technique of stellar occultation. During the first year of operation on board Mars Express, SPICAM observed more than 500 star occultations, yielding vertical profiles of CO 2, ozone, and dust/clouds/aerosols. We review the principles of a <b>star</b> <b>occultation</b> in the absorptive regime, emphasizing two advantages of this method: an absolute value is obtained from a relative measurement without the need for an absolute calibration of the instrument, and the altitude of the measurement is accurately known because it depends only on the position of the spacecraft and not on the pointing of the instrument. We describe a general algorithm used for all occultations. First, we derive from the raw data the transmission of the atmosphere as a function of wavelength, T(?, z), taking account of instrument-specific factors. Then a spectral inversion retrieves the slant densities (local densities integrated along the line of sight) of all absorbing species for each measurement of the transmission T(?, z) during the occultation. Finally, a vertical inversion retrieves the vertical distribution of the local densities from the series of the slant density measurements. This vertical inversion includes a new scheme of Tikhonov regularization. This paper will serve as a reference for the SPICAM Mars Express data which will be systematically made available to the public in the PDS-like archive managed by ESA...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{scattering}} of sunlight by the Earth atmosphere above {{the top of}} the stratospheric layer, about 30 - 35 km altitude, is only due to Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric molecules. Its intensity is then directly proportional to the atmospheric density. It is then possible to retrieve a temperature profile in absolute value using the hydrostatic equation and the perfect gas law, assuming that the temperature is known from a climatological model at {{the top of the}} density profile. This technique is applied to Rayleigh lidar observations since more than 35 years (Hauchecorne and Chanin, 1980). The GOMOS <b>star</b> <b>occultation</b> spectrometer observed the sunlight scattering at limb during daytime to remove it from the star spectrum. In the frame of the ESA funded MesosphEO project, GOMOS Rayleigh scattering profiles in the spectral range 400 - 460 nm have been used to retrieve temperature profiles from 35 to 85 km with a 2 -km vertical resolution.

As a quasi-reference for validation in few selected regions with sparse ground-based observations the multi-pixel GRASP algorithm for the POLDER instrument is used. Validation of first dataset versions (vs. AERONET, MAN) and inter-comparison to other satellite datasets (MODIS, MISR, SeaWIFS) proved the high quality of the available datasets comparable to other satellite retrievals and revealed needs for algorithm improvement (for example for higher AOD values) which were taken into account for a reprocessing.

AerGOM enhances the quality of the stratospheric aerosol extinction retrieval due to the extension of the spectral range used, refines the aerosol spectral parameterization, the simultaneous inversion of all atmospheric species as well as an improvement of the Rayleigh scattering correction. The retrieval algorithm allows for a good characterization of the stratospheric aerosol extinction for a wide range of wavelengths. In this work, we present the results of stratospheric aerosol extinction comparisons between AerGOM and various spaceborne instruments (SAGE II, SAGE III, POAM III, ACE-MAESTRO and OSIRIS) for different wavelengths. The aerosol extinction intercomparisons for λ [*][*] 700  nm. Due to the unique observational technique of GOMOS, some of the results appear to be dependent on the <b>star</b> <b>occultation</b> parameters such as star apparent temperature and magnitude, solar zenith angle and latitude of observation. A systematic analysis is carried out to identify biases in the dataset, using the various spaceborne instruments as references. The quality of the aerosol retrieval is mainly influenced by the star magnitude, as well as star temperature to a lesser degree. To ensure good-quality profiles, we suggest to select occultations performed with star magnitude M [*][*] 6 [*]×[*] 10 3  K. Stray-light contamination is negligible for extinction coefficients below 700  nm using occultations performed with a solar zenith angle [*]>[*] 110 ° but becomes important at larger wavelengths.

For the first time, we show comparisons of GOMOS 500 nm particle extinction profiles with the ones of other satellite occultation instruments (SAGE II, SAGE III and POAM III), of which the good agreement lends credibility to the GOMOS data set. Yearly zonal statistics are presented for the entire period considered. Time series furthermore convincingly show an important new finding: the sensitivity of GOMOS to the sulfate input by moderate volcanic eruptions such as Manam (2005) and Soufrière Hills (2006). Finally, PSCs are well observed by GOMOS and a first qualitative analysis of the data agrees well with the theoretical PSC formation temperature.

This is key information necessary for studying {{the evolution of the}} asteroid belt and to calibrate indirect methods of size determination, such as the models used to analyze thermal infrared observations. Up to now, the observation of asteroid occultations is an activity essentially secured by amateur astronomers equipped with small, portable equipments. However, the accuracy of the available ephemeris prevents accurate predictions of the occultation events for objects smaller than ~ 100 km. Aims: We investigate current limits in predictability and observability of asteroid occultations, and we study their possible evolution in the future, when high accuracy asteroid orbits and star positions (such as those expected from the mission Gaia of the European Space Agency) will be available. Methods: We use a simple model for asteroid ephemeris uncertainties and numerical algorithms for estimating the limits imposed by the instruments, assuming realistic CCD performances and asteroid size distribution, to estimate the expected occultation rate under different conditions. Results: We show that high accuracy ephemerides which will be available in the future will extend toward much smaller asteroids the possibility of observing asteroid occultations, greatly increasing the number of events and objects involved.
