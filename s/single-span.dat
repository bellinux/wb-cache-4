Parts of the distinctive glass roof were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the glazing was not re-instated during railway usage after the war. Following the Beeching Report, passenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last goods train ran in 1971. In the 1980s the rail approaches to the station were redeveloped as a major supermarket opened in December 1982, and the station itself {{is used as a}} pedestrian passageway to and from the city; {{there are a number of}} small shop units in the former station buildings.|$|E

40|$|Trans-{{membrane}} domains (TMDs) from <b>single-spanning</b> membrane proteins {{are commonly}} viewed as membrane anchors for functional domains. Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) exemplifies this concept, as it retains enzymatic function upon proteolytic {{release from the}} membrane. However, the subtype 1 NA TMDs have become increasingly more polar in human strains since 1918, which suggests that selection pressure exists on this domain. Here, we investigated the N 1 TMD-head domain relationship by exchanging a prototypical “old” TMD (1933) with a “recent” (2009), more polar TMD and an engineered hydrophobic TMD. Each exchange altered the TMD association, decreased the NA folding efficiency, and significantly reduced viral budding and replication at 37 °C compared to at 33 °C, at which NA folds more efficiently. Passaging the chimera viruses at 37 °C restored the NA folding efficiency, viral budding, and infectivity by selecting for NA TMD mutations that correspond with their polar or hydrophobic assembly properties. These results demonstrate that <b>single-spanning</b> membrane protein TMDs can influence distal domain folding, as well as membrane-related processes, and suggest the NA TMD in H 1 N 1 viruses has become more polar to maintain compatibility with the evolving enzymatic head domain...|$|R
5|$|An Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to allow a}} wrought iron {{suspension}} bridge to be built instead of stone, and tolls levied to recoup the cost. A company was formed and funds raised {{during the first few}} months of 1830, but the money raised was not sufficient for the construction. Despite this, the act received Royal Assent in May 1830. Brunel produced a new proposal costing £10,000 less than Telford's design and gained support for it in the local press. James Meadows Rendel, William Armstrong and William Hill also submitted new, cheaper proposals, complaining that the committee had not set a budget. In 1831 a second competition was held, with new judges including Davies Gilbert and John Seaward examining the engineering qualities of the proposals. Thirteen designs were submitted; Telford's was the only one in which the chains achieved the weight per square inch required by the judges but it was rejected as being too expensive. The winner was declared to be a design by Smith and Hawkes of the Eagle Foundry in Birmingham. Brunel had a personal meeting with Gilbert and persuaded him to change the decision. The committee then declared Brunel the winner and he was awarded a contract as project engineer. The winning design was for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers. In 2010, newly discovered letters and documents revealed that, in producing his design, Brunel had taken advice from his father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. The elder Brunel had recommended including a central support for the bridge, as he did not believe a <b>single-span</b> bridge of such length could be constructed. His son chose to ignore his advice.|$|E

40|$|The {{orientation}} of most <b>single-spanning</b> membrane proteins obeys the "positive-inside rule", i. e. the flanking {{region of the}} transmembrane segment that is more positively charged remains in the cytosol. These membrane proteins are integrated by the Sec 61 /SecY translocon, but how their orientation is achieved is unknown. We have screened for mutations in yeast Sec 61 p that alter the {{orientation of}} <b>single-spanning</b> membrane proteins. We identified a class of mutants that are less efficient in retaining the positively charged flanking region in the cytosol. Surprisingly, these mutations are located at many different sites in the Sec 61 /SecY molecule, {{and they do not}} only involve charged amino acid residues. All these mutants have a prl phenotype that so far have only been seen in bacteria; they allow proteins with defective signal sequences to be translocated, likely because the Sec 61 p channel opens more easily. A similar correlation between topology defects and prl phenotype was also seen with previously identified yeast Sec 61 mutants. Our results suggest a model in which the regulated opening of the translocon is required for the faithful orientation of membrane proteins...|$|R

40|$|Multispanning {{membrane}} proteins - i. e., proteins {{with multiple}} transmembrane domains that thread back-and-forth across the cell membrane - {{are essential for}} cellular functions that include signal transduction, material transport, and energy conversion. Performing these functions requires the proteins to integrate within the membrane in the correct topology, or the overall orientation of the protein relative to the membrane. The integration of most proteins proceeds via the Sec translocon, a conserved protein-conducting channel that allows a nascent protein chain to access the membrane while being fed into the channel during translation. Previous studies have established that the Sec-facilitated integration of <b>single-spanning</b> proteins depends on factors including nascent chain hydrophobicity and charge; however, {{the extent to which}} these properties influence the integration and topology of multispanning proteins is less clear. Here, we use coarse-grained simulations to investigate the Sec-facilitated membrane integration of multispanning proteins on realistic biological timescales. We employ a simulation model that enables access to a timescale of minutes while retaining sufficient chemical accuracy to capture the forces that drive membrane integration. This study focuses on understanding two experimental observations: first, the finding that the protein EmrE exhibits two possible topologies in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry; and second, the finding that some marginally hydrophobic domains efficiently integrate into the membrane as part of a multispanning protein, despite inefficiently integrating as a <b>single-spanning</b> protein. This work provides mechanistic explanations for these observations, leading to insight into the sequence-level determinants of multispanning membrane protein integration and topology (1) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo get {{insight into}} the {{insertion}} mechanism of small newly synthesized <b>single-spanning</b> membrane proteins, Pf 3 coat protein mutants were constructed with potential glycosylation sites in the N-terminus.

Such Pf 3 constructs also insert efficiently into Escherichia coli vesicles and even in pure lipid vesicles, suggesting a common mechanism, which might be spontaneous. Glycosylation was sensitive to changes in the amino acid sequence of the N-terminus, suggesting that it depends on the structure of the protein and/or its positioning with respect to the lipid–water interface...|$|R

25|$|The Classical Revival {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Nathan C. Wyeth, an architect {{in private practice in}} the city, and Major Max C. Tyler, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers.

Subsequently, the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers asked the CFA for a list of architects whom the CFA believed would be competent to design an aesthetically pleasing bridge. The CFA swiftly provided a list, and in July 1916 Tyler met with the CFA to discuss a short list of potential architects. The CFA and Tyler also conferred on the bridge's orientation, design, and approaches. Tyler selected Wyeth. The plans were nearly complete by September. Wyeth and Tyler's initial design for the bridge was a double-deck structure with a single, high span. But with World War I erupting in Europe, inflation made this structure too costly. Wyeth then submitted a design for a single-deck, <b>single-span</b> bridge on January 12, 1917.

40|$|Bacterial {{integral}} inner membrane proteins {{are either}} translocated across the lipid bilayer using an energy-driven enzyme, {{such as the}} Sec translocase, or they might interact directly with the membrane due to hydrophobic forces. We report that the <b>single-spanning</b> Pf 3 coat protein is spontaneously inserted into the membrane of Escherichia coli and requires the electrical component of the membrane potential (DeltaPsi) to translocate its N-terminal region. This results in a final N(out) C(in) orientation of the protein in the cytoplasmic membrane, due the potential-driven translocation of the aspartyl residue at position 18 in the hydrophilic N-terminal tail. Uncharged protein tails are only translocated when the hydrophobic transmembrane region of the protein has been extended.

Surprisingly, the anionic lipids phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin stimulate N-terminal translocation of the protein, even though it has no charged amino acid side chains. This novel effect is general for anionic lipids and depends on the amount of charge on the lipid headgroup.
