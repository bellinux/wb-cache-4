5|$|William faced {{difficulties}} in his continental possessions in 1071, but in 1072 {{he returned to}} England and marched north to confront King Malcolm III of Scotland. This campaign, which included a land army supported by a fleet, resulted in the Treaty of Abernethy in which Malcolm expelled Edgar the Ætheling from Scotland and agreed to some degree of <b>subordination</b> to William. The exact status of this <b>subordination</b> was unclear– the treaty merely stated that Malcolm became William's man. Whether this meant only for Cumbria and Lothian or for the whole Scottish kingdom was left ambiguous.|$|E

5|$|The conquests {{were made}} behind {{a mask of}} <b>subordination</b> to Rome. Zenobia issued coins {{in the name of}} Claudius' {{successor}} Aurelian, with Vaballathus depicted as king; since Aurelian was occupied with repelling insurgencies in Europe, he tolerated the Palmyrene coinage and encroachments. In late 271, Vaballathus and his mother assumed the titles of Augustus (emperor) and Augusta.|$|E

5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept <b>subordination</b> towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of BhimaI, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.|$|E

5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert {{the presence of}} and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of the}} most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of <b>subordination</b> in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
5|$|Emir Sanjar al-Jawli {{acquired}} the governorship of Gaza and central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored Gaza and transformed {{it into a}} flourishing city, having built in it a horse-race course, a madrasa (college), a mosque, a khan (caravansary), a maristan (hospital), and a castle. In late 1332, coinciding with the appointment of Emir Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial privileges of Gaza, such as the governor's direct <b>subordination</b> to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Syria, Emir Tankiz al-Husami.|$|E
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and <b>subordination</b> before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, the West Nohno {{completed}} her nine-month journey {{when she arrived}} at Mobile, Alabama, after sailing via Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Key West. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that during this voyage, seaman James Orville Couchois had incited <b>subordination</b> and disloyalty among the crew. The head of the Naval Armed Guard detachment aboard West Nohno reported Couchois' activities, as well as comments from other crew members on the ship. After the ship had docked at Mobile, Couchois {{was removed from the}} ship and ultimately faced a trial for sedition. Couchois, who was the deck manager for the National Maritime Union of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of five years.|$|E
5|$|Jones himself {{came under}} threat of {{transfer}} or <b>subordination</b> in April 1943 when the Federal government began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. MacArthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held over. In the King's Birthday Honours that June, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and <b>subordination</b> that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E

5|$|Odaenathus was {{described}} as Roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription. Scholarly opinions vary on the exact date of Odaenathus' elevation to the position; Gawlikowski and Jean Starcky maintain that the senatorial rank predates the Ras elevation. Udo Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a senator in 250. Another possibility is that the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously; Odaenathus was chosen as a Ras following Gordian's death, then after Philip the Arab concluded a peace with the Persians, the emperor ratified Odaenathus' lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee Palmyra's continuous <b>subordination.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{assumption}} of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation: independence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian. The timeline {{of events and}} why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague. In {{the second half of}} 271, Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans; this may have alarmed the queen, driving her to claim the imperial title. Zenobia also probably understood the inevitability of open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning <b>subordination</b> would be useless; her {{assumption of}} the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause. Aurelian's campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Guðrøðr's {{authority}} in the Hebrides is unknown due to his apparent coexistence with Gilli, and to the uncertainty of Orcadian encroachment. Guðrøðr's successor is likewise uncertain. On one hand, {{he may have been}} succeeded by his son, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1004/1005). Although it is conceivable that either Gilli or Sigurðr capitalised on Guðrøðr's death, and extended their overlordship as far south as Mann, possible after-effects such as these are uncorroborated. Although it is possible that Gilli controlled the Hebrides whilst Guðrøðr ruled Mann, the title accorded to the latter on his death could indicate otherwise. If so, the chronology of Gilli's <b>subordination</b> to Sigurðr may actually date to the period after Rǫgnvaldr's death in 1004/1005.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBriot–Bouquet {{differential}} <b>subordinations</b> play {{a prominent}} role in the theory of differential <b>subordinations.</b> In this article we consider the dual problem of Briot–Bouquet differential superordinations.

The authors determine properties of functions p satisfying this differential superordination and also some generalized versions of it. In addition, for sets Ω 1 and Ω 2 in the complex plane the authors determine properties of functions p satisfying a Briot–Bouquet sandwich of the formΩ 1 ⊂{p(z) +zp′(z) βp(z) +γ|z∈U}⊂Ω 2.
