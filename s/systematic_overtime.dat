Following national protests, they were released in 1847. This inspired William Allan and William Newton to invite numerous other unions to merge to form one large amalgamated body. This occurred in 1851, when the Old Mechanics dissolved into the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} identified New Model Unions, founded in 1851, representing engineers across the United Kingdom. In January 1852, the union threatened strike action when engineering employers introduced <b>systematic</b> <b>overtime</b> and began to increase the numbers of unskilled workers in the trade. In response, the employers instituted a lockout, refusing to allow workers to return until they signed an agreement by which they renounced membership of any Trade Unions. After three months, the ASE was defeated and its members signed the employers' agreement, although the vast majority continued their membership of the union in secret. The ASE charged the relatively high subscription fee of one shilling per week. In 1896 it was again involved in an extended lockout, and in 1920 developed into the Amalgamated Engineering Union.|$|E
