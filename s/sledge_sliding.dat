60|$|So Natalie and I were betrothed {{within a}} month of our first meeting. Within three we were married, for {{what was there to}} prevent or delay? Naturally Sir Alfred was delighted, seeing that he possessed but small private {{resources}} and I was able to make ample provision for his daughter who had hitherto shown herself somewhat difficult in this business of matrimony and now was bordering on her twenty-seventh year. Everybody was delighted, everything went smoothly as a <b>sledge</b> <b>sliding</b> down a slope of frozen snow and the mists of time hid whatever might be {{at the end of that}} slope. Probably a plain; at the worst the upward rise of ordinary life.|$|E
40|$|It {{is evident}} that a certain {{resisting}} force is acting against a tractive force when a sledge (or any other simmiller log-transporting equipment) is pulled by that force. The total resistance is mainly due to the friction on the contacting surface between the sledge and the ground on which it lays, but somewhat complicated figures {{may be seen in}} the amount of the resistance owing to the additional resisting forces on the front surface and the side surfaces of the sledge. Though there had been already performed numerous studies theoretically as well as experimentally on the phenomena of friction and resistance, the given values of the resistance or the coefficients of friction differ to a large amount in each case; the nature of friction itself is not yet sufficiently clarified because it depends upon various complicated factors. The author performed some experiments with smallsize model-sledges aiming to analyse the problem. In the experiments coefficients of statical friction on the bottom surface and the resisting forces both on the front and the side surfaces of the model-sledges were measured. As to the measurement of friction and resisting forces, two methods, namely, 1) maximum slope of the ground surface at the moment when a <b>sledge</b> <b>slides</b> being measured directly, and 2) tractive force to move a sledge on horizontal surface being measured, and then coefficient calculated mathematically, were compared at first; better results were proved by the latter method. The results obtained by the latter method are as follows...|$|R
50|$|In 1997 Mark Lehner and Roger Hopkins, a stonemason from Sudbury, Massachusetts, {{teamed up}} to conduct a pyramid-building {{experiment}} for a NOVA television episode. They built a pyramid 6 m high by 9 m wide, consisting {{of a total of}} , or about 405 tons, it was made out of 186 stones weighing an average of 2.2 tons each. They had a total of just over 3 weeks to build it, due to their filming schedule. 12 quarrymen carved 186 stones in 22 days. They were able to erect it using 44 men. They used iron hammers, chisels and levers (this is a modern short-cut, the ancient Egyptians were limited to using copper and later bronze and wood). But they did experiments with copper tools, noting that they were adequate for the job in hand, only provided that additional manpower was available to constantly re-sharpen the ancient tools. They estimated they would have needed around 20 extra men for this maintenance. Another short-cut taken was the use of a front end loader or fork lift truck. However, modern machinery was not and could not be used to finish the construction. They used levers to lift the capstone to a height of 20 ft. Four or five men were able to use levers on stones less than 1 ton to flip them over and transport them by rolling them. For the larger stones, they had to tow them. They found that by putting the stones on wooden <b>sledges</b> and <b>sliding</b> the <b>sledges</b> on wooden tracks, they were able to tow a 2-ton stone with 12 to 20 men. The wood for these sledges and tracks would have to have been imported from Lebanon at great cost since there was little, if any, wood in ancient Egypt. While the builders failed to duplicate the precise jointing created by the ancient Egyptians, Hopkins was confident this could have been achieved with more practice.|$|R
